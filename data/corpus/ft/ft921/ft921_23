FT  19 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The rewards of failure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW THINGS better illustrate the weakness of managerial accountability in
the Anglo-Saxon economies than the haphazard way in which top executive pay
is determined. Disclosure is minimal; pay levels are usually set by other
top executives with a vested interest in high settlements; and there appears
to be little obvious relationship between risk and reward. Small wonder that
there is widespread suspicion on both sides of the Atlantic that top
executives have been feathering their own nests. Nor is it purely a matter
of envy.
There is no correlation, internationally, between high executive rewards and
corporate success. Indeed, there may be a negative correlation. Such
evidence as there is suggests that German and Japanese executives require
less bunce to deliver economic miracles. In the United States, where pay
packages constitute a more important part of society's scoring system,
managerial rewards are sky-high by international standards. Yet the country
is suffering from a long-term crisis of productivity, of which the troubles
of the motor industry in Detroit are just one symptom.
In Britain, meantime, the relationship between high incentives and
performance is also perverse. Several of the entrepreneurial high flyers of
the 1980s found themselves in the headlines first as the recipients of
spectacularly high executive pay, then as victims of the sack or of
receivership. There is something odd, too, about the way in which British
directors' pay has outstripped average earnings by a wide margin since 1979
when top marginal rates of tax plunged from 98 per cent to 40 per cent.
Simplistic view
That does not sound like any discernible approximation to a market system of
pay determination. Nor does it reflect a very subtle view of human
motivation in the firm. The more eye-catching pay packages in Britain and
the US point to a one-dimensional view of managerial capitalism in which the
top executive is a mighty superman in charge of a bloodless machine; because
he alone is perceived to hold the key to growth, he requires large rewards.
Yet there are few such supermen in the real world of industry and commerce,
where competitive advantage increasingly derives from the effective
management of wider human capital. That, in turn, calls for teamwork and a
shared sense of common goals, which are unlikely to be fostered by excessive
rewards in the boardroom. A better way of arriving at top pay is badly
needed. And that means something more than cosy remuneration committees of
non-executive directors for all quoted companies.
Greater disclosure
Britain's Cadbury committee on corporate governance would do well to ponder
the US Securities and Exchange Commission's latest initiative to require
greater disclosure, together with a shareholders' vote on management pay
proposals. More disclosure is undoubtedly needed; and a vote on remuneration
at British annual general meetings would have the effect of concentrating
management's mind, even if institutional shareholders used the additional
information chiefly to crack the whip behind the scenes.
The institutions on either side of the Atlantic should also use their
influence to steer management away from spurious performance measures in the
direction of simpler reward systems. There is no wholly satisfactory measure
of performance and in big industry today success frequently has as much or
more to do with collective achievement than with the efforts of individual
directors. Performance targets can provide an incentive to juggle with
accounting or engage in unproductive takeover activity. And share incentive
schemes should be just that: incentives, not rewards that entail no risks.
The most damning aspect of the present system in the Anglo-Saxon world is
the consistency with which managerial failure appears to be so handsomely
rewarded. It would be foolish to expect top management to find its own
remedy without constructive prompting from outside.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Straining at Prague's leash: The Slovaks' growing discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, arrives in Czechoslovakia at the
end of this month, he will sign a treaty of friendship aimed at healing
wounds that have festered since German forces divided the country during the
Second World War.
But the timing is ironic. New political forces arising from the collapse of
the Soviet bloc, together with the deep-rooted Slovak nationalism, are
threatening to split the country again into its Czech and Slovak components.
In the two years since the collapse of the communist government in Prague,
the Czech and Slovak republics have been unable to agree a political basis
for their future coexistence in one country. General elections in June are
likely to see advocates of greater autonomy win a majority in the Slovakian
parliament, further increasing pressure on the country's fragile federal
structure.
As in the republics of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the lifting
of communist rule has shown up latent divisions. The federal government in
Prague will be hoping that it can reach agreement on a new federal structure
without the upheavals suffered elsewhere in eastern Europe.
Tension has been exacerbated by growing nationalism in Slovakia, the smaller
and poorer republic, which is home to a third of the country's 15m
population. A powerful faction within the Christian Democrats, the biggest
party in the republic's coalition government, is calling for greater
autonomy, as is the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, led by
the demagogic Mr Vladimir Meciar.
Such calls are resisted by the Czech-dominated federal government. While
Czech politicians and the federal government have accepted the need for
negotiations on the country's political structure, they resist a weakening
in the existing powers of the central government.
For the federal government and for pro-federation politicians in Slovakia,
Mr Meciar poses a growing threat. Recent polls indicate that 27 per cent of
Slovak voters support him; he is expected to win the most votes in June.
While stopping short of demanding independence, he is seeking increased
powers for the Slovak parliament. He also wants the federal government to
slow the pace of its economic reform.
Slovakian nationalists such as Mr Meciar are capitalising on a revived sense
of Slovak identity. Or, as Ms Zuzana Weberova, a young factory worker in
central Slovakia, puts it: 'He makes us feel like we are born again, like we
can suddenly speak out again.'
Slovakia has always felt like a poor relation of the Czech republic.
'Besides a short spell when a pro-Nazi regime declared its independence
during the Second World War, it has never exorcised its 19th-century dream
of nationhood,' says Mr Jan Morovic, a university professor in Bratislava,
the Slovak capital.
Aspirations to nationhood are echoed by Mr Milan Knazko, an adviser to Mr
Meciar. 'We must recreate a democratic nation, incorporate it with the
Czechs, and then into the European Community.'
Such ideas are heard frequently across the political spectrum in Slovakia.
Mr Jan Carnogursky, the Slovak prime minister and leader of the Christian
Democrats, has thrown doubt on his party's commitment to the Czechoslovak
federation. He speaks of Slovakia's future star on the European Community
flag.
Emerging Slovak nationalism has been fuelled by economic difficulties. The
collapse of the Soviet market, which represented the principal source of
demand for Slovakian industrial production, has prompted a fall in output
and a loss of jobs. The republic's unemployment rate had climbed to 11.8 per
cent by the end of 1991, twice the level in the Czech republic. In some
Slovak regions, especially those which rely upon the defence industry,
unemployment has passed 20 per cent.
Prospects for recovery are gloomy. In particular, the preponderance of
inefficient Soviet plant and equipment has hampered adjustment to a more
market-based system. Slovakia has attracted a mere 4 per cent of the
estimated Dollars 800m of foreign investment which has flowed into
Czechoslovakia in the past two years.
Slovak politicians believe the federal government does not have the
republic's economic interests at heart. They have criticised the decision to
wind down and eventually phase out the country's production of arms, the
bulk of which is made in Slovakia.
Mr Meciar, who promises to maintain the republic's defence industry, also
wants state subsidies to be kept in place for ailing enterprises, as well as
softer loans for industry. The problem with the nationalists' ill-defined
economic programme is that it would run against the radical reforms, backed
by the International Monetary Fund, which were drawn up last year and are
being implemented across the country. The reforms include privatisation and
anti-inflationary measures such as a tight monetary policy and restrictions
on government expenditure.
The danger for the federal government in Prague is that it will no longer be
able to implement such policies in a more independence-minded Slovakia. As
the two republics pursue their diverging paths, pressures for a complete
break will become harder to control.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The UN and Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BARRING any last-minute hitches
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
such as a breakdown of the ceasefire in Croatia - the United Nations is
about to embark on its largest peace-keeping mission in 30 years, by
deploying more than 14,000 troops in Yugoslavia.
The risks are considerable. The UN is venturing into uncertain territory:
its goals are seen differently by Croatia and Serbia, the two main
protagonists, in a conflict that has already left at least 5,000 people
dead, and more than half a million homeless. But its task is vital
nonetheless: preserving the peace in order to give political negotiations on
Yugoslavia's future a chance.
Supported by the European Community, the UN was invited by Croatia, Serbia
and the federal army to implement the latest ceasefire. It has already set
out a detailed programme on where, how and for what duration its troops
should be deployed throughout Croatia. It has also clearly spelt out its
objectives: it will seek to persuade the army to withdraw from Croatia, and
all sides to disarm. More importantly, as stressed in its mandate, the UN
will 'not prejudge the outcome of political negotiations for a comprehensive
settlement of the Yugoslav crisis'. Finding that remains the task of the
EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia.
The UN is treading a fine line between the hopes and fears of the two
republics. Croatia has reservations about its plan. President Franjo Tudjman
fears that the presence of the UN troops will cement the gains made by
Serbia and the army which control nearly a third of Croatian territory. He
wants the UN to facilitate the federal army's rapid withdrawal from the
republic, help restore Croatian jurisdiction throughout its territory, and
then go home within a year.
Balkan conflagration
Serbia, in contrast, believes that the longer the UN stays, the more likely
it is that parts of Croatia will be eventually annexed by Serbia. The
sceptics, for their part, argue that the UN is about to become embroiled in
a Balkan conflagration from which no easy or honourable retreat will be
possible.
No one can doubt the difficulties facing the UN troops. In addition to
trying to promote trust among Serbs and Croats, they will, in the process of
disarming all sides, confront people with a long tradition of bearing arms
and using them.
Peace conference
But if the UN is to inspire confidence, it is imperative that its
peace-keeping role be coupled with the reconvening of the EC peace
conference, which has been suspended pending clarification of the UN's role.
Without parallel political negotiations led by the Community, the UN's
mission could easily come unstuck.
There are several things the Community should do to assist the peace
process. It must insist on rigorous implementation of the arms embargo which
was imposed last year but has not been strictly enough enforced. Since its
recognition by the international community last month, Croatia is rearming
so as to redress the military balance, and regain its territory. Serbia and
the federal army are also obtaining weapons. Rearmament by both sides could
strain the ceasefire and ultimately force the UN out.
The EC also needs to address the future status of other republics which are
still seeking recognition, principally Macedonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. The
latter republic with an ethnic mix of Moslems, Serbs and Croats is now a
virtual hostage of the Serb-dominated federal army. It is also in danger of
becoming the next crucible of conflict, as Serbia and Croatia turn their
attention to carving it up between them.
Recognition of Bosnia's territorial integrity by the Community is thus
critical. It would strengthen Bosnia's hand in arguing for the withdrawal of
the army into Serbia, which is now its natural home.
The impending UN peace-keeping effort is a step towards consolidating the
stand-off between Serbia and Croatia. But it should not be seen as an end in
itself: if it is not accompanied by a fresh Community effort to find a
lasting political solution, its efforts will be in vain.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Arts: Sport of a sort - but it may not sound like cricket /
Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After England's 31-13 victory over France in the Five Nations contest on
Saturday, Bernard Lapasset, president of the French Rugby Federation,
declared that 'British teams have a certain conception of the game, and
referees with certain ways of interpreting the rules. There is clearly a
large gap between our conception of the game of rugby and that of the
British . . . they are not interested in the game being spectacular or
attractive.' Millions of Britons recognise that as French grapes of the
sourest sort, and hypocrisy of the highest order, because we had seen
Gregoire Lascube stamp on Martin Bayfield's face.
Indeed, the Dunkley video archive, like many others no doubt, now contains a
record of that bit of viciousness which led to Lascube being sent off,
because we were taping the match for the only member of the household who
was not present. She was actually at Parc des Princes watching from the
stand, but naturally asked us to record the match so that she could see what
had really happened. The hysterical Lascube clearly had no idea, as he
repeatedly kicked Bayfield's head, not only that there was nothing between
him and the touch judge, Owen Doyle, who alerted the estimable referee,
Stephen Hilditch, but that there happened to be a television camera with a
vantage point very similar to Doyle's. Consequently millions of us saw what
happened, and then saw it replayed again and again in the following hours as
it was discussed by studio commentators. (What has happened, incidentally,
to the little 'R' in the corner of the screen which used to tell you that
you were watching instant replay? These days you never know whether they are
carrying on with the game or showing a replay from a different angle).
The amount of sport now being delivered to British sitting rooms via
television is unprecedented. This is particularly noticeable, of course, for
those with satellite dishes since there are three entire channels dedicated
to sport: Eurosport, running 24 hours a day; Screensport, which provides 18
hours a day during the week and 24 hours at weekends; and Sky Sports which
is on screen for about 20 hours virtually every day. True, most viewers
still have no dish, but even they can find more sport than ever before,
delivered by the four terrestrial channels. The BBC alone in the next couple
of months will be showing, in addition to its routine sports programmes, the
rest of the Five Nations championship, the fifth and sixth rounds of the FA
Cup, the European Indoor Athletics Championship, the World Figure Skating
Championships, the Grand National, the Boat Race, the start of a new season
of grand prix motor racing, the US Masters, the women's hockey Cup Final,
and the London marathon.
As with every other aspect of life touched by television (music, politics,
drama) sport is not merely conveyed to us via the medium, it is changed by
it. Some of the changes are simply in the way that we perceive the events
and are unexceptionable. The Lascube stamp was a microcosmic example; not
only does television take us closer to the activity than was previously
possible, it provides a multiplicity of viewpoints for all of us on our old
green sofas. The opening races to decide who will challenge for the
America's Cup are being covered for Sky Sports by cameramen who have been
taking their motor boats breathtakingly close to the competing yachts,
providing the viewer with an account of the racing that has literally never
been available before, except to the competitors themselves. Those standing
beside the bobsleigh run at the Winter Olympics can see each bob only for a
moment as it flashes past whereas we at home follow it all the way down.
True, we have to put up with the inanities of some of the commentators.
Helen Rollason, who seems to have been doing Desmond Lynam's share of the
BBC anchor work in the Winter Olympics as well as her own, keeps saying she
will be 'seeing' us later which is, of course, nonsense. David Vine
described one competitor in Val d'Isere as 'A big tall racer', his emphasis
implying that most of the competitors were big short men. But that is not
such a terrible price to have to pay. Other changes, however, are not
welcome. Having originally brought us such startlingly beautiful pictures of
the English countryside from race meetings such as Saturday's at Chepstow,
which would otherwise have looked like a sequence of animated oil paintings
by Stubbs, television has ruined the effect by renting space to advertisers
who install huge, garish hoardings beside the course.
A similar phenomenon now occurs in athletics and skiing. Kit manufacturers
pay top competitors huge sums to wear their goods but cameras do not
normally dwell on the feet, so the moment the winner crosses the line he
tears off his shoes or skis and holds them up beside his face so that any
picture of his winning smile is, willy nilly, also an international
advertisement. It is no exaggeration to say that in the last few days we
have spent longer looking at the striking (and doubtless copyright) design
on the skis of 16-year-old Toni Nieminen, the flying Finn, than we have
looking at him ski-jumping. Even one of those rare sports which,
technically, maintains its amateur status is treated by the BBC in the same
way that they treat Radio 1: it is made to seem commercial by the
promotional packaging. Thus Saturday's rugby match was preceded by, among
other things, an assembly of Guscott/Carling clips which 'sold' the two
players to a disco beat.
But the most annoying thing is the slow but inexorable manner in which the
packaging of sport for television eventually starts to overtake the sport
itself. The classic example is American football, a game which, even though
it is played before huge crowds, is organised entirely to suit American
television with its frequent commercial breaks. The tedium of the game
results almost entirely from this arrangement. Screensport is currently
running a trailer which urges 'Get your skates on every Monday and get up to
date on the National Hockey League' meaning, of course, the North American
ice hockey league. This is accompanied by pictures of a fight between two
players and a third sliding up the ice and crashing into the goal post - no
skill, but much mayhem.
So what's new, ask the American and Australian broadcasters who are bringing
us growing quantities of this sort of thing, sport has always meant
spectacle. Now they are driving cricket down the same road. Time was when
cricket was one of the few truly beautiful experiences to be had from
television: to lie back in a cool room during a hot summer, in front of a
screen consisting of two-thirds blue and white and one third green, and to
spend the day following a Test match, used to be a civilised and civilising
experience. Indeed it still is. But this coming Friday the Cricket World Cup
begins on Sky Sports and we are warned that matches will be played under
artificial light, the players will wear pastel coloured 'pyjamas', the sight
screens will be black and the ball white, there will be a miniature camera
built into the stumps, and microphones buried at the crease. The return to
the pavilion of anyone who is out without scoring will be accompanied on the
screen by Cholmondeley, the weeping cartoon duck.
That may be sport of a sort - television sport - and perhaps I shall find
myself hooked on it, but it does not sound much like cricket. Those who
scoff and declare that it is time for television to lead cricket out of the
dark ages might pause for a moment and think about the way television led
darts out of the dark ages. Cricket was not and is not in any sort of dark
age, and television's spin doctors will not improve the game, they will
merely improve television's ratings which is, anyway, their sole object.
And you do realise, don't you, that you ain't seen nothin' yet: on July 25,
in the middle of the fourth Test, the 1992 Olympics open in Barcelona . . .

Tomorrow's World provides a timely 'Sport Special' which considers the part
played by science in achieving success, whether by improving the ability of
athletes, their training, psychology, equipment, or what they ingest,
including drugs. The programme highlights the British bobsleigh team which
prepared for the winter Olympics by taking its sledge design and philosophy
from the east Germans (7.30 BBC1).
Bookmark (8.10 BBC2) offers a drama documentary called 'Miss Pym's Day Out'
which re-creates November 23 1977 in the life of novelist Barbara Pym. On
that day she went to the Jubilee bazaar in Finstock and then travelled to
London for the Booker Prize ceremony, her novel 'Quartet In Autumn' having
been shortlisted. Channel 4 begins a series of six 'weekly glimpses' of how
the 6m inhabitants of St Petersburg are surviving their first winter since
the collapse of the USSR. Kevin Sim (who made the excellent documentary
'Four Hours In My Lai') is living in the city, making the programmes there,
and sending them back for sub-titling (9.45). Dispatches is yet another
attempt to whip up interest in satanism (10.30 C4).

FT  19 FEB 92 / Management: Retailing - Finding partners for life / John
Thornhill reports on how the John Lewis chain looks after staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Lewis Partnership, which runs 22 department stores and the Waitrose
supermarket chain, can claim with more justice than most companies that it
looks after its employees. But then it does have a clear incentive to do so:
its 32,000 employees own the company.
Ever since 1929 when John Spedan Lewis put the family company's assets into
a trust for the benefit of past, current and future employees, the
partnership has adopted a different approach to running its business than
its competitors.
Management is given great executive freedom but held strictly accountable by
the employees (or partners as they are called); profits are shared equally
among members; and great emphasis is placed on retention of staff, training
and personal development.
As the inspirational Spedan Lewis put it: 'The supreme purpose of the John
Lewis Partnership is simply the happiness of its members'.
At this point, cynics might reach for their profit and loss accounts,
assuming that such high-sounding principles would come unstuck in the
competitive world of British retailing. After all, JLP is competing
head-to-head against some formidably efficient public companies, such as
Marks and Spencer and J. Sainsbury.
But in a new book on the partnership*, two business academics argue that
JLP's unique organisational structure and its awareness of the role of
people has given it advantages in the market-place. Being nice to people can
be profitable.
The authors examine JLP's performance against a range of financial and
economic data and conclude that it is directly comparable with that of the
market leaders in both the food and the non-food sectors. They suggest that
JLP 'ranks high or top in profitability and productivity, and shows no
significant evidence of under-investment, over-borrowing or
under-liquidity'. They say JLP's experience casts doubt on the pessimistic
theory that performance suffers when there is no capital market discipline
and when employees are involved in decision-making.
In a rare interview, Peter Lewis the company's present chairman and nephew
of Spedan Lewis, naturally welcomed the book's conclusion but was coy about
the suggestion that the partnership had much to teach other businesses.
In a lofty office overlooking the red-brick splendour of Westminster
Cathedral, the imposingly tall but meticulously polite Lewis says: 'We are
not a proselytizing company. We do not go out and tell people how to run a
partnership. We simply show by what we do that it can work'.
He accepts that the Partnership's structure gives the management full scope
to decide strategy but rejects the book's suggestion that at times this
smacks of 'dynastic autocracy'. The point is, he suggests, that the obverse
of executive independence is accountability, the nub of the whole
organisation.
'It makes people think ahead. It makes people consider the consequences of
their actions' he says.
In this sense, as the book observes, the constraints of employee ownership
act as a substitute mechanism to capital markets. 'It is our people, not our
shareholders, to whom we are answerable,' Lewis says.
Employee participation works in a variety of ways within JLP. Under its
constitution, partners elect representatives to branch councils (which
scrutinise management decision at store level) and to the 140-member central
council (which acts as the forum and focus of public opinion within the
Partnership). The central council also elects three Trustees of the
constitution who have the ultimate power to replace the chairman.
Managers are employed to manage the business rigorously but the company
accepts that 'those partners who may neither aspire to be a manager, nor
possess the abilities to be one, are recognised as individuals with a valid
contribution to make to the success of the business'.
But accountability also works in less formal ways through the weekly staff
Gazette, which carries extensive staff correspondence and detailed
information about the partnership's trading performance. Any partner can
write to the magazine with a complaint or a question which must be answered
by the director of the relevant department.
This mechanism is often more likely to lead to changes which affect the
daily working conditions of most of the partners. So, for example, a
letter-writing campaign in the staff Gazette led to the abolition of
confidential staff assessments - they now have to be shown to the relevant
partner.
Complaints can range from the serious to the bizarre. Last week, for
example, 'Sick of Eating Humble Hair' wrote to complain about hairs found in
the canteen food.
Even a casual perusal of the Gazette reveals that the Partnership is not the
idyll of industrial harmony that it might seem. The letters pages are
frequently crammed with grumbles about ill-considered decisions or
incompetence - much as you would expect in any organisation.
But few companies are so open about exposing their faults and trading
prospects or so publicly committed to trying to rectifying their problems.
The company accepts that some employees find its culture too oppressive or
sanctimonious and leave but it points out that its rate of staff turnover is
significantly less than that in comparable retail businesses.
JLP employs a far higher proportion of full-time staff than competitors and
offers more attractive levels of pay because of its partnership bonus
scheme. Last year JLP made post-tax profits of Pounds 78.7m, of which Pounds
42.1m was ploughed back into developing the business and most of the rest
was distributed among the partners. In the 1979-89 period, the bonus
averaged 20 per cent of annual pay.
gest that employee-owned companies inevitably face tension balancing
short-term rewards with long-term investment. The natural desire is to
maintain the bonus in a downturn, thereby undermining the company's
competitiveness. Such issues loom large when partners face a cut in their
take-home pay.
However, Lewis suggests that such tensions can be defused by adopting a
consistent approach to bonus payments. Ultimately, he suggests, the
partnership boils down to a commitment to social justice. 'It was certainly
a driving force in Spedan's ideas. What struck him was the waste of talent
and energy in a lot of people who, if only given a chance would contribute
to a common enterprise'.
Times have changed since the 1930s, but Lewis believes those principles are
still relevant today.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory school choices highlighted -
Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday attempted to push education up the pre-election agenda by
asking why Tory ministers continued to prefer private schools for their
children in spite of their claims to 'have improved state education out of
all recognition'.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said the entire Labour frontbench
used the state system while only one Cabinet minister - Mr Tony Newton,
social security secretary - sent his children to state secondary schools.
His charges were promptly derided as 'nasty, personalised attacks' by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, who claimed they showed that Labour did
not have an education policy.
'The point of our reforms is to raise standards in state schools so that no
parents should feel obliged to send their children to private schools unless
they wish to,' Mr Clarke said.
Mr Straw insisted that the fact that ministers still opted for private
schools was eloquent testimony to their lack of confidence in state
education, in spite of 13 years of Tory government.
This point, he added, was first made in a 1990 pamphlet by Mr George Walden,
Tory MP for Buckingham and a former education minister. Asking why ministers
avoided the state sector, Mr Walden concluded: 'The only answer now is the
truth, and the truth is scarcely sayable by any government minister.'
Mr Straw said that the election would give voters the choice between a
Labour Cabinet who used state schools and 'a Conservative party who have no
personal interest in state education'.
He went on to produce new Labour research showing that nearly all cabinet
ministers in Germany and France used publicly funded schools.
Asked whether he was dragging personal issues into the election, Mr Straw
insisted he had taken care not to identify individual Cabinet ministers'
children or their schools.
'What I was articulating was a profound question about this government's
commitment to state education first raised by a Tory MP,' he said.

MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, environment secretary, took the election campaign to
Labour's heartlands yesterday when he pledged Pounds 750m for urban renewal
to 20 inner-city areas under the second phase of the government's City
Challenge scheme.
All of England's 57 urban priority areas (UPAs) - including the 11 which
were successful in last year's pilot competition - are free to bid for the
funds. Each winner will receive Pounds 37.5m spread over five years from
1993-94.
The 57 areas - with average unemployment rates of more than 12.5 per cent -
are concentrated in London, the north, the north-west and the Yorkshire and
Humberside region. Bids for funds must include a scheme from councils for
improving a run-down area in partnership with local businesses, voluntary
groups and community organisations.
The Pounds 750m is not new money. As with the Pounds 412m allocated in the
first phase, it will be taken from the government's existing urban
programmes. Funding for the two phases combined will consume about a fifth
of the budget allocation for the four main urban programmes - with serious
implications for councils unsuccessful in the bidding.
Mr Heseltine said: 'City Challenge is about vision, quality, partnership and
expecting local authorities to lead their communities.' To be successful,
bids would need to exhibit 'flair and imagination', and the capacity to
attract private-sector investment, he added.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said the government
was 'playing games' with inner cities. 'Those authorities who lose will have
wasted time and very scarce resources,' he said.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Newcastle upon Tyne City Council and chairman
of the Labour-led Association of Metropolitan Authorities, condemned the
principle of bidding, but was 'pleased that all UPAs will be able to
compete'.
In addition to yesterday's launch in London, ministers are planning
'regional seminars' to publicise City Challenge. Councils must declare their
intention to bid for second-phase funding by the end of the month. They must
then submit a full proposal by April 22.
If the government is re-elected, it intends to pick the winners by the end
of July. If Labour takes office, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment
secretary, has pledged that it will meet funding commitments already agreed,
but will then integrate City Challenge into a single urban programme to be
distributed on the basis of need.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Warning of 'chaos' over council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL TAX could produce as much administrative chaos as poll tax unless it
is changed significantly, the National Association of Citizens' Advice
Bureaux (Nacab) warned yesterday.
Nacab says in a report comparing plans for council tax with its experience
of poll tax that clear information about the operation of the new tax should
be made available well before its introduction. Nacab also wants an option
for taxpayers to pay weekly, and says they should be allowed to pay any
council-tax debts by 'realistic instalments' before bailiffs are called in.
Nacab adds that much tighter regulation of bailiffs is needed.
The 456 Citizens' Advice Bureaux are still dealing with 14,000 queries a
month about poll tax, also called the community charge, and Nacab recommends
100 per cent poll-tax rebates for those on low incomes compared with the
present 80 per cent ceiling.
Ms Ann Abraham, Nacab chief executive, said: 'From registration right
through to arrears and enforcement, bureaux all over the country have seen
thousands of people in difficulties over paying their community charge. The
government is in danger of making the same mistakes with the council tax.'
Charging Into The Tax. Nacab, 115 Pentonville Road, London N1 9LZ. Pounds 5.

FT  19 FEB 92 / BR may relaunch promotion for east coast line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is considering a marketing relaunch of its showpiece east coast
main line to Scotland in an effort to tempt back customers irritated by the
problems which have dogged the route since its Pounds 500m electrification
was completed last summer.
Vandalism and technical difficulties have affected the performance of the
line - which links London with York, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh -
since it became fully electrified in July. This has frustrated BR's hopes
that faster journey times would allow it to compete more effectively for the
business and leisure markets.
The line's high-speed trains were the centrepiece of InterCity's promotion
last autumn.
The marketing drive was backed by a promotion, billed as the world's biggest
travel offer, in which InterCity offered free travel worth about Pounds 50m
in exchange for vouchers given to shoppers at Boots stores. Allied to this
was extensive publicity in northern England and Scotland.
But yesterday Mr Philip Benham, BR's customer service and retail manager for
the InterCity east coast line, said BR was considering a campaign to
persuade potential customers that the line's difficulties had been
surmounted.
'We're thinking quite seriously at the moment about how to relaunch our
marketing effort and how best to target it,' said Mr Benham. 'We have quite
a task on our hands to regain confidence.'
BR is today running one of its Q-trains, a special anti-vandal train manned
by British Transport Police, in Teesside. A similar Q-train, the first on
the east coast line since electrification, travelled around Tyneside last
week. The purpose of the train is partly to catch vandals and partly to
impress on the public that BR is tackling the problem.
Mr Benham said the line's difficulties had been caused partly by 'teething
problems' as staff became used to new technology. There had also been
serious vandalism including repeated damage to the fibre-optic cable which
controls signalling and points and carries BR's internal telecommunication
links.

FT  19 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Social workers lose jobs after long
strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 100 employees of Camden council in north London yesterday lost
their jobs as social workers following a long-running strike.
The striking social workers, all members of the Nalgo public-sector union,
will be considered for other jobs within the council over the next four
weeks. But Camden said they were unlikely to secure jobs within the
authority because of cost-cutting and would probably be made redundant.
Nalgo yesterday accused Camden of trying to escalate the dispute and said it
planned to ask other council staff to strike in support of the social
workers.
The union plans to extend an existing ban on Nalgo members applying for
social work posts in Camden to all social services posts.
The strike, which has lasted nearly 10 months, started after the council
refused to pay a nationally negotiated increase in 1989. Camden had
previously negotiated a local increase to boost recruitment. Staff then went
on strike in April last year .
Mr Phil Turner, who heads the staff and management services committee, said
the national agreement did not apply because the local agreement 'offered
better terms'.
He said the council had offered conciliation and arbitration, which was
rejected by Nalgo and the social workers.
The council said it has been forced to restructure the social work
department because of recent legislation. Before Christmas last year, social
workers were offered new posts and a pay rise. The deadline for acceptance
was yesterday.

FT  19 FEB 92 / FT Cable and Satellite Conference: BBC intends global
24-hour television news by next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is planning to have a round-the-clock worldwide television news
service operating by next year.
Mr Michael Checkland, BBC director-general, said yesterday that the
corporation was in advanced negotiations to take the 24-hour World Service
Television, launched in Asia last year, to Africa, Australia and Japan.
'We aim to be worldwide by next year, and we will examine closely the ways
in which this service can be linked into a UK service,' Mr Checkland told
the Financial Times Cable and Satellite Conference in London.
He envisaged the 24-hours-a-day television news channel being broadcast by
satellite in the UK, funded by subscription and competing with Sky News, the
satellite channel.
The move is part of a BBC initiative to develop sources of funding in
addition to the licence fee. The corporation believes subscription income
will reach as much as Pounds 2bn in the UK by the end of the decade.
'The BBC must be inventive in sharing in that growth to support its future
broadcasting role,' said Mr Checkland. He emphasised, however, that he was
opposed to either BBC1 or BBC2 becoming subscription channels.
BBC projections suggested that average household expenditure on
television-related activities in the UK would rise from Pounds 279 a year
now to more than Pounds 400 in 1997. Television's proportion of leisure
spending would rise from 8 per cent to 11 per cent.
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames Television, in his first public
statement since Thames lost its ITV franchise, expressed some bitterness
yesterday about the process.
'A fine company is being put through the shredder after one fax and little
thanks,' Mr Dunn said. As a result 1,200 people were losing their
livelihoods and experienced programme-making teams were being broken up for
ever.
As an independent producer Thames would concentrate on entertainment, drama,
children's and factual programmes.
Mr Leslie Hill, chief executive of Central Independent Television, renewed
his campaign for the rationalisation of ITV and a move towards fewer
companies.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Deprivation blamed for rise in crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Metropolitan Police yesterday identified 'social and economic malaise'
as a factor in record crime rates in London.
Commander David Stevens, presenting the capital's crime trends for last
year, said the figures had to be viewed against the background of the
recession. A 26 per cent increase in street crime last year had occurred
largely in areas of social deprivation.
The pre-election atmosphere, said Commander Stevens, was an opportune one
for the community to influence policing. Crime-prevention initiatives must
be introduced by all responsible members of society, he said.
Recorded crime in London rose by 11 per cent to a record 926,200 offences
last year, and national figures are expected to show a similar trend.
The link between social deprivation and crime is not one that appeals to
ministers, who denied that deprivation caused recent Tyneside riots.
Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said the figures highlighted the
government's failure to tackle the causes of crime rather than its symptoms.
Mr Robert MacLennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said that it
was not enough for the government simply to pay lip service to crime
prevention, which must form the core of a strategy for tackling crime.

MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the new prime minister of the Irish Republic, is to meet
Mr John Major, the UK premier, in London next week for talks about Northern
Ireland.
Mr Reynolds yesterday told his parliament that the planned meeting had been
brought forward because of the 'changed situation' in Ulster. It is
scheduled for next Wednesday.
The Irish prime minister said that after a meeting between Mr Charles
Haughey, Mr Reynolds' predecessor, and Mr Major in Dublin last December, it
was agreed to hold prime ministerial meetings every six months. But
following recent telephone calls with Mr Major about the continuing spiral
of violence in Ulster, that schedule was revised.
Mr Reynolds said that his government was ready to do 'everything possible'
to help parties in Ulster resume dialogue abandoned last summer.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Air 2000 to lease four Airbus A320s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND UK charter airline has decided to operate Airbus A320 narrow-body
airliners, whose sophisticated computerised control systems have recently
been under criticism.
This followed the crash of a French Air Inter A320 last month near
Strasbourg, killing 87 people.
Air 2000, the charter airline of the Owners Abroad tour group, said
yesterday it would lease four new A320s from ORIX Aviation Systems of
Dublin. The aircraft will be powered by V2500 engines built by the IAE
consortium which includes Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, MTU of
Germany and a group of Japanese aero-engine companies.
The first two aircraft will be delivered to Air 2000 for use this summer and
the other two will enter service next year.
Last month Excalibur, a new UK charter airline, announced orders for three
A320s.
Air 2000 now operates a fleet of Boeing 757 twin-engine aircraft. It said
the A320s would meet a need for a smaller airliner to operate from
provincial airports and on less dense routes.
Meanwhile London City Airport received a boost yesterday with the
announcement that CityAir Scandinavia, a new Swedish airline, plans to
introduce daily services using British Aerospace 146 jets between Stockholm
and London.
This follows the extension of the Docklands airport runway to enable BAe 146
jets to operate there. Crossair, the regional carrier which is 51 per cent
owned by Swissair, has already announced daily services between Zurich and
London City using BAe 146s.
CityAir Scandinavia is absorbing Malmo Aviation, a carrier that operates
passenger services on the Malmo-London Gatwick and Malmo-Hanburg routes as
well as cargo services for TNT, the Australian transport group.
The airline said it intended to start a twice-daily service between
Stockholm and London City 'as soon as is practical after the official
opening of the airport's extended runway on March 30'.
Ryanair, the independent Irish carrier, is expanding its flights from London
Stansted to Ireland with a daily service to Shannon from April 10. The route
is already operated by Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Red tape cuts to be accelerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATIONS on betting shops, employment agencies, licensed taxis and some
professional partnerships could be revised or abandoned under the
government's initiative to cut the red tape surrounding British businesses.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, yesterday reported on progress
to reduce the 'irksome burdens' on business and set out plans to step up
deregulation over the next year.
He said the Home Office was considering if betting shops should be allowed
to open late to reflect the increase in evening race meetings. Licensing
controls on taxis and other passenger-hire vehicles were being reviewed by
the Department of Transport to establish if they were unnecessarily
restrictive.
Mr Redwood said the Department of Trade and Industry also intended to ease
restrictions on the size of large partnerships offering a mix of
professional disciplines.
On a broader front, Mr Redwood said businesses had been relieved of 163
forms and guidance documents in the past 12 months. As part of the
initiative, government departments had also identified 20 of more than 400
types of business licences which they intended to scrap during the coming
year. Mr Redwood said the thrust to eliminate outdated and often costly
regulatory measures was being targeted partially at Brussels, which produced
many regulations and directives affecting business. He said the British
government intended to oversee 'a deregulatory presidency', particularly in
respect of the single market, when it assumed the EC presidency in the
summer.
The minister stressed that government departments were also examining ways
of reducing the statistical burden on industry and commerce. Local
authorities were being encouraged to examine the necessity of regulations
and to ensure enforcement was consistent.
Mr Redwood said the government was particularly concerned to ease the burden
for small businesses. Increasing numbers of companies could now make much
simplified tax returns, and a review was under way to see if audit and
accounting requirements for very small businesses could also be reduced.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, yesterday announced a scheme
to bring senior academics into industry for up to six months to work on
technology projects.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Record Treasury receipts offset debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD government receipts last month enabled Britain to repay Pounds 3.7bn
of debt, against the trend of a steady deterioration in government finances
largely because of the recession.
The Treasury said yesterday that in the first 10 months of the 12 months to
April this year Britain borrowed Pounds 6.6bn to finance public spending,
compared with a repayment of Pounds 3bn in the equivalent period last year.
The borrowing figure for the this fiscal year would have been higher but for
receipts last month of Pounds 23.3bn - up from Pounds 15.3bn in December and
Pounds 22.7bn in January last year.
Over the past year, government tax receipts have been kept down by weak
economic activity, while higher spending on unemployment pay and other
social benefits has pushed up spending.
At the same time, the government has become more relaxed about increasing
public spending. It is considering tax cuts in next month's Budget which
could further weaken the fiscal position.
In the first 10 months of 1991-92, government receipts were Pounds 170.1bn,
an increase of 3 per cent on the Pounds 165.5bn in the same period last
year. Government cash outlays for the 10 months reached Pounds 176.2bn, up
9.5 per cent on last time's Pounds 160.7bn.
Last month's receipts were helped by large payments by companies of
corporation tax on previously reported profits, which are normal for this
time of year. Corporation tax revenues for the month came to Pounds 5.6bn,
down slightly on the Pounds 6bn in January last year. Income tax and Customs
and Excise receipts pulled in Pounds 7.6bn and Pounds 4.5bn respectively,
compared with Pounds 7.7bn and Pounds 3.7bn last time.
Even with the record receipts, last month's net debt repayment - which was
in line with City expectations - was smaller than the comparable figure of
Pounds 5.1bn in January 1991.
That was because government cash outlays last month totalled Pounds 19.5bn,
well above the Pounds 17.4bn last time.
For the whole of 1991-92, a public-sector borrowing requirement of about
Pounds 12bn is expected, after the small net repayment in this fiscal year
of Pounds 465m. Next year, many economists expect the PSBR to be about
Pounds 24bn.
Excluding privatisation proceeds, the PSBR in the first 10 months of 1991-92
was Pounds 13.7bn, against Pounds 0.6bn last time.

TRADE negotiators are this week pushing in secret sessions in Dallas to
complete large sections of the draft of the North America Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta), Nancy Dunne writes from Washington.
The talks, scheduled for February 17-21, are seen as critical if a completed
pact is to be introduced to the US Congress this year. It is thought the
pact must reach Congress in some form by the end of next month if it is to
pass this year. The legislation, to be introduced this week by Congressman
Jim Jontz (Democrat, Indiana), would remove the deadlines set out in the
Nafta 'fast-track' approval process.
Instead of the five-month procedure approved by Congress last year, members
would have an unlimited amount of time to consider a Nafta. The Jontz bill
will allow amendments to the Nafta pact in five areas: labour and
environment standards, worker adjustment assistance, rules of origin and
dispute resolution.
Broad support is expected because of the way the economy has recently
deteriorated.

Karen Fossli reports.
The contract includes an option for possible additional work which, if
exercised, could take its value up to NKr840m, Wilrig said.
Loke and Sleipner East are scheduled to come on stream October 1, 1993, with
Statfjord North due to start in April 1994, and Statfjord East the following
October.

The Western Harbour Crossing is one of the core projects of an
infrastructure development which, by 1997, will see the opening of a new
airport, a suspension bridge and associated roads. Many of the new
developments will be built on reclaimed land.
The tender will be let on a 'build, operate and transfer' arrangement. The
successful bidder will be awarded a franchise to operate the tunnel for 30
years and to charge tolls, after which ownership will be transferred to Hong
Kong's government.
Work on the tunnel is expected to begin by June 1993 and be ready for
traffic by the 'middle' of 1997. Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty on
July 1, 1997.

revolutionary venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENIN'S home town is the site of a bold attempt to marry the pride of former
Soviet communist industry with western capital.
Although the town of Ulyanovsk itself is stubbornly clinging to the name it
received in honour of the revolutionary who started life as Vladimir
Ulyanov, its huge aviation plant has turned itself into a joint-stock
company, able to sell shares to outside investors.
In its pursuit of foreign capital, the maker of the Antonov-124, the largest
transport aircraft in the world, has even given itself a western-sounding
name, Aviastar.
And it plans soon to sign a deal with Robert Fleming, the UK investment
management company, to produce a medium-range passenger aircraft, the
Tupolev 204, upgraded with Rolls-Royce engines and western avionics.
'We do not know the intricacies of market economics,' admits Mr Viktor
Mikhailov, the plant's general manager, whose taciturn appearance conceals a
tough entrepreneur. But he is confident that 'with western capital, as well
as your know-how in sales and marketing, we can produce a plane that is not
only far cheaper but which can compete in all other respects with any
western equivalent'.
He doubts he will be allowed into European and US markets, but he sees
potential in Asia and the Far East, and even Russia. For the domestic
market, he is already producing a no-frills Russian-only version.
Rolls-Royce, which would supply engines to the TU-204 similar to those which
fit most Boeing-757s, has been involved in the negotiations though it will
not be taking a stake in the venture. It would be paid out of foreign
exchange earnings from sales of the aircraft outside the former Soviet bloc.
Built on the banks of the Volga River, the aircraft plant is a typical
product of a Brezhnevite passion for sprawling industrial complexes equipped
at great expense with imported technology and endowed with their own
housing, social care, farms and shops.
But under the combined effect of market reforms and government bankruptcy,
the plant is increasingly having to fend for itself. The state has cut off
all funds and investment, leaving unfinished key parts of the plant such as
the paint shop. Military orders which used to account for most of the
plant's business have shrunk to almost nil, and the government still owes
money for past deliveries of aircraft.
Moscow has also landed the plant's management with responsibility for the
livelihood of 160,000 people - workers and their dependants who live and
work on this 6,500-hectare site, including the street cleaners, doctors and
teachers who work in the township built specially for the factory. This
means that two-thirds of Mr Mikhailov's revenues are gobbled up by social
spending.
Apart from this, Mr Mikhailov's biggest worry is the high prices charged by
monopoly producers and the difficulties of maintaining traditional contracts
with suppliers.
'You can't have democracy without discipline,' he says, echoing the deep
dissatisfaction of many Soviet managers with the economic effects of the
Soviet system's collapse. Although his production has not been affected for
the first quarter of this year, he warns that a failure by republics to keep
up previous deliveries to each other's plants will spell disaster.
Mr George Horton, the tireless American who heads Fleming's Russian
investment fund, says it is too early to tell how much foreign capital would
be required for the Tu-204 project because it is not yet clear how many
aircraft will be produced. Although a prototype could be ready for the
Farnborough air show in September, it will take at least three years to get
the aircraft certified in the west.
Mr Mikhailov says it would cost Dollars 1bn to modernise the plant to his
satisfaction - for instance to expand production of the Antonov-124, and
turn it into an 800-seat passenger aircraft. His figure would presumably
include building flats for all his workers.
But he knows he will have to content himself with far less.
Like Fiat in its talks with the Russian carmaker Avtovaz, Robert Fleming
wants to insulate its investment by creating a separate company for the
joint project, rather than to buy directly into Aviastar. This is because
Aviastar itself, like other big companies such as Kamaz, the truck maker,
carries a heavy burden of non-productive assets, such as schools and
housing, which as Kamaz found through bitter experience when offering shares
last year, are of no attraction to western investors.
Given the political instability and the difficulties of investing in Russia,
such a marriage does not promise to be easy to start with. But both the
western and Russian partners say they are looking for a long-term
relationship.
'At the end of the day you have faith that the Russian government will not
do something to hurt foreign investors, because they need foreign capital,'
says Mr Horton. 'If you don't believe that, you shouldn't be here.'

CHINA will need foreign capital and manufacturing expertise to go ahead with
the Three Gorges project to control flooding in the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River through construction of a huge dam, Simon Holberton reports
from Hong Kong.
Zhao Chuanshao, a ministry of water resources official, said China was
'interested in securing foreign loans' to finance the multi-million-dollar
project and leading foreign manufacturers to help make parts for the
project, the English-language China Daily reported yesterday.
China would be willing to import technologies and materials to build the
680,000KW turbo-generators and the 500,000-volt transmission lines to carry
electricity generated.
The dam would dwarf any in the US and exceed the capacity of Brazil's dam at
Itaipu, the world's biggest.
A water level of 150 metres would produce a reservoir stretching 250 miles.

FT  19 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Gatt members set to oppose US on tuna
import curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GATT members yesterday lined up to back endorsement of the controversial
disputes panel ruling against US curbs on tuna imports.
The ruling was raised at the regular meeting of Gatt's governing council not
by the complainant, Mexico, but by the EC. The EC has been directly affected
by last month's US court ruling extending the ban on tuna imports from
Mexico and Venezuela to re-exports of these imports by, among others,
France, Italy and Spain. Some 20 countries are thought to be affected.
Rich and poor countries urged adoption of the panel report, completed last
August. Under US pressure, Mexico had agreed not to take the case further.
It has become a cause celebre for environmental groups, mainly in the US,
which claim Gatt rules prevent action to curb pollution or protect
endangered species.
The US banned imports of Mexican tuna, saying Mexican fishing fleets kill
too many dolphins in their tuna nets. The panel said the US ban contravened
Gatt rules, because discriminatory trade measures could not be used to
impose environmental laws outside a country's own jurisdiction.
Those urging adoption of the report said Gatt rules did not stop governments
taking domestic measures to protect the environment nor concluding
multilateral environmental pacts. But the panel argued that countries could
not restrict imports of a product merely because it originated in a country
with environmental policies different from its own.
Mr Andras Szepesi, Gatt panel chairman, argued that if countries wished Gatt
to allow trade sanctions in response to different environmental regulations,
they should do so by amending Gatt rules or waiving Gatt obligations rather
than distort the interpretation of existing rules permitting limited
exceptions. This, he said, would enable Gatt members to limit the range of
policy differences justifying trade sanctions and to devise safeguards to
prevent abuse.
Mexico said it would support multilateral measures to reduce incidental
dolphin kills in fishing nets. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said
the administration was seeking a solution to accommodate the interests of
all those involved. But it could not overturn decisions of the US courts and
at this point, the only way to change matters might be through legislation.
The council will return to the issue in March.
Other issues discussed by the Gatt council included:
* The council agreed Romania's request for a working party to renegotiate
its 1971 membership terms;
* The US was granted a waiver from Gatt's non-discrimination
(most-favoured-nation) rule to extend preferential trading arrangements to
Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru;
* Canada agreed to the adoption of a disputes panel report upholding a US
complaint on discrimination against beer imports by Canada's provincial
liquor boards.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Twin banknotes embarrass mint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is investigating claims that its National Mint has been forging
banknotes, writes John Barham.
Last July, two authentic banknotes appeared with identical serial numbers
and worth Dollars 50 each. Alarm grew when a pair of smaller denomination
notes surfaced. It soon emerged that the duplicates were coming from the
mint, although how they leaked into the economy was unclear.
The central bank has no idea how many duplicates are in circulation but
strenuously denies massive printing of fakes. Argentina has about 1.1bn
banknotes in circulation, worth Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 3.4bn), so the
probability of detecting duplicates is tiny.
Officials claim the affair has been blown out of proportion by a press
baying for scandals. But the government ombudsman said yesterday he had
reopened an inquiry begun in July. A letter written in August to the mint by
Mr Roque Fernandez, central bank president, and leaked at the weekend
indicated high-level concern.
Mr Fernandez rejected the explanation by Mr Armando Gostanian, head of the
mint, that the twin banknotes were produced by faulty printing equipment.
The central bank now believes the extra notes were replacements for notes
with small printing errors that should have been destroyed.

<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL MILKEN, the former junk bond king, will pay an additional Dollars
500m (Pounds 276.2m) into a fund to compensate the victims of his securities
frauds under a proposed outline settlement of civil lawsuits stemming from
the collapse of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank.
Mr Milken - who built up and headed the high yield bond department at Drexel
 -has already put Dollars 400m into the fund.
Other officials of Drexel, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February
1990, would contribute Dollars 300m in aggregate under the proposed deal.
Drexel's insurers would reportedly add another Dollars 100m.
Mr Milken faces suits from small investors as well as the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation acting on behalf of savings and loan organisations
which were big Drexel clients. There has been much recent speculation that
he would try to settle the civil actions.
The FDIC, which oversees the banking and thrift industries in the US,
yesterday declined to say whether it was satisfied with the proposed
settlement package.
Yesterday, Mr Milken's spokesmen - along with the FDIC - pointed to a 'gag'
order insisted on by Judge Milton Pollack, overseeing the Drexel bankruptcy,
and declined to comment.
There has been considerable pressure from Judge Pollack to reach settlements
in the wave of litigation which followed Drexel's collapse, and thus to
avoid courtroom battles which could drag on for years. His urgings had
already prompted a settlement in the Drexel bankruptcy proceedings, with
securities litigants and traditional creditors agreeing to split the spoils.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Lines in the Gulf's shifting sands: UN grapples with border
demarcation between Iraq and Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORDER demarcation in the Middle East, and particularly in the often
featureless desert topography of the Gulf states, is a notoriously rough and
ready business. Pity, then, the United Nations Commission trying to reach a
definitive demarcation for the line between Iraq and Kuwait, historically
among the most bitterly contested - and among the most clumsily defined.
Roughly speaking, the border was agreed to lie just south of the Iraqi town
of Safwan and reach the coast where the channels Khor Zubair and Khor
Abdullah meet to the north of Kuwait's Bubyan and Warba islands. A working
acceptance of this border was in place up to August 1990 when Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
After the Gulf war ceasefire, however, the US-led anti-Iraq coalition,
backed strongly by Kuwait, sought to define once and for all the precise
meeting point of Kuwait and Iraq and set up the special UN Commission
accordingly. It is expected to reveal its final decision at its fifth
post-war meeting in April.
The trouble is that the official correspondences and maps, mostly penned by
British officials in the first third of the 1900s, originally defining the
border are full of such phrases as 'south of . . .' and 'just south of . .
.' - wholly inadequate for such hotly-disputed territory.
In translating lines on the map into lines on the generally featureless
ground, the commission has then had to contend with references to such
things as the most southerly date palms from Safwan and the site of a border
post, hammered in placed by a British political agent in 1923 - for years
the only border post along the entire boundary.
These might be features enough in the scrubby wastes south of Safwan, were
it not for the fact that the Iraqis early in the 1920s cannily planted new
sets of southerly date palms and in 1939 stole the original border post.
Deciding on exactly where the border reaches the coast - it is agreed to run
in a straight line from the position of the original Safwan border post -
has also been complicated by the fact that many of the original British maps
were not drawn to scale.
It now appears that the Commission, which has completed most of its field
work, has decided that the border should lie somewhat to the north of its
presently accepted line - a fact which this month prompted Mr Tareq Rzouqi,
Kuwait's representative on the Commission, to declare that the new border
will entrench the emirate's historical rights.
But more pertinently to the question of future political peace in the
region, it will also deny Iraqi claims.
Three times this century, in 1938, 1961 and of course 1990, Iraq has
belligerently pushed an historic claim to the whole of Kuwait. Its argument
ran that Iraq was constituted out of the three Ottoman wilayets of Mosul,
Baghdad and Basra, and that Kuwait was part of the latter under Turkish
Ottoman rule.
Historians generally agree that this claim is weakly based. Kuwait held an
ambiguous, and highly autonomous, place in the Ottoman empire and, anyway,
signed a secret protocol with Britain in 1899 turning the country into a
virtual protectorate well before the final dissolution of Turkish influence
in the region.
Indeed, Iraq itself has on numerous occasions acknowledged Kuwait's
independence: formally so in 1963 through a treaty accepting Britain's 1923
boundary demarcation
Nevertheless, Baghdad will protest strongly at a line which looks certain to
deny it several oil wells in the disputed Rumalia field and the best part of
its Umm Qasr naval base.
The latter point in particular will inflame Iraq, highlighting as it does
the limited sea access available to a large country of more than 17m people
heavily dependent, the present embargo notwithstanding, on oil-based foreign
trade. For years before the 1990 invasion, Iraq had sought some form of
leasing agreement over the Warba and Bubyan islands to guarantee it security
over sea passage into Umm Qasr and Basra, further north up the Shatt al
Arab. This, while President Saddam Hussein remains in power at least, will
be out of the question.
'Whether Iraq's historical claims on Kuwait are correct or not, Iraq will
never drop its claim on the country,' remarks one western diplomat in
Kuwait.
The Kuwait government knows this and is already inviting tenders from
foreign companies to build a security fence along the entire 200km border
with Iraq. Work is due to begin as soon as the UN commission formally
unveils its final decision.

FT  19 FEB 92 / 'Gorbachev' of the platteland seeks mandate: Mr F W de
Klerk's attempt to halt his sliding popularity with white voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S president has a touch of Gorbachev about him: he seems to be
less popular among his own people (white Afrikaners) than with his former
enemies, at home or abroad.
Today's by-election in the conservative western Transvaal platteland town of
Potchefstroom - a centre of Afrikaans learning and religion - will give the
best indication yet of white support for Mr F W de Klerk and the revolution
he has wrought in South African politics.
He has challenged the ultra-right Conservative Party (CP) - which wants to
reinstate and perfect the apartheid policy abandoned by the ruling
Nationalists - to prove its strength in Potchefstroom. It is a risky
strategy.
Every by-election since Mr de Klerk took power in 1989 has shown a
substantial swing away from his party. Potchefstroom could well prove little
different, though Mr de Klerk is clearly hoping the swing will not be enough
to overturn the National Party's 1,584-vote majority in a constituency of
22,000 voters.
The government has perhaps not helped its chances with the announcement on
Monday that white parents will soon be required to pay considerably more for
the education of their children. The timing of this announcement, two days
before a sensitive by-election, is extremely odd.
This is home ground for Mr de Klerk, who attended Potchefstroom University.
When he addressed an election meeting in the town last week, his message was
surprisingly candid. Whites, he said, must face the reality of numbers: they
are outnumbered 3:1 in Potchefstroom by blacks, and they are no longer able
to tame the majority with force. They must learn to share power; the
alternative, he said, would be suicide for the Afrikaner volk. He was
referring to the alternative proposed by the Conservatives: classic
apartheid, as practised by H F Verwoerd and his successors, to keep white
and black ever separate under the law.
Potchefstroom will help to answer a crucial question: do the Conservatives
now speak for the majority of whites? Has Mr de Klerk lost his legitimacy as
an Afrikaner leader?
The answer will matter little in constitutional terms: even if the
Conservatives triumph in 'Potch', they will remain vastly outnumbered in
parliament by National Party MPs. And with Mr de Klerk's party caucus
holding firm, the Conservatives know they cannot count on members crossing
the floor to topple the president in a no-confidence vote. The
constitutional route to revolt is blocked for them. But a Conservative
victory could provide a moral basis for the right-wing struggle; whites can
argue that they are being governed by an illegitimate regime which has lost
its mandate from the electorate.
This could fuel white terrorism - the only real threat to Mr de Klerk's
reforms. Mr de Klerk would have to cede a lot of psychological ground to
white supremacist groups and to the whole fractured right in South African
politics. And though the lunatic right has relatively few members, it
remains an important spoiling force: the effect of a few well-timed
assassinations and well-placed bombs could prove catastrophic.
A Conservative victory in Potchefstroom would, inevitably, raise the
frightening prospect that the National Party might also fail when they put a
new constitution to a planned referendum of white voters. Mr Cyril
Ramaphosa, secretary general of the African National Congress (ANC), has
said there would be a revolution in South Africa if whites reject a
constitution agreed to by the rest of its people. Conversely, a defeat in
Potchefstroom could work to Mr de Klerk's advantage: it would concentrate
the minds of ANC leaders on the need to win whites over with a constitution
that gives minorities real power
Because they, too, will lose if Mr de Klerk's referendum fails; they are far
from keen to return to the revolutionary struggle, and have begun to like
the taste of national political power. If Mr de Klerk wins Potchefstroom, he
can claim to be white South Africa's undisputed leader; if he loses, he can
press the ANC for help. He could end up winning, either way.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNALS that 1992 will see economic and possibly political reform in China
strengthened yesterday when a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong again
referred to calls by the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping for accelerated
reform, Simon Holberton reports from Hong Kong.
Wen Wei Po said government departments had been circulating Deng's
observations on his recent visit to southern China - the region which has
most embraced economic reform.
Diplomats and analysts said the article was significant because the
dissemination of information in this way was part of the Chinese way of
building consensus about policy. It follows several reports which taken
together suggest a struggle for party policy and succession is under way.
However, not all accept that recent developments heralded a return to
reform. Professor David Shambaugh of London's School of Oriental and African
Studies, said a year ago the Chinese press ran pro-reform articles only for
hardliners to reassert themselves later.
The Chinese communist party is due to convene its 14th party congress late
this year. At this meeting the party's 'line', or policy, will be
established and a leadership appointed to carry it through. Signs of change
may be visible at a meeting of the National People's Congress, China's token
parliament, when it convenes in late March.
Wen Wei Po said Deng's view was the improvement of the economy should be the
Communist party's first priority in contrast to party dogma which since
Tiananmen square has stressed correct ideological thinking.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Reshuffle of Israel's old guard may unlock peace process:
Today's Labour leadership election could free the logjam of Jerusalem
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN them, Yitzhak Shamir, 76, Shimon Peres, 68, and Yitzhak Rabin, 69,
have occupied the office of prime minister of Israel for 12 of the last 18
years. The overwhelming likelihood is that one of them - polls favour the
present incumbent, Mr Shamir - will do so again after the June 23 general
election.
Nevertheless, leadership elections in the Likud and Labour parties today and
tomorrow promise more than just a reshuffling of the all-too familiar old
guard.
The two contests may not produce new faces at the top. But they will have a
considerable effect on the shape of the inevitable coalition government that
will emerge from the election, and especially on its posture towards the
Middle East peace negotiations launched in Madrid last October. They may
determine whether the process, currently sustained chiefly by US pressure on
the participants, will achieve anything of substance.
The more bitter is being fought in the Labour party, which under the
leadership of Shimon Peres has led a government for only two years since
Likud first came to power under Menachem Begin in 1977. In an unprecedented
ballot of its 150,000 members today, Yitzhak Rabin, replaced as leader by Mr
Peres in 1977, is seeking to take over the party once more.
Two other candidates, Mr Israel Kessar, leader of the Histadrut trade union
federation, and Mrs Ora Namir, a veteran party activist and MP, are also on
the ballot. But the real contest is between old rivals Peres and Rabin.
Mr Rabin, Chief of Staff during the triumph of the 1967 Six Day War, when
Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and Arab
east Jerusalem, believes Labour is fatally handicapped by Mr Peres'
leadership.
His supporters say Mr Rabin can recapture voters who have gone over to the
Likud because of fears that Mr Peres is too willing to make concessions to
the Palestinians. Like Mr Peres, Mr Rabin favours giving up some 'land for
peace', in line with the peace talks formula espoused by the US and demanded
by the Arab side. But his record and stance is perceived as much tougher
than that of Mr Peres.
Mr Rabin, who has the support of most Labour MPs, is the favourite, although
Mr Peres is a tenacious fighter who is hoping to deny his rival the 40 per
cent support needed for outright victory on the first ballot. A run-off will
be held on February 26 between the two leading candidates if no clear result
emerges.
According to opinion polls, a Rabin victory would dramatically improve
Labour's prospects in June. One showed Labour with 32 per cent support, only
one point behind the Likud, under Mr Rabin, but nine points behind on 27 per
cent under Mr Peres.
Labour would probably lose more voters to a new united front of three small
'dovish' parties if Rabin is the leader rather than Peres. But they would
still be in the camp of natural Labour allies against Likud.
The contest for the Likud leadership tomorrow appears less uncertain. Mr
Shamir is challenged by Mr David Levy, his foreign minister, and Mr Ariel
Sharon, the hardline housing minister, but should comfortably win in the
first round outright.
The vote will be an important indicator of the relative strengths of the
various camps within the party. In particular, Mr Levy has much at stake. As
the most vociferous supporter of the peace talks within the government, he
needs to achieve a good showing - 25 per cent or more - to secure his future
claims on the leadership, his present status as number two to Mr Shamir and
to demonstrate backing for his relatively conciliatory stance.
Mr Levy's supporters, mainly drawn from the less privileged Sephardic, or
Oriental Jewish communities, tend to be less ideologically committed to the
occupied territories than the old Ashkenazi, or European leadership
represented by Mr Shamir.
With unemployment at more than 10 per cent and rising because of the strains
of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, they are concerned that
Likud is losing ground to Labour on economic issues. Opinion polls showing
up to 80 per cent of the electorate dissatisfied with the government's
economic performance bear this out.
The polls show a solid majority of Likud supporters back Mr Shamir's
uncompromising line in the peace talks. But at the same time, more than a
third express a less dogmatic approach. For example, a recent survey showed
39 per cent of Likud voters in favour of freezing Jewish settlements in
order to win Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees from the US.
If Mr Shamir - and perhaps even Mr Sharon - roundly defeats Mr Levy, Likud
will go into the June election in as tough a mood as ever. If, in addition,
Mr Peres survives as Labour leader, then the betting in Israel is that Likud
will emerge again as the biggest party, the economy notwithstanding.
The customary long period of coalition bargaining would ensue (no party has
ever won an outright parliamentary majority). But given the deep animosity
between Mr Shamir and Mr Peres, a revival of a Likud-Labour partnership is
extremely unlikely, leaving instead the option of a right-wing coalition
hostile to any peace talks compromise - similar to that which collapsed last
month.
Even with Mr Rabin at the head of Labour, the party is given little chance
of defeating the Likud. But a Shamir-Rabin coalition would be a distinct
possibility. The two have worked closely together before. They disagree on
the shape of a final settlement in the occupied territories. But they could
almost certainly formulate a joint approach on Palestinian autonomy which
would improve the prospects for the peace talks to reach the interim
solution on the West Bank and Gaza sought as an initial breakthrough by the
US. Such an outcome would not be easily achieved, but it would be enhanced
if Mr Levy achieves a good result in the Likud vote.

IVORY Coast's main opposition leader was arrested with hundreds of
supporters yesterday when an anti-government march degenerated into the
worst rioting seen in the west African country, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
The mass round-up came when thousands of demonstrators poured through the
capital, Abidjan, smashing everything in their path. Brandishing clubs and
hurling rocks they shattered hundreds of car and shop windows in the central
Plateau area.
Mr Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the Ivorian Popular Front, was detained at a
military camp with his wife, Simone, prominent opposition figures and at
least 300 supporters, witnesses said. Mr Alassane Ouattara, the prime
minister, said the opposition had failed to control the marchers, estimated
at about 20,000.

<TEXT>
A LOW turnout is feared today when Punjabis vote for the first time after
nearly five years of direct rule from New Delhi.
Sikh militants have ordered a two-day 'bandh' (general closure) which
brought disruption to the northern Indian state yesterday and is expected to
be enforced more forcefully today. Troops deployed to keep the peace during
the fortnight's campaign, are expecting to face widespread violence today.
Various factions of the Akali Dal, the main Sikh political party, are
boycotting the elections under instructions from the militants.
The campaign, cut short to two weeks because of the violence in the state,
has been subdued. Few of the usual signs of an election - posters,
loudspeakers and party flags - have been in evidence as both candidates and
voters fear they will become targets of the militants.
Unlike the last election in Punjab in 1985, when more than 250 candidates
were backed by the militants with the aim of winning control of the
legislature and then declaring independence, there are no such candidates
this time.
So far about 20 people have been killed in election violence - a low figure
by Punjab standards.
Security provided by the military for the elections has been heavy.
All candidates were given protection by the army and they campaigned, if at
all, quietly. Elections meetings were held by some national leaders amid
tight security and before small audiences. Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, whose Congress party is one of the main contestants, did not
campaign at all.
Apart from the Congress, the main parties contesting the elections for 13
members of parliament and 117 members of the state legislature are the Hindu
revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party and the Marxists.
Also in the fray is a small, inconsequential faction of the Akali Dal whose
leader, Mr Amrinder Singh, was elected unopposed before the campaign started
when his opponents withdrew.
It is believed they withdrew because they wanted at least a token Akali
presence in the new Punjab legislature. Mr Amrinder Singh is thought to be
backed by the Congress and is tipped to become chief minister of Punjab if
no party wins a majority.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Boycott ends as LDP agrees on bribery probe
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition parties last night
agreed terms for a parliamentary hearing into a bribery scandal, involving
Kyowa, a bankrupt steel frame maker and property developer.
Opposition parties called off a two-week boycott of the Diet (parliament)
staged in order to force the LDP to allow a full examination of the affair.
The deadlock has delayed debate over the government budget for the new
fiscal year which starts in April and other government business. It also
provoked renewed criticism of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, for
his alleged failure to defuse the row.
The politician most deeply involved in the scandal is Mr Fumio Abe, a former
cabinet minister, who has been charged with receiving a total of Y90m
(Pounds 405,400) in bribes in return for supplying planning information. Mr
Abe was originally charged with receiving bribes worth Y80m. The charge was
later amended to Y90m. The Tokyo district public prosecutor's office this
week closed its investigation of the affair and indicated that no action
would be taken against other politicians who also took money from Kyowa.
Mr Abe will probably not be summoned before the Diet since his case is sub
judice. But the LDP agreed to demands from opposition MPs to call two other
leading LDP members who are alleged to have accepted large political
donations from Kyowa - Mr Jun Shiozaki, a former junior minister, and Mr
Zenko Suzuki, a former prime minister. Both have denied any wrong-doing.
Mr Suzuki, who was prime minister in 1980-82 and is now 81 years old, had
resisted giving testimony before a Diet committee on the grounds of ill
health. He offered to give testimony at home. But the LDP has now agreed
that both Mr Suzuki and Mr Shiozaki should give evidence in televised
hearings next Tuesday.
Even though the Kyowa affair is seriously disrupting Diet business, it is a
preliminary event before politicians begin to argue in earnest over a much
larger scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, a transport company, under
investigation by the public prosecutor's office for giving loans and loan
guarantees totalling Y530bn for questionable purposes. Among the recipients
of the company's favours was Mr Susumu Ishii, the former head of Inagawakai,
Japan's second largest gangster organisation.
The Sagawa Kyubin group also gave hefty financial support to around 100
politicians, including several leading LDP members.
Those who have acknowledged receiving funds include aides to Mr Kakuei
Tanaka, the former prime minister, who was involved in the Lockheed bribery
scandal in the 1970s.
Yesterday an aide to Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, another former prime minister,
acknowledged that a political research institute established by Mr Nakasone
after he left office in 1987 may have received donations from Sagawa-related
companies. But he said that if Sagawa made donations they were legal.

Britain is pressing the EC to oppose plans at next month's meeting of the

At the Cites meeting in Japan on March 2 some African states, including
South Africa and Zimbabwe, are expected to urge that the ban on ivory
trading, introduced in 1989, should be lifted. Others, such as Kenya and
Botswana, are expected to seek a resumption of trade in other elephant

The African states argue that money from the trade is needed to help
conservation of elephants and other wildlife.

A NATIONAL one-day pay strike by Portugal's public-sector workers caused
widespread disruption yesterday, although support was patchy, writes Patrick
Blum in Lisbon.
The strike appears to have been strongest in Lisbon, with public transport,
schools and hospitals most affected. International air travellers faced
cancellations and delays as ground staff walked out.
Unions called the strike in protest at the government's imposition of an 8
per cent pay rise on more than 300,000 public administration employees, in
line with its inflation forecast for the year.
The strike went ahead despite an agreement last weekend with the moderate
UGT union, raising its basic offer to about 10 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN economy stands at a watershed, and the coming months will decide
if the present slowdown is a pause for breath, or the beginning of a
longer-lasting downturn, the Economics Ministry warned yesterday.
In its gloomiest prognosis for months, the ministry identified two decisive
negative factors which could tip the economy into a lasting recession:
continuation of last year's high rate of wage increases, and a failure in
the negotiations in the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt).
Publication of the ministry's latest monthly report coincided with new
statistics for wages, prices and external trade for the past year. They
showed largely negative trends on all fronts for 1991 as a whole, although
there was a marginal improvement in December's trade figures and January's
inflation rate.
In particular, the wage figures published by the Federal Statistics Office
showed that although gross wages rose faster than inflation, net wages -
after tax and social security payments - actually fell below the rise in the
consumer price index.
Between October 1990 and October 1991, gross wages in west German industry
and commerce rose by an average 5.4 per cent, compared with a 3.5 per cent
increase in the cost of living. However, after allowing for both tax
(including the 'solidarity surcharge' for unification) and inflation, net
wages dropped between 1.1 and 3.3 per cent, according to Mr Egon Holder,
head of the statistical office.
That loss in purchasing power is now an important factor fuelling union pay
demands and contributing to the slowdown in the west German economy.
As for the trade picture, Germany saw a large deterioration in its trade
balance and current account over the year, related essentially to the import
surge to fuel demand in east Germany, combined with declining export demand
in the rest of the world economy. However, imports dropped sharply (by 7.6
per cent) in December, to mark a slight recovery.
In spite of the combination of surging imports and sluggish exports, visible
trade remained in surplus, but down from DM107.4bn (Pounds 37.4bn) in 1990
to just DM20.8bn (Pounds 7.2bn) last year. Within that figure is a sharp
reduction in Germany's trade surplus with France and Britain (down by almost
DM10bn in each case, to DM8.6bn and DM8.1bn respectively), and a switch from
surplus to a DM1.3bn deficit with the US.
The overall balance of payments switched from a surplus of DM77.4bn in 1990
to a deficit of DM34.2bn last year, including payments for the Gulf war and
a significant outflow of investment capital.
The Economics Ministry warned that the rate of wage increases was equally
worrying in both east and west Germany. While pay rises in the west were
fuelling inflation, those in the east were discouraging investment in the
region, leaving it dependent on government subsidies - which meant a
continuing high tax burden and therefore depressed consumer demand in the
west.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Annual Production falls for first time since 1983
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL production fell by an average 2.1 per cent in Italy last year,
the first decline since 1983, according to figures from Istat, the national
statistics office, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The figures confirm the
recession affecting a broad swathe of industry which began in late 1990.
There is no immediate evidence of recovery.
Worst affected were heavy industry and engineering, where output fell 5.4
per cent, reflecting the downturn in the motor industry and machine tools,
where plants are working at 75 per cent capacity. In contrast, the food
sector rose a modest 1 per cent, underlining the way consumer spending has
held up.
Last year's industrial downturn was also confirmed this week by provisional
Istat figures showing a 2.6 per cent decline in employment in companies with
more than 500 employees. The industrial north was worst affected; Lombardy
alone lost 108,000 jobs.
The true level of industrial unemployment, however, is disguised by the
practice of state-funded temporary lay-offs. Resort to this mechanism,
especially notable in large groups like Fiat, increased by 21 per cent on
average during the year, but in the case of engineering the increase was 60
per cent. Large companies also took advantage of a government scheme to help
fund 11,000 early retirements last year; a further 25,000 are planned this
year.
The shake-out in industrial employment is expected to accelerate, and the
government is likely to come under pressure to absorb more workers on the
state payroll, following the example of an agreement over the weekend with
Olivetti. The government agreed to absorb 1,000 Olivetti workers who had
been threatened with job losses.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Italy's monetary parting of ways: Reforms at the Bank of
Italy and the Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a century together, the Bank of Italy and the Treasury last month took
a step towards divorce with the decision to give the central bank autonomy
to set the discount rate.
The move, while largely symbolic, was designed to bring the country closer
into line with European Community commitments on economic and monetary union
after the Maastricht summit in December. While the discount rate, the key
rate charged by the central bank to commercial banks, used to be determined
by the Treasury, it was only on the recommendation of the Bank of Italy
located just down the road. Nevertheless, greater independence of central
banks from governments was a key demand from the Germans in particular, and
few EC countries will benefit more than Italy.
Treasury officials have for years fought a losing battle against
free-spending politicians, who have given Italy Europe's second-biggest
government deficit after Greece. A more independent central bank, with
muscle to match its reputation for professionalism, is as welcome to
reformers in Rome as it is to the architects of Emu.
The Bank of Italy's enhanced stature has been accompanied by moves to
upgrade the Treasury's own abilities in economic policy management and
macro-economic research and forecasting, which had previously been entrusted
almost exclusively to the central bank.
In its first big re-organisation since 1889, the Treasury has appointed five
new director-generals, equivalent to permanent secretaries in the UK civil
service. Mr Mario Draghi, the highly-respected former official of the
International Monetary Fund brought in to replace Mr Mario Sarcinelli as
director general last year, is being promoted to a higher grade. Meanwhile,
two of the newcomers are being brought in from outside.
One, Mr Francesco Giavazzi, a prominent economist from Milan's Bocconi
university, will be responsible for macro-economic research and forecasting.
Among his first jobs will be to come up with names for the new 10-man
council of permanent advisers, probably top economists, which was another of
last month's innovations to reinforce the Treasury analytical skills.
The second outsider is Mr Enrico Granata, formerly head of the legal
department at Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, a respected public-sector
financial services group. He will head a new directorate in charge of
organisational matters relating to monetary and fiscal policy. More
important, he will also supervise the Treasury's hand in dealing with
public-sector banks, especially over privatisation.
A frustrated Mr Sarcinelli left Italy for one of the deputy chairmanships of
the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development after hitting out
at the persistent inability of Italian politicians to get to grips with the
budget deficit. In his parting letter, he also drew attention to the
scarcity of economic expertise in the Treasury.
The most important step - yet to come - is the curtailment of the Treasury's
right to use the Bank of Italy to fund the budget deficit. As in other
countries, the Treasury has an account with the central bank for financing
day-to-day public spending. However, the Italian account also carries an
overdraft facility which would shame the most open-handed bank manager.
The credit line was originally intended to give the Treasury some
flexibility in managing liquidity. But over the years, it has grown into a
tool for financing budget deficits. Cumulative usage of the line has risen
to more than L70,000bn, (Pounds 32bn) according to Mr Riccardo Barbieri, an
economist with J P Morgan in Milan.
Use of the line has been more limited in the past two years. However, there
are still periods, such as last September, when the Treasury has gone on a
binge.
Mr Guido Carli, the veteran Treasury minister, has vowed to reform the
credit line, a move that will probably go hand in hand with steps to reduce
Italy's currently high bank reserve requirements. With only hours before the
dissolution of parliament last month, Mr Carli even put forward a draft law
to underline his commitment to reforming the credit facility. Swept aside in
the torrent of more pressing last-minute legislation, the bill had no chance
of passing into law. But Mr Carli has laid down a marker for the next
government.
At 77, Mr Carli, a former central bank governor, has earned a rest, but he
may want to soldier on a little longer to see cherished legislation, such as
that on limited privatisations, take effect. With the main political parties
likely to emerge weakened from the general election in April, Mr Carli's
continued presence at the helm would also be a strong signal to other
European partners, and to the new blood being brought into his ministry,
that change, this time, really is at hand.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Ministry proposes package of measures to lure investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPREHENSIVE package of measures to improve the attractiveness of Germany
as an investment location, including corporate tax cuts, and plans to
improve labour mobility, has been drawn up by the Economics Ministry.
The package is an attempt to meet the growing chorus of complaints from
German industry that high wage and tax costs, and an excessive burden of
social and environmental spending, are driving German and foreign investors
alike away from the market.
In a special report on the issue, the ministry insists the complaints are
often repetitive and exaggerated. But it also admits that they should be
taken seriously, as a reflection of the real fears of German entrepreneurs.
'The warning signals should be taken seriously,' it says. 'The preservation
and improvement of the quality of Germany as an investment location is a
task which depends equally on the state, enterprises, wage partners and
other social groups.' Above all, action is needed with the approaching
completion of the European Community single market at the end of 1992.
The package includes:
strict control of state spending, to prevent excessive demands on the
domestic capital markets, and a rising tax burden on industry
further cuts in corporate taxation, to bring the marginal rate down to 46
per cent (from the current 51 per cent)
registration of private job-hunting agencies, to break the monopoly of the
Federal Labour Office in job placement
encouragement of greater regional and sectoral variations in wages,
especially between east and west Germany, and discouragement of binding
national wage agreements
greater flexibility of working times
promotion of greater competition in infrastructure services, including
telecommunications and transportation
environmental controls on industry to be matched by corresponding financial
relief in other areas.

A FIRE yesterday destroyed one of the most eye-catching pavilions of the
Seville Universal Exposition, which opens on April 20, writes Tom Burns in
Madrid.
Firemen fought a four-hour battle to extinguish the blaze at the 'Time
Machine'. Conceived as a Time Machine that used a combination of visual
effects to explain five centuries of discoveries, invention and
technological applications, the pavilion was a key component of Expo '92's
commemoration of Columbus' voyage to the New World 500 years ago.
Although the fire's cause was not known last night, security experts have
voiced fears that Expo '92, which groups some 90 pavilions representing
nations and multinationals, would be a target for terrorist groups,
including the Basque separatist organisation Eta.
The destroyed complex, which consisted of eight modules spread over 12,000
sq metres, was officially known as the Discoveries Pavilion, and was
expected to draw some 20,000 visitors a day.

WESTERN countries must make more money available to help meet the estimated
DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) cost of making nuclear power stations in Russia and
the rest of eastern Europe safe, according to Mr Adolf Huttl, head of the
KWU energy division of Germany's Siemens industrial group.
He said the foreign exchange portion of this, to finance imports into the
affected countries of vital equipment such as new control instruments, could
be kept to about DM4bn.
Western industry also had to work closely with the countries to build up the
volume of local supplies and contracts in such work. This would account for
the other DM8bn.
Mr Huttl said the figures applied only to the 63 pressurised water reactors
 -just over half of which are in Russia - built with Soviet technology.
The 16 Chernobyl-type reactors were not worth improving as their faults were
too basic. The company believes they should be closed.
Mr Huttl said the funds so far made available by the EC, equivalent to a few
hundred million D-Marks, were insufficient and only covered studies and
planning work.
It was unrealistic to expect Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and most of
the former Soviet Union republics to close their nuclear power plants at
once, since they depended on these for electricity.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S rate of inflation fell 4 per cent last month to take the annual
rate below the psychologically important 30 per cent level for the first
time since July 1990, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
The rise in the January consumer price index to a level 28.2 per cent above
the year-earlier figure was partly technical as the effects of subsidy cuts,
price liberalisation and the rise in Soviet energy prices to world levels
fell out of the statistics. The last consumer subsidies, excluding public
transport, were abolished in the 1992 budget.
Downward pressure on inflation was also helped by appreciation of the
forint, the national currency, which increased competition from imports in
the domestic market at the expense of domestic production and employment.
Inflation is now well below the peak of 38.6 per cent recorded last June and
on target for the year-end official forecast of about 15 per cent.
In a further confirmation of the downward trend, producer prices rose an
annualised 6.1 per cent in the six months to November 1991.
The National Bank of Hungary has made lower inflation its priority after
concentrating on strengthening the balance of payments in 1991.

FT  19 FEB 92 / Tietmeyer defends high interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bundesbank was acting in the best interests of Europe by keeping
borrowing rates high, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the bank's deputy governor, said
last night. He told the London School of Economics the stance was aimed at
bringing down German inflation, and that this would ultimately help price
stability in the rest of Europe.
He also hinted strongly that the future European Central Bank (ECB) should
be located in Frankfurt, and repeated recent Bundesbank warnings about the
progress to European economic and monetary union around the end of the
century. A union - featuring a single European currency supervised by the
ECB - would make 'no sense' unless the economic performance of individual
countries grew closer.
Mr Tietmeyer acknowledged that the Bundesbank's action in December in
increasing German rates by  1/2 percentage point had caused concern in other
countries in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The highest German
rates since the 1930s have inhibited these nations from cutting their
borrowing rates.
However, he said the action, by damping German inflation triggered by
unification, was essential to secure sound-money principles for the whole of
Europe.
In moving towards Emu, Mr Tietmeyer said in a passage likely to appeal to
the UK government, that Europe should rely on market forces to bring about
the desired economic convergence in areas such as interest rates and
inflation.
In what appeared to be a reference to France, he expressed disapproval of
the approach favoured by some in Europe of overt government intervention in
areas such as industry. 'Vigilance. . . . is essential if the emergence of
dirigiste policies is to be countered,' he said.
He also urged the UK government to accelerate any moves to give the Bank of
England independence from the Treasury over setting British interest rates.
Such a move would be necessary if Britain were to decide to join Emu and 'it
would be desirable for such a step to be taken at as early a stage as
possible'.

It had originally sought to curb false or misleading claims by drawing up
detailed lists of banned or restricted terms. However, food manufacturers
protested that such an approach would unduly inhibit marketing and product
innovation.
The Commission is now considering instead drawing up a set of general
principles, which would leave manufacturers free to make claims for their
products, provided they were able to prove these were justified.
Products could continue to be labelled with claims such as 'light',
'alcohol-free' or 'cholesterol-free' so long as manufacturers made clear
what they meant by these terms.
Brussels officials expect draft legislation to be submitted this year to the
Council of Ministers, which first asked the Commission in 1978 to propose a
system for regulating labelling claims.

THE slowdown in the German economy is either a pause for breath or the start

The economics ministry issued the grim warning yesterday as it highlighted
two decisive factors which could push the economy into a long downturn:
a continuation of last year's high wage increases and collapse of the
negotiations on the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
The ministry's latest monthly report was released at the same time as
statistics for the past year's wages, prices and external trade. They show
largely negative trends on all fronts for 1991 as a whole. Page 3

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Corazon Aquino of the Philippines has asked President George Bush
to put aside bitterness between the two countries and help turn the US Subic
naval base into a commercial port providing access to American warships,
Reuter reports from Manila.
In a letter to Mr Bush released by the presidential palace yesterday, Mrs
Aquino said the Philippine Senate's decision last September to reject a new
bases treaty with the US should not damage the relationship between the two
allies.
Rejection of the new treaty, which would have given the US use of Subic for
10 more years, has forced Mrs Aquino to tell Washington to withdraw its
forces by year-end.
The US departure would signal an end to nearly a century of an US military
presence in its former colony.
Mrs Aquino said in her letter: 'It is in our mutual interest that this
transition be carried out in a manner that conveys to Americans and
Filipinos abroad and the world at large that we have put behind us the
bitterness generated by the acrimonious bases negotiations and that we
remain true friends.'
Manila says it plans to convert Subic, a US ship repair yard, into a
commercial port but wants the Americans to leave behind some facilities,
including floating dry docks.
'I would have preferred an orderly withdrawal that would have permitted the
retention in Subic of one or two of the floating dry docks and the related
ship repair facilities, to be operated under mutually acceptable
arrangements,' Mrs Aquino said in her letter, dated February 3.
She said 'a minimum of these repair facilities would need to remain in place
if the US Seventh Fleet is to have access to the facilities.' If the dry
docks remained, US Navy ships would be given preference in their use.
A spokesman for Mrs Aquino said the dry docks were not absolutely necessary
in a commercial port, but would be necessary if the port were to be used for
military purposes.
It was not known if Mr Bush had replied to Mrs Aquino but an American
official hinted that the US forces might take the dry docks with them when
they left Subic.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO unions representing members of the Italian police protested yesterday
outside the Ministry of Interior in Rome and organised a nationwide series
of demonstrations to draw attention to pay and work conditions, writes
Robert Graham in Rome.
The protest coincided with public discontent among the para-military
Carabinieri over their pay and conditions. This comes at a time when Italy's
security forces are under increasing pressure to combat a rising wave of
organised crime countrywide.
In response, President Francesco Cossiga called a meeting of the defence,
finance and interior ministers in an bid to prevent the grievances becoming
an election issue.
The police are concerned by a January decree which brought the pay of junior
ranks of the Carabinieri up to levels of their inspectors. They have
demanded a re-organisation of career structures and more pay, retaining the
previous differential with the Carabinieri.
The Carabinieri, meanwhile, has been angered by MPs' inability to approve
the decree raising their pay and last week chose the occasion of a funeral
of two colleagues, gunned down by Naples gangsters, to shout abuse at
authorities.

INTERNATIONAL Semi-Tech Microelectronics, the fast-growing Toronto-based
holding company, is raising USDollars 140m through a Hong Kong affiliate by
issuing shares to the public in Singer, the sewing machine and household
appliance company.
Semi-Tech Global, a Hong Kong-based public company 40 per cent owned by
ISTM, plans a secondary offering of 7m Singer common shares at USDollars 20
each. Another 1.1m shares would be available, if necessary, to cover any
over-subscriptions.
The issue will cut Semi-Tech's stake in Singer from 67 per cent to 51 per
cent.
The bulk of the offering will be in the US, but a tranche of 1.75m shares
will be available to an international syndicate led by Merrill Lynch,
Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Credit Suisse First Boston.
Singer was listed on the New York Stock Exchange last August. Its shares
were trading at Dollars 20.25 each before yesterday's announcement.
Mr James Ting, Semi-Tech's chairman, said the proceeds would be used for
acquisitions to complement Singer's businesses. He said Semi-Tech had no
intention of further reducing its stake in Singer.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIKUBEN, the first of the large Danish banks to publish its 1991 results,
suffered a DKr2m (Dollars 317,000) pre-tax loss last year after increasing
bad loan provisions from DKr920m to DKr1.38bn. In 1990 the bank recorded a
pre-tax profit of Dkr80m.
The bank said at the half year that it expected second-half provisions to
decrease. However, the continuing recession in Denmark, as well as in
several of its most important trading partners, had affected both business
and personal customers, said Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, the group's chief
executive.
Bikuben raised DKr500m through a new share issue in November. The bank then
forecast that 1991 results would be very close to break-even.
Despite the small loss last year, the bank's capital adequacy ratio was 11.4
per cent, compared with the legal minimum ratio of 10 per cent. Unibank,
Denmark's second largest bank, is streamlining its management structure and
giving the group management a tighter grip on credit decisions, which have
been the responsibility of the bank's four divisions.
The move by the bank, which publishes its 1991 results today, is seen as a
recognition of the problems it has faced since it was formed in 1990 by the
merger of Privatbanken, SDS and Andelsbanken.
The first sign came with the 1991 half-year results which showed a pre-tax
profit of DKr728m, compared with DKr1.5bn for its rival, Den Danske Bank.
Since then the equity market has marked down Unibank. Shares of Unidanmark,
the holding company, have recently traded at around DKr210.
The decision last week by Moody's, the US rating agency, to place Unibank's
long-term debt rating under review was another blow. Moody's expressed
concern at the quality of the bank's assets.

AKBANK, Turkey's largest private bank, saw after-tax profits for the year to
December 31 rise 6 per cent to USDollars 265m.
Profits rose from TL733bn to TL1,343bn, although this does not reflect
Turkish inflation at around 70 per cent, and depreciation of the lira during

Mr Erol Sabanci, bank chairman, predicted Akbank would continue to be the
most profitable bank in Turkey in 1992.
Akbank is majority-owned by Sabanci Holdings, Turkey's largest industrial

Unlike its competitors, it has not ventured into fund management and equity
trading.
The bank's deposit base remains strong at around TL2,511bn, while loans

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Textron takes the controls of an
overhauled Cessna - Nikki Tait profiles one of the best-known names in US
aviation following its Dollars 600m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE billboard at Cessna Aircraft's Wichita, Kansas, headquarters
proclaims: 'From zero to 500 in 6.7 years.' Employees usually chuckle at
this adman's spoof of car industry marketing - it has nothing to do with
acceleration but everything to do with the sales performance of a
significant product line.
There is, however, nothing laughable about the Dollars 600m cash price that
Textron, the Rhode Island-based conglomerate, has just agreed to pay for
Cessna. The deal was the outcome of an auction which General Dynamics, the
defence contractor and Cessna's former owner, initiated last autumn.
Nor is there anything laughable about the radical overhaul which one of the
best-known names in US aviation has faced during the past decade. At the end
of the 1970s, Cessna employed more than 21,000 people - 16,000 in Wichita
alone - and was viewed as the leading manufacturer of light aircraft.
Today, it has one-quarter of that workforce and makes only corporate jets,
plus a range of single-engine turbo-prop aircraft. The only thing which has
gone up is profit. The Dollars 109m operating figure for 1991, according to
Cessna, was the best in its history.
Nobody could claim that this corporate metamorphosis was achieved against an
easy industry background. It has been calculated, for example, that US
general aviation manufacturers shipped only 1,021 aircraft last year - the
lowest annual figure since the Second World War. That represents an 11 per
cent drop from the previous year, and took total industry billings below
Dollars 2bn.
Reasons for the depressed situation are not difficult to identify. Part of
the problem is attributed to the explosive growth in product liability
costs, which is, in turn, a reflection of US tort claims and litigation.
Back in 1986, for example, Cessna's chairman, Mr Russ Meyer, told a Senate
aviation sub-committee that the company's premium for liability insurance
had soared from Dollars 5,000 per aircraft in 1983, to Dollars 90,000.
Not surprisingly, US manufacturers of small, single-engine aircraft found
the economics becoming hugely unfavour-able. Cessna - which had once
produced nearly 9,000 piston-powered aircraft in a year, and whose
172/Skyhawk model was built in greater numbers than any other aircraft -
pulled out of this market in the mid-1980s.
Piper Aircraft, another leading small-aircraft manufacturer, filed for
bankruptcy protection last July.
The net effect of this retreat was reflected in last year's numbers: US
suppliers produced only 613 piston-powered aircraft in 1991, compared with
17,000 in 1978.
The tax climate has deteriorated, too. The General Aviation Manufacturers
Association (Gama), the US industry's trade body, has been lobbying hard for
the reintroduction of 'investment tax credits' and repeal of the 'luxury
tax' on business aircraft mandated by Congress. Gama took some heart from
fiscal proposals contained in President George Bush's state of the union
address last month, but still maintains that more could be done.
Finally, there is the recession. Business aircraft tend to be viewed as an
executive luxury, and when the outlay for a corporate jet ranges between
Dollars 2.5m and Dollars 25m, this presents an expense that can be easily
pruned. As one analyst puts it: 'When you're laying off hundreds of workers,
buying a corporate jet just does not look good.'
It is true the business jet market held up rather better than general
aviation last year. However, the 186 business jets sold, although 10.7 per
cent higher than the 168 jets sold in 1990, was still only half the 389
delivered in 1981.
Cessna is no stranger to hard times. Founded in 1927 by Clyde Cessna, whose
mechanical interest surfaced when he fixed farm equipment on his father's
Kansas homestead, the company teetered on the brink of bankruptcy during the
Depression. In the event, Cessna did not fail, but between 1931 and 1933 not
a single aircraft was produced.
Cessna's reshaping during the 1980s was perhaps more subtle, but no less
dramatic. As losses started to mount early in the decade, sales of non-core
assets flowed, coupled with job cuts and abandonment of the piston aircraft
market. In 1985, General Dynamics bought the struggling company for some
Dollars 664m, but Cessna, at least, maintains the relationship had always
been hands-off.
"General Dynamics came along when we needed the assistance of a large
corporate parent, particularly to build some of the new designs we were
looking at,' says Mr Roy Norris, senior vice-president of marketing.
'When Cessna was first acquired, and during the first year of ownership,
they made some modest contribution of funds. But following that, all of our
new aircraft programmes and aircraft introductions, were funded totally out
of the earnings of the company.'
Cessna has enjoyed some breaks. Federal Express became a key customer for
the company's Caravan turboprop aircraft - a utility aircraft which was
originally designed 'for flying into the bush'. Of the 500-plus sold to
date, about half have gone to the package delivery company.
But perhaps the most significant element in Cessna's overhaul was the
decision to concentrate on the corporate jet market, where it has come to
command a 60 per cent share.
At the bottom end of its range, Cessna offers the small Citation Jet,
costing Dollars 2.62m and still at the prototype stage. Deliveries are due
to start later this year. At the top, there is the Citation X, due to come
on stream in 1995 and billed as the fastest-ever business jet.
Coupled with fairly resilient sales for existing Citation lines, this new
focus helped push revenues to around Dollars 820m last year, and the order
backlog to over Dollars 1bn.
Cessna says the market has been tough, but bearable: 'We saw a little
softness last year, but nothing of the order of magnitude we were hearing
from other people in the industry,' says Mr Norris.
But the switch in emphasis, plus the domestic recession, has necessitated
more attention on the overseas market. Sales outside the US have accounted
for half the total in recent years, compared with 14 per cent in 1984. New
marble-clad 'showroom' facilities have been carved out of the delivery
hanger, and tastefully under-stated suites await would-be buyers at the
Wichita offices.
As for the new relationship with Textron, whose extensive operations also

CHILECTRA Metropolitana, Chile's largest electricity distribution company,
has raised Dollars 72m from US institutional investors in order to
participate in the privatisation of Argentine utilities.
Chilectra is the second Chilean company to issue American depositary
receipts (ADRs), the instrument through which foreign companies are able to
sell equity in the US.
Its success, following that of the trail-blazing Compania de Telefonos de
Chile, may persuade other Chilean companies to tap the US capital markets to
finance their expansion plans at home and abroad.
The company said the ADR offering had been heavily oversubscribed and
attracted interest not only in the US but also from institutional investors
in Asia and Europe. The private placement was managed by JP Morgan, the US
investment bank.
Chilectra forms part of Enersis, a fast-growing group of private electricity
companies whose profits last year topped 49bn pesos (Dollars 130m) - a 34
per cent return on assets.
The Chilean company is particularly interested in bidding for Segba,
Argentina's biggest utility, when it comes up for sale this year. Chilectra
is talking to potential partners in the US, Spain and France on a possible
joint bid.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bow Valley posts CDollars 258m
deficit after write-down

<TEXT>
LOWER OIL and gas prices combined with a large write-down to push Bow Valley
Industries, the Canadian energy producer controlled by British Gas, into the
red last year .
The Calgary-based company's net loss was CDollars 258.7m (USDollars 219.2m),
or CDollars 3.31 a share, compared with 1990 earnings of CDollars 49.7m, or
47 cents.
Before a fourth-quarter write-down of CDollars 268.8m, last year's net
income was CDollars 10.1m. The write-down stems from an annual comparison
between the book value of Bow Valley's Canadian assets and expected future
revenues based on constant prices.
The company said the book value of its interests in Indonesia and the UK,
centred on the Brae Field in the North Sea, remained unimpaired.
Operating revenues fell by 24 per cent to CDollars 267m, due to lower
production and prices.
Oil output declined to 29,400 from 34,100 barrels a day, partly as a result
of fourth-quarter maintenance work at Brae and disappointing drilling
results at South Brae.
Natural gas production slipped to 166.1m cu ft a day from 173.7m cu ft,
while the average price was down to CDollars 1.46 per metric cubic foot from
CDollars 1.51.
British Gas has a 54 per cent stake in Bow Valley. The UK company announced
earlier this month that it would soon spin off to the public 15 per cent of
its Canadian distribution utility, Consumers Gas.

FT  18 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSITIVE political and economic sentiment helped stock index futures rise in
thin but steady trading, writes Christopher Price.
The March futures opened at a healthy 2,532, with a number of factors
weighing on the market, namely the scope for interest rate cuts following
Friday's inflation figures, good weekend polls for the government and
positive overnight trading news from Tokyo.
The market moved steadily ahead to midday, with dealers reporting interest
from US buyers. But with Wall Street's closure, many independent dealers had
taken a day's holiday and March stalled until the late afternoon. However,
it found strong support at the 2,550 level that provided a spring board for
a late burst which generated a squeeze.
March closed at 2,565, up 35 on the previous session, and around 15 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover was a
low 3,053 lots.
Wall Street's holiday also depressed business in the traded options market.
Volume was a poor 22,825. The FT-SE 100 index option had 3,441 contracts
dealt.
Thames Water was the busiest stock option, with the May 360 puts dominating
the day's total of 2,837 lots traded.

FT  18 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures provide the lead for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH WORLD stock markets providing no clear lead, the London equity sector
was left yesterday to juggle with the chances of developments in interest
rates and electoral prospects at home. However, hopes of early reductions in
domestic base rates, encouraged by the UK press at the weekend, found no
support either from sterling's progress or from the Bank of England's
actions on the London money market.
An advance in the stock market towards the close, in spite of the absence of
Wall Street, which was closed yesterday, reflected a strong rise in the
futures market, which caught the equity marketmakers short of stock in the
underlying blue chip issues.
The gain of 27.1 on the day took the FT-SE Index to 2,541.0, bringing the
2,550 level into the market's sights once again.
UK public opinion polls continued to show that the ratings of the two main
political parties are close together, while the latest hints from political
circles merely underlined expectations in the City that the UK general
election will be held early in April.
A glimmer of optimism came from a survey of the distributive trades by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which suggested a rise in sales
volumes. The survey supported the view of Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, that a consumer spending boom is about to
rescue the UK economy.
Share prices opened uncertainly, however, and it was not until the stock
index markets came in on a firm note that the underlying stock market moved
ahead. A good premium on the March futures contract of the FT-SE Index was
soon reflected in a gain of 18.4 for the index itself, which touched 2,532.3
at mid-morning.
But trading volume, already foreshadowing the absence of a lead from Wall
Street, was painfully thin and share prices could not sustain their early
gains, at least for a while.
The late upswing saw a pick-up in Seaq volume, which totalled 463.8m shares
on the day, against a previous 593.1m. Friday's total represented Pounds
1.2bn in genuine customer, or retail, business, a significant increase over
the daily values of the past week.
There was further selling of BP shares, as the analysts continued to react
negatively to last week's trading statement. The stores sector responded
well to the CBI survey, although share volume was moderate. Great Universal
Stores, notably a thinly traded share, stood out strongly, and Marks and
Spencer and Kingfisher reacted positively to the hope of increased sales in
the high streets of Britain.
The strongest gains came among the blue chip internationals, which benefited
both from the strength of the Footsie futures contract and the hope that
Wall Street will sustain its recent firmness when it returns from holiday.
Among these market leaders, pharmaceutical issues were strong and stocks
such as Reckitt &amp; Colman and Rank Organisation, more directly influenced by
Wall Street, closed very firmly.
However, across the broad range of the market, shares were not active and
traders warned that price movements reflected the need of marketmaking firms
to find shares to cover selling bargains struck in the previous week. London
is unlikely to develop any new trend until Wall Street returns to business.

FT  18 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 2.1% on
official support for yen
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN'S sharp upturn against the dollar following the Bank of Japan's
intervention on the foreign exchanges encouraged dealers to buy shares, and
the Nikkei average gained 2.1 per cent on the day, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei closed 441.12 up at 21,324.98, recovering the important
21,000 level. Arbitrage-related selling sent the index to the day's low of
20,574.01 in the morning. However, afternoon reports of the central bank's
intervention to support the yen prompted a rise in bond prices, and the
Nikkei rose to the day's high of 21,325.68.
Activity was limited to dealers, and volume remained low at 200m shares
after Friday's 180m. Overall declines still led rises by 480 to 416, with
223 issues unchanged at the close. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 4.52 to 1,559.83, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
2.46 to 1,199.25.
The Bank of Japan sold an estimated UDollars 500m against the yen. The
dollar, which traded around Y128 in the morning, closed at Y126.93, down
Y1.02 from last Friday.
Traders interpreted the Bank of Japan's move as an attempt to curb Japan's
exports, thus reducing the country's trade surplus. 'But the most effective
way is to cut interest rates,' said Mr Chris Turner at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd.
The bond and stock markets rose, as market participants saw a higher yen
limiting inflation and leading to lower interest rates.
High-technology issues rebounded from a bout of morning weakness following
Japanese brokers' downward revisions of their earnings forecasts for the
sector in the current year. Toshiba closed Y7 higher at Y628 and NEC added
Y10 at Y1,110.
Interest rate-sensitive large-capital issues firmed. Nippon Steel improved
Y4 to Y348 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries finished Y10 ahead at Y637.
Banks lost ground on corporate selling, locking in profits ahead of the
March book closing. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y70 to Y2,830 and Sumitomo
Bank Y60 to Y1,730.
Daito Trust Construction was the best performer of the day, climbing Y730 or
9.2 per cent to Y8,600. Investors who had sold the stock on earnings-related
rumours rushed to buy back the shares after the company announced a stock
split last Friday.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 69.13 to 22,642.52 in volume of 56.1m shares.
The index fell for the sixth consecutive day as constructions lost ground.
Roundup
ACTIVITY on the Pacific Rim reflected the closure of Wall Street last night,
and share prices were not impressed by Tokyo's gains.
TAIWAN plunged on reports that the central bank had suspended applications
from foreign fund companies for investment into the local stock market. The
weighted index tumbled 166.95 or 3.3 per cent to 4,856.48, following a small
gain of 3.02 points on Saturday. Turnover increased to TDollars 32.26bn from
TDollars 21.98bn.
Mr Samuel Shieh, the central bank governor, was quoted as saying that the
suspension was aimed at relieving upward pressure on the local currency
against the US dollar.
HONG KONG fell as profit-takers moved in after last week's gains. The Hang
Seng index receded 53.13 to 4,719.19, after setting records during five of
the preceding seven sessions. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 1.7bn from
HKDollars 2.3bn.
The property sector was dampened by a government report showing that the
vacancy rate of local residential flats rose last year. Cheung Kong lost 30
cents to HKDollars 21.10 and Hongkong Land slipped 20 cents to HKDollars
10.30.
AUSTRALIA had its second quietest day this year, turnover dropping to
ADollars 121m, its lowest since January 3. In spite of a firmer banking
sector, the All Ordinaries index closed 4.8 off at 1,614.2.
MANILA's composite index slid below 1,200, ending 22.65 weaker at 1,179.10.
Turnover fell from 138m pesos to 110.6m. The government's 5.5bn-peso
offering of 21 per cent of Philippine National Bank, scheduled for March 15,
is viewed as a threat to the market.
SEOUL also had its liquidity worries as the composite index dipped 7.57 to
640.14, turnover contracting to Won222bn, compared with levels of well over
Won300bn last week.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered from early weakness to end slightly higher in light
trading. The composite index gained a net 2.03 at 597.78 in turnover of
MDollars 132m, after MDollars 134m.
Buying interest continued in gaming stocks, and the lottery issue Tanjong
rose 25 cents to MDollars 8.70 with 1.4m shares traded. SINGAPORE lost
ground and the Straits Times Industrial index ended 9.10 lower at 1,494.81
in turnover of SDollars 86.44m, after SDollars 115.3m.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England set out to skim the froth of interest rate speculation
yesterday, signalling in its early dealings that there would be no imminent
cut.
It traded just a shade under the current 10 1/2 per cent base rate level
during the day. However, the market was still gambling on a reduction around
the March 10 UK Budget, with players holding on to their paper for more
favourable rates.
As a result, the Bank of England injected a mere Pounds 431m by midday to
stem a forecast Pounds 1.3bn shortage.
Treasury bills, maturing assistance and exchequer transactions accounted for
the lion's share of the shortfall.
In the morning, the Bank bought band one and two bank bills at 10 3/8 per
cent, and Pounds 316m in paper for resale to the market on March 9 at 10
7/16 per cent.
The afternoon found players still scrambling for paper, as the Bank again
operated in measured tranches of band one and two bank bills at 10 3/8 per
cent. Afternoon and late help totalled Pounds 714m, leaving the market
Pounds 125m short.
Overnight money was expensive yesterday, trading for the most part at about
11 1/2 per cent. By the close, it had fallen to 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent -
still on the high side, said traders.
'It is an indication that it will be another dour day tomorrow,' commented
one dealer, who added that most players were not expecting an imminent cut
in rates.
He went on to say: 'It might be a political manoeuvre, but it is not likely
in this climate.' Sterling's bottom-ranked position within the European
exchange rate mechanism appears to be the principal obstacle to a cut.
Most of the rates at the short end were similarly pessimistic. One week
money closed at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, while the one month rate was 10 5/8 -
1/2 per cent. The key three months interbank rate ended at 10 3/8 - 5/16 per
cent.
The March short sterling contract took the contrary view, finishing at
89.84. At that level the market is discounting a reduction in rates before
the contract falls due on March 16.
In Germany, call rates were steady at 9.55/65 per cent. Traders were anxious
that call money could approach the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent, if the
Bundesbank did not provide enough liquidity in this week's round of
securities repurchase agreements.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Bulls ignore intervention on Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENT remained bullish on the dollar, in spite of attempts by the
Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan to weaken the US currency in the early
hours of yesterday morning, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Traders said the intervention had offered buying opportunities at the
expense of the D-Mark, among other currencies. They speculated that a large
buying order from the Middle East, believed to be the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, had helped the dollar to recover some of the ground lost through
intervention.
The actions from the US and Japanese central banks at 4.40 GMT pushed the
dollar from Friday's close of Y128 to Y126.70 at the London opening.
However, the US unit ignored attempts from Japanese officials to talk it as
low as Y123 to Y125, and it closed at Y126.95 in London.
Mr Peter Luxton, a senior economist at Barclays, said: 'Unless they
intervene again, it is unlikely they will be able to talk it down to that
level.' However, the central banks' actions had resulted in a more cautious
approach to dollar/yen trade. 'There is a reluctance to push the dol-lar up
too rapidly,' said Mr Luxton. Dollar trade was also said to have been muted
as a result of the US public holiday.
There was no reluctance in dollar/D-Mark trade, which saw the German unit
weaken from DM1.6117 at the opening in London to a close of DM1.6230.
Comments from Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger that Germany was
not likely to raise rates in the near term made the currency a prime target,
said traders.
The market for D-Mark/yen trade had also been quite active, said Mr Luxton.
The D-Mark weakened in tandem with the dollar early yester-day morning, and
closed at Y78.21, compared with Y78.44 on Friday.
The D-Mark held last week's gains against the Swiss franc, to close
unchanged at 90.14 centimes. Traders suggested that the franc would fall as
low as 91 to 92 centimes in the near term, as it was unlikely that any help
would be forthcoming from the Swiss National Bank.
Sterling finished unaltered against the D-Mark, and remained glued to the
floor of the European exchange rate mechanism. Economists said sterling's
position was more a problem for the Spanish than for the Bank of England.
The UK currency stood at just 39 per cent of its allowed divergence from the
central Ecu rate, while the peseta was at 70 per cent.
Economists also dismissed the possibility of an imminent cut, even as little
as a quarter of a point reduction, in UK interest rates.
The pound's resistance in the foreign exchange markets had so far been the
result of a dollar focus. The danger was that if the authorities did lower
rates soon, sterling would no longer be ignored.
The peseta continued to hold the lead in the ERM. It closed steady against
the German unit, at Pta 62.70 per D-Mark.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Little to
laugh about in UK agriculture - At last week's NFU annual meeting farmers
were not in the mood for jokes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were few laughs at the annual general meeting of the National Farmers'
Union in London last week. The 600 to 700 delegates representing the farmers
of England and Wales were too preoccupied with the sorry state of their
industry for there to be much humour.
Indeed, in case there were any doubts about the extent of the problems, they
were spelled out early on in the proceedings by Mr David Naish, the union's
president. The long-term decline in farm incomes, he said, had now led to a
situation where 35 people were leaving the land in Britain each day, that is
12,000 a year. This could not go on, he concluded.
Nevertheless, there were lighter moments at the meeting. One came during a
debate on the need for better marketing of farm produce. The NFU had, in
fact, launched a new initiative entitled Food from the Countryside late last
year to encourage and assist farmers who were prepared to enter into
collaborative ventures (co-operative is a dirty word in farm circles these
days because there have been so many business failures in the sector) to
market their produce to the supermarkets.
Commenting on the logo adopted for the scheme, which dominated the stage at
Kensington Town Hall, where the meeting was held, one delegate thought the
stylised farmyard, the cattle on the meadow and the clear blue sky, were a
bit idealistic. But he was particularly concerned with the three birds
flying above the farm buildings.
'They may look like crows,' he said, 'but I have to tell you they are
vultures. One is called MacSharry (the European Community's agriculture
commissioner), another is called Gummer (the UK agriculture minister) and
the third is called Sainsbury (Britain's leading supermarket chain).'
It got a raucous laugh, reflecting the love-hate relationship between
farmers and both politicians and supermarkets, whose combined activities
seem to shape their lives; activities over which they feel they have little
or no control.
But the president was not so amused. He had wisely decided not to whinge and
he found the comment about vultures negative. What was needed, he said, was
a fair settlement of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade and a non-discriminatory reform of the EC's common agricultural
policy. Once those two elements were in place, efficient British farmers
would be able to hold their own against any legitimate competition and
better marketing would be one of the keys to their success.
What he implied was that instead of calling the supermarkets rude names,
farmers would do better to find ways of sharing in their prosperity. To
achieve that, it was necessary for producers to group together to provide
the enormous quantities and high quality that the supermarkets demanded.
Few individual farmers, whose businesses were tiny in comparison with the
multiples, could hope to go it alone. Some sort of joint venture involving
the supermarkets was essential.
Then came the second joke. It was the one about the hen and the pig who met
to discuss the joint promotion of the great British breakfast. As the talks
progressed, the pig began to have doubts. It gradually became clear to him
that while the hen might do well out of their partnership, his commitment
would be total and final. Too often, said that speaker, the farmers' role in
joint marketing initiatives was analogous with that of the pig.
Furthermore, there were real fears that British food producers might be at
an unfair disadvantage when it came to competing with imports. Even the
prime minister, who made a surprise visit to the meeting, confessed himself
unsure if the same levels of safety and standards of animal welfare that
could be guaranteed for British farm production could honestly be given for
food coming from abroad.
The point was taken up again during a party political forum in which
agriculture spokesmen for the Conservatives, the Labour Party and the
Liberal Democrats explained their policies for farming in advance of the
Election. Mr David Curry, minister of state for agriculture, accepted the
proposition that the standards imposed in the UK may be higher than those in
force in some other EC countries. 'However, EC legislation means that we
cannot ban European food coming to Britain.'
Ms Sue MacGregor, presenter of the BBC's Today radio programme, who chaired
the forum as a consumer of food, was visibly shocked at the admission and
the minister tried to allay her fears by saying that his ministry officials
monitored quite a lot of it and that if any were found to contain chemical
residues or bacteria harmful to health it would be refused entry. Ms
MacGregor did not appear totally convinced.
All of which seemed to add weight to the growing arguments for more British
food to be home produced. At present, UK farmers supply some 70 per cent of
the food that can be produced in the British climate and there is a food
trade gap of about Pounds 6bn.
Reducing that gap would clearly be good for the balance of payments and the
supermarkets have expressed themselves keen to move further in that
direction. But not all the way. Mr Tom Vyner, joint managing director of
Sainsbury's, made it clear to the meeting that 'the purchase of foods from
abroad is part of a competitive process. It is skilful buying that keeps
down prices. . . and that plays a cardinal role in our trading policy.'
On my way back to Norfolk on the train, I read in a farming magazine that
one of Mr Vyner's competitors, Tesco, had already demonstrated its
commitment to competitive buying by purchasing Irish and New Zealand lamb.
Since the EC variable premium ended in December, British open market lambs
are too dear, a spokesman is quoted as saying, 'so we have to look
elsewhere'.
So, after extolling the virtues of fresh English lamb for the last few
years, an excellent example of marketing and adding value, Tesco has
apparently abandoned the quality image in favour of selling at the lowest
price. Doubtless, all the other supermarkets will be forced to follow suit
or risk losing sales, and UK sheep farmers' returns will presumably once
again fall into loss.
It is hardly surprising, then, that some farmers are a little cynical about
the current rash of official recommendations to enter into long-term
arrangements with one another and the big buyers in order to improve their
marketing in the face of disappearing guarantees from Brussels. They feel
that the forces ranged against them are so strong and so prone to change the
rules at short notice that those jokes they crack about their plight are not
even meant to be funny - merely ironic.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scotland's salmon farmers lift
output 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH salmon farming industry, which last year suffered from low
prices and experienced several bankruptcies, increased its output during the
year by 25 per cent to 40,600 tonnes of salmon. However production this year
is expected to be static or decline by up to 7 per cent.
The scale of the production increase, revealed by the Scottish Office,
surprised farmers gathered in Glasgow for the annual Scottish fish farm
conference and exhibition.
The salmon farmers were also digesting last week's announcement by Unilever,
the UK-Dutch food and consumer products group, that it wants to sell its
subsidiary Marine Harvest, the largest salmon producer in Scotland,
accounting for nearly a quarter of production.
Salmon prices were low last year mainly because of over-production and
dumping in the EC market by Norway, which produces four times as much as
Scotland. Because salmon farming operates with a three-year production
cycle, farmers cannot adjust production to market conditions.
Last November the EC imposed a minimum price on imports from Norway, and
Norway took steps to reduce its surplus. Aquastar, a seafood subsidiary of
British Petroleum, agreed to dispose of 32,000 tonnes of frozen salmon in
markets outside the EC, Japan and the US.
With both Norway and Scotland reducing the number of smolts (young salmon)
being transferred to cages in the sea for maturing, salmon prices are
expected to recover over the next year. Mr Donald MacRae of TSB Bank
Scotland told the conference that whereas in 1991 world supply of farmed
salmon had outrun demand by 44,000 tonnes, this year there would be a
shortfall of 13,000 tonnes, rising to 64,000 tonnes by 1995.
The announcement of the sale of Marine Harvest surprised many people in the
Scottish fish farming industry. The company was a pioneer of salmon farming
in Scotland and Unilever's decision to pull out made some farmers question
whether the industry had a good long-term future.
Mr David McCarthy, Marine Harvest's chairman, said that Unilever was selling
the company along with other agribusiness interests to concentrate on core
activities.
Marine Harvest lost Pounds 15m in 1990 but its financial performance
improved sharply last year with lower fish mortality and improved
environmental management.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber agreement at risk,
claims EIU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL rubber agreement has been put at risk by the failure to
agree a cut in price support levels, the Economist Intelligence Unit says,
writes David Blackwell.
One of the strengths of the agreement, which operates through a buffer
stock, has been that it confines itself to price stabilisation and does not
try to give long-term support to prices - a commitment which has brought
about the collapse of most international commodity agreements to date, the
EIU says in its latest World Commodity Forecasts.
Producers are understandably dismayed at the low level of prices, which have
fallen 'almost to the 170.6 cents a kilo of the 1985 disaster year in
current terms and well below it in real value'. But if the buffer stock is
taken up to the maximum level of 550,000 tonnes while there is still no
upturn in demand in sight, the agreement and the buffer stock could be
threatened, together with a more serious collapse of natural rubber prices.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uzbekistan cottons on to
marketing opportunities - A farm sector that is looking forward to reaping
the benefits of the break from centralised control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK IN the pre-putsch days of the Soviet Union, the word cotton used to sum
up everything that Uzbekistan felt was wrong about its relationship with
Moscow.
Cotton, Uzbeks claimed, was not only responsible for the region's disastrous
ecological problems - most notably the drying up of the huge Aral Sea
because of over intensive cotton monoculture - but also the source of
Uzbekistan's poverty. Under the old system of centralised planning,
Uzbekistan's rich cotton crop was almost entirely controlled from Moscow,
where the central authorities decided how much cotton would be planted,
where it would be sold and at what prices.
But now change is afoot. In the wake of its August independence declaration,
Uzbekistan has seized control of its cotton production and is already laying
plans to sally forth into the international export markets.
Uzbekistan currently produces two thirds of the overall cotton crop of the
former Soviet Union, or 5m tonnes of raw fibre a year. Under the old
centralised system, less than 10 per cent of Uzbekistan's cotton was
actually spun and woven in the republic, the bulk of it being sent to
textile mills elsewhere, notably Russia.
Similarly, although the Soviet Union had previously exported between 500,000
and 750,000 tonnes of cotton a year, very little of the hard currency profit
found its way back to Uzbekistan.
Now however, the Uzbeks are determined to control their cotton exports
themselves. 'We intend to trade cotton like any normal country, for the good
of Uzbekistan,' explains Mr Anvar Makhmudov, chairman of the Uzbek
government's economic committee.
Uzbek economists refuse to reveal at the moment how much cotton they
actually plan to export this year - or indeed how much they are already
selling abroad - for fear of depressing world cotton prices.
But nevertheless, the leadership is now buzzing with a host of cotton-based
schemes designed to boost the Uzbek economy and allow the republic to
develop its own textile production.
Raw cotton is being offered - along with Uzbekistan's gold - as a guarantee
for foreign investors wishing to invest in Uzbekistan. Although this has
been conducted on an ad hoc basis so far, an American-Soviet joint venture,
Sibir, which is itself now trading in cotton, is currently working with the
Central Uzbek Bank to establish a full legal framework for this, according
to Mr Victor Fishman, Sibir's Tashkent-based director.
The Uzbek government also has plans to start trading on international
commodity exchanges, such as the Liverpool exchange, in addition to the
direct barter deals that are already being arranged to bring in a limited
supply of technology, consumer goods and badly-needed grain into the
republic.
According to Mr Makhmudov, deals have already been signed with Hungarian and
other East European countries to exchange an undisclosed quantity of cotton
for nearly 2m tonnes of grain before the end of the year. With the breakdown
of inter-republic trade links and the poor soviet grain harvest, supplies of
grain to Uzbekistan from Russia and the Ukraine have fallen dramatically.
'We look on our cotton as a strategic reserve which we can use to bring
essential products into Uzbekistan,' says Mr Safayev, who says that he hopes
that cotton will provide one of the main bargaining chips in Uzbekistan's
negotiations with Russia - not least because of the large number of Russians
employed in Russia's textile factories, which have previously depended on
supplies of Central Asian cotton.
But in spite of all these plans, so far relatively little seems to have
changed for the cotton farmers themselves. The Uzbek government says that it
intends to privatise limited quantities of land and - somewhat
unrealistically - reduce the land under cotton cultivation from 70 per cent
to 40 per cent of the arable land. They intend to replace it with grain and
vegetable cultivation, to reduce the disastrous ecological effects of the
previous cotton monoculture.
But, so far, nearly all cotton cultivation remains in the hands of the
collective and state farms, who are working, as before, to a fixed cotton
plan - now determined not by Moscow, but instead by the government in
Tashkent.
Under one set of the frequently changing regulations, the farms are forced
to sell 95 per cent of their planned cotton to the state, at a fixed price
that is still considerably lower than world market prices. The remaining 5
per cent, along with any cotton harvested in excess of the plan, can be sold
freely, either through direct barter deals with enterprises in other soviet
republics to obtain scarce consumer goods, or on the new commodity exchanges
that have recently been set up in Tashkent to deal in cotton.
As the cotton prices on these exchanges are up to three times higher than
the official government prices, it seems that many farms have been
increasingly resisting the Tashkent government's state orders and quietly
selling a growing proportion of their cotton on these exchanges and through
direct barter deals with enterprise in other Soviet republics.
Similar checks exist on the export of cotton. Individual farms can only sell
their cotton abroad through the official, Uzbek government-backed, cotton
trading associations. According to one set of regulations, for example, any
cotton export deal over 1,000 tonnes has to be endorsed by the Uzbek
president himself.
'It still takes a long time to get cotton out - and it's virtually
impossible without good government connections,' commented a foreign cotton
dealer in Tashkent.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aborigines fail to block
ADollars 500m iron ore project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN federal government has removed one of the major barriers to
the ADollars 500m (USDollars 375m) iron ore project of the CRA subsidiary,
Hamersley Iron, at Marandoo, in Western Australia.
The government has rejected an application by the Karinji aboriginal tribe
to block the project under the federal Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act.
Mr Robert Tickner, the federal minister for aboriginal affairs, said he was
not satisfied that the mining project was a serious threat to aboriginal
heritage, as required by the Act.
Hamersley Iron will now have to pass the state environmental regulations of
Western Australia before the project can finally proceed. A company official
yesterday said the decision was due in 20 weeks and that he was optimistic
that the project would get the state government's approval.
Mr Tickner's decision is the latest in a series of recent moves that seem to
indicate the government's desire to offset the negative effects of its
blocking of the Coronation Hill gold and platinum mine in June last year.
Late last year Mr Tickner declined to use the Aboriginal Heritage Act to
block Dominion Mining's ADollars 350m nickel project at Yakabindie, also in
Western Australia. However, the project is still delayed by an appeal
against the state government's approval lodged by aboriginal groups with the
Western Australian Supreme Court.
The Coronation Hill ban had reduced industry confidence in Australian mining
investments, with local companies threatening to shift substantial
exploration budgets overseas.
Last week, the Coronation Hill joint venturers, led by New Crest Mining,
filed a High Court action challenging the validity of the government plan.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: World sugar market 'at the
crossroads'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD sugar market is at the crossroads, forcing many producers to
review their sugar policies in the light of changing international trade
patterns, the Gatt, and other trade liberalisation issues, according to the
latest sugar report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house.
Should the Gatt talks be successful, cuts in support mechanisms by 1999
'should accelerate the fall in the EC's net exports as marginal producers
fail to cover their average production costs. The same argument applies to
some of the high cost/less efficient producers in the US.'
This will open up new opportunities for many producers in Africa and the
Caribbean, but they will need to examine their long-term cost structure and
efficiency. Man points out that under preferential access to the US and EC
markets, their production costs and efficiency deteriorated to the extent
that some have failed even to meet their quota allocations.
The increase in international trade will not, however, increase the
transparency of the market. The uncertainty of Russsia's effective imports,
Cuba's exports and the pattern of trade elsewhere in eastern Europe have
'turned the clock back some 40 years to a time when information about import
demand and export availabiltiy was lacking'.
Meanwhile sugar prices - which recently fell below 8 cents a lb - are
expected to come under further pressure as exportable surpluses come on to
the market from Brazil, Cuba, Thailand and the EC.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'No reason' for LME prices,
says analyst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS WERE using confusion over Russian metal exports as a cover to
squeeze the London Metal Exchange aluminium and nickel markets, some
analysts suggested yesterday. This was after the LME nickel price jumped to
its highest level for six months, while aluminium edged up to a seven-month
peak.
'This is crazy. There is no reason for prices to be at this level,' said Mr
Robin Bhar, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez
group. He said metal consumers were staying out of the market and, with more
than 1m tonnes of aluminium and 17,000 tonnes of nickel in LME stocks,
'no-one could claim there were shortages'.
Mr Bhar pointed out that the contango (premium for three-month over cash
metal) for aluminium and nickel had narrowed sharply. He added: 'The LME
should nip this potential technical squeeze in the bud.'
Meanwhile, traders said the Russian government, under pressure from
producers, had cut the new export duty on metals from about 500 to 290 Ecus
(Pounds 206) a tonne. Metal sold for funds to buy essential raw materials
might be entirely exempt from duty.
This would help Russian aluminium exporters, it was suggested, because much
of their metal was sold to purchase raw materials. However, nickel was sold
mainly for foreign currency and producers were having difficulty. Reuter
reported Raznoimport, the Russian trading company, as saying that Russian
commercial banks were prepared to finance pre-payments of nickel export
duties but wanted to charge 60 per cent annual interest.
Fund buying lifted three-month nickel prices to Dollars 8,245 a tonne at one
stage yesterday. By the close it had slipped to Dollars 8,207, up Dollars
52.50 from Friday, while cash nickel was up Dollars 165 to Dollars 8,195.
Three-month aluminium reached Dollars 1,340 a tonne before closing at
Dollars 1,322.50, up Dollars 11. Cash aluminium ended at Dollars 1,297, up
Dollars 9.50.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Warrants launched on four UK
water stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers has launched 10m put and 10m call warrants on a basket of
four UK water stocks, designed to allow investors to take a view on the
outcome of the UK general election and its effect on the stock market.
The utility companies are considered the most politically sensitive stocks,
since a Labour victory could squeeze profits as a result of a tighter
regulatory environment. Salomon said trading in water company stocks has
been subdued due to concern about the outcome of the election.
The call and put warrants allow investors not only to take bullish or
bearish views on the stocks, but also to hedge their portfolios against a
fall in the price of the stocks without selling existing holdings.
The four water stocks in the basket - Anglian, North-West, Severn Trent and
Thames - were chosen because they are components of the FT-SE 100 index.
Their weighting in the basket is close to their index weighting to
facilitate the use of the warrants by fund managers which track the index.
Only Thames Water is listed as a traded option on the London Traded Options
Market.
The US-style warrants can be exercised at any time during their one-year
life.
Dealers said several banks were attempting to design investment products
based on the uncertainty over the election. Salomon, which recently
announced its intention to expand its UK equity derivatives business, plans
to launch further election-led products.

JAPAN Airlines (JAL), the Japanese national carrier, plans to increase the
size of its fleet by a third to 134 aircraft by 1996-97, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
This forms part of the airline's five-year business plan which it updates
every year and under which it aims for sales of Y1,600bn (Dollars 13bn) in
the year starting April 1 1996, against Y1,120bn in 1990-91.
It plans to increase its fleet to 110 aircraft by end-1992-93 with the
introduction of 15 aircraft and retirement of eight-year-old aircraft. To
cope with a shortage of pilots, JAL plans to train and use about 300 foreign
pilots by 1994-95.
JAL plans to expand its overall business by 6 per cent a year during the
five-year period. It wants to expand domestic passenger operations by 9 per
cent, international passenger operations by 6 per cent and international
cargo operations by 4 per cent.
Among its business management goals, JAL aims to secure a one-third share of
the domestic passenger market and strengthen cost competitiveness.
In spite of a current downturn in air transport both at home and abroad, the
airline expects demand to pick by 1993-94 at the latest.
As part of JAL's business plan, the airline plans to open at least four
domestic routes from Osaka and at least five domestic routes from other
regional cities.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Profits plunge 60% at Fletcher
Challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in first-half profits and hefty dividend cut are revealed by
Fletcher Challenge, New Zealand's largest industrial company with forestry,
energy and construction interests.
Net profits for the six months to end-December plunged 60 per cent to
NZDollars 151.6m (USDollars 82.4m), or 8.6 cents a share, from 1989's
corresponding NZDollars 376.3m, or 27.9 cents. Sales declined by 7.4 per
cent to NZDollars 6.28bn from NZDollars 6.78bn.
As a result of the fall, the half-year dividend is being sliced from 11.5
cents a share to 7 cents.
The latest figures are after extraordinary losses of NZDollars 32m, mainly
from writedowns on the value of properties held by a construction unit.
Results in the previous year included extraordinary gains of NZDollars 52m.
Weak prices for pulp and newsprint caused Fletcher's core forestry division
to record a loss of NZDollars 79m in the period, down from a profit of
NZDollars 76m a year earlier. The 72 per cent-owned unit, Fletcher Challenge
Canada, has been particularly hurt by an oversupply of newsprint on the
North American market and weak demand.
In contrast, earnings from the energy division rose 8 per cent to NZDollars
196m from NZDollars 181m, reflecting increased production from operations in
New Zealand and in Canada.
Profit from the farm-servicing division, which includes its Rural Bank unit,
rose 42 per cent to NZDollars 51m from NZDollars 36m. But earnings of the
construction division, affected by weak market conditions both in New
Zealand and in North America, fell 73 per cent to NZDollars 17m from
NZDollars 63m.
Prospects for the year to end-June are clouded. Fletcher Challenge predicts
earnings of about NZDollars 300m, down 46 per cent from 1990-91's NZDollars
555m, which in turn were 16 per cent below those of the previous year.
The directors said weak markets in most of its products were likely through
the second half but they expected a substantial cyclical recovery in
earnings in the next few years.
The company plans to sell assets worth NZDollars 750m in the current year.
It has already raised NZDollars 500m of that target so far in the period.
Assets sold include two sawmills in British Columbia, a 45 per cent stake in
Quebec-based forest products company Donohue-St Fleicien, and several
properties.
Fletcher Challenge's total liabilities stood at NZ3.7bn at end-June last
year.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA begins its largest privatisation and flotation sale in two weeks
with Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned power generating and distribution
monopoly.
The Malaysian government's offer of 23 per cent, or 685m shares, of the
group, will draw nearly MDollars 3.1bn (USDollars 1.2bn) from the equity
market compared with a total of MDollars 3.8bn raised in rights issues last
year.
At MDollars 4.50 a share Tenaga is valued at MDollars 13.5bn, compared with
a total of about MDollars 150bn in market capitalisation for the existing
300 or so companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.
Underwriting the Tenaga sale are 48 of the country's 50 stockbrokers and all
its dozen merchant banks.
Group pre-tax profit for the year to August is forecast to increase by 54
per cent to MDollars 1.1bn from MDollars 692m last year, and a further 17
per cent to MDollars 1.2bn in 1993-94. Tenaga's shares are priced at about
11 times earnings.
In the distribution of the Tenaga sale, Malaysian and foreign investors will
be allo- cated 44 per cent of shares available; employees will share about 3
per cent. Government-approved Bumiputra or Malay investors and their
investment institutions will be allotted the balance of 360m shares.
Tenaga has an installed generating capacity of 5,000 MW and supplies to 3m
consumers, half of them in the industrial sector and 30 per cent in
commerce. It has assets of MDollars 14.8bn, and plans to invest MDollars
37.7bn for the rest of the decade.
Tenaga's sell-off follows the 30 per cent offer for Proton, the state-owned
car maker, last month.
The sale of 25 per cent of Telekom, the telecommunications monopoly, raised
MDollars 2.5bn in 1990, but its share value has since doubled to MDollars
10.
Guthrie, a Singapore construction group, is offering Dollars 1.68 a share
for a controlling stake in its associate L &amp; M Group Investments. Guthrie
intends to place out shares in excess of 51 per cent through Smith New Court
Securities, the brokerage, and Nomura Singapore, the merchant bank.

ECI TELECOM, one of Israel's fastest-growing companies, posted a 77 per cent
increase in net profits in 1991 to Dollars 27.4m as demand for its
capacity-enhancing voice and data circuit multiplying equipment rose sharply
in its main North American and European markets, in spite of recession.
ECI, which like a growing number of successful Israeli high-technology
companies is quoted on Nasdaq in the US, has managed spectacular growth
since the late 1980s when it rebounded from a period of losses by shifting
away from defence to civilian products, which account for the majority of
sales.
Sales last year, most overseas, were a shade under Dollars 114m, up 53 per
cent over 1990 and more than twice the Dollars 53m reached in 1989. Mr David
Rubner, the chief executive, said a feature of 1991 had been ECI's
penetration of eastern European markets. Sales to state telecommunications
concerns in eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria accounted for
about 15 per cent of the total, he said.
The company, whose main shareholders are Israel's Clal group and Mr Charles
Bronfman, the Canadian investor, is offering a two-for-one share split as
dividend to increase share liquidity.
Koor Industries, the conglomerate rescued last year by its creditors from a
crippling debt burden, is planning to follow the example of ECI and similar
companies by floating roughly one-third of its telecommunications and
electronics subsidiary Tadiran on New York markets, spurning the
narrow-based Tel Aviv stock exchange.
Tadiran, signalling a Dollars 30m net profit in 1991 after a period of heavy
losses, was recently valued by Israeli consultant banks at between Dollars
280m and Dollars 330m.
Koor is shortly to pick the main underwriting bank from a shortlist of
Merrill Lynch, Shearson Leaman, First Boston and Kidder Peabody.
Mr Benjamin Gaon, Koor chief executive, remarked that times had changed
since Koor's US creditors had threatened it with liquidation.
'It is amazing. This time they are chasing us to do business with us, not
the other way around.'

CANON, the Japanese precision instrument-maker, yesterday announced a 3.9
per cent rise in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y76.1bn (Dollars 618.7m)
for the year ended last December, thanks to continued strong sales of its
computer printers using new bubble jet and laser technology, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The announcement comes at a time when profits at Japanese high-technology
companies are being squeezed by sluggish exports and lower profit margins.
Sales rose 15.3 per cent to Y1,073.4bn from Y931.30bn. Canon said sales of
its office automation machinery, including its computer printers, which rose
13 per cent to Y793bn, helped sustain profits. Camera sales rose 25 per cent
to Y220.7bn. Exports rose 18 per cent to Y812.7bn, while domestic sales rose
7 per cent to Y260.6bn.
Canon suffered exchange rate losses due to the yen's appreciation against
the dollar, but interest on deposits rose 18.4 per cent to Y25.7bn on higher
interest rates and a rise in short-term funds due to warrant-bond issues
worth Y100bn.

STORAGE Technology, a US manufacturer of data storage sub-systems for
high-performance computers, announced yesterday that it planned to buy Edata
Scandinavia, its Scandinavian distributor, for Dollars 75m in cash.
Edata, which employs 194 people, had 1990 revenues of around Dollars 68.3m,
about three-quarters of it derived from Storage Technology products. It
operates in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway
and Sweden. Storage Technology has European marketing operations in Austria,
France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the UK.
Mr Harris Ravine, Storage's executive vice-president for Europe, said the
acquisition would increase its direct presence on the continent. He added
that Edata in the past had concentrated on mainframe products, but in the
last two years it diversified into mid-range markets, which was in line with
Storage Technology's strategy.
The US company has reached an agreement with key Edata shareholders which
commits to its offer series A shares representing 70.4 per cent of the
votes, and it is making a public offer for the remainder of the equity.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Assistance for Maxwell pensioners kept to
minimum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is not prepared to do more than meet its statutory
requirement to pay the state guaranteed minimum pension to members of the
various Maxwell company pension schemes, Mr Tony Newton, social security
secretary, told a Commons select committee.
Mr Newton said he and representatives of the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Treasury met 10 days ago with trustees and administrators
of the Maxwell schemes and told them that pensioners would receive the
guaranteed minimum if pension fund assets had disappeared.
'I don't see a possibility of going beyond that,' he said.
He added neither the trustees of Mirror Group Newspapers nor the
administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation had discussed their
plans to wind up their respective schemes. 'Those concerned had a divided
opinion on the effects of winding up.'
Last Friday, MGN announced it would wind up its existing pension scheme and
begin a new one, paving the way for the government to supplement the fund by
providing the guaranteed minimum for members.
Meanwhile, Mr Newton ducked MPs' questions about the type of pension law
reform - if any - under consideration by the government. 'The government's
position is that we need to see the report of the Serious Fraud Office
before we can decide what issues need to be addressed, he said.
Separately, Mr Newton said that the Department of Social Security and the
Occupational Pensions Board were preparing rules to improve the information
which must be disclosed to pension fund members.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Agreement near for Macdonald Publishing
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agreement in principle concerning the sale of Macdonald Publishing, the
loss-making publishing venture of Maxwell Communication Corporation, is
imminent. Mr Anthony Lomas, of Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, is
hoping to announce a potential purchaser later this week.
Considerable interest has been shown in Macdonald since it was placed in
administration by the High Court in January.
All the signs point to Boston publisher Little Brown, Headline and Macmillan
of the UK being among the serious contenders as the bidding reaches its
final stages.
Macdonald's publications take in Catherine Cookson, the Noddy books of Enid
Blyton and literary biography. It owed MCC about Pounds 33m and had been
losing some Pounds 1m a year.
Mr Lomas denied reports yesterday that Macdonald had been losing authors
because of the uncertainty and emphasised that it was unlikely that arrears
of royalty payments to authors would not be met.
Despite the disruption caused by the collapse of the Maxwell empire,
Macdonald has been trading normally and was virtually up to date with its
February printing schedule.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon denies pursuit by Maxwell
administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETROCON, the group making a hostile bid for James Wilkes, the Midlands
engineering company, yesterday reacted angrily to the suggestion in a Sunday
newspaper that administrators to company owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell
had initiated legal action against Mr Colin Robinson, Petrocon's chairman.
Petrocon's share price fell 11 per cent to 40p following the Independent on
Sunday's story, reducing the value of its all share bid by 10 per cent to
Pounds 31.8m.
A solicitor for Mr Robinson said he was considering legal action against the
newspaper. He said that the litigation against Mr Robinson and others had
been started by Mr Maxwell in March 1990 and assumed by the administrators,
Arthur Andersen, when Hollis Industries went into administration last
December.
Suggestions that administrators had launched the litigation, rather than
inherited it, were potentially defamatory. They suggested that Mr Robinson
faced a new and more serious case than the one begun by Mr Maxwell two years
ago.
The case revolves around the sale in 1988 of a license held by Locktronics,
a subsidiary of Hollis Industries - which Mr Robinson and others controlled
 -to Beverly, a company Mr Robinson also controlled.
Mr Robinson said the 1988 sale had been included in board minutes but he had
made a technical violation of the Companies Act by not having a resolution
approving the sale voted on by shareholders.
The row over Mr Maxwell's two year old case against Mr Robinson overshadowed
the posting of Petrocon's offer document to Wilkes shareholders.
Petrocon argues that it has the management team to sort out Wilkes's
financial problems without having to resort to fire sales to deal with its
high level of debt. Wilkes had gearing of 108 per cent at December 1990.
Mr Robinson also believes the closure of Wilkes's country house head office
and its helicopter company plus the removal of the current board will save
Pounds 1.5m in expenses each year.

FT  18 FEB 92 / City discount house hit by Pounds 24m losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION DISCOUNT, the City discount house, yesterday reported heavy losses and
the departure of Mr Graeme Gilchrist, its chief executive.
The company lost Pounds 23.6m in 1991, following a sharp deterioration of
the core discounting business. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.8m the
year before.
Union's first loss on its discounting operations in 29 years highlights the
problems facing London's nine discount houses through which the Bank of
England channels liquidity to the commercial banking system and influences
interest rates.
Following announcement of the losses, Mr Gilchrist is to take early
retirement as chief executive and his duties will temporarily be taken by Mr
Robin Herbert, chairman.
Mr Herbert blamed the Pounds 2.91m losses in discount house operations,
compared with a Pounds 11.06m profit the previous year, on very short-term
interest rates which had remained higher than three-month rates throughout
the year.
The predictable downward direction of interest rates since sterling joined
the European exchange rate mechanism had also reduced discount houses'
opportunity to deal profitably, said Mr Derek Lyons, managing director of
Union's discount house operations.
Mr Herbert said that a return to a normal yield curve - with short-term
rates lower than longer-term rates - would improve discount house
profitability.
Union Discount's main diversification, into asset financing, cost the
company Pounds 16.25m at the operating level.
Most of these losses came from Sabre Leasing, which provides lease finance
to customers of office equipment suppliers.
Union also made an exceptional charge of Pounds 9.47m, most of which covered
the write-down of an Edinburgh building taken as security for its one
property development loan in 1988.
The company's equity and gilt-edged marketmaking division, another of the
diversifications, increased its profits from Pounds 2.27m to Pounds 3.90m
while money management division profits fell 6 per cent to Pounds 1.17m.
Union Discount is paying a final dividend of 2p per share for a total of
13.5p against 35p a year earlier. Losses were 98.9p a share against profits
of 57.02p.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Dalgety ahead 4 per cent as market share increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DALGETY, the foods and agri-business company, raised pre-tax profits by 4
per cent to Pounds 53.8m in the six months to December 31, following
increases in its share of the snacks and pet-foods markets and gains from
corporate rationalisation.
Sir Peter Carey, chairman, said the result, compared with Pounds 51.7m last
time, was encouraging in the present economic climate. He forecast continued
growth in consumer foods and ingredients.
However, Mr Maurice Warren, chief executive, said he expected little change
in economic conditions before the middle of the year.
'The upturn we were all hoping for in late autumn has not followed through.
We are conditioning our manufacturing units to the idea that recovery will
be very flat,' he said.
Mr Warren ruled out bidding for British Petroleum's nutrition businesses or
for Unilever's agribusiness operations recently put up for sale. Though
Dalgety regarded agribusiness as a core activity, it saw foods as the main
focus of future growth.
Trading profit on consumer foods rose to Pounds 27.8m compared with Pounds
23.7m a year earlier on the strength of a strong performance by the Golden
Wonder snacks business, which increased its share of a flat UK crisps
market.
Spillers pet foods increased volumes by 7 per cent in spite of a decrease in
the overall market.
Margins on baking mixes improved, because of rationalisation following the
acquisition of Greens.
Homepride benefited from the strength of the cooking sauces market, which
grew by 22 per cent in value and 8 per cent in volume.
Trading profit on food ingredients of Pounds 11.8m, against Pounds 11.6m the
previous year, was held back by difficult conditions in milling and baking
and by the weakness of catering.
Martin-Brower, the US food distribution company, increased profit to Pounds
6.8m, compared with Pounds 6.6m, helped by favourable exchange rates, but
tough trading conditions cut agribusiness profits to Pounds 11.9m from
Pounds 12.2m.
Total turnover increased to Pounds 2.01bn from Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.84bn
when adjusted for disposals). Earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 18p as
against 16.9p, aided by a reduced tax rate, while net borrowings fell to
Pounds 79m from Pounds 125m. The interim dividend is raised to 7.5p from
7.15p.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Wm Low warns on full-year profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM LOW, the Scottish super-market group, alarmed the City yesterday by
warning that full-year profits would fall below last year's Pounds 23.6m.
The announcement sparked a 38p fall to 224p in the company's share price.
Dundee-based Low blamed the recession for a fall in sales volumes and
operating margins and the financial strains imposed by its ambitious store
opening programme.
The group, which trades from 66 supermarkets, said sales volumes from
comparable trading space were some 4 per cent to 5 per cent lower than in a
good year but that this decline had had a disproportionate impact on
margins.
Mr Jim Millar, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Across the board we are
still seeing double-digit sales increases on last year including our new
stores. But we tightened gross margins quite deliberately with our price
freeze last year and have now seen a further tightening because of the sales
situation and the rising costs in some of our older stores.'
Low said it was confident that the benefits of the store opening programme
would eventually flow through as planned.
The company opened six stores in the first half of the year which incurred
heavy promotional costs, but they are expected to contribute strongly to
profits in the second half.
Low is not the only food retailer to feel the effects of the recession.
Gateway and Tesco have recently announced plans to reduce their cost bases
by trimming staff numbers.
Mr Millar said it might be necessary to 'tweak' labour costs in some of its
stores to align them more closely with sales levels. 'But we have no
programme of saying 'let's go out and take Pounds 1m out of our personnel
bill',' he said.
He added that there was no connection between the profits warning and the
abrupt announcement last week of the departure of Mr Colin Mitchell as
managing director after the company had been 'unable to resolve the future
role he would play in the organisation'.
Mr Mitchell had been seen by many as Mr Millar's heir apparent. 'I am 61 and
the board is well aware that the succession is something that has to be
addressed,' Mr Millar said yesterday.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Musawi mourners vow revenge: Westerners advised to leave
Beirut as kidnap threat increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN embassies in Beirut yesterday advised the few hundred remaining
expatriates to leave the city in case the Israeli killing of Sheikh Abbas
Musawi, the Hizbollah leader, prompted renewed attempts by his supporters to
kidnap westerners.
Lebanese police said they had tightened security at western embassies and
other foreign interests in Beirut.
However, Iran said it expected the kidnappers holding two German hostages to
respond 'reasonably'.
The security warning came as thousands of Lebanese Shia Moslems thronged the
streets of south Beirut vowing revenge against Israel and the US for
Sunday's attack on the motorcade of Mr Musawi in which his wife,
six-year-old son and five bodyguards also died.
'Oh God, wipe Israel and America out of existence,' chanted an estimated
50,000-strong crowd which turned out, led by Sheikh Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah the spiritual leader of Hizbollah, to mourn the death of Sheikh
Musawi, secretary-general of the organisation.
Mr Musawi's deputy, Mr Naeem Qassem, told the rally: 'Do you think, enemy of
God (Israel), that you have won? No, we are waiting for you ..the earth will
shake beneath your feet.'
In southern Lebanon, Hizbollah gunners launched a wave of rocket and
artillery attacks on the 'security zone' north of the Israeli border
occupied by Israeli troops and their local militia allies. Some rockets fell
harmlessly into Israel itself. Israeli forces responded with artillery
barrages.
Lebanese army units were also reported to have been involved in the
artillery exchanges in southern Lebanon, a rare and potentially dangerous
direct confrontation with Israeli forces.
The Lebanese government, although at odds with Hizbollah which defies its
authority, called on the United Nations Security Council to discuss the
killing of Sheikh Musawi.
The European Community yesterday supported the US call for all parties to
show restraint, reflecting fears that the increase in violence could
threaten the Middle East peace talks next week. It also called for a
stronger European role in the peace process.
In a statement EC foreign ministers meeting in Lisbon urged 'all parties to
refrain from taking any action which could endanger the (current peace)
negotiations or undermine the establishment of a climate of confidence,
including the pursuit of the current settlement policy'.
The Israeli government said it would go ahead with the Washington talks, a
position already confirmed by Syria and Lebanon. The other parties involved,
Jordan and the Palestinians, have given no indication that they will reverse
earlier decisions to attend.
But in a further complication Israel confirmed it had arrested two men added
by the Palestinians to their delegation for the peace talks.
The Musawi attack followed the killing of three soldiers in Israel by
Palestinians on Friday and two retaliatory Israeli air raids on Palestinian
refugee camps in Lebanon in which at least four people died.
The attack on Mr Musawi was greeted by the Israeli government and defence
establishment as a timely re-assertion of the army's effectiveness.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government yes-terday announced it had hired Goldman Sachs, the
US investment bank, as an adviser to help attract badly needed foreign
investment to Russia.
Mr Robert Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, said he saw the bank's main
contribution as persuading companies around the world to invest in Russia.
It would also give advice on attracting venture capital to the republic.
Illustrating the dramatic turn of Russian economic policy, the US advisers
will occupy office space in the building which used to accommodate Gosplan,
the now defunct state planning agency.
Mr Rubin said that Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister, had asked Goldman
Sachs to help identify a 'relatively small number of realistic projects' in
key areas such as natural resources, consumer goods, and food processing,
and to see them through as quickly as possible.
Mr Leonid Grigoriev, chairman of the government's Foreign Investment
Committee, declined to specify how Goldman Sachs would be paid for its
services. But it is probable that the bank, which will benefit from free
publicity as well as direct access to the government and its secrets, will
not be getting cash.
Mr Grigoriev said 400 firms had competed to get the position, which was
awarded to Goldman Sachs because of its 'aggressiveness'.
He admitted, however, that there were a number of basic questions which
Moscow would have to resolve before large-scale investment would be
possible.
He said the government had not yet decided whether to use a special exchange
rate for foreign investors in the privatisation of state property. An
alternative, to prevent Russian investors from being squeezed out of the
race, was to limit the number of assets offered to foreigners. But until one
or other method was chosen, investors could not take part in the
privatisation process. He also could not say when President Boris Yeltsin
would sign a long-awaited decree on mineral rights and concessions to
foreigners in the oil industry.
Although he said the committee would be pressing for new benefits to
encourage investment, the government was divided over whether to grant
special tax exemptions at a time when its key priority was to balance the
budget and strengthen the rouble.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK and EC settle Pounds 120m funding dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government yesterday settled a long-running dispute with the European
Commission which had blocked the release of about Pounds 120m in European
Community funds for Britain's depressed coal-mining regions.
Mr Peter Lilley, Britain's trade and industry secretary, said the government
had agreed to introduce more 'transparency' into the way it accounted for
funds distributed by the European Regional Development Fund.
He told MPs that the government planned also to widen 'competition' by
allowing agencies such as British Coal Enterprises, urban development
corporations and regional development agencies to compete against local
authorities for the EC funds.
Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for regional policy, stressed yesterday
that the agreement with the British government required that EC regional
grants would be 'identified separately in expenditure programmes, and public
expenditure cover (from the UK side) will automatically be made available
for them'.
Mr Millan claimed the 'automatic' nature of this matching finance was
missing from yesterday's statement by Mr Lilley. He said the agreement they
had reached was 'very clear' and he hoped the government would abide by it
honestly. The deal, described by the Labour party as a 'humiliating
climbdown', will allow the immediate distribution of Pounds 115m from the
Community's Rechar programme to fund more than 50 projects in areas hit by
coal-mine closures. Scotland, Lancashire and Nottinghamshire are among the
main beneficiaries.
The agreement should also allow the Commission to lift a threatened block on
up to Pounds 900m of regional funds for 1992-93 for a range of projects in
depressed areas.
The dispute, the subject of fierce political exchanges at Westminster in
recent months, arose after Mr Millan demanded changes to ensure that money
allocated to Britain would represent a clear 'addition' to normal Treasury
spending and that the EC money would reach the industrially-stricken regions
at which it was targeted.
The stance taken by Brussels sparked sharp differences within the cabinet,
with Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, privately taking the
Commission's side.
Mr Lilley and the Treasury initially opposed any change in the way the EC
funds were included in the government's overall public-spending totals. But
Conservative MPs in areas denied the blocked funds had been pressing for a
settlement before the general election.

FT  18 FEB 92 / North Sea oil price falls after Opec deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices fell almost Dollars 1 a barrel yesterday amid pessimism
on the London market following the insubstantial weekend agreement by the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Geneva.
The 1m barrels a day (b/d) cut in production agreed by Opec, to about 23m
b/d, was smaller than traders had expected, and North Sea Brent crude prices
dipped from Dollars 18.40 to Dollars 17.525 a barrel in busy trading.
The agreement is set to be undermined by the reservations of the
organisation's largest producers; Saudi Arabia said it would produce more
than its allocation and Iran believed output cuts should have been deeper.
One crude trader for a Norwegian oil company said: 'The market is
questioning whether we have a firm agreement at all.'
London market traders had taken a more optimistic view of oil prices late
last week when it looked as though Opec was approaching a deal to reduce the
flow of oil by some 1.5m b/d.
'The final agreement came as a real disappointment,' said Mr Peter Gignoux,
manager of the petroleum desk at Smith Barney. 'The next few days will be
very dangerous for oil prices.'
Most Opec ministers believed the new production arrangement would at least
stabilise prices. But few were optimistic that it would push prices up
towards their target of Dollars 21 a barrel.
Traders will now be looking for signs that the producers' club can deliver
the promised cuts in output. If these are not evident in the market in the
next month, prices could collapse further.
Traders believe that the fact that Opec has scheduled its next meeting for
two months' time seems to suggest that the organisation is sceptical about
the effectiveness of its latest deal.

The speed with which Saudi Arabia and Iran distanced themselves from Opec's

By setting its next meeting as soon as April, Opec had already indicated
that it had no great confidence in the deal's staying power. But for the
Saudis to undermine it publicly, just as they appear to have done their best
to stymie agreement in the first place, was an unexpected blow. The question
is what they hoped to achieve by such an uncompromising stance. The oil
price dropped below Dollars 18 per barrel yesterday. Given the combination
of oversupply and recession, it is hard to see why it should recover.
Perhaps the only hope is that cheaper oil will stimulate demand further out.
But that seems a weak motive for shaking the cartel's foundations.

FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Dalgety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thanks mainly to its consumer products division, there is a solidity about
Dalgety these days which belies its recent history. That the group is now
firmly back in the dependable but dull category was exemplified by
yesterday's 7 per cent increase in interim earnings. Gearing is a
comfortable 35 per cent; the interest bill is more than 10 times covered.
But profits growth this year will probably be not much more than 5 per cent.
Consumer products, mainly potato crisps and pot noodles, now account for
nearly half the group's profits and are receiving the lion's share of new
investment. That should keep Dalgety's progress in the right direction.
Long-term investors will recall how the shares accurately charted the
company's decline after the mid-1970s and are doubtless hoping for a return
trip. In the meantime, the 7 per cent yield on the shares is sufficient
compensation for the patience required of them.

FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: William Low
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 15 per cent fall in William Low's share price yesterday was a harsh
reaction to a profits warning in a sector where consistent double-digit
growth is considered normal. Other food retailers will doubtless argue that
Low's problems stem from a unique combination of bad luck. Eighteen months
after its Pounds 38m rights issue, a trough in its development cycle and
one-off reorganisation costs have coincided with deep recession in its
market. The abrupt departure last week of the group's managing director will
not have helped the market's confidence.
But by next year, sales growth should accelerate afresh as new stores open
for business. Low has always grown by leaps and bounds with the occasional
stumble along the way. Assuming it makes about Pounds 20m pre-tax profit, a
maintained annual dividend would be three times covered, so the group is
unlikely to be another Asda. Other regional players such as Morrisons have
continued to perform well against the big chains, so the case for a second
tier of supermarket operators looks solid enough for the moment. All the
same, Low's problems are a reminder that even the smaller food retailers
have ambitious growth assumptions. Judging by its reaction, the market
intends to put a heavy price on any shortcomings.

FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Union Discount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Punting on short-term interest rates is inevitably risky, even for
specialists such as the discount houses. But the swing from profits of
Pounds 11m to a Pounds 3m loss from this side of Union Discount's business
raises questions about what ERM membership has done to the sector as a
whole. Union blames the inverted yield curve for its performance. That ought
to be worrying because such a curve is likely to become more common given
the need to shore up sterling against other European currencies. The
evidence, however, suggests that other discount houses were better at
reading the market than Union despite the difficult market conditions last
year. So the ERM is perhaps less of a threat than meets the eye.
Union's other problem is that leasing has singularly failed to produce the
high-quality earnings needed to offset the risks inherent in its main
business. Yesterday's statement stressed the vigour with which it has
tackled its leasing losses, but Union is still stuck with a
capital-intensive business rather than one which generates a more
appropriate steady cushion of fee income. That will take a long time to
correct. Meanwhile the shares are hardly a bargain, even though at 146p they
are at a 50 per cent discount to net assets.

FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Germany holds on tight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,541.0 (+27.1)
Thanks partly to the low oil price, Germany should avoid the 5 per cent
inflation rate which once threatened this spring. But that will be little
comfort to those awaiting a Bundesbank rate cut. Even though it denied
yesterday that wage settlements were directly linked to monetary policy, the
central bank is clearly unhappy about the 6.4 per cent settlement for
steelworkers. Worse still, January money supply figures due this week will
show a further surge in M3, putting it outside the target range for several
months to come.
Indeed, the Bundesbank looks boxed in. Even if a weakening economy were now
prompting second thoughts on monetary policy, it would be hard to find a
convincing reason for cutting rates. The hawks on its governing council
would hardly swallow the argument that credit demand has been artificially
swollen not only by unification, but also, temporarily, by companies
borrowing to offset cash flow tightness induced by the slowdown. Equally
unbeguiling are expectations of lower headline inflation from July as last
year's temporary tax increases drop out of the index. By then, US economic
recovery may be pushing up both raw material prices and the dollar, adding
to German inflationary pressures.
There is thus a real possibility that the Bundesbank may do no more for the
balance of 1992 than trim money market rates, leaving official rates
unchanged - unless, of course, it becomes really alarmed about the economy.
It currently believes that activity will revive during the second half,
fuelled partly by higher demand in the rest of Europe. Its own policies,
however, reduce the prospect of a spontaneous European recovery, while the
risk of a hard landing in Germany is growing.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Conservatives lose the election, the reason will be that Mr John
Major came to office too soon, and with too little experience behind him, to
sail free of Treasury thinking. If they win, it will be because he got
nearly everything else right. The prime minister must take the blame if he
is defeated, but even if he succeeds by a narrow margin he might ask himself
why he placed so much trust in an institution that combines the technical
abilities of Dumbo with the political sophistication of Mickey Mouse.
Step back, and you will see what I mean. Between June 1987 and October 1989,
economic policy was managed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Nigel Lawson.
The personal antipathy between them is well-known; the result was the Lawson
boom, which led to today's Treasury bust. Fate is cruel: Mr Lawson may be
partly to blame, but Mr Major cannot avoid carrying the can for the
depression that today threatens his political career. He had no experience
of high office before the 1987 election; after it, he became chief
secretary, the man responsible for the expenditure side of the budget. Then
in October 1989, he was suddenly thrust into the chancellorship.
His officials loved it. Mr Lawson had had a sufficiently high estimation of
himself to make his own mistakes; now they could hope to persuade an untried
new chancellor to make the Treasury's mistakes. Mr Major is no puppet. He
rightly determined that the overriding objective must be to reduce
inflation, which was in danger of ballooning into the higher double digits
and out of control.
At some time - then or later - he must have been presented with forecasts
that suggested that he could conquer inflation in time for an election. He
would have been assured that while unemployment might be increasing, the
recession needed to bring prices down would be over before the electorate
was asked for its verdict. Meanwhile, Mrs Thatcher's 'skittish' attitude to
Europe (the adjective is that of one of her erstwhile colleagues) had its
own disastrous effect. It took a year for Mr Major to persuade her to take
Britain into the exchange rate mechanism, but, either out of conviction or
Treasury misdirection, or both, he did so at a challengingly high rate.
Then in November 1990, as suddenly as he had become chancellor, he became
prime minister. It is a job he has handled well. He was an excellent leader
during the Gulf war. He abolished the poll tax. He invented (or developed)
the Citizen's Charter, performed excellently on the world diplomatic stage
and turned himself into the Conservatives' greatest electoral asset. What he
did not do was shake off the curse of the Treasury.
This would have been difficult, but not impossible. He could have
anticipated the What Mr Major did not do was shake off the Treasury curse
political damage likely to result from the ERM decision and tried for a
re-alignment. He might have demanded of the new chancellor, Mr Norman
Lamont, that the 1991 budget should contain the fiscal stimulus currently
expected of the 1992 budget. Perhaps he could have bought off the poll tax
without raising VAT by quite so much, taking the strain by borrowing.
He did not do any of this partly because it was not then certain that
inflation would fall away in the summer and partly as a result of a desire
to maintain the government's credibility in the markets. Anyway, the
Treasury kept forecasting that there would be a resurgence of economic
growth, perhaps in the second half of 1991, and, if not then, in the first
half of 1992 - but surely in time for a May 1992 election.
There were tremors in the autumn, but the increases in spending announced
then apply from later this year. They do not have immediate political
significance. Mr Lamont cannot be faulted for this. He is not a whizz on TV,
but he has done the job he was given, keeping his nerve and sticking to
orthodoxy. If your assumption is that the country comes first, and let
political consequences fall where they may, Mr Lamont is your man. If Mr
Major had wanted a heavyweight chancellor able to deploy deep-seated
political instincts as a check on Treasury misinformation, he could have
called on Mr Michael Heseltine. Only he would have stood a chance of
re-aligning or reflating and simultaneously finessing market reactions.
The realisation that the Treasury had led the government up a gum tree
dawned on most members of the cabinet at around Christmas time. The previous
strategy was based on false Treasury assumptions. Inflation would be down to
4 per cent or less, but the slump would not end before polling day. Nothing
could be done about it. Ministers had been so absorbed with Maastricht that
the upward creep of German interest rates came as a shock.
A campaign time-table, setting out themes for every week until Easter, had
been agreed at a November meeting of the 'political cabinet' - ministers
minus officials. Prepared by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi under the instructions of the
party chairman, Mr Christopher Patten, it was hotted up, re-submitted, and
once again agreed. The Christmas plan is the one Mr Major is now working to.
It accepts that the Tories may not be floated to victory by a rising tide of
consumer spending.
Against that, the Conservative machine, perhaps strengthened by desperation,
is looking tougher and more professional than Labour's. It had the
opposition on the run on taxation in January and it may do further damage
this week with its campaign on trade union influences on the Labour party.
The proposition to be put before the electorate is twofold -
first:(whispered) 'Under her we made a mess of things but John Major has not
put a foot wrong' and, second (shouted): 'Labour would make a worse hash of
it.' It is not an edifying theme but it is all they have. Fiscal virtue is
not always rewarded.

A spectator, convinced that all sportsmen are equal in the eyes of God,

Japan's non-tariff barriers are reaching parts which even the most
experienced foreign businessman is ignorant of.
Recently a German multinational celebrating in Tokyo had the bright idea of
presenting its 500 guests with traditional German beer mugs, complete with
pewter lid and company emblem - delicately wrapped, Japanese-style.
But, come the day of the party, no beer mugs in sight. Japanese customs had
refused entry, on the grounds that they wanted to know more about the metal
used in the lids and whether it was harmful.
Arguments that imports of such mugs were hardly an innovation cut no ice. It
took weeks for sense to prevail; by then the guests were long gone and the
company was faced with a fat postage bill to send the mug chasers.
No doubt worried about disruption to future festivities, the angry Germans
prefer to remain anonymous. Maybe they will be sticking to sake in future.

One obvious reason why John Major should call the general election on April
9 is that Margaret Thatcher will be abroad for the last week of the
campaign.
Conservative Central Office and Major have spent many hours agonising over
what role she should play, aware of the explosive potential of any
disloyalty, intentional or otherwise, from the former prime minister.
The role she has now agreed, after several meetings with John Major, is
limited, given her usual appetite for punishing itineraries. Aides say she
will be campaigning for friends in marginal constituencies - helping Michael
Forsyth, the deeply Thatcherite Scottish Office minister, retain his
precariously unsafe Stirling seat, is probably high on her list. An
appearance at a Tory rally with the prime minister is also promised.
But from the beginning of April, Mrs Thatcher has long-arranged engagements
and lectures in the US which her office says cannot be re-
scheduled. She will be back, however, in time to vote.

Graeme Gilchrist's sudden exit from Union Discount means that two
high-profile City jobs will have to be filled pretty sharply.
As chairman of the London Discount Market Association, Gilchrist was the man
responsible for telling the Governor of the Bank of England what he couldn't
find out about the market from his Reuters monitor.
This weekly task will now fall to his deputy, Robin Moser, managing director
of Alexanders, the oldest discount house.
Finding a replacement for Gilchrist should not be too difficult. Admittedly,
there has been a fairly heavy turnover of Union's executive directors of
late but Derek Lyons, managing director of the traditional discount house
business, would be the obvious internal candidate, and very capable too.
'We have shut the stable door very firmly, though obviously to some extent
the horse has bolted,' says Robin Herbert, Union's old Etonian chairman.
Having recently taken over from Alec Ritchie, another well-connected
merchant banker who headed Union for 20 years, no blame can be laid at
Herbert's door.
But given the wealth of non-executive City talent on Union's board, it seems
a trifle unfair to lay all the blame for Union's strategic errors on poor
old Graeme Gilchrist.

A big morale-raising job awaits Efthymios Christodoulou, who took over this
week as the new governor of the Bank of Greece. The central bank's
reputation as a watchdog inevitably suffered from the Pounds 110m Bank of
Crete embezzlement scandal, even though retiring governor Dimitris Halikias
escaped blame for it.
Another problem for the newcomer is that his bank's research department,
once a respected think-tank, is suffering from a brain-drain as bright staff
are lured away to the private sector by higher pay. From 90 researchers not
long ago, it has shrunk to under 50  - barely enough to crank out the
forecasts required by the OECD and IMF.
Even so, the 59-year-old Christodoulou must feel relieved to be leaving the
economy ministry. He had a hard time during his 18-month tenure as minister,
not least when it came to persuading his cabinet colleagues to back his
medium-term austerity programme.
On the other hand, as a gregarious Euro-MP for over a decade, Christodoulou
built a useful network of contacts in Brussels. These paid off in 1990 when
Greece found itself in the embarrassing position of having to ask the
Commission for an emergency balance of payments loan for the second time in
only four years.
With Greek credibility in Brussels at a low ebb, Christodoulou's lobbying
was crucial in getting the Pounds 1.6bn loan approved. Now he has to
disprove those critics who argue that skilful politicians do not make good
central bankers.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Leading Article: A murderous path to peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL murders perpetrated by the extremist enemies of Israel and by
the government in Jerusalem during the weekend offer an ugly counterpoint to
the international commitment to bring peace to the Middle East. The deaths
of three Israeli soldiers, several residents of a Palestinian refugee camp,
Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah leader, his wife and son are testament to
the powerful resistance that remains to the concept of compromise.
The link between the events is that they all make a negotiated peace less
likely. Killing Israeli soldiers will not make an Israeli government more
likely to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza. Killing Sheikh Abbas Musawi
and his family will not, contrary to Israeli leaders' protestations, make
what they call 'terrorism' less likely. On the contrary, the killing of the
Hizbollah leader, who was thought to have been helpful in winning the
release of western hostages in Lebanon last year, raises the probability of
retaliation and further reaction.
It also has wider implications of importance to the international community.
If the peace process, in which the US has invested so heavily, is to be
given a chance, then the parties most involved must at least exercise
restraint. It is not asking for anything new or something which cannot be
delivered. When Israel was far more threateningly attacked by Iraqi Scud
missiles last year, it demonstrated just how restrained it could be in
response to US pressure.
Growing recklessness
The Israeli government may have accurately assessed that no American
political leader was going to be too publicly concerned about the death of a
Lebanese Shia cleric closely associated with Iran. But there does seem to be
creeping into Israel's conduct of foreign policy an almost reckless
willingness to challenge the American view of how events should evolve in
the Middle East.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, has not just rejected
Washington's ideas for modest confidence-building measures, but at times has
appeared to be deliberately provocative, particularly on the issue of
building Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories. It may be a
measure of how out of touch Israel's leaders have become with American
opinion that they believed the administration would, whatever the
provocation, accede to the request for Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to
help house immigrants from what was the Soviet Union.
Qualified sentiment
Israel retains a powerful hold on US and European sentiment. But that
sentiment is much more qualified than it was at the height of the Cold War
and when the Arab nations refused to contemplate peace and territorial
compromise. The containment of Soviet ambitions in the Middle East is no
longer an issue and the majority of Arab countries have said not just that
they are willing to recognise Israel but have already sat down with its
leaders in the same room.
Israel can be as sceptical as it wishes about the underlying Arab
motivation, but what it must not do is refuse to acknowledge the importance
of the changes which have taken place or the desire of its closest allies to
carry the process forward. The more moderate leaders of the Arab world,
buoyed by the liberation of Kuwait nearly a year ago, are again in danger of
seeing their political gains eroded. Islam is once more being vigorously
promoted as the sole remaining force which can unite peoples against
unpopular governments and international manipulation. The killing of Mr
Musawi is grist to the mill of religious militants from Algeria to Iran.
How much all this matters to the Israeli public should be more than ever a
matter of critical debate. In June, it goes to the polls for what might be
the most important election since independence. Mr Shamir and his Likud
party believe Israel can cope with all the consequences of holding on to the
occupied territories. The Labour party thinks it must offer some land in
return for peace. Israel's choice will have a direct impact on western
interests and could confirm what threatens to become a widening conflict of
view.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Arts: Concepts which make their mark - The work of Ian
Hamilton Finlay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Hamilton Finlay is a reclusive and controversial figure, as combative a
polemicist as he is rigorous in his address to the personal aesthetic of his
work. Pity the poor ratings officer who treads too light a path to his door,
or the unwary critic whose too easy reading of the work, and more casual
utterance, soon betray him.
Finlay is a conceptual artist, which is to say that the work is always the
vehicle to the particular idea, to which it gives physical embodiment and
presence. Its expression invariably combines image or object with a text or
inscription of some kind. That this last should be so often gnomic or
inscrutable serves simply to give this intellectual content, or aura of
intellectuality, an added force. Mere ambiguity, by contrast, comes as
blessed clarity and relief.
Now in his late 60s, he has lived at Stonypath, his 'Little Sparta' in
Strathclyde, since 1966. There he has made the garden itself both his studio
and gallery, the only true context and setting for his work. He never
leaves. The world must come to him on his terms, which is a fine trick if
you can bring it off and sustain it by the qualities of what you do. What
Finlay does is to conceive of the informing idea and then to commission the
actual expressive object - the carved stone, the plaque with its lettering,
the bronze, the print, the symbolic item - from the latest craftsmen in whom
he has come to place absolute confidence.
Exhibitions of the work that comes from so detached a process are not
over-frequent. Finlay is an anxious perfectionist and his inevitable absence
from the seat of practical debate, as the show comes together, hardly helps.
Misunderstandings and quarrels with curators, administrators and dealers are
common enough, last-minute cancellations not unknown. To the embattled
artist such creatures are the enemy.
But the shows do go on, or up, and it happens that two such are now in
London. Instruments of Revolution &amp; Other Works occupies the Institution of
Contemporary Arts (The Mall SW1, until April 5, then on to Leeds and to the
Yorkshire Sculpture Park at Wakefield), and Victoria Miro (21 Cork Street
W1, until April 3) is showing 10 Maquettes for Neo-Classical Structures.
While in no sense retrospective, together they give us enough of the true
flavour of the man and his work at their most serious, fascinating and
successful - and precious, and tiresome.
Finlay is as much a romantic as he is a classicist, a poet as likely to be
seduced by the poetic dream as puritan in thrall to his severe ideal of
perfectibility. Apollo pursues his Daphne whom he must lose, his dream
turning to wood before his eyes, just as Saint-Just and Robespierre must
lose their Republic, though they themselves would be the ones to be
destroyed. 'And even as she fled/ the Republic charmed him . . . He on the
wings of Love/ She on those of Fear.' Finlay is alive to every irony.
His imagery is that of revolutionary sentiment; transformation and
contradiction; and the general follies of mankind, making frequent use of
puns and obscure erudition. The French Revolution in particular stands as an
abiding theme in his work, as much for the loftiness of the hopes and
aspirations that inspired it as for its abject and bitter failures and
cruelties. It is for him a true image of all human enterprise.
At the ICA a set of inscriptions on slate walls marks the decade of the
Argentine strike at San Carlos Water. 'Transformations of Fire/ First San
Carlos Water/ But half the Water is Earth/ Half Lightning Storm.' 'Fure
coming on/ Will discern/ And catch up/ With all things.' 'Exocet steers
all.' These are declared Heraclitan sentiments: Heraclitus, the philosopher
who held that the world was created from fire. Of a naturally melancholy
disposition, so Lempriere tells us, he passed his time in a solitary,
unsocial manner. He was called the mourner, 'from his unconquerable custom
of weeping at the follies, frailty, and vicissitudes of human affairs.'
Rendered rambling and unintelligible to his doctors by a dropsical complaint
brought on by a voluntary diet of grass, he retired to a dunghill in vain
hopes that the natural warmth would effect a cure. His sad story is a lesson
to us all.
Finlay's Instruments of Revolution are implements variously set and
inscribed: a hoe - osez; a spade - Ventose; a sickle; a wheelbarrow; a light
machine-gun; three watering cans - 'Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon'; a
beribboned axe in a block - 'la Revolution est un bloc'; the blade of the
guillotine. Upstairs the room is full of tiny hinged wooden pieces, each to
its own plinth and very simple, that stand open to reveal text, or sun-dial
image, on their plane faces: 'Water's Edge/ Water Sedge', 'Sheepcote/
Dovecote/ Whichcote', 'pebbled brook/ freckled freshet/ strong stream':
poetical, fey, irritating by turns.
But, as with the ten maquettes at Victoria Miro, what justifies the work is
not the force of sentiment or idea as such that it supports, but rather the
sense of its object-hood, its physical being. That this should be so is, in
the circumstances, remarkable - a true feat of imaginative appropriation on
the artist's part. There is never a doubt that these strangely eloquent
things are Finlay's very own. In this respect these new maquettes -
obelisks, columns, pyramids and arches with their elegiac lapidary
inscriptions - are as successful as anything he has done. 'Edifice - the
seat or summit of reason': 'all greatness stands firm in the storm'.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Technology: Life in a snapshot - Computers are predicting
the spending patterns of British consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are the maker of a new consumer widget which you think appeals to the
thirtysomething social climbers among Britain's middle classes. How would
you find out which part of the country would be most appropriate as a test
market?
You may be helped by a new package of information about Britain's social and
economic fabric due to be assembled over the next few years.
In a new study, researchers at Essex University are to track the lives of
about 10,000 individuals chosen at random from around the UK. The survey
staff will return to the individuals each year to see how their lives have
changed.
The research will provide a view not just about, say, the numbers of people
who own a video recorder - but the way in which ownership patterns change
depending on individuals' circumstances.
On a macroeconomic level, the study should also shed light on how decisions
by millions of individual consumers come together to influence spending
patterns in the economy. This area is of particular relevance in the current
recession. The recovery has been held back by weak levels of consumer
spending - an area which accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product.
The information from the Essex study will be contained in a computerised
database, which will be available to commercial groups such as market
researchers and consumer-goods companies. It should be possible for
businesses with the relevant computer equipment to connect up their offices
to the database over the telephone system.
Ultimately, the data will be linked with similar information about social
change in other European countries, providing a snapshot of how life across
the continent differs.
Working on the British Household Panel Study is a 35-strong team of
sociologists, economists and computer technicians. The group is backed with
Pounds 5.5m by the government's Economic and Social Research Council.
Results from the study will be available from the council's data archive
unit, also based at Essex.
All the people selected in the study will be interviewed on an annual basis,
starting later this year, to discover information about subjects such as
income, health and employment. The individuals will also be questioned on
their living accommodation, the kind of goods and services they purchase and
political views.
From the research should emerge a new perspective on life in Britain. Other
surveys, for example those organised by the Central Statistical Office or
the Employment Department (see panel), provide a view of the proportion of
the population who own particular types of goods, have specific illnesses or
work in certain jobs.
But while nearly all of these projects build up information by interviewing
on a regular basis different groups of people, the Essex study will be the
first large-scale UK study to return to the same individuals each year.
As a result, the project should obtain not only information about social and
economic change, but insights as to how and why groups of people move
between different levels in society, judged by their incomes and other
factors.
David Rose, acting head of the Essex team, says: 'Our analysis will be going
much deeper than other surveys. For example, we will be able to find out not
just how many people are below the poverty line, but what kind of people
they are.'
Although the data will be used primarily by academics, the information could
also help companies. A business selling household equipment, food or
consumer magazines could, for instance, use the information to obtain a
detailed sociological profile of individuals in a specific part of Britain.
Such a company will be able to determine at what rate people in a specific
region and age group are becoming owners of video players, buying baked
beans on a regular basis or installing double glazing. That could help
businesses to target marketing efforts.
Other areas of research which will be helped by the study include:
The labour market. The study should provide extra information about career
patterns, why people move between specific jobs and how these factors are
influenced by aspects such as education, health and income.
How households make spending decisions. The degree to which households are
willing to run down savings to fund consumer purchases or move house will be
one aspect under study. The project might also shed light on how general
consumer confidence affects spending decisions.
Transitions in and out of poverty. Key influences such as education, family
background and social or political views will come under study.
Housing. The study will obtain a snapshot of views from people about the
desirability of renting or buying houses, together with details about why
they move and specific difficulties such as availability of accommodation
and finance. That should provide a mass of extra information about the
housing market.
Health. Links between individuals' health and other aspects of their lives
such as age, income and employment will also be explored.
Values. The study should provide new information on shifts in ideas among
specific segments of the population in areas such as equality, freedom,
fairness and political thinking.
Extra and more timely information about the UK labour market will emerge
later this year as a result of improvements to the Employment Department's
labour force survey. The survey is to be conducted quarterly, instead of
annually. Partly as a result of greater use of computers, results from the
exercise will become available in six months, halving the current waiting
period. The data will be useful for economists, businesses and politicians
who are attempting to monitor changes in the numbers employed and out of
work.
The new exercise builds on the department's existing labour force survey,
one aim of which is to provide a check against the department's monthly
unemployment statistics. These are based on the numbers of people who claim
unemployment benefit at government jobcentres, and so provide only a
relatively superficial view of the jobs market.
Results from the first of the quarterly surveys, based on research taking
place over the next three months, will be published in the autumn. After
this, new results will emerge on a three-monthly basis.
The relatively short time between the research and publication of results
will increase the survey's relevance. It is a considerable improvement on
the waiting time of one year which applies to the current, annual survey.
The results from the 1991 survey are still being collated and are expected
to become available by early next month.
The format of the survey remains much the same as before. Interviewers
employed by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys gather information
from a random sample of about 120,000 people in 60,000 households around
Britain. In this way, the survey determines broad trends, in areas such as
training, shifts between different types of work and the periods specific
groups of unemployed people have been without jobs.
While up to now the interviewers have recorded answers on paper, in the new
quarterly survey they are using Toshiba hand-held computers. By plugging
their machines into a central computer over the telephone network, the
interviewers can feed data to government statisticians more quickly, helping
to speed up the job of analysis.
Also contributing to a reduction in the waiting time is that the job of
collecting and analysing the information has been given to a new 200-strong
team at the OPCS, which the Employment Department says will produce results
more quickly. The department says the cost of producing the four surveys a
year is less than four times that of the annual survey.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Wielding a sharp scalpel
 -Back from the brink / One company doctor's prescriptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE vast majority of people only start their own companies 'because they are
completely unemployable'.
Given remarks like that, it is just as well that Danny Chapchal, a company
doctor who has brought more than one business back from the brink, says he
does not set out to be liked.
He aims, however, to win the respect of those working around him, even if he
spends quite a lot of time casting doubt on the business acumen of British
managers and on the commitment of the financial institutions which back
them.
Chapchal is a 46-year-old accountant who started up and sold his own
electronic components company in the 1960s before going on to help a string
of struggling, small and medium-sized businesses back on their feet.
He is now chief executive of SQL Systems International, a Surrey-based
management systems software company, after venture capitalist investors
invited him in to help stem mounting losses. Subsidiaries have been sold
off, jobs have gone and annual turnover has been trimmed back from Pounds 9m
to Pounds 5m. The company, however, is profitable again.
Chapchal, who says he cannot function without classical music playing in the
background, sees himself as a sort of corporate Furtwangler, Toscanini or
Karajan.
'Furtwangler said a good conductor can turn the village band into the
philharmonic but a bad one can turn the philharmonic into the village band.'
There are, he says, nothing like enough good conductors within the ranks of
Britain's smaller businesses. Many of the record numbers of companies now
falling into the hands of receivers never stood a chance, he says, even if
the economy had gone from boom to boom.
'Two basic types start companies. The minority have a brilliant idea, know
where their strengths begin and end, and recognise the need to bring on
board other skills right from the start. They might succeed. But the rest
are super-idealists who have started out on their own because they have got
fed up with big business and want to get away from controls and planning and
strategy.
'The first employees are friends and everyone gets a Rover. They pretend
everyone is equal and no-one takes any decisions if someone is going to get
hurt.
'The end result is a terribly immature business culture in which discipline
breaks down and no-one is in overall charge. I went into one company and
no-one knew it was Pounds 1.5m in debt.
'Too many companies still think of management as a necessary evil. But there
has to be a boss, someone to say yes and no and to focus and direct their
energies. It all sounds so obvious but many new companies think they can do
it differently.'
Chapchal says start-ups nearly always make the same fundamental mistakes:
'They invariably underestimate by half the amount of capital they require,
they are under-resourced in staff terms and are slow to react to changes in
relevant technology'.
But surely every business has to start modestly, to learn to walk before it
can run? 'Absolutely, but its no good if you are even unable to crawl. If
you can't begin with certain fundamental strengths, then you are going
nowhere.'
He joins in the chorus of criticism over the low priority afforded to
research and development but says that, even when it is adequately financed,
it is often misdirected.
'There is a tremendous temptation for UK companies to be technology-led, but
the real challenge is to be market-led and backed up by technological
know-how.'
Sound professional advice, he adds, is often forsaken by small business in a
'we know best' approach, although he is also withering about the general
level of practical expertise among the bankers who take it upon themselves
to spot winners and identify losers.
'Most of them have absolutely no comprehension of running a business. So
much so, they don't even realise when things start to go horribly wrong. If
a company goes bust overnight, it is not the only one at fault.'
Chapchal is also critical of the investment community, which he says remains
stubbornly attached to the concept of quick returns. 'The average venture
capitalist wants to get out within three to five years. In Europe it is five
to eight years, or longer if necessary.'
Chapchal says he is now looking for something big to tackle. 'I've done a
few smaller companies and would like to get my hands on something in deep
trouble which ought not to die, but will unless it gets help. Big or small,
if companies take their eye off the ball, they're out'.

payment - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How does a small company persuade its customers to pay? Nothing Ventured,
the newsletter of the British Venture Capital Association, recounts the tale
of a company that found a very effective method.
Having tried and failed with polite requests, blunt demands, personal visits
from the credit controller and solicitors' letters, the small supplier
ordered its staff to call the recalcitrant customer at 30-second intervals.
The telephone campaign continued for the rest of the day and restarted at
8am the next morning. The customer's business, dependent on telephone
selling, seized up. By noon on the second day it capitulated and sent a
cheque.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Fair shares for the savvy
investor - The growth of a stock index for small US companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past, small American companies had to rely on word of mouth among
brave stock analysts if they wanted to see much trading in their shares.
But today, if a small firm can be included in the Russell 2,000 Index, the
benchmark index of small capitalisation companies, it stands a better chance
of riding the wave of popularity that small shares are currently enjoying on
Wall Street.
The Russell 2,000 Index is composed of 2,000 companies with an average
capitalisation of Dollars 100m.
The largest company in the index, the National Pizza Company, has a market
capitalisation of Dollars 338m, and the smallest, Intertrans Corp, of
Dollars 15.7m.
The Russell 2,000, created by the Frank Russell Company, a Seattle-based
pension fund advisory firm, is attracting increasing attention as the values
of small company shares have shot up.
Last year the index outperformed the larger and more important Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 by more than 15 percentage points. The total annual rate of
return on the Russell 2,000 was 46.05 per cent, while the S&amp;P 500 posted
just 30.5 per cent.
The vogue of small capitalisation companies appears to be continuing this
year as well. The index has become something of the darling of indexers -
those mostly institutional investors who match their portfolios to a
particular market index. An index offers several advantages: if the
portfolio is matched perfectly - that is, it contains proportionately the
same stocks that are in the index - it assures a return at least as good as
the index.
This helps to eliminate the risks of bad stock picks and reduces the amount
of trading in a portfolio, and thus its transaction costs.
Money has flooded into the Russell 2,000 in the last few years. According to
Katie Weigel, vice president for product development at the Frank Russell
Company, the amount of assets indexed to the Russell 2,000 has risen from
zero in 1985, the year after the index was launched, to Dollars 1.3bn at the
end of 1989 and to more than Dollars 2bn today.
Money managers expect that it will continue to rise. With that kind of money
being pumped into small capitalisation shares, the companies can enjoy the
advantages that rising stock prices confer, such as greater ease in raising
money, converting debt to equity or substituting bonds for bank debt. In
addition, since in many small companies top managers are owners of shares,
their own net worth increases.
Part of the reason why so much investment has flowed into the Russell 2,000
recently is that in rising markets, small stocks have better chances for
growth and investors have been lured by high returns.
But Sandip Bhagat, manager of the small capitalisation stock fund for
Travelers Investment Mangement Company, a unit of Travelers Insurance, said
he believes that in a slow-growth, maturing economy, as the United States is
now, small company shares have greater possibilities for growth.
Money managers also say that the index will continue to prosper because
large institutional investors and other savvy individuals are now seeing
some benefits in having a proportionate exposure to the spectrum of the
market.
For example, at PanAgora Asset Management - an investment firm with Dollars
12bn (Pounds 6.6bn) under management and offices in London, Boston and Tokyo
 -David Beckedorff, who manages a small capitalisation fund that tracks the
Russell 2,000, says that the index represents roughly 8 per cent of the US
stock universe and that there are some clients who wish to invest
proportionately.
Along with the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 of medium-sized companies  -
which respectively represent 75 per cent and 15 per cent of the stock
universe - the Russell 2,000 is a building block for an index-investing
strategy, said Beckedorff.
PanAgora's fund, which is open to pension funds, began last summer and has
Dollars 25m in assets. It does not attempt to purchase all 2,000 of the
index's shares because of a lack of liquidity in small stocks. Instead, it
selects 820 stocks from the index, picking for a spread among industries and
the greatest liquidity.
A similar type of selection from the Russell 2,000 is made by the Vanguard
Group of mutual funds for its retail public fund that is based on the index.
Gus Sauter, the fund's manager, says that his Small Capitalisation Stock
Fund has mushroomed from just Dollars 18m in 1989, when it converted to
track the Russell 2,000, to Dollars 170m today.
Although liquidity problems make the Russell 2,000 the most difficult index
Vanguard tracks, Sauter said: 'In the long run, we expect it to be a big
fund'. Bhagat of Travelers is also convinced the shift into small stocks is
for the long-term. 'These will be the better performing sub-asset class' at
least until the mid-1990s, he says.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): PLA setback in dismissals appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Port of London Authority has lost part of its appeal against an order to
reinstate 12 shop stewards who were found to have been unfairly dismissed
during the 1989 dock strike.
The decision continues the legal victory of the TGWU general union, which
has spent about Pounds 1.5m on the record 190-day industrial tribunal. The
PLA, however, is appealing on two other grounds.
The union's lawyers are submitting a substantial costs claim to the PLA.
Costs are not usually awarded against the losing side in a tribunal but the
union hopes it may recoup some of its costs.
The PLA is highly unlikely to reinstate the workers but will have to pay
compensation of between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 80,000 each.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Skilled blue-collar workers 'winning
big rises'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKILLED blue-collar workers are receiving pay increases well above the rate
of inflation because employers fear skill shortages when the recession ends,
according to a survey of operative and clerical pay rates, Diane Summers
writes.
Increases averaged 9.3 per cent last year for blue-collar workers in
administration, catering, distribution, engineering, personnel and
production, according to the survey of more than 1,000 companies carried out
by Reward, the pay research group.
The report says skilled workers are being looked after well by their
employers. 'Employers appear to be saying 'those we keep, we will pay well
to ensure that the organisation does not stall its growth when the recession
ends'.'
Examples of big rises include: 17.7 per cent for warehouse supervisors and
15.4 per cent for skilled warehouse staff; 22.5 per cent for driver/packers;
16.2 per cent for some grades of skilled craft workers; 21.2 per cent for
semi-skilled plant maintenance workers and 12.7 for production supervisors.
Clerical pay has risen less sharply, with an average rise of 6.6 per cent.
Reward forecasts a steady decline in pay increases for clerical staff over
the coming months, with an average of 5 per cent until September this year.
Central London clerical pay remains the highest in the country at 41.4 per
cent more than the average. South Wales is lowest, where clerical pay is
14.2 per cent less than the average.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Vauxhall plant faces strike on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the TGWU general union at the Ellesmere Port plant of Vauxhall,
the General Motors subsidiary, have voted overwhelmingly to strike over a
pay dispute.
With only a small number of postal votes still to be counted, union
officials said yesterday that 76 per cent of those who voted favoured a
stoppage and 89 per cent for action short of a strike.
The TGWU is the largest union at Vauxhall. It is thought that other unions -
both at Ellesmere Port and at the company's manufacturing and parts sites at
Luton - have also delivered decisive majorities, although the margins in
favour may be less.
Disclosure of the TGWU result came as management and unions at Rover, the
carmaking subsidiary of British Aerospace, edged closer to a deal on working
practices and bargaining procedures.
The two sides have been negotiating since September on changes which would
see the introduction of reforms including single-table bargaining, in which
all blue-collar and white-collar unions would negotiate together;
'continuous improvement' working practices for everyone; and increased
flexibility by workers.
A single-grade structure would eventually be introduced. Talks on the
changes continued late into yesterday evening and were adjourned until
Monday.
The ballots of more than 8,000 members of blue-collar unions at Vauxhall
follow the company's refusal to raise the 5 per cent it has offered for the
first year of a two-year deal.
The offer would provide an increase in line with inflation in the second
year and workers would also receive a lump-sum payment equivalent to 0.5 per
cent of annual pay.
Apart from protesting about the level of the offer, workers are angry about
a company proposal to reduce the potential for productivity bonuses to rise
and its refusal to meet demands for a shorter working week.
There is also dissatisfaction about the time it has taken to negotiate the
deal. Talks which began last May have been complicated by the company's
linkage of pay increases to changes in working practices and by the unions'
refusal, for several months, to accept the linkage.
If the deal goes ahead and the changes run to the company's satisfaction,
workers at Luton will receive a rise of 5 per cent, on top of the annual pay
rise. Ellesmere Port employees benefited by a similar amount last year in a
comparable agreement.
Mr Steve Broadhead, a TGWU official, said workers were aware of a deal at
Ford which provided 5 per cent in the first year and 5 per cent or inflation
plus 0.5 per cent, whichever was the greater, in the second.
'There were no strings attached there,' he said.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Stationery Office unions urge
rejection of 3.5% offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Her Majesty's Stationery Office are being urged to take
industrial action over pay just a year after HMSO became the first Civil
Service agency to break away from national pay bargaining.
Four unions have recommended that the 2,000 non-industrial civil servants at
HMSO reject the proposed deal, which they estimate is worth 3.5 per cent
from the settlement date of last October.
Two, the NUCPS and CPSA, are urging industrial action short of a strike.
The other two, the IPMS and GMPU, say they will follow suit if their members
reject the deal.
Action the unions are considering includes working to rule or to job
description and an overtime ban. They are also considering strikes by
selected groups of workers.
Mr Graeme Watt, NUCPS assistant secretary, said any action would probably
delay supplies to customers.
The offer compares with rises of at least 6.5 per cent last year for civil
servants who remain in national bargaining. Last week workers whose pay is
determined by public-sector pay review bodies were awarded rises averaging
6.5 per cent.
The dispute at HMSO is likely to strengthen the resolve of Civil Service
unions in maintaining national bargaining arrangements.
The government is urging greater devolution of pay determination as part of
its Citizen's Charter programme.
The unions ordered the ballots after failing to persuade HMSO to ask the
Treasury to vary its Pounds 4m profit target for last year.
HMSO managers had argued that they were unable to pay more than the offer
because anything greater would have jeopardised the Pounds 4m target. They
offered a three-month pay deferral followed by a 4.7 per cent increase for
the rest of the pay year.
Union leaders are concerned that similar arguments will be used in the pay
negotiations next year, especially as the profit target has been increased
to Pounds 6m for the 1992 calendar year.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Industrial action threat at BP plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOP STEWARDS at BP Chemicals' three main UK plants threatened industrial
action yesterday over the company's decision to withdraw collective
bargaining rights at the Baglan Bay plant in south Wales.
But union representatives at Baglan Bay, Hull and Grangemouth, near Falkirk,
decided to advise Baglan Bay members to accede to the company's request to
sign personal contracts.
Mr Fred Higgs, national secretary of the TGWU general union, said the advice
to sign was intended to stop divisions among workers as some union members
had already signed under threat of redundancy.
'The shop stewards decided that members at the three sites would be urged to
take industrial action if the company does not remove the personal contracts
and if its executives refuse to meet national officials over the issue.'
BP Chemicals told the TGWU and the AEU engineering workers' union last week
that it was giving 90 days notice of the end of collective pay agreements at
Baglan Bay.

TRADE: Britain's financial-services sector should be one of the main
beneficiaries from the new agreement between the European Community and the
European Free Trade Association, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, told the
Commons last night.
He envisaged that the agreement would lead to 'significant economic gains'
for industry and consumers. There would be free movement of capital,
services, goods and people.
Welcoming the agreement, Ms Joyce Quin, Labour trade spokeswoman, emphasised
that the parties to the agreement should seek to promote world trade as a
whole and to dispel ideas of a 'fortress Europe'.
*****
GUILLOTINE: Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, last night accused
the government of 'prostituting' the legislative programme to its electoral
timetable.
A motion to curtail debate on the Local Government Bill was approved by a
majority of 89 (292-203).
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, said the use of the guillotine was
necessary because of Labour 'filibustering' in committee stages.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard condemns Labour's 'evil'
links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES yester-day fielded no fewer than six ministers at a press
conference in an attempt to raise the profile of Labour's union links in the
election campaign, Philip Stephens writes.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, warned that a government led by Mr
Neil Kinnock would return Britain to the industrial relations chaos of the
1970s. He described Labour's policies as 'made for the unions by the unions'
and referred to the 'evil' links which gave union leaders control of
Labour's policymaking machinery.
His comments were derided by Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, as
'a pathetic attempt to divert attention from the Conservatives'
mismanagement of the economy'.

<TEXT>
MR DONALD DEWAR is a rare example of a politician who gives the profession a
good name. That, of course, is what his more combative colleagues single out
as his principal weakness.
The gangling, 54-year-old shadow Scottish secretary is widely respected on
both sides of the Commons for all-round integrity and scrupulous
reasonableness. Perhaps, too much so.
Such traits are unusual enough in the Commons. They are all the more so in
the rough world of Scottish politics, where quiet diplomacy is often
reinforced by the unspoken threat of a well-aimed kick.
With his countrymen once again in turmoil over devolution and independence,
Mr Dewar is arguably Labour's most embattled politician - after Mr Neil
Kinnock himself.
If the party fails to win the coming election it will be up to Mr Dewar to
prevent a split in his party that could dash its chances of ever forming an
administration in Westminster.
With an iron grip on Scottish local government and 48 of the country's 72
parliamentary seats, it is a wonder that any Labour leader in Scotland will
be able to justify being denied power by the very Act of Union the party is
pledged to defend.
It is after the election and not before that he may face his most serious
political test.
In recent weeks, however, Mr Dewar has suffered his toughest trial since the
Scottish National party converted a 19,500 Labour majority into a 3,500
nationalist victory at the 1988 Govan by-election.
With a general election likely for April 9, he has faced unaccustomed
criticism for what was widely seen as a lacklustre performance in a
televised debate on Scotland's mounting constitutional controversy.
Days later an opinion poll showed a surge in nationalist support with a
remarkable 50 per cent of Scots preferring outright independence to Labour's
alternative plan for a Scottish parliament.
On February 4 Mr Dewar acted to calm anxiety among Scottish MPs as they
gathered for their regular monthly meeting in parliament.
Before anyone could voice unease he defused the concern with a disarmingly
contrite critique of his own performance and agreement that Labour should
now sell its devolution policy under the more positive banner of 'home
rule'.
Furthermore, he accepted that he would devolve more campaigning roles to his
troops. One MP commented afterwards: 'It was a typically robust performance
by Donald and everyone went away satisfied.' But Mr Dewar's emollient style
is beginning to worry a few. As one leftwing backbencher put it: 'Donald's a
good Glasgow University debater, but he's no street-fighter.'
Mr George Foulkes, a friend and admirer of Mr Dewar - like the vast majority
of Scots Labour MPs - puts it more gently: 'He is sometimes too reasonable
and tends to see the other side of arguments. That can be dangerous,
especially so close to an election.'
A scion of Glasgow's professional classes, Donald Campbell Dewar is a
typical Scottish Labour laird and a prime example of the party's
academicly-inclined, legally-trained oligarchy. The only child of a doctor,
he was sent to that stiflingly conservative bulwark of respectability, the
Glasgow Academy.
At Glasgow University the 'Gannet', as he was nicknamed, leapt to prominence
when he succeeded Mr John Smith as leader of the Labour club. It was here he
first encountered his hero, the late Hugh Gaitskell.
After qualifying as a lawyer he prised Aberdeen South from the Tories in
1966, completing his philosophical apprenticeship as parliamentary private
secretary to Mr Tony Crosland, then president of the Board of Trade.
An eight-year exile from the Commons ended in 1978 when he narrowly held
Glasgow's Garscadden constituency at a by-election, in spite of a fierce
challenge from the SNP. Today he has a 19,000 majority.
Always a devolutionist, Mr Dewar's enthusiasm for Scottish culture has been
fed by a passion for collecting well-bound volumes of 18th century Scots
literature, so chaotically scattered round his home that it was once taken
as evidence of a burglary.
His ectomorphic form, vast appetite, rapid-fire speaking style and public
gregariousness hides a self-deprecating personality and a manic
preoccupation with work that prompt some to conclude that he is motivated
more by some unexplained inner despair than a passion for social reform.
'Donald is never happier than when he is miserable,' is an observation that
has become a cliche.
If Mr Dewar's networking has proved crucial in keeping the potentially
faction-ridden Scottish party united, so too has his extreme caution - which
has led crueller critics to accuse him of being more calculating civil
servant than vision-driven politician.
In particular, they point to the Scottish Labour leadership's hovering too
long on the fringes of the Scottish convention - the body that first
brokered the current round of devolutionist thinking.
Others say that Mr Dewar, and Mr Murray Elder, the Scottish regional
secretary, have been over-zealous in their management of the party,
confining strategic decision-making to an elite inner circle.
Another Dewar virtue turned vice is his strong personal loyalty - an example
is his support for less admired frontbench colleagues like Mr Tony
Worthington - which is widely deemed to betray a lack of ruthlessness
bordering on the unprofessional.
But the most damaging charge in the radical atmosphere now prevailing in
Scotland is that Mr Dewar is essentially an establishment figure, looking
forward to playing Westminster's viceroy in its northern colony. It is a
card the nationalists are certain to play.
Mr Dewar is fond of saying that being Scottish secretary - with powers drawn
from seven or eight English departments of state - is his greatest ambition.
With Scotland in its current fever it would be politically much cannier,
perhaps, to hint that he would prefer to crown his career as prime minister
of a Scottish parliament - even, indeed, if that is not entirely true.
It is typical of Mr Dewar's guileless honesty, if not his political nous,
that he would not dream of doing so.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition launches NHS offensive -
Pre-election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrats yesterday backed guaranteed 'sustained increases' in
National Health Service funding, as Labour accused the government of
creating a US-style, two-tier health service.
NHS spending would be increased in real terms every year if the Liberal
Democrats' policy document were implemented. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, said service levels would remain constant, or rise, after
taking account of demographic changes and higher costs.
A fully-costed programme will be given in the party's election manifesto.
The final, pre-election version of Labour's health policy will be launched
by Mr Neil Kinnock, party leader, and Mr Robin Cook, shadow health
secretary, on Thursday. Mr Cook prefaced the launch yesterday by producing a
dossier of case studies which he said showed that patients were being forced
to go to the private sector for treatment - in effect, 'privatising' the
NHS.
The Labour proposals will pledge the party to ending the internal market on
which the government's NHS reforms of last year are based. This will include
an undertaking to abolish the two most highly publicised aspects of the
reforms - self-governing trust hospitals and GP fund-holders. The proposals
will, however, recognise the case for giving GPs greater involvement in
planning.
Labour leaders acknowledge the need to keep purchasing and provision of
health care separate - an approach which is being adopted in health systems
around the world. They believe it can be achieved managerially in health
authorities, rather than by market mechanisms.
The Liberal Democrat proposals also embrace the separation of responsibility
between deciding priorities and running services, but they would be based on
service agreements between democratically accountable health authorities and
hospitals.
The party also plans to abolish charges for eye and dental checks, increase
investment and gradually reduce prescription charges. Tobacco promotion
would be banned.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health minister, said that whereas in 1987 the then
Alliance parties had backed an 'internal market', the Liberal Democrats were
now 'desperately in search of a workable health policy'. She added: 'This
isn't it.'
Mr Ashdown said yesterday that Labour or the Tories should try to form a
coalition government with minority parties in the event of a hung
parliament, rather than making a 'fast dash' to a second contest. 'The
voters want a constructive, more positive approach from their politicians,'
he said.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Lloyd's meeting not all plain sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S two-hour meet-ing of MPs and Lloyd's executives was not all
plain sailing, according to some politicians who attended.
Senior executives from the insurance market were taken aback by the
aggressive nature of initial questioning from a small minority of the group
of about 25 parliamentarians who attended the meeting at the Lloyd's
building in the City.
Mr Hugh Dykes, Conservative MP for Harrow East, said the forum 'was used by
a number of people who had suffered themselves' in the market.
Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, said: 'We were there to learn
about Lloyd's and not for the pursuit of private vendettas.'
In spite of this setback, most MPs said the meeting had been useful both as
a briefing on the workings of the market and as an opportunity to emphasise
the collective view that regulatory reform was needed.
According to Mr Richard Page, MP for Hertfordshire South West and
vice-chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee, Lloyd's
representatives were left 'in no doubt whatsoever' that an independent
regula-tory body was required.
Among other subjects discussed were the technicalities of reinsurance, the
prospect of more favourable tax treatment for Names and the possible
introduction of a system of limited liability incorporating an investor
protection fund levied from all to guard against excessive losses.
Participating Lloyd's representatives included Mr David Coleridge, chairman,
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association,
and Mr David Rowland, chairman of the Rowland task force that recently
completed an extensive review of Lloyd's market structures.
MPs who attended included: Mr James Arbuthnot (C Wanstead &amp; Woodford), Ms
Rosie Barnes (SDP Greenwich), Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North), Dame
Peggy Fenner (C Medway) - in whose constituency Lloyd's is a big employer -
Sir Anthony Grant (C Cambridgeshire South West) - who piloted the Lloyd's
Act through the Commons in 1982 - Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman (C Lancaster),
Mr Paul Marland (C Gloucestershire West). Also attending was Mr Peter
Viggers (C Gosport) who suggested the meeting.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers defeated in vote on
council tax - Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS suffered their first defeat on the council tax legislation last
night as peers decided that the severely mentally impaired should receive
extra protection against being made responsible for bills.
In discussion of the detailed report stage of the legislation, peers voted
by 95 to 83 that people suffering from conditions such as Alzheimer's
disease should not be jointly and severally liable for the council tax,
which is due to replace the poll tax in April next year.
The government is determined that the bill should be passed before the
general election - at present it is due to be completed early next month.
Overturning this defeat in the Commons could be time-consuming, however.
Ministers say a household containing someone severely mentally impaired will
receive a 25 per cent discount on bills.
Lord Henley, junior social security minister, said the discounts meant there
was no question of being liable for someone else's tax.
Baroness Hollis, speaking for the Opposition, called the government's plans
'perverse, cruel and bizarre'. She said they meant, for example, that if
that a husband left his mentally impaired wife, she could be pursued for
payment of the entire household bill.
Officials believe that strictly the amendment makes little difference to the
actual liability faced by someone mentally impaired, but relying on this
argument to prevent the change being effective would be a difficult line for
the government to sustain.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Main parties neck and neck in poll
of polls - Public opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHEN, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE opinion polls are to be believed, the voters have made up their minds
already.
With Mr John Major now virtually committed to an April 9 general election,
the latest batch confirms that the time, money and energy expended by the
two main parties since the new year has been largely wasted.
Rather like the opposing sides in the First World War both Labour and
Conservatives have fired huge amounts of ammunition to little effect.
The FT's weighted average of the last seven opinion polls shows them firmly
stuck in trenches giving each a fraction less than 40 per cent the vote.
Neither side has budged since the autumn.
Only the Liberal Democrats, apparently benefiting rather than suffering from
the publicity surrounding Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission that he had an affair
with his former secretary, can claim a marginal improvement.
There is potential, however, for both Mr John Major, the prime minister and
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, to claim the initiative. The prime
minister can set the agenda with a tax-cutting Budget. Mr Kinnock can claim
that the voters have still to fully appreciate how deep the recession has
become.
The present deadlock has fuelled the growing feeling at Westminster that the
most likely result of the election will be a hung parliament.
On their present performance the FT's computer gives the Conservatives 317
seats (against 326 needed for an overall majority), Labour 298 and the
Liberal Democrats 11. The Conservatives now have 367 seats, Labour 230 and
the Liberal Democrats 22.

<DATELINE>
   A SOLICITOR acting on behalf of several hundred Lloyd's Names
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the individuals whose assets provide the insurance market's capital - is
preparing to seek injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing from Names'
funds in order to meet insurance claims.
Mr Michael Freeman, of the West End legal firm Michael Freeman, aims to
issue motions for 'around 10' separate injunctions either today or tomorrow.
The injunctions would function as test cases for the more than 600 Names who
are financing the action.
The Names are members of insurance syndicates specialising in catastrophe
reinsurance and managed by Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and
Devonshire agencies.
All suffered heavy losses from the string of catastrophes that occurred in
1989 and 1990.
Names on the Gooda Walker syndicates recently received notice that they must
pay cash calls of Pounds 101m before March 2 or Lloyd's would cash bank
guarantees, held by the Names' agents, in order to meet claims.
Lloyd's is pledged to fight the injunctions and will seek an immediate court
hearing if they are granted.
Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, said yesterday: 'We oppose the
injunction extreme-ly strongly. We have no way of operating if people don't
pay their losses.'
Mr Freeman described the cash calls as 'improper'. Earlier this month he
wrote to Names advising them that the terms of cash calls made by agents
breached the agreements signed by Names with their agents.
He also said that the certification required to begin the procedure to draw
from deposits had not been provided.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Effluent charges to rise 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of industrial groups, water companies and farmers face a 20 per
cent rise in fees for discharging effluent into rivers and coastal waters
from April.
The polluting effluent comes from industrial plants, sewage treatment works
and discharges from some farms.
The increased charges, announced yesterday by Mr David Trippier, environment
minister, are part of the 'polluter pays' principle, and are intended to
cover the cost of pollution control administered by the National Rivers
Authority.
The total revenue the rivers watchdog receives from administering licenses
and monitoring discharges will rise by Pounds 2m to Pounds 38m. It will also
receive a government grant of Pounds 81.8m for pollution control during the
coming year. It will be able to spend 15 per cent more on pollution control
than in the current year.
There are more than 86,000 licenses granted by the authority to allow
discharges.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Wakeham seeks coal power deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Wakeham, the energy secretary, is trying to persuade electricity
suppliers to buy enough coal-fired electricity from generators to guarantee
sales of 40m tonnes from British Coal's deep mines, according to Coal UK,
the newsletter published today.
The deal would mean that British Coal could sell a further 20m tonnes of
cheaper coal from surface mines, giving it sales close to the 65m tonnes it
presently sells to the electricity industry.
Although reports that Mr Wakeham was working hard to secure a contract
between British Coal and the electricity industry surfaced last week, it is
still unclear whether the regional electricity companies will accept Mr
Wakeham's proposal. If the proposal is accepted, it would compel the
generators, National Power and PowerGen, to buy from British Coal to supply
the regional companies.
The deal is thought to offer British Coal Pounds 35 a tonne, compared with
more than Pounds 42 a tonne at present. This would allow it to keep open 28
pits it identified as most economic.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Growth in personal computer sales slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH in sales of personal computers in the UK slowed sharply between 1989
and 1990 and reached a five-year low last year, according to figures to be
published later this week, Alan Cane writes.
New statistics from Context, a London-based marketing consultancy, show how
the personal computer market has been depressed by the recession and
tumbling hardware prices.
The price of personal computers has fallen by between 25 per cent and 40 per
cent for the past two years and further price cuts seem certain.
Context's figures show the market grew 39.5 per cent by volume between 1988
and 1989 and 59.7 per cent by value. Between 1990 and last year, however,
the increase by volume was 2.3 per cent while the value of personal
computers sold declined by 8.4 per cent.
The total value of personal computers sold through dealers and other
indirect channels totalled Pounds 1.7bn last year, representing about
775,000 machines. Both figures would be about 15 per cent higher if all
distribution channels were included. Amstrad's PCW word processors were

FT  18 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Cruellest cut could come from the voters - Why
Lamont should not rely on tax reductions to win the general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont needs only to look around the entrance hall of his official
residence at 11 Downing Street to be reminded of the pitfalls of income tax
policy in an election year. For gazing down from the walls are two former
chancellors and prime ministers, Gladstone and Disraeli, who in 1874 were
respectively the loser and the winner of a general election in which
Gladstone went to the country promising to abolish income tax.
Gladstone's defeat not only established income tax as a permanent fixture in
the government's fiscal armory, it provided an early example of an
occasional tendency in Britain for the electorate to reject lower taxes as a
vote catcher.
There is of course no hope that Mr Lamont, now preparing for his second
Budget on March 10, will abolish income tax. But action to reduce the income
tax burden is almost certain for the first time since Mr Nigel Lawson's tax
cutting budget of 1988.
The chancellor is now generally expected to take a penny off the basic
income rax rate, reducing it to 24p from 25p in the pound, even though this
will cost the exchequer some Pounds 1.95bn when the government's finances
could be heading for a deficit of between Pounds 18bn and Pounds 24bn in
1992-93.
If Mr Lamont thinks he has sufficient scope, he may raise the allowances
before which the basic rate takes effect by more than the statutory 4.5 per
cent rate determined by last December's year-on-year increase in the retail
prices index. Television viewers can expect the chancellor to justify either
move as a stimulus to Britain's recession-hit economy in his Budget speech.
But income tax cuts this year would be almost entirely politically
motivated. It is far from clear that lower income taxes would be the best
way of restoring growth.
Oxford Economic Forecasting, a private sector economic research body, has
calculated that 1p off the basic rate would add just 0.1 per cent to
economic growth this year and 0.3 per cent in each of the two subsequent
years. Although OEF, like many other forecasting bodies, expects the
chancellor to lop 1p off the basic income tax rate, it warns that 'such
action may well cause some problems over the medium term'.
Mr Geoff Meen, OEF's research director, points out that tax cuts take some
time to work through to the economy and might only start to boost activity
after the long-awaited recovery had begun.
In the meantime, the government's already poor financial position would have
been weakened further.
From an economic viewpoint, the chancellor's first choice of a basic rate
cut also appears perverse. Increasing allowances benefits the bottom 70 per
cent of taxpayers in particular, while a basic rate cut puts more money in
the pockets of the top 30 per cent. The lower paid would be more likely to
use any tax hand-out to boost spending, thus stimulating demand in the
economy.
Furthermore, higher allowances take people out of the tax net. The
independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that some 1.1m
people would stop paying income tax altogether if the chancellor were to
raise allowances by 9 per cent - or double the rate of indexation.
Because the cost of Budget tax changes is calculated on an indexed base,
such a move would be cheaper than a basic rate cut, costing about Pounds
950m more than simply indexing the allowances.
The government has a long standing commitment to reducing the basic income
tax rate to 20p. But until the beginning of this year, few people expected
that a start would be made on this programme in this year's Budget.
The change of government sentiment in favour of a rate cut is rooted in the
tax and benefits policy of the opposition Labour party. Income tax is one of
the few areas of economic policy where a sharp distinction exists between
the government and opposition. A rate cut would clearly mark the
Conservatives as the party of tax cuts ahead.
Labour intends to abolish the upper earnings limit on employee's National
Insurance contributions and introduce a top tax rate of 50 per cent for
people earning substantially more than Pounds 30,000 a year to finance
higher pensions and child benefits. It has also proposed restricting reliefs
for higher tax payers and moving to a new starting rate of tax at below 20
per cent. Its plans would effectively create a top tax rate of 59 per cent
compared with the present 40 per cent, set by Mr Lawson in 1988.
The IFS has calculated that very few people in the bottom 70 per cent of
income distribution would lose from Labour's plans and many would gain. But
the abolition of the upper earnings limit would affect 3.2m employees, who
would lose 9 per cent of all earned income above Pounds 20,280. Someone
earning Pounds 27,000, for example, would lose slightly more than Pounds 600
a year.
Many of the potential losers are concentrated in London and the south-east,
where the recession has hit hardest and there are several marginal
constituencies. Therefore it is not surprising that income tax has become a
big election issue.
A cut in the basic rate of tax has obvious attractions for Mr Lamont. It
would attract more headlines in a pre-election Budget than a big increase in
allowances. As Labour has said it will reverse any pre-election cut in tax
rates, such a move would force the Opposition to campaign in support of
raising taxes. But an income tax cut would not be without risk. Budget and
election planners ignore the streak of altruism in the electorate at their
peril.
Mr Lamont will have to bear in mind that opinion polls earlier this year
suggested that most voters would prefer more spending on public services
than lower taxes. There is also the dreadful example of Gladstone, who
foundered in 1874, when both the vote and liability to income tax were
confined to small and affluent minorities.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Minister announces curb on investment by pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYER-RELATED investment by occupational pension schemes will be limited
from March 9 to 5 per cent of funds, the Department of Social Security
announced yesterday. New regulations will also mean that self-investment
below that level will have to be disclosed.
A ceiling on self-investment was called for in the Social Security Act 1990.
But it did not take effect because the government could not agree on how to
define self-investment or where to impose a ceiling. The National
Association of Pension Funds, the industry body, had urged a complete ban on
employer-related investment by pension funds. The rules do not apply to
small self-administered schemes with fewer than 12 members, or to
employer-related investments in bank or building society accounts.
The issue is controversial because pension funds have often invested in
shares in the companies which employ their members and in assets owned by
the companies. Thus, if the employing company collapsed, workers might lose
much of their pensions as well as their jobs.
The rules announced yesterday will not force pension funds to sell property
they own which is used by the employer. However, if such property already
exceeds 5 per cent of all investments, they will not be able to buy more.
The rules bar investment in the employing company an loans or securities
issued to or by 'any person who is connected with, or an associate of, the
employer.' However, Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, rejected a
request from the Occupational Pensions Board to define more clearly who is a
connected or associated person or company.
It is not clear whether some of the investments made by the late Robert
Maxwell's pension funds in companies in which Maxwell was building a
personal stake would have fallen foul of the new rules.

FT  18 FEB 92 / BR white paper delay explained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAY in issuing a white paper on privatising British Rail was yesterday
attributed by government officials to the complexities of the regulatory
regime.
They accept that, if the general election were held in April, privatisation
was more likely to feature in the Tory manifesto than in a white paper.
Officials were keen to play down reported differences between Mr John Major,
the prime minister, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, about the
form of privatisation. They emphasised the complexity of issues such as the
fare structure in a privatised network which had still to be tackled.
Ministers were said still to be aiming for full privatisation.
Mr Major said some technical problems, including safety issues, had still to
be sorted out, and the white paper 'may or may not' be published before the
election.
The delay is the third setback for the white paper, which was promised last
summer to arrive by the end of last year.
Mr Major insisted that the Tories would still go ahead with the
privatisation of British Rail. 'That privatisation will proceed, there
should be no doubt,' he said.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Dublin 'concern' on IRA deaths
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the four IRA men shot dead by the Army minutes after an attack on a
Northern Ireland police station had been cleared at a London court last year
of gun-running charges, it emerged yesterday.
Kevin O'Donnell, 21, was arrested in London in May 1990. He later told an
Old Bailey jury that he had no knowledge of weapons found in his car and was
subsequently acquitted.
The Dublin government yesterday expressed concern about the shootings, as Mr
David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, predicted an early meeting
between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the
new Irish premier.
An armed IRA gang attacked the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Coalisland
station at about 10.35pm on Sunday. Minutes later there was an exchange of
gunfire near the town.
The RUC said: 'Soldiers in uniform encountered a number of vehicles and
armed men at Dernagh crossroads, at a car park, at St Patrick's Roman
Catholic church. There was an exchange of gunfire. Four men were killed, two
were wounded and are in hospital under police guard. A soldier was wounded
and is in hospital.'
'A heavy 12.7mm machine-gun, mounted on a hijacked lorry, was recovered at
the scene along with several AK47 rifles,' the RUC added.
All those killed are understood to have been members of the IRA's East
Tyrone 'brigade'. The unit has lost several members in confrontations with
the security forces, including eight who were shot dead at Loughall, South
Armagh, nearly five years ago. It is believed that soldiers had been
monitoring the 'brigade' for several weeks.
The Rev William McCrae, Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, supported the
'effective engagement' of terrorists, saying it would save lives. 'I trust
this is the commencement of a vigorous and determined security initiative.'
Mr Francie Molloy, a Sinn Fein councillor, alleged that the deaths arose
from a 'deliberate shoot-to-kill policy' by the Army.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday assured Mr Andrews that
the government would continue to treat Northern Ireland as a priority
problem.
At a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Lisbon Mr Hurd told his Irish
counterpart that Mr Major would continue his involvement in all-party talks
on the province.
Police yesterday discovered a suspected IRA underground arms bunker in the
Irish Republic. About 1,000 rounds of ammunition and five magazines were
found in a bunker beneath a cowshed on a farm near the town of Abbeyfeale,
on the border of County Kerry and County Limerick.
A 17-year-old Protestant man was shot dead last night when a gunman opened
fire inside a video club in north Belfast.
The attack happened in the Upper Crumlin Road district. The shot man was a
member of staff in the video club.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Big energy users seek nuclear cap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE consumers of electricity will today ask Mr John Wakeham, the energy
secretary, to cut their bills by capping the subsidy they pay to the nuclear
industry.
A group of large customers, including Blue Circle Cement and United
Engineering Steel, has already threatened to stop paying the subsidy, which
represents 11 per cent of their electricity bills, in April.
The Major Energy Users Council is meeting Mr Wakeham in the first of a
series of talks intended to resolve the row over the rise in large
consumers' bills since the electricity industry was privatised in 1990.
Council representatives said that capping the subsidy was one way of getting
bills down to the level enjoyed by their European competitors.
The large users indicated that refusing to pay the levy was a tactic to show
they believed that the government, which collects the levy, was to blame for
the high bills, rather than the generators.
Council members said the group was disturbed that the price at which Nuclear
Electric was offering power - about 2.6p a unit - was being used by National
Power and PowerGen as a benchmark to determine the price at which they would
sell to large users.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Waldegrave outlines HIV compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT compensation for people infected with HIV, the virus that can
lead to Aids, during National Health Service blood transfusions and tissue
transfers, was announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, health
secretary.
The package, which will cost about Pounds 12m, follows a Pounds 42m scheme
announced in November 1990 to help haemophiliacs who suffered in the same
way. There were reports late last year of HIV infection in 74 people who had
blood transfusions or tissue transfers.
The maximum payment, for infected people with dependent children, will be
Pounds 80,500.
Mr Waldegrave said that payments would be made as soon as possible, although
further work had to be done on the mechanism for handling individual claims.
Mr Benet Hytner QC is to chair a panel of experts to consider cases where
necessary.
Mr Waldegrave said the government did not accept the argument for a general
scheme of 'no fault' compensation for medical accidents, but ministers had
decided to treat patients infected with HIV as a special case.
The move follows an intensive parliamentary campaign on their behalf.
Labour welcomed the change in the government's position, although it
criticised the delay in reaching the decision.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, suggested the shift 'may well have more
to do with the approaching election than with the existing injustice to
people tragically and accidentally infected with HIV'.
Mrs Margaret Jay, director of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The
government's decision is welcome, but late. It could have saved long months
of unnecessary hardship by making this announcement earlier.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / FT London Motor Conference: Rover chief attacks government
over economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP attack on the govern-ment's handling of the economy was delivered
yesterday by Mr George Simpson, chairman of the Rover vehicles group and
deputy chief executive of its parent, British Aerospace.
Blaming the recession on the economic policy of Mr Nigel Lawson, the former
chancellor, he called for a national industrial strategy such as in Japan or
Germany.
Mr Simpson told the Financial Times London Motor Conference that if such a
strategy were not created 'the possibility of Britain re-emerging as a
significant industrial force in the new Europe seems to me to be very remote
indeed'.
The 'first lesson' the government needed to learn was the 'urgent' need to
reduce the relative volatility of the economy compared to those of its
international competitors.
While the government could not insulate the UK from global economic
upheavals, 'they could - as others do - manage the domestic economy in such
a way as to iron out the excessive fluctuations which continue to
characterise macro-economic conditions in the UK'.
Mr Simpson added: 'Surely, if Nigel Lawson had handled the economy
differently a few years ago we would not have seen the explosive growth in
demand and the loss of control of inflation with the consequent need to
raise interest rates to a level, the only consequence of which could be the
onset of a sharp and deep recession.'
Mr Simpson called for improved quality of information about the economy, and
much more 'continuous and effective' communication between government and
industry.
He said: 'We continue to be faced with economic models with an inbuilt
capacity for forecast fallibility . . . with politically influenced Treasury
statements . . . and with opinion-based surveys with dubious statistical and
research basis.
'There is a very clear need to establish in the country a range of
independent, reliable, consistent economic forecast data.'
He made clear his belief that the motor industry could not escape partial
responsibility for the reduced profits - and in some cases record losses -
from the sharp decline in UK vehicle sales. In spite of all the lessons some
UK-based manufacturers had handled the recession badly. They had been
unrealistic about the effects of recession, cutting back too little and too
late. The industry needed to become more flexible and quicker to adopt
Japanese lean-production methods. A firm prediction that Honda will move
fairly quickly to production of 200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 300m plant
under construction at Swindon, Wiltshire - twice the officially-declared
capacity - was made yesterday by Professor Garel Rhys, a senior motor
industry economist.
The forecast was based on the size of component purchases Honda has
indicated it will make in Europe, and on the economy-of-scale disadvantage
the plant would otherwise face in comparison with Japanese competitors in
the UK.
Prof Rhys, of Cardiff Business School, told the conference that Honda
envisages spending between Pounds 600m and Pounds 800m a year in full
production. Toyota was planning spending of about Pounds 700m at its
200,000-cars-a-year plant due to come on stream in Burnaston, Derbyshire,
and Nissan Pounds 850m at the 300,000-cars-a-year level in Sunderland.
Because of this, said Prof Rhys, it was 'virtually inconceivable' that Honda
would not move to at least 200,000 units annually, perhaps by the mid-90s.

FT  18 FEB 92 / FT Cable and Satellite Conference: EC fears row over sports
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE is likely to mount on the European Community in the wake of the
winter Olympic games to legislate on the issue of exclusive television
rights to sporting events, a European commissioner warned yesterday.
There have been protests about the exclusive television rights to both the
winter and summer Olympics bought by the European Broadcasting Union, and
about the subsequent sale of exclusive satellite rights to Eurosport, which
consists of a number of broadcasting union members.
Mr Jean Dondelinger, the EC commissioner responsible for audio-visual
policy, told the Financial Times Cable and Satellite Conference in London
yesterday the present approach was 'clearly not the right way' to serve the
market.
The commission had been reluctant to intervene immediately under competition
rules and possibly interfere with programmes. 'What appears to be clear is
that in future the question of access (to rights) still needs a solution,'
said Mr Dondelinger, adding that possible legislation would be considered
later this year.
Mr Dondelinger was answering questions after emphasising that the challenges
posed by the development of high-definition television in Europe were as
great for programme-makers as for equipment manufacturers. 'What the viewer
will want is high quality wide-screen programmes on wide-screen sets,' Mr
Dondelinger said. 'One without the other would be waste of time, effort and
money.'
He also argued that as demand for satellite television increased, the best
possible management of the orbital positions of satellites would be needed
to ensure that viewers received the best pictures and sound at the best
prices.
Mr Jean Grenier, director-general of Eutelsat, the European satellite
organisation, said it planned to locate two satellites in the same orbit.
This meant that about 40 channels could be received with a single dish from
the same orbital position.
The decision, likely to be taken soon, is a clear sign that Eutelsat is
fighting back against the Astra television system. Astra plans to offer 48
channels on a single dish by locating three satellites in virtually the same
orbital position.
Mr Grenier said tests on interference between the two satellite systems
showed that British Sky Broadcasting channels, in which Pearson, publishers
of the Financial Times has a stake, would not be affected by interference as
Astra had previously feared.
Eutelsat still believed, however, that while 60cm satellite dishes could be
used in certain conditions, 80cm dishes were needed to protect against all
risk of interference.
Mr Gerard Le Febvre, director of strategy at CLT, the Luxembourg-based
broadcaster, said that since 1987 the total audience share of public-service
broadcasters in Europe had declined 62 per cent to 35 per cent last year. A
new role for some public-service broadcasters would be to broadcast new
services worldwide via satellite.
Mr Le Febvre said that cable would be the biggest television growth area in
the 1990s. He predicted that in each country there would only be one
national public-service channel with one or two competing pay channels, up
to three private general-interest channels in each language area and a
growing number of special-interest satellite channels.

Liquid assets: a scheme to build offices, shops and flats at Paddington
Basin in west London (above) has won detailed planning permission from
Westminster City Council, Vanessa Houlder writes.
British Waterways, the public utility which runs the canal system, and
Trafalgar House Developments intend to develop the site during the second
half of the decade.
The completion of the first phase will coincide with the opening of the
Heathrow Express, a British Rail line from Paddington to Heathrow Airport,
due to open in 1996. The last phase will coincide with the opening of
CrossRail, the link between Paddington, Liverpool Street, and eastern
England, due to open in 1999.
The 13-acre project, designed by Building Design Group and Skidmore Owings &amp;
Merrill, is adjacent to Paddington Station and will include 1.2m sq ft of
offices, 100,000 sq ft of shops and restaurants, and 236 flats.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Arthur Young is fined Pounds 100,000 by regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR YOUNG, the accountancy firm, was yesterday fined Pounds 100,000 by
its regulatory body for failing to highlight 'seriously misleading' figures
in the 1984 accounts of Milbury, the collapsed house-building group
controlled by Mr Jim Raper.
The penalty is the largest yet imposed through the Joint Disciplinary
Scheme, the self-regulatory mechanism of the institutes of chartered
accountants in England, Wales and Scotland, and the Association of Certified
Accountants.
A committee of inquiry set up under the disciplinary scheme said Arthur
Young, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, 'fell below the standard which
should be displayed by, and which may reasonably be expected of, a firm of
chartered accountants serving as auditors of a public company'.
Mr David Brierley and Mr Christopher Wilson, two directors of Milbury who
are chartered accountants, were also 'admonished' by the committee, which
launched its inquiry after a critical report by the Department of Trade and
Industry on the company was published in 1988.
Milbury collapsed in 1985 leaving Pounds 15m owing to creditors after
issuing annual accounts for 1984 which showed pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.1m, and interim results which referred to increased operating profits and
favourable expectations.
The DTI criticised the Stock Exchange, Arthur Young and individuals
associated with the company. Its report said Mr Raper was 'a devious man
(whose) motivation is out-and-out self-interest'.
Arthur Young was accused by the DTI of failing to ensure that Milbury's
accounts complied with accounting standards, with the result that its
profits were 'materially inflated'.
The disciplinary scheme concluded that the treatment of an acquisition and
loans held by the company breached accepted accounting standards; that
policies for interest and advertising costs were 'inappropriate and
imprudent'; and that the 1984 annual report gave a misleading impression of
cash balances.
It added that it had 'taken account of the absence of any acknowledgement by
Arthur Young of their failings during the committee's inquiries'.
Arthur Young has also been asked to contribute Pounds 40,000 towards the
costs of the proceedings. Although it no longer exists, its partners at the
time of the final audit remain liable.
Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young who was not connected
with the former Arthur Young, said yesterday he was 'clearly disappointed'.
The firm would probably pay the fine but, he added, 'we believe the accounts
did give a true and fair view at the time.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Further university places to be funded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTRA 18,000 university places will be funded next year, the University
Funding Council said yesterday. This is double the increase previously
announced.
Universities fear that the increase will lead to a sharp deterioration in
teaching quality unless extra resources are provided.
The council, a quango which distributes state grants to universities,
announced the extra places as part of an 8.5 per cent increase in funding
for university teaching in 1992-93. Funds for research will rise by 11 per
cent, to be distributed on a more selective basis than previously.
The extra places represent a 6 per cent increase on the current quota,
taking the number of funded places to 322,000. The extra students have been
allocated to universities with the lowest unit costs.
Professor Graeme Davies, funding council chief executive, said: 'We have
rewarded those institutions that are doing most to provide extra places at
lowest cost.'
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said, however, that
universities faced a 1.5 per cent cut in teaching funds, allowing for
inflation and the extra students.
The funding council says this is a reasonable efficiency gain, but Dr David
Harrison, committee chairman, said: 'More than 1,500 extra teaching staff
will be needed to teach the 18,000 new students if class sizes are not to
rise even further and staff are still to have time for research.'
Research funding will be concentrated on institutions and departments with
high scores in the UFC's assessment of research quality.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Tokyo sells Dollars 500m to strengthen yen

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan sold about Dollars 500m on Tokyo's foreign exchange market
yesterday in a co-ordinated move with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
which helped push the dollar down sharply against the yen.
The unusually large sale brought the dollar down from Y128.28 to Y126.93
against the yen.
The move comes at a time when Japan's trade surplus has been surging to high
levels, to the embarrassment of the government, and highlights attempts by
authorities to alleviate foreign criticism by strengthening the yen.
A Ministry of Finance official said later that the yen had deviated from
Japan's economic fundamentals. Financial policymakers of the Group of Seven
agreed a range of Y123 to Y124 for the dollar at last month's meeting in New
York.
The Tokyo stock and bond markets reacted favourably to the move, as market
participants associated the higher yen with lower inflationary pressure, and
lower interest rates. The No 129 10-year benchmark bond closed down 8.5
percentage points at 5.375 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 index closed above
the psychologically important 21,000 level.
The bank hinted at further dollar sales if necessary.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Bush slated for stalling on global warming deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration has come under attack for stonewalling efforts to
win a worldwide agreement on global warming at the Earth Summit due to take
place in Rio de Janeiro in June.
Senator Albert Gore, one of the leading spokesmen for the opposition
Democrats on environmental issues, said the administration had rejected a
policy of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions - one of the factors thought
to contribute to global warming - at 1990 levels.
'Our position is now different from the rest of the world. There are 139
countries on one side. There is one country, led by the Bush administration,
on the other side,' Mr Gore said, citing a document faxed to him by someone
within the administration. Mr Gore also attacked President George Bush for
not attending the summit.
Mr Bush's stance on environmental issues was fiercely criticised in a debate
on Sunday between the five major candidates for the Democratic party's
presidential nomination.
One of the Democrat candidates, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, said:
'Every one of us believes that the president of the US should go to the Rio
conference and say: 'The US has been lagging on agreeing to global standards
on global warming and we are going to agree right now with the Europeans on
reducing carbon dioxide emissions, increasing fuel efficiency standards and
whatever we have to do to meet a common standard.''
Mr William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the US
wanted to sign a treaty in Rio, but cautioned that the scientific evidence
on global warming was not conclusive. 'We certainly will be prepared to deal
on the issue of global warming. The US very much wants to see a framework
convention,' Mr Reilly said.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Garcia is chosen as party chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERU'S former president, Mr Alan Garca, has been elected head of the
country's biggest political party, the American Popular Revolutionary
Alliance (Apra), only weeks after being cleared of charges of illegal
personal enrichment while in office.
Mr Garca, who led an Apra administration from 1985-90, was elected secretary
general by popular acclaim during the party's annual congress at the weekend
in the northern city of Trujillo.
The delegates' choice put an end to the ambitions of Mr Luis Alva Castro, Mr
Garca's chief rival, within the party. He has been secretary general for the
past three years.
By threatening not to accept the offered position unless his conditions were
met, Mr Garca succeeded in placing his own candidates in key party
positions. Senator Mercedes Cabanillas becomes his second-in-command and Mr
Abel Salinas, senator and former economy minister, the secretary for
planning.
In December a supreme court judge decided there was insufficient evidence to
proceed with charges that Mr Garca illegally enriched himself during his 12
years in public life, particularly during his presidency.
Mr Garca vehemently denied the charges.
But there was concern in some Apra circles that Mr Garca's choice of Mr
Agustin Mantilla, former interior minister, for the position of
'organisation secretary' would lead to the militarisation of the Apra party.
Apra remains the largest party.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA and Ukraine agreed provisionally yesterday on how a Ukrainian
currency could be introduced without disrupting the rouble zone.
The agreement between senior officials could signal a breakthrough in
relations between the former Soviet republics, although it has still to win
approval from the respective governments.
But Mr Volodymir Hryniov, deputy president of the Ukrainian parliament,
said: 'We have no doubt this document will be taken as the framework for the
introduction of our currency.' Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, deputy chairman of the
Russian parliament, said he was sure the deal would be signed.
The delegations were among 11 from post-Soviet states at a conference to
discuss how best to organise trade and monetary policy. It was part of an
attempt by the European Commission, the Soros Foundation, the Centre for
European Policy Studies and the London School of Economics to sponsor as
common an economic space as possible among the republics.
The 'code of conduct' agrees:
It is the right of all sovereign states to issue currency;
Substitution of old currencies should be 'quick, complete, and
non-discriminatory';
All roubles collected should be remitted to the Russian central bank;
Monetary assets of other rouble zone residents will be treated in a way
which minimises damage to all parties;
The country issuing the new currency will inform rouble zone central banks
of its programme, subject to confidentiality on the exact date and rate of
substitution.
AP reports from Kiev: Ukraine took control of a Soviet air force division
yesterday, three days after a group of pilots 'defected' to Russia, Tass
news agency said. Ukraine's Defence Ministry could not confirm the report,
which Tass said was the first time a strategic force under the Commonwealth
of Independent States had withdrawn from central command.
Reuter reports from Madrid: Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy premier, and Mr
Claudio Aranzadi, Spanish industry minister, said Spain would release the
remaining Dollars 1bn of a Dollars 1.5bn credit line extended to the Soviet
Union in November 1990 for three years.

FT  18 FEB 92 / EC attempts to revive Yugoslav peace process: Ministers seek
to steer course between claims of feuding republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday sought to manoeuvre itself into a better
position to re-start the Yugoslav peace conference in parallel with the
arrival of a United Nations peacekeeping force.
The EC's diplomatic moves came as Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United
Nations secretary-general, formally asked the UN Security Council in New
York to despatch a force of nearly 14,000 to Yugoslavia, initially for 12
months.
As part of a carefully balanced diplomatic package of decisions in Lisbon,
EC foreign ministers endorsed deployment of the UN force to keep peace
between Serbs and Croats.
'It is a risky enterprise,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, 'but
the risks of not proceeding (with the UN deployment) are greater than the
risks of proceeding.'
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign minister, said: 'The arrival of
the (UN) blue helmets should be the moment to give new impetus to the peace
conference.'
To this end, EC ministers sought to steer a more careful course between the
various feuding Yugoslav republics:
Serbia's leadership was praised for its 'constructive' attitude recently, in
particular towards arrival of UN forces. Ministers effectively told
President Slobodan Milosevic that Serbia can expect to regain EC trade
preferences if he subscribes in writing to the EC's call for inviolability
of existing frontiers as the basis for a peace settlement.
Ministers proposed that European and national parliamentarians, as well as
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, should supervise the
forthcoming referendum on Bosnia-Hercegovina's independence. The ministers
seem to want to keep their 200-strong team of official EC monitors out of a
republic which could become the next crucible of conflict. Ministers dodged
recognition of Macedonia, as strongly requested by their Greek colleague, Mr
Andonis Samaras. But Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's minister, tartly
reminded Mr Samaras of the need to undramatise the issue. Athens fears the
republic's use of the name Macedonia will stir irredentist feeling in
northern Greece.
Laura Silber and Judy Dempsey add: Mr Milan Babic, president of the
self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina in south-western Croatia, yesterday
softened his stance on the UN troops, saying they would not meet 'organised
armed resistance'. But their safety could not be guaranteed, he warned.
Speaking in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Mr Babic said he would accept a
UN decision to send peacekeepers, but added 'it would be extremely
difficult' to disarm the 30,000 Serb reservists and irregulars from Krajina.
He rejected some elements of the UN plan on the grounds that it treated
Krajina as part of Croatia. But he claimed that the UN secretary-general had
met some of his objections by promising that Krajina would not be placed
under Croatian jurisdiction, and that the peacekeepers would stay for at
least a year.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Lloyd's in cash talks with Bank: Commercial lenders may be
asked to provide backing for Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER, ROBERT PESTON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London, government ministers and the Bank of England are
discussing measures to ease a liquidity crunch at the insurance market,
according to a senior broker involved.
The exploratory talks may result in a formal request to the Bank that it
should encourage commercial banks to provide loans to hard-pressed Names -
the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's.
Another possibility would be the setting up of a commercial banking
syndicate to lend to the market's central fund which pays those claims that
Names are unable to meet.
The broker said the price of official help may be an end to the system of
self-regulation, introduced by the Lloyd's Act of 1982. A government
official said yesterday: 'The Bank of England has not yet received a formal
request though it would not be surprising if one was made.'
The news of the talks coincided with a meeting of between 20 and 25 MPs and
peers with Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's.
The MPs, who subjected him to some tough questioning, were concerned about
last week's House of Commons allegations of malpractices in the market.
The market's 300 or so syndicates - groups of Names - have been hit by heavy
claims, including those resulting from a typhoon in Japan last September.
Losses are also continuing from US pollution and industrial injury awards
and a series of catastrophes between 1988 and 1990.
Many commercial banks have withdrawn credit lines to the insurance market,
making it more difficult for syndicates to meet liabilities.
'There is a serious sterling shortage on the market,' said one agent.
According to the broker involved in the talks, Lloyd's needs a funding
arrangement to meet some Pounds 2bn in losses expected to fall due over the
next 18 months. The refusal of some Names to meet losses could aggravate
these problems. Some 600 Names - mostly members of catastrophe reinsurance
syndicates - are reported to be seeking a court injunction this week to
prevent Lloyd's from drawing down on deposits that they hold with their
agents.
The banks may be asked by the Bank of England to provide funds to shore up
the market in the same way as they are sometimes pressed to provide
liquidity to save ailing companies. A Bank official, however, said there was
no possibility of it providing funds from its own resources.
Commenting on expectations that the market's loss for 1989 - not disclosed
until later this year - will be Pounds 1.35bn, a Lloyd's agent, or syndicate
manager, said: 'I just don't know where the funds to meet this loss are
going to come from.'
Lloyd's insists the solvency of the market - ultimately backed by Pounds
18bn of assets provided by the market's 22,500 Names - is intact.
'Solvency is not an issue, but we do have a shortage of liquid funds,' said
an official at Lloyd's Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and
back-up services to the market.
Lloyd's is also seeking to restore confidence among Names, which has been
bruised by recent losses. The number of Names at Lloyd's has fallen by
nearly a third over the past four years.
'If you have a confident liquid market then you have yourself a business,'
said the broker.
Some of the MPs at yesterday's meeting said they favoured change in the
regulatory regime. Lloyd's executives were left 'in no doubt whatsoever'
that MPs believed that the market needed independent regulation, according
to Mr Richard Page, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry
committee.
Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, complained about his fellow MPs'
outbursts. 'I have been going on Parliamentary visits for 29 1/2 years and
never heard the like in terms of rudeness to our hosts,' he said.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Steep rise in complaints over life assurance sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP PRACTICE among life assurance sales agents is rising steeply,
according to Lautro, the self-regulatory body that oversees the industry.
In its annual report on monitoring and enforcement in the year to June 1991,
Lautro recorded a big increase in consumer complaints, mostly about
over-selling and the sale of unsuitable products. Complaints rose 77 per
cent to more than 4,000.
Lautro has changed some membership rules to curb excesses. Some of the
increase in complaints could reflect growing consumer awareness of the
regulatory body, Lautro said, but there was little doubt that sharp practice
had increased.
For instance, Lautro found a majority of life assurance companies that rely
heavily on tied sales agents - roughly half of all life companies  - 'have
serious compliance shortcomings'.
The companies have typically failed to comply with rules on checking
references, curbing the enthusiasm of new sales agents or providing proper
training. Failure to comply with these rules is closely linked to
mis-selling.
Tied agents are those not employed directly by life assurance companies but
who sell the products of one company exclusively and receive commission for
each policy they sell. Typically, insurance companies pay far higher
commissions to tied agents than to independent financial advisers who sell
the best product of a group of companies.
A recent study by the Securities and Investments Board found that up to 44
per cent of policies sold by tied agents were cancelled within the first two
years, an indication that the policy was mis-sold in the first place.
Lautro also found a large increase in the number of investors questioning
the advice they had received on personal pensions, particularly where sales
agents had urged the transfer out of attractive occupational pension schemes
into less attractive private ones.
'Company representatives too often fail to make a sufficiently detailed
realistic or objective analysis of the relative merits of transferring their
prospective investors to a personal pension or leaving them in their
occupational scheme,' Lautro said in its report.
It said the number of complaints about personal pensions could understate
the extent of the problem. Pensions generally are so complex that few people
know whether they have been misled.

FT  18 FEB 92 / US funds job plan for nuclear experts in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is to provide Dollars 25m (Pounds 14m) for an internationally
sponsored 'job centre' in Russia for nuclear scientists from the former
Soviet Union.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, said yesterday, after talks with
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, that Washington would contribute the
money to discourage top scientists from selling their skills abroad. The
scientists earn about Rbs1,200 a month.
A statement issued with Russia and Germany said the centre would be 'a
clearing house for developing, selecting, funding and monitoring projects
that would be carried out . . . at facilities located in the Russian
Federation and other interested Commonwealth states.' The scientists would
'redirect their talents to non-military endeavours'.
The US also offered to supply 25 special rail containers to transport
nuclear warheads to Russia from other republics.
The European Community immediately gave its backing to the International
Science and Technology Centre. Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs
commissioner, told foreign ministers of the Twelve in Lisbon that the
Community had earmarked Ecu50m (Pounds 35.6m) of 1991 technical aid for
nuclear safety in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and some of this
could be used to fund the nuclear job centre.
Professor V. Mikhailov, head of the former Soviet Union's military nuclear
programme, said last month that 100,000 people were employed making atomic
weapons. Between 2,000 and 3,000 possessed key nuclear secrets. Such experts
are banned from leaving the country, but the west still fears that military
spending cuts will turn them into atomic mercenaries.
Prof Mikhailov said skilled Russians were needed to dismantle the redundant
nuclear weapons; without them, the country could be turned into 'one big
Chernobyl'.
The US and Russia agreed to keep working on further cuts in strategic
nuclear weapons. Mr Yeltsin said he expected the matters being discussed
would be ready for a formal agreement at a summit with President Bush in
July.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Judge in Blue Arrow trial fuels legal row: Four receive
suspended sentences amid calls for review of how fraud cases are handled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Blue Arrow trial judge yesterday joined calls for a review of how large
fraud cases should be handled in the courts as he gave suspended sentences
to the four financial advisers convicted of conspiracy to defraud over the
1987 rights issue.
Mr Justice McKinnon warned that trial by jury in these cases would be at
risk unless the burden they imposed on everyone involved was reduced.
Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed and Mr Nicholas Wells, former County
NatWest executives, were all sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, suspended
for two years. Mr Martin Gibbs, a former Phillips &amp; Drew director, was
sentenced to 12 months, suspended for two years.
All four were convicted last Friday of conspiracy to defraud over their
handling of the rights issue after a trial lasting more than a year and the
most expensive criminal prosecution ever held in the UK.
There were sighs of relief at the sentences from relatives and friends in
the packed public gallery at a court in the City. Mr Justice McKinnon said
the four had not planned to break the law. He denied they were getting off
lightly.
The judge's uncompromising remarks about the handling of the case will add
to demands for a radical rethink of how complex City fraud cases are dealt
with by regulators and the legal system.
He said the trial had placed an unacceptable burden on everyone concerned,
including the jury. He told the court: 'What is beyond all doubt is that all
involved in this case have had to endure what no one in our courts should be
called upon to cope with. Many lessons will have to be learnt from this
trial about the proper way these cases are presented if trial by jury is to
survive in cases such as these.'
Although Mr Justice McKinnon said he was not apportioning blame for the
length of the trial, his remarks were widely seen as critical of the Serious
Fraud Office which brought the prosecution.
Despite the jury's decision to convict the four men, the judge made no costs
order, leaving the SFO to fund its Pounds 1.9m prosecution. Lawyers saw this
decision as highly unusual.
Mr Wells and Mr Gibbs both left the court without making a statement. But Mr
Jonathan Cohen, County's former chief executive, told reporters: 'This has
been a devastating week for me and my family. I reiterate that no action
that I sanctioned I felt would prejudice anyone, but I realise that the jury
reached the conclusion that I must have done.
'There are many things I would like to say about the bringing of this
prosecution, but I have been advised that since I am going to appeal in the
hope of clearing my name it would not be appropriate to comment at this
time.'
All four men confirmed their intention to appeal against their convictions.
Should any of them succeed in overturning their convictions, any return to
City careers would depend on convincing regulators that they were fit and
proper people to re-enter the City.
The judge's decision not to imprison the four convicted men was not
unexpected since all had been allowed home on bail after being convicted.
Mr Justice McKinnon said the four were guilty of a serious offence since
many millions of Blue Arrow shares had been bought at the falsely inflated
price following their decision to support the issue secretly themselves.
They had not acted for personal gain nor intended others to lose. They had
acted under pressure and from a desire to help Blue Arrow, their client, and
their own companies.
Ms Mo Mowlam, who speaks for Labour on City matters, said the outcome of the
trail represented 'a waste of Pounds 35m of taxpayers' money' and the

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (10): Tide is coming in - Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JUDGED by the number of quoted companies with their headquarters in
north-east England, Tyne and Wear's economy could be thought to be going
backwards. There are only 25 - and only 10 of these are survivors from 1982,
when there were seven more in total.
Moreover, an analysis by Price Waterhouse, the accountants, shows that the
top five by turnover - Northumbrian Water, Northern Electric, Barratt, Vaux
and Cowie - accounted for 75 per cent of turnover and 59 per cent of
employees.
On the face of it, this is not good news: the best regional economies have a
wide mix of locally-headquartered companies by size and type. West
Yorkshire, for example has about 80.
But the nature of the 'quoteds' does not tell the story - any more than the
depth of water at half-tide tells whether the sea is coming in or going out.
In Tyne and Wear, a sea change has occurred in the past 12 years and the
tide is now quite obviously coming in.
There is even evidence in the numbers of quoted companies, for the shares of
six of them are quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market, the way to go
public for medium-sized or smaller companies with potential for growth.
Other evidence can be found at Price Waterhouse's Newcastle office block in
the shape of the practice itself. As Mr Bill Teasdale, a partner through 12
years of change, puts it: 'In 1980 we had a typical audit-based practice
with 100 people. Tyneside had a very narrow economic base.'
Price Waterhouse now has nearly 250 people in Newcastle and 19 local
partners, compared with six partners 10 years ago. There is still an
insolvency department, but it has not grown further. The firm has a small
but busy corporate finance section. Other accountancy practices in
Newcastle, such as KPMG Peat Marwick's, have also grown and become much more
pro-active.
Wise Speke, the region's biggest stockbroker, has become a strong exporter
from the region of financial services to corporate clients - notably
competitively-priced share dealing and related counselling and advisory
services for employees.
It was bought by the London-based Sturge group in 1987 but is master of its
northern destiny with 130 of its 230 staff in Newcastle - up a third in five
years - as it has developed from its strong private client base into niche
corporate markets.
Growth in financial and professional services does not come out of thin air.
Local demand has been growing.
Mr David Williams, who heads the Newcastle office of 3i, the investment
capital provider, says: 'In the five years to March 1991 we invested Pounds
60m in northern business, much of it on Tyneside. It has been growth rather
than buyouts, which have never been a strong business here.
'I feel more optimistic now than for some time. Nearly all our investments
are healthy. Most are not at full capacity because of the recession, but
they are not in distress. Since September 1990 our failures have been less
than 2 per cent in numbers and less than 1 per cent in terms of our total
investment in about 200 companies. The fact that 3i has such a healthy
business is evidence of local strength. It also reflects that many people
here had a big dose of reality in the early 1980s. They are better managers
now and plan their businesses well.'
While this suggests a strengthening diversification at the smaller end of
the industrial and commercial spectrum, Tyne and Wear nevertheless needs
healthy big businesses to provide the main economic building blocks.
Evidence of health is also strong here, in spite of recent job losses
because of recession in some sectors.
Press Offshore, soon to be renamed Amec Offshore, currently has a Pounds
300m order book. On Agip's Tiffany contract, said to be the biggest single
turnkey project in offshore construction history, it is the lead contractor.
Because of the contract's tight timescale, Press is dovetailing work on the
engineering, construction and hook-up phases, an innovation which it hopes
will give it an edge in competition for future orders.
Pallion Engineering - an unusual combination of Anglo-Greek investors,
former shipyard shop stewards, businessmen, Mr Bob Clay, the left-wing
Labour party MP for Sunderland North, and the Church of England - announced
in December it had clinched its first contract: steel fabrication work for a
flue gas desulphurisation project.
The consortium fought for more than two years to prevent the demolition of
Sunderland's last shipyards and create new demand for local shipyard
workers' skills. It bought the former Pallion shipyard from British
Shipbuilders in mid-1991 for Pounds 2m.
One reason why numbers of 'local quoteds' declined was the merger into the
Rolls-Royce group of NEI, now renamed the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power
Group. Management by Mr Terry Harrison is as local as ever and 7,500 Tyne
and Wear employees are a considerable source of local spending power.
Mr Gerry James, spokesman for the business, says: 'Unless recession is truly
international, it doesn't have much effect on us. We help to insulate the
regional Tyne and Wear economy because most of our sales are exported.'
Tyneside is also surviving the peace dividend. Swan Hunter has several
years' work and is employing 3,900 people at present, while the 850-strong
workforce of Vickers Defence Systems have five years' work for battle tanks
and recovery and infantry combat vehicles - and a successful Gulf war to
prove to export markets that its products do the job.
Of long-term significance, however, is that investment levels have been kept
up by such mainstays of the local economy, with the former NEI, Vickers and
Swan Hunter companies channelling resources into high technology to stay
competitive.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (9): Sunny side up, please - Social
difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE local authority economic development officer explains his stance on
Tyneside's social problems. 'When you go to see companies in the South you
give them a pretty positive picture of the area,' he says. 'But here, I
would be foolish to pretend there weren't problems.'
This approach to Tyne and Wear's deprived areas has been common among those
who anxiously seek to attract inward investment, in a bid to ameliorate the
very problems they find it delicate to discuss.
At the best of times, the area's economic regeneration bodies have been
touchy about its image, thinking it too grim; too negative. September's
riots in the West End of Newcastle and the Meadow Well estate in North
Shields were seen when they happened as a marketing calamity, a washing of
dirty linen in public.
In a sense, the riots happened at the least-worst time; the recession meant
there was little inward investment to be frightened off. The view has since
been promulgated locally that the 'events' had no impact, that similar
criminally-inspired incidents of little real significance were happening in
the south but were, most unfairly, less reported than Tyneside's. Even so,
any national mention of the riots still provokes unease.
The desire to present everything sunny side up is a mirror image of the
tendency, in some media quarters, to treat Tyneside's deprived areas as a
fascinating wen of squalor and hopelessness.
'They didn't want to hear the positive side of what we're doing,' complains
one woman campaigning for improvements in her area despite threats from the
local criminal network which resents any challenge to its power. She remains
bitter that a threat during the riots to petrol bomb her house was, briefly,
a 'good story' for a reporter phoning from a safe distance. She and her
friends are bitter too that the rising tide of crime, harassment and quiet
misery in their vandalised estate had gone largely unreported for years
before.
What the riots did highlight was the extent to which some areas have become
virtual ghettoes where people inhabit a different world from the far more
pleasant localities where other Tyne and Wear residents live. Many of the
latter have no direct contact with these grim estates, except through car
crime.
Newcastle's City Challenge submission for the West End, an area of 35,200
people, says that more than 50 per cent of its 16- to 24-year-olds are
jobless. The overall 23 per cent unemployment rate masks pockets of well
over 50 per cent. Only 2.1 per cent of pupils at the local comprehensive
obtain five or more GSCEs. Just 14.4 per cent of households are
owner-occupied; only 15 per cent have a car.
In Scotswood, within the Challenge area, a tenant-led survey revealed that
only 20 per cent of residents are in full-time work, and that one in four
homes reported a break-in in 1991. At the Meadow Well's primary school, at
the time of the riots, every pupil qualified for clothing grants.
'We took the kids to MetroLand once,' says a mother of five children at
Scotswood, where the streets look over the Tyne to the MetroCentre and its
funfair. 'We couldn't afford for them to go on any of the rides; it was so
disappointing.'
Her 17-year-old son has become involved in car crime. 'I lost him to the
street culture,' she says. She told the police of his activities and
suffered severe harassment from local youths for 'grassing'. Although still
nervous of going out even by day she is actively involved in the Scotswood
strategy steering group, working with the local authority to improve the
area. 'The reason we're fighting is for our kids,' she says. 'With the three
younger ones I tell them the world out there is a bad world.'
In the 1980s, Tyneside was dealt the full pack of government urban
initiatives, most designed to stimulate the economy by investment in bricks
and mortar. But long before the 1991 riots, recognition was growing that the
trickle-down effect was insufficient to tackle the scale of problems in
deprived areas. It had also become apparent that spending money on the
physical fabric was not on its own a solution.
A consensus has emerged, among bodies ranging from the TWDC and Labour
party-controlled local authorities to the groups of tenants - mostly women -
who are fighting for a better future, that progress can be made only if
local people have an active, leading role in improving their areas. 'It's
less top down and more bottom up,' says regional DTI director Pamela Denham.
'Empowering people is the word.'
Among the places where this theory is being tested is the Meadow Well, now
focus of a multi-agency initiative. A group of committed residents is
developing a community village concept, running in tandem with other
projects. There is also the start of a return to policing on foot and Mr
John Stevens, Northumbria's new Chief Constable, is bringing a fresh mind to
tackling crime.
One of the most influential experiments, begun in the late 80s, is the
Cruddas Park Initiative. Led by the private-sector Newcastle Initiative it
has focused the efforts of government departments, private companies, the
city council and residents on a small deprived area. It has transformed some
local people's lives by giving them a sense of achievement, a job and an
income.
This partnership concept is the nub of City Challenge, the new scheme of Mr
Michael Heseltine, Environment Secretary. 'The great advantage we have in
Newcastle is that the learning curve is already in place; a lot of people
have been working at this for a number of years,' says Mr Jonathan Blackie,
its City Challenge director.
All five Tyne and Wear councils are eligible to apply for the next round of
Challenge funding; all will. They hope to apply the lessons of Cruddas Park
and many other initiatives focused, in some cases for a decade, on problem
estates dotted throughout Tyne and Wear.
But is the private sector sufficiently big, and willing, to get deeply
enough involved in so many places? And will City Challenge be swimming
against the tide as local authority cuts mean pruned budgets for education,
probably the most important initiative of all?
Considerable efforts are being made to increase the involvement of business
with schools; the Tyneside TEC is spending Pounds 4m on business and
education partnerships.
Training, too, is central to many local initiatives. Among Newcastle City
Challenge's top priorities, for example, is the creation of a Pounds 1m
multi-agency training centre in the West End. Throughout Tyne and Wear the
TECs are involved in efforts to bring residents back into the labour market.
Pre-training courses, some linked directly to job opportunities, are
springing up to help those long out of the habit of work, or never in it, to
reach the stage of competing effectively for employment.
'The important thing is that people are trained for real jobs,' says Pamela
Denham. But are there going to be jobs for many of Tyne and Wear's 64,000
unemployed as the demand for unskilled labour dwindles?
'There's no jobs to be had outside self-employment,' says Colin Lamb,33, of
Newcastle, jobless seven years. Mr Lamb had a business idea  - a board game
he developed on the unemployment theme, called On Your Bike. He presented a
copy to Mr Norman Tebbit, there was a flurry of publicity, then the slow
discovery he could not break into the games market.
Despite his spent savings and a marriage broken by the strain, Mr Lamb, now
living on Pounds 39 a week of state benefits, is glad he tried. He firmly
believes his game is a winner but he does not think he is.
'It's the educated people who are working,' he says. 'I did Employment
Training and it was an utter waste of time.' He was sent on another training
course, got to the gate and turned away. 'I just knew it wasn't going to get
me anywhere. You lose heart.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (6): Still cracking problems - Tyne
and Wear Development Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE past few months have been trying times for the Tyne and Wear Development
Corporation: it had just published an attractive annual report last
September when Tyneside's riots made the document look like
self-congratulatory hyperbole.
Worse, by congratulating itself in the report for its community relations,
the corporation appeared to be out of touch with reality. Advertising and
promotional campaigns went into red-faced retreat while the corporation's
directors and officers took stock.
Any reappraisal, however, has been more about style than substance. The
corporation, which spends Pounds 50m a year as the government's main agency
for regenerating the Tyne and Wear economy, decided even as the riots raged
that it was not going to change tack. It believed then, as now, that its
policies had not failed and were already being vindicated.
'Riots would only represent a failure of policy if they happened in 10
years' time,' says Mr Alastair Balls, the chief executive.
'Most people's perception is that last September's disturbances were a
seven-day wonder. There is no reason to believe they will be repeated. They
were the work of a tiny minority and were mainly criminal in nature. People
are very angry about them. Action has now been taken by police and the local
communities to ensure they do not repeat themselves.'
Moreover, he sticks by the claim in the annual report that the corporation
has 'cracked the problem' of reconciling investor demand to local community
aspirations. He says this means that the mechanism to crack the problem is
in place, rather than the problems solved.
The mechanism revolves around community consultation and involvement in
developments. Relationships are sometimes fragile and hampered by lack of
community centres or obvious leaders to offset the power of 'community
gangs' but Mr Balls says there is no other way forward than to build on
whatever legitimate points of focus can be found, such as local schools.
What seems different now, however, is that the social problems are being
confronted more openly. Before the riots they were acknowledged but played
down so that investors would not be scared off.
The resultant 'talking up' of the area led critics to accuse the corporation
of obscuring crucial issues with hype. Although this rankled with some of
its senior figures - 'Marxist propaganda' was one retort - the riots have
forced issues more into the open.
'There are social problems and this cannot be gainsaid,' Mr Balls
acknowledges. The result is that the corporation now appears to be arguing
its case rather than merely promoting it. Indeed, the riots have been a
stern test of argument - and judged against other attempts at economic
development in Britain and in the US, Tyne and Wear's argument is a strong
one.
The corporation is now five years old and half way through its planned life.
It has adopted a 'string of pearls' approach to regeneration, reclaiming
more than 10 miles of separated, derelict waterside sites along the Tyne for
a business park, industrial areas and housing and leisure developments.
As with similar agencies in other British conurbations, it is its own
planning authority and can enforce land assembly through compulsory
purchase.
This has been crucial on Tyneside because development has long been stymied
by fragmented ownership of many miles of river bank. Newcastle Business
Park, where the corporation now has its own offices, proves the point: there
was a single landowner so it started filling up as soon as the corporation
had serviced it.
Similarly, a few miles down river, St Peter's Basin, an imaginative housing
and harbour development, was also completed rapidly.
These projects have testified to the corporation's competence - it even
rescued the hotel after Rush &amp; Tompkins, its builder, had gone bust - but Mr
Balls says developers need more than that.
'The one thing that gives the corporation clout is confidence among the
private sector that land really will be assembled. Nearly every major site
we have was in fragmented ownership. Unless people believe you can get it
together, they won't take an interest,' he says.
Completion of a fifth compulsory purchase public inquiry has therefore been
yet more evidence of earnestness. But perhaps more important was a long
struggle through the courts to beat off objections from Procter and Gamble
to the corporation's plans for East Quayside, which will help Newcastle
exploit the waterfront better.
The corporation spent about Pounds 300,000 to win. Mr Balls says it had to
be: losing would have frustrated land assembly and dented investor
confidence. By contrast, he says, the riots failed to make any real impact
on confidence at all, indicating the private sector's real priorities.
'We have 15 projects under way with developers building,' Mr Balls says. 'In
our view that is quite unusual in a recession and contrasts considerably
with elsewhere. The question is whether the area's economy is capable of
sustaining the developments so that there won't be an oversupply.
'We have been careful to try and ensure that the type of property we are
bringing to the market has been wanted. There is still a strong market for
top quality office accommodation in Newcastle. As long as we feed the market
at the right rate, we should fill it. This is about 150,000-250,000 sq ft a
year at present.'
The corporation also has what it hopes will be a science park approaching
completion - 150,000 sq ft of modern space in the middle of Newcastle.
Meanwhile, in Sunderland, the corporation owns two of the three sites
comprising the new enterprise zone and is building speculatively at a rate
of 75,000 sq ft a year to bring a measured volume to the market.
Since the sites are only half a mile from Nissan's factory, no one believes
there is much risk in building before end-users have been found.
Another high-profile Wearside project is a new campus for the polytechnic,
which will eventually transform itself into the University of Sunderland,
with close links to Nissan.
Hanging over this considerable progress, however, is the uncomfortable
problem of nearly every Tyneside site being hemmed against the river by
run-down or deprived neighbourhoods, sharpening the contrast being the haves
and the have-nots.
The riots may have been inspired by criminals, but they could not have taken
hold without genuine local grievances to fan the flames.
Typical unemployment rates are between 30 and 50 per cent and Mr Balls
acknowledges there will be serious consequences for the corporation if
opportunities do not materialise for local people.
Ominously, only a handful of about 800 jobs in Newcastle Business Park have
so far gone to local people. Mr Balls says that this is partly because some
of the incoming companies were relocating with their entire workforces.
Nevertheless, with just one exception, local people have only been able to
get menial jobs with one of the park's newcomers, despite a number of
well-paid white collar jobs with prospects being available. Several hundred
people were interviewed but only one showed enough potential to be taken on.
The scale of the problem is often not low levels of local skill, but none at
all. The corporation is paying for 'pre-recruitment training' to teach
people how to fill in forms, improve literacy and numeracy, and coach them
in how to dress and behave at interviews.
Attitude training is also proving important, to teach the importance of
punctuality and turning up for work regularly. Some incoming companies have
said they can cope with job training themselves - provided attitudes to work
are right in the first place.
If they are not, Mr Balls can rightly argue this is not the corporation's
fault but that of a wider society which has tolerated such levels of inner
city decline in the past and the concomitant growth of an underclass.
Addressing the problem now, however, is clearly going to hinge on the
corporation's community policies working. The riots could not have made that
clearer.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (8): Crucial strategic connection -
The Northern Development Company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE connection between Northumbrian Spring Water and Nissan may not be
immediately obvious, but it is strategic and has proved crucial to the
reconstruction of Tyne and Wear's economy.
The water is a local bottled brand and is what Dr John Bridge offers from
the fridge in his Newcastle office to visitors who feel in need of a
Perrier. Dr Bridge is chief executive of the Northern Development Company
(NDC). Inward investment is his main business.
Inward investment is itself about import substitution, which in turn
concerns not only large items such as cars and the factories that make them,
but everything needed to make the inward investment work: labour,
professional services, components, and office or canteen supplies, including
bottled water. Hence the link.
Its importance, however, is that it is no accident, but the result of a
deliberate policy prosecuted vigorously by the NDC. 'Local sourcing is
critical to developing the local economy and maximising the numbers of jobs
generated by any inward investment,' Dr Bridge says. 'We are not just
pushing sites and factories, but making sure a local supplier network is in
place when inward investment comes in.'
The NDC evolved from the North of England Development Council (NEDC) in the
wake of Nissan's arrival. The NEDC, regional agency for the
government-backed Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB), worked closely with local
authorities to win Nissan. The impressive display of teamwork was one of the
reasons why Nissan chose Tyne and Wear rather than competing areas where
local unity was less apparent.
By 1987, the government was encouraging the formation of the NDC as the
archetypal development agency it wanted to see for an English region, with
core funding from the IBB to market abroad, plus additional financial
support from county and borough councils and private sector subscribers .
That the experiment has worked is apparent all over a northern economic
region covering Tyne and Wear, Teesside, Northumberland, Durham and Cumbria
 -the NDC's territory. Two strategic investments in four years  - Nissan in
Tyne and Wear and Fujitsu in County Durham - have been followed or
accompanied by a substantial filling-in of the regional economy to service
them.
The number of Japanese companies in north-east England is approaching 50. Dr
Bridge puts the value of their investment at Pounds 1.7bn and 12,000 direct
jobs so far. 'We have our mechanism for attracting inward investment pretty
well established and generating results,' he says. 'Now we are putting more
resources into Korea and Taiwan and this is bearing fruit.
'This region needs one really strategic investment every four or five years.
We had Nissan in 1986, Fujitsu in 1990. We are now looking for Pounds 500m
and 1,000 jobs by about 1994.'
It is the coherence of its strategic economic overview and the generally
enthusiastic support for its policies from local authorities, industry and
commerce that marks the NDC out from similar bodies in England.
It is not all about inward investment: the NDC encouraged a local supplier
network for an indigenous and burgeoning offshore industry that has created
several thousand jobs in Tyne and Wear alone. It has also pulled together
local chambers of commerce and academics to produce a reasonably accurate
quarterly survey of regional economic trends.
About 400 private sector companies pay as much as Pounds 200 a year each to
the NDC. Sponsorship by some of them of individual events, promotions,
conferences and seminars has dropped off in the recession, but the base of
monetary and moral support is intact. The total budget of about Pounds 4.5m
comes mainly from the government via the IBB and local authorities.
Not everything is smooth: Sunderland recently sent its own civic delegation
to the Far East and a sub-committee has since concluded the NDC's
regionwide, broad brush approach makes the town too passive in trying to win
new jobs, so that it is not automatically included on every potential
investor's shortlist.
Sunderland is therefore considering 'enhancing our competitiveness by
intervening more directly in the inward investment market.' This looks like
a breaking of the ranks that have given the north real clout in a
competitive international market, but Dr Bridge is unfazed.
His experience is that working the Far East in particular is costly,
requiring continuous effort by permanent staff in established offices. 'If a
local authority has the resources and wants to send some councillors and
their wives on a trip, that's fine,' he says.
Economies of scale will almost certainly decide the issue, especially since
the NDC is an economy of scale in itself. For example, it has two civil
servants from the Department of Trade and Industry based in Great North
House, the NDC headquarters. 'We are trying to make sure we all avoid
duplication of effort,' Dr Bridge says.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (5): A powerful magnet - Tyneside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWCASTLE comes as a surprise to many first-time visitors.
Primed to expect - depending to their preconceptions - pit heaps, grime, a
concrete jungle or men in mufflers and flat caps, many are taken aback at
the city's handsome central conservation area, its fine shops and dozens of
restaurants.
Newcastle, unlike so many British urban centres which die after 6pm, has
retained a grip on its populace's thirst for leisure and entertainment,
whether than means eight pints of lager and a kebab or a night at the opera.
Regional capital of the north-east, its facilities are a powerful magnet for
Tyneside's 832,000 population. How else could a city with fewer than 300,000
residents, 12.9 per cent of them unemployed, possibly support in its centre
alone more than 100 restaurants, 60 pubs and nightclubs, three department
stores, hundreds of shops and a plethora of theatres, cinemas, museums and
other cultural facilities?
The Royal Shakespeare Company's annual visits to its 'third home' and
performances by the city's resident Northern Sinfonia and visiting
orchestras, draw people in from a very wide area.
The Theatre Royal, beautifully refurbished at a cost of Pounds 9.3m, and the
restored Tyne Theatre, which has Victorian understage machinery of interest
to theatre historians worldwide, are both held in great affection and
regard.
The same cannot be said of the City Hall, the main concert venue, long
criticised for its lack of atmosphere and size - it is inadequate for
blockbuster events. To test the commercial scope for a new concert venue, an
expert study funded by the TWDC, the city council, the Department of the
Environment and the Northumbria and English tourist boards began last month.
Tyneside's two giant retail centres - Eldon Square, Europe's largest city
centre shopping complex in Newcastle, and the MetroCentre, Europe's largest
out-of-town shopping and leisure complex in Gateshead - maintain a friendly
rivalry, co-operating in wooing big-spending Scandinavians and competing in
the home market.
Both had very good Christmases and are sounding bullish even now. Secondary
shopping streets and areas are, however, finding the competition difficult
and are tending to shift downmarket. But Newcastle is about to have an
injection of yet more top quality shopping space at its very heart; the new
neo-classical Monument Mall will open this spring.
Although the city has responded swiftly to any threat to its supremacy - the
MetroCentre's multiscreen cinema was promptly countered by a similar
development in Newcastle and Eldon Square has been extended since the
MetroCentre opened - it has been unable to combat the shrinkage of its
manufacturing sector.
Manufacturing employment declined from 28 per cent in 1981 to 17 per cent in
1989, with a corresponding rise in the service sector; about 20,000
manufacturing jobs have been lost in the city in the past 20 years. The
latest cut is at Anglo Great Lakes' graphite electrode plant, closing this
summer with the loss of 230 jobs.
Some argue that all this is an inevitable feature of international
employment trends; that the remaining big manufacturers, by dint of
investment, are offering high quality jobs with prospects; that in an age of
mobility Newcastle should embrace a service, small business and high-tech
industry future, built partly on its strong academic sector, and not worry
too much if some residents work elsewhere in Tyne and Wear.
But the city's failure to attract any of the north-east's Japanese
manufacturing investments has underlined its lack of large development
sites. To remedy this, the city council's unitary development plan
controversially proposes the release of 1,222 hectares from the green belt
near Newcastle airport and the new Western Bypass. The land would be
available for business and industry, recreation and 3,000 homes.
Gateshead has fared better in land availability, thanks to its large Team
Valley Estate. The public developer English Estates, headquartered here, is
carrying out developments in various locations in Tyne and Wear to help
diversify its economic base. Some are high-tech, others more conventional
such as its new factory development at Walker Riverside in Newcastle.
Much of the former Gateshead garden festival site is destined for housing or
recreation but near the river Sir Robert McAlpine is to develop Tyne Park,
comprising office and high-tech space. Agents Storey Sons and Parker have no
firm lettings yet but say they are not disappointed with the level of
interest. They remain convinced there is potential on Tyneside for more
modern, high quality office space and for rental growth from the present
Pounds 13.50 per sq ft maximum.
Storey Sons and Parker itself made news last year when six partners bought
the business from Lloyds. Headquartered in Newcastle, with other offices in
Yorkshire and the north-west, it claims to be the north of England's largest
firm of commercial-sector chartered property surveyors.
The firm notes that several leading hotel groups have, against the national
trend, been inquiring about development sites in Tyneside, even though
several new hotels, including the four-star Copthorne on Newcastle Quayside
and the Friendly Hotel at Boldon Business Park, South Tyneside, have opened
recently. Other occupants of the Boldon park include Japanese car trim
manufacturer Hashimoto, a Nissan supplier.
Work also starts this summer on a new hotel near the river mouth in South
Shields. It will be ready in time for next year's Tall Ships Race. The last
race, in 1986, stirred deep affections for the River Tyne. Since then its
riversides have been much rejuvenated. The 1993 event should be one to
remember.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (4): Market is dull but firm -
Housing

WHEN the Newcastle-based Northern Rock Building Society announced a record
financial year last week despite supposedly nationwide recession in property
markets, it begged the question why. Something more than a local fluke was
clearly at work because the smaller, Sunderland-based North of England
society had also reported unprecedented good results the week before.
While luck played no part, regional culture and history did. Tyne and Wear
has never had a domestic property market based on false values or rampant
inflation. Until recently, half the people lived in council or private
rented accommodation.
The area has long been comparatively short of middle-class managers or
professionals compared with other northern counties such as Greater
Manchester or West Yorkshire. Tyne and Wear is smaller and does not sprawl,
and has had less pressure to push outwards into the countryside than
elsewhere.
The duller, but firm market produced by such factors is reflected in
Northern Rock's own corporate culture. Mr Kevin Southwood, director and
general manager, says: 'We have never done 100 per cent loans or non-status
loans. We have always checked that people will be able to afford to pay. In
our re-mortgage business, we never lend more than 80 per cent of the value
of the property.
'When we have had to repossess from defaulting mortgagees, it has been
because of marital breakdown or redundancy, not the inability of people who
borrowed too much to cope with high interest rates. The result is that we
have had only 35 repossessions on Tyneside over the past 12 months.
'For a Pounds 4.5bn building society, that is very, very small. Even when we
have repossessed, we have not lost any money because prices are firm.
Indeed, it is difficult to detect any decline in values. Some people say
they could have sold for more a year ago, but there is no actual fall in
terms of prices dropping below what people paid.'
If anyone thinks this conservatism makes for a dull company, Northern Rock's
results are testament to the virtues of prudence. It has achieved entirely
organic expansion with no mergers; last year, assets grew by 29 per cent,
profits by 33 per cent; it has done 45 per cent more lending and achieved
more than 15 per cent reduction in unit costs.
A 30 per cent market share in the north-east suggests a fair reflection of
the state of regional economy. Northern Rock has a national spread, but half
its branches are in the north-east and two-thirds of its 1,200 staff. In
terms of asset value, it is now the eleventh-largest British building
society.
In an adjacent office block to Northern Rock, Mr Howard Dawe, chief
executive of Bellway, the house builder, says: 'We have great faith in
northern markets because traditionally there was low home ownership. It is
only 60 per cent now.' He says regional housing markets only start to become
saturated when owner-occupation reaches about 75 per cent of the housing
stock. Then the market depends on people moving house, which fewer do in
recession. At Northern Rock, Mr Southwood says that the region's evolving
and broader economic structure is improving general affluence and upward
mobility, so home ownership and trading up are continuing.
The result is that while there has been a considerable slowdown at the top
end, the market for houses priced up to Pounds 75,000 is still buoyant. Even
houses costing over Pounds 100,000 are still selling, but the market is
quieter.
These prices would not buy much in the south, but in the north they do. 'Our
main range is from one-bedroomed flats to five-bed semis, with prices
running from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 250,000,' Mr Dawe says.
This did not win Bellway many admirers during the southern boom, when it
hardly looked daring compared with its Tyneside rival Barratt. But its share
price was five times Barratt's last week, giving Bellway a market
capitalisation of Pounds 93.1m against Pounds 90.2m for Barratt.
He is critical, however, of green belt policies, which he sees as based on a
need to halt urban sprawl that is valid in the south but not in Tyne and
Wear. He says shortage of good building land has put pressure on executive
housing markets. Mr Southwood says these may actually have become locally
overheated because of the shortage.
The strong market encouraged the famous Gosforth rugby club to sell its
Northumberland county ground for executive housing. Generally, two acres
plus a house can cost more than Pounds 350,000. Darras Hall - Newcastle's
'executive ghetto' near the airport - offers prices from Pounds 180,000 to
Pounds 400,000 and many relocating southerners, armed with large sums from
southern sales before the recession, have in recent years looked no farther.
Partly because the executive housing market is tight, the commuter belt for
Tyneside has fanned out considerably northwards and westwards into
Northumberland as roads have improved. This good local infrastructure is
seen by economic development bodies - and relocating industry - as one of
the region's prime attractions, especially for people used to miserable
London commuting standards.
There has therefore been a fast-growing awareness of the attractions of the
Tyne Valley's many beautiful honey-coloured stone homes, in towns and
villages such as Hexham and Corbridge and Wylam, or in nearby hamlets.
Prices have responded accordingly and projects such as barn conversions are
likely to provide local builders with lucrative work.
Nevertheless, Newcastle has some highly attractive areas of good quality,
executive housing close to the city centre and very readily accessible to
the many fine cultural, leisure and shopping facilities it offers by dint of
its regional capital status. All five boroughs have areas of up-market
housing, often close to useful amenities such as the Metro rapid transit
system.
Indeed, the underground Metro system - which opened in 1984 at a cost of
Pounds 284m - is becoming an increasingly important asset in the Tyne and
Wear lifestyle, especially since it offers rather more pleasant rides and
greater efficiency than its London counterpart.
Three months ago, a new Pounds 12m extension opened to Newcastle Airport. It
is a strategic element in the north east's infrastructure as it links the
airport directly to British Rail services, attracting nearly Pounds 2.5m
from the European Regional Development Fund.
A feasibility study is in progress into extending the Metro to Sunderland,
which would provide another strategically important link by improving
regional coherence.
Meanwhile, south of the river but inland, the demise of heavy industry such
as the Consett steel works in County Durham has made areas such as
Derwentside attractive and affordable for many in the Tyne and Wear
workforce.
The retreat of coal mining has also opened up interesting housing
possibilities. The prime example is the upmarket new estate developed by
Barratt and McLean in South Tyneside on the former Whitburn colliery. The
adjacent pit heap has become a coastal park, due to be handed over to the
National Trust. The coal stocking site is a nature reserve.
Within the urban area, there has been new housing development, some of it
very attractive, on several infill sites. On the fringes, in areas such as
Kingston Park on the northern edge of Newcastle, there are large new housing
estates. Despite cash restrictions, the local authorities have also been
progressively upgrading their housing stock, including estates whose design
made them unattractive to tenants.
The government's urban programme has also been important here, with Bellway
in particular exploiting it, as it has elsewhere in Britain. Ten years ago
it bought nearly 200 run-down council flats in Scotswood and successfully
converted them for sale at prices that local people could afford.
It is now four years into Hebburn Village, on the site of the shipyard that
built HMS Kelly, Lord Mountbatten's ship, in the Second World War.
There will eventually be 500 low-cost homes, mainly of two- or three-bedroom
size. Starting prices of Pounds 20,000 have now appreciated into the Pounds
30,000-Pounds 40,000 range. Eventually, a few up-market homes will be added,
costing Pounds 60,000-Pounds 70,000.
'We are selling to people who are moving back into the district. They moved
out because of poor housing and now it has improved they want to get back to
familiar places and faces,' says Mr Bill Stevenson, Bellway's urban renewal
chief.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (3): A morale booster - Wearside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAKE IT WEARSIDE, urge the slogans emblazoned on hundreds of commercial
vehicles owned by Sunderland borough council and local private companies.
Make it Wearside, entreat the advertisements designed to promote the borough
as 'the advanced manufacturing centre of the North'.
Sunderland, one of Britain's largest towns, has long felt aggrieved at
playing second fiddle - in outsiders' eyes, at least - to Newcastle.
Wearsiders, known locally as Makems, do not take kindly to being mistaken
for Geordies.
Winning Nissan's investment and watching it flourish and attract component
suppliers has been a big morale booster for those local people who feel they
or their children have a chance of working for the new automotive employers.
Others, meanwhile, have cheered themselves a little with the spectacle of
Newcastle United trailing behind their Roker rivals on the football pitch.
But the real boost for Sunderland now would be to see significant job
creation on the riverside sites which once provided the thousands of
shipbuilding, coal mining and heavy engineering jobs on which the town so
heavily relied.
These traditional industries bore the brunt of Wearside's job cuts in the
1980s. Within a decade, their workforce was cut by a half, the town lost its
last shipyards - ending a 600-year-old industry - and the total number of
employees in work dropped by 5,300 to 90,800, a fall due almost entirely to
a reduction in male employment.
Even so, when the government decided in 1988 to close the last shipyards
with the loss of 2,400 jobs, some members of the local business community,
which includes substantial employers such as Nissan, Rolls Royce, Vaux and
Grove-Coles, not surprisingly took exception to the 'dead town' image
portrayed in sections of the media.
But outcry over the shipyards' closure helped secure a 150 acre enterprise
zone as part of the goverment's Pounds 45m 'rescue package'. It also
triggered the creation of The Wearside Opportunity (TWO), a local private
sector initiative, in partnership with the local authority and development
agencies, to regenerate the borough's economy and pep up its morale by
building on its manufacturing traditions with new, forward-looking industry.
In fighting for inward investment, Sunderland now has a number of
advantages. They include Nissan's proximity and the enterprise zone, in
force until the year 2,000.
Zone status is the factor which squares the circle, making speculative
building financially attractive, says Mr Norman Bachelor, a director of
Washington Developments, a London and Edinburgh Trust subsidiary. In Tyne
and Wear generally, rental levels are still a deterrent to private sector
developers, he says. His company is now developing the first 57,000 sq ft
phase of 500,000 sq ft of business space on the Tyne and Wear Development
Corporation's Hylton Riverside site.
Nearby in the zone, beside car dealer Reg Vardy's new showroom, the flagship
for the new Nissan Motor GB distribution network, Scottish Provident have
just developed eight high specification industrial-warehouse units, called
Sunrise Enterprise Park. At the third section of the zone, Doxford Business
Park, Akeler Developments Plc are about to start work on the first phase of
more than one million square feet of space, plus a hotel.
Eleven English Estates units, in three eye-catching pavilions, were the
first new units in the zone; seven have so far been let at around Pounds 7
per sq ft.
The zone's prime purpose is to attract companies new to the area. But
relocations from nearby are being welcomed too provided they increase their
workforce.
Another important element in the campaign to foster advanced manufacturing
is Sunderland Polytechnic. Led by Dr Anne Wright, the only female
polytechnic rector outside London, it has developed a number of facilities
for industry. These range from its electromagnetic compatibility testing
tank, for businesses trying to attain new European standards, to its
advanced manufacturing systems centre, which advises on integration of
computers and robotics into manufacturing processes.
The 1989 census of employment showed 25.2 per cent of Wearside's employees
then worked in manufacturing, 2 per cent above the national average. Despite
the emphasis placed by TWO and its partners on training and flexibility,
many of those who have lost their jobs in recent years are worried there is
no place for them in 'high-tech' industry. Low aspiration, says one senior
local figure, is Wearsiders' biggest problem.
However, there is general recognition that high-tech manufacturing is only
one aspect of Wearside's future. And for many local people, recent arrivals
such as Press Offshore, which has moved onto the former South Docks site,
and Christmas decorations manufacturer Ti-Well, a relocation from
Bedfordshire to a former shipyard workshop where ships funnels were once
made, seem more immediately relevant to their employment needs.
Nissan's presence has drawn in some significant new employers such as switch
and engine valve makers TRW, and Sommer Allibert, who make dashboards. In
the year to April 1991, the Commission for the New Towns saw a 150 per cent
increase over any previous year in its industrial development land sales in
Washington, thanks partly to incoming Nissan suppliers.
Delighted though it is at Nissan's success, the borough council does not
overstate its importance; it does not want outsiders to imagine Nissan
dominates the entire local labour market. As Janet Snaith, the council's
employment manager, says: 'We still have 17,000 unemployed and a long way to
go.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (2): Benefits beyond the automotive
sector - Nissan's regional impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW trips can have paid greater dividends than the flight which Sir William
McAlpine and his son Andrew took to Japan soon after Nissan revealed in 1981
that it planned to site its European car plant in the UK.
As a result largely of the negotiations triggered by that visit, McAlpine's
annual north-east turnover rose from Pounds 10m before 1984, when Nissan
announced it had chosen the former Sunderland airport site, to Pounds 150m
in 1991 - two thirds of it directly attributable to Japanese investment.
Last year was admittedly exceptional even by the standards of McAlpine's
success in winning Japanese contracts: in 1991 the company's work on the
ever-expanding Nissan plant, now a Pounds 900m investment, coincided with
its construction of the first phase of Fujitsu's Pounds 400m semiconductor
plant at Newton Aycliffe in Co Durham.
Even so, the remarkable boost to turnover underlines the sometimes
overlooked spin-off of Nissan's choice of Tyne and Wear for locally-based
companies beyond the automotive components sector.
Quantity surveyors and project managers Turner &amp; Townsend, founded in
north-east England in 1946 and headquartered in Darlington, Co Durham, were
similarly quick off the mark in 1981 when Nissan, in tandem with its search
for a site, began a less publicised survey of the UK construction industry.
Although the Japanese car maker was at that time making no promises to
develop beyond its proposed 24,000 cars-a-year first phase, Turner &amp;
Townsend realised the project's enormous potential significance and tried
hard, but discreetly, to help Nissan with any information it required.
That policy of establishing cordial relations early on - and of taking
Nissan seriously - has paid off handsomely. Since 1984, the firm has had a
constant presence at the Sunderland site, controlling construction finance
and contracts.
As a direct result it was selected as project manager not only by several
Nissan suppliers moving into the surrounding area but by excavator
manufacturer Komatsu at Birtley, Tyne and Wear and by Fujitsu for its new
Aycliffe plant.
The firm's story also demonstrates the importance Nissan at Sunderland has
attached to developing its relationships. Thanks to the good understanding
built up there, Turner &amp; Townsend was given responsibility for overseeing
development of both the Cranfield, Bedfordshire, headquarters of Nissan's
European Technology Centre and the Maple Cross HQ of Nissan Motor GB, the
company's new distributor.
'Relationships are terribly important to the Japanese,' says Mr David Barry,
a partner in the firm and regional director for Turner &amp; Townsend Project
Management. 'Having started a relationship they want to see it succeed.'
His firm, one of the UK's six biggest in its field, does not divulge its
turnover but the Japanese link has substantially boosted income in its
north-east heartland. It has insulated the firm locally from the chill of
recession, which has forced competitors to cut staff. And it led to the firm
being chosen by Toyota as quantity surveyor for its new Derby plant - a
contract to which Nissan had no objection provided a 'Chinese wall' operated
between the relevant staff in the firm's Derby and north-east offices.
'Nissan was the pad which launched us into this type of work,' says Mr
Barry. 'It's been a tremendous relationship.' He and Mr Benny Kelly,
McAlpine's regional manager, say they have found Nissan tough in
negotiations but loyal and determined to make the relationship work. Both
also say Nissan has been very keen to get local companies to work on the
plant's development.
Other beneficiaries of this policy include electrical engineers Mott
McDonald, the consulting engineers for the Tyne Bridge in the 1920s, also
constantly at work on the Nissan site since 1984. The 'Nissan Effect' has
even helped transform its potted plant suppliers from a little local company
into a national operator.
Keenness to build local relationships does not however imply any timidity or
laissez-faire on Nissan's part. Indeed, one of the company's most remarkable
features has been the way it has set its own agenda.
At Nissan's request, Turner &amp; Townsend even found themselves restructuring
the conventional relationship between client, consultants and contractor.
'We sat with Nissan on one side of the table,' explains Mr Barry. Mr Kelly
says Nissan's requirements have stimulated the quality of construction work
in the region and improved its responsiveness.
Nissan has also forcefully championed to local businesses the doctrines of
total quality, flexibility, teamworking, training and equal status. More
traditional companies may still have executive dining rooms but some now
feel a touch defensive about them.
Occasionally there are grumbles that Nissan hogs the limelight a little too
much. But nobody denies the importance to Tyne and Wear of Europe's biggest
single inward investment by a Japanese company.
The backdrop of UK recession makes even more notable Nissan's announcement
last month of another Pounds 200m of investment at Sunderland, another 600
jobs, boosting employment to 4,600 next year, and an increase in production
capacity by 1993 from 220,000 cars to 300,000.
'It gives some pause for thought for those people who thought they were just
coming in for a quick buck and would then go away again,' comments Mr Ed
Robson, Sunderland's director of architecture and planning, who was project
co-ordinator in the 1980s for the Tyne and Wear local authorities' campaign
to net Nissan.
The company's choice of the region, its successful expansion and impressive
performance - the Sunderland workforce is said to equal its Japanese
counterparts - have been valuable selling points in attracting inward
investment.
'It's a very strong signal that this is a very good place not only to invest
but to grow,' says Dr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern
Development Company, the economic regeneration body. The region now has
nearly 50 Japanese companies, expected by 1993 to have created about 12,000
jobs and invested Pounds 1.7bn.
There is no mistaking what many north-east job hunters think of Nissan's
presence; its current local recruitment campaign for 1,600 additional
employees, to reach its 4,600 target, has so far elicited 28,000
applications. But the message has also got through to many of the unemployed
that they are not part of Nissan's brave new world. 'I'm too old for them'
is a frequent refrain among jobless over-35-year-olds.
Nissan's choice of Sunderland raised hopes that a whole new automotive
sector would be created in a region devoid of significant car manufacturing
since Edwardian times, when Lord Armstrong's Newcastle works made cars for
export to Japan. Some spin-off from Nissan, obliged by European Community
requirements to achieving 80 per cent European sourcing, is evident,
especially in Sunderland and Wearside. Since the mid-80s some 23 automotive
suppliers have set up in the region.
Nissan estimates it will spend Pounds 190m with its 27 north-east suppliers
this year, rising to Pounds 281m in 1993 out of a total Pounds 850m spent
with 195 European suppliers. North-east suppliers account for almost half
its UK components spending. By next year, Nissan expects its orders to
generate work for about 3,000 employees in north east-based direct supplier
companies.
The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation argued in a recent report,
Automotives - the Driving Force of the New North East, that the region could
now become a premier centre of car component manufacture in Britain and
possibly Europe. Mr Alastair Balls, TWDC chief executive, believes 300,000
cars-a-year capacity is the level at which component suppliers may be
attracted to relocate into the north-east when the recession abates. That,
he says, is 'just tough' for other regions.
Professor Ray Hudson and Dr David Sadler, Durham University geographers,
have raised some eyebrows, and even tempers, locally with a recent report
suggesting new facilities developed around the Nissan plant have tended to
specialise in production of relatively low value-added and bulky components.
Their research also suggested the equation optimistically made between
just-in-time production and spatial proximity had been greatly over-stated.
In a region fighting for more automotive industry, this is heretical talk.
But Prof Hudson says he is denying neither the pulling power of Nissan, nor
its direct contribution to the local economy. 'What Nissan will have done in
employment terms, although in a different part of the north-east, is replace
Consett steel works.'
He also predicts that Nissan will expand its annual capacity to 400,000 cars
during the 1990s. 'That would be a pretty powerful magnet.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (1): Standing up to recession -
Nissan started a bandwagon of inward investment that is transforming Tyne
and Wear's economy, but pockets of long-term unemployment remain a serious
problem. Last year's riots damaged a carefully nurtured image but,
paradoxically, they may even have strengthened the region's case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TYNE and WEAR is undergoing long-term and continuing economic change,
creating problems as well as benefits. The overall picture is summed up by
Mr Paul Briggs, chairman of the north- east region of the Confederation of
British Industry.
'In the north-east we have changed the fabric and means of business. The
economy is being reconstructed. Productivity is infinitely higher. The
biggest development of the last 10 years has been the amount of inward
investment and the new demands it has imposed on quality and performance. We
have now got to grow many more businesses in the region.
'On the other hand, the problem is a rump of unemployment which is very
difficult to overcome. There is a bad educational problem. We need a
multi-skilled workforce, not labourers.
'This raises a major social question and will require an integrated
approach. The link between business and education must improve and involve
government, local authorities, schools, further education colleges,
universities and the training and enterprise councils."
The urgency of this social question was not fully recognised either
regionally or nationally until last September, when riots erupted on
Tyneside.
Their impact on most people outside the region was worsened by an
unawareness of underlying problems because of a concerted 'talking-up' of
the region's attributes to impress inward investors.
This campaign had justified itself by attracting Nissan to Tyne and Wear in
1985. 'We now have nearly 50 Japanese companies, nearly 12,000 jobs and
Pounds 1.7bn from them in the region,' says Dr John Bridge, chief executive
of the Northern Development Company (NDC), a consortium with public and
private sector support.
The NDC is now targeting Korea and Taiwan and the first trickle of companies
has arrived, but that is only part of the story. In the 18 months to last
October, foreign inward investors started 83 projects, creating or
safeguarding 8,000 jobs, with an estimated Pounds 1bn of capital spending.
Thirty-seven involved European-based companies, 24 were from the Far East,
and 22 from the US. Far East investors accounted for 40 per cent of the
jobs. In addition, 37 projects involved relocating UK companies, creating
another 2,400 jobs.
Not all this activity went into Tyne and Wear. The NDC acts for the whole
north-east and Cumbria, but Newcastle is the regional capital and service
centre and its conurbation of 1.13m people has the largest population. What
is good for the north is good for Tyne and Wear.
Generally, the influx has broadened the economic base and helped Tyne and
Wear to withstand recession better than most of the south of Britain.
Moreover, 40 per cent of output is now exported - inevitably so, since the
inward investors have mainly come for easier access to European markets.
This, coupled with very few people or businesses mortgaged up to the hilt,
has helped insulate the local economy from the problems of southern England.
Why the inward investment is needed is that only half a generation ago a
third of the north-east's workforce was employed in shipbuilding,
steelmaking or coalmining. Closures have seen the figure drop to only 3 per
cent now.
This long-term decline of basic industry is condemned by Mr Doug Henderson,
MP for Newcastle North and one of the Labour party's trade and industry
spokesmen. He is glad of Nissan's arrival but says it does not yet herald
economic revival for an area which has consistently been near the top of the
UK unemployment league.
The search for work is the issue. In Tyne and Wear, for example,
shipbuilding has been reduced to the high-tech warship yard of Swan Hunter.
Amec, in the shape of its Press Offshore subsidiary, has been another
indigenous success, as have the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group -
formerly NEI - and Vickers, builders of the battle-proven Challenger tank.
But the need for higher productivity has limited the numbers of jobs they
can create.
Most new jobs require qualified workers such as at two emergent Tyneside
information technology businesses, Quality Software Products and Sage.
'You don't need labourers carrying buckets of rivets around Swan Hunter any
more,' says Mr Neville Trotter, MP for Tynemouth and Tyne and Wear's only
Conservative in the House of Commons. The Meadow Well estate, where the
riots began, is in his constituency.
Politically, reconstructing the regional economy has been a race to reduce
unemployment to manageable levels before the social problems boiled over.
The rate for Tyne and Wear was 11.8 per cent last December  - the latest
detailed figure - with another 0.8 per cent on employment training.
In addition, 12.6 per cent of under-18s were out of work and another 62 per
cent of them were in youth training. There were 1,708 vacancies advertised
in Jobcentres; one for every 38 unemployed claimants.
Absolute numbers are down at least a third on the levels before Nissan's
arrival, but the concentration of long-term joblessness into pockets has
accentuated the differences between the haves and have-nots.
Newcastle's submission for urban funding in the government's City Challenge
competition says more than half the people under 24 in the West End district
are out of work. Only one in 50 who attend the local comprehensive school
leave with five or more GCSE passes.
Within the West End, beside the river, is the Tyne and Wear Development
Corporation's impressive Newcastle Business Park. British Airways has set up
a computerised telephone-sales operation there. Only the brightest have a
chance of anything other than a menial job.
In spite of the efforts of many decent local people, these are the
conditions in which is developed an underclass with a criminal culture. An
inevitable result - as has happened following other UK urban riots in the
past 12 years - is that the blame has been put almost entirely on criminals,
with only a token acknowledgement of the conditions which enabled them to
flourish.
Mr Trotter says about 100 professional criminals rioted because the police
had started to crack down successfully on their Meadow Well base. Mr
Alastair Balls, chief executive of the development corporation, talks of
'criminal gangs' impeding the building of community networks among decent
people.
Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce, says:
'There were two reasons for the riots: crime, and a badly managed housing
estate. They were a great sadness to the community, but they were criminal
in origin.'
Dr Bridge says: 'They put crime on the shopping list of things companies
wanted to know about. Tokyo TV was a problem because it was a negative, but
people soon realised that it's no worse here than overseas. It's less of
problem than was the one they used to ask about - industrial relations. They
don't ask about labour relations at all any more because those problems
don't exist.'
But Mr Tilmouth adds: 'The riots have stiffened our resolve. There is still
a long way to go. Many of us are determined to press on harder than before.'
Indeed, the riots may help Tyne and Wear sell its case, which often looked
almost too good to be true when it was merely promoted, rather than argued.
The argument is strong: an entire sub-region has largely pulled itself up by
its bootstraps and started to transform a declining, failing economy into a
growing one.
Mr Kit Pumphrey of Newcastle stockbrokers Wise Speke sums up a growing mood:
'All my life we have been running to stand still against industrial decline.
Now we have a chance to build and grow. We have turned a corner and have
much more power to help ourselves.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Appointments: IT man to be i/c IFM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICCH Financial Markets (IFM), the systems subsidiary of the International
Commodities Clearing House, has named Wal Reisch to succeed Martin Eades as
chief executive.
Eades, whose three-year contract is up, arrived at ICCH as group managing
director, encompassing both the clearing house, which clears and guarantees
trades executed on London futures and options markets, and IFM. In September
1990, David Hardy took over as managing director of the London Clearing
House, leaving Eades in charge of IFM.
With his skills more pronounced on the selling than on the man management
side, Eades, 50, who had previously worked in Tokyo, is credited with
successfully introducing several Japanese commodity exchanges to ICCH's
clearing and trading systems. But attempts to float IFM off from ICCH, which
is owned by a group of UK banks, have so far failed.
Reisch, a 45-year-old Australian, has been with ICCH since he joined the
Sydney branch office in 1974. Like Eades, he is an information technology
boffin, and has been responsible for group IT strategy. The two men also
share a concern for assuring their personal succession; Reisch has six
offspring, and Eades has seven.

Lawrence Churchill has been appointed as the first chief executive of
National Westminster Life Assurance, the newly created life assurance
subsidiary of NatWest, the second largest UK bank.
NatWest Life opens its doors at the beginning of 1993 with capitalisation of
Pounds 150m - 92.5 per cent NatWest-owned and the remainder Clerical
Medical.
Churchill joined NatWest from Allied Dunbar last September. He was director
in charge of information technology, administration, and pension and
management services.
A devoted rugby enthusiast and Oxford-trained classics scholar, Churchill
says his goal is to ensure that NatWest Life becomes the outstanding life
assurance company of the 1990s.

Alan Thomson, previously finance director of Courtaulds Coatings for five
years, started yesterday as the new finance director of The Rugby Group. His
predecessor, Barry Hardcastle, 56, retired for health reasons at the end of
last year.
Thomson, a Scottish chartered accountant, who had been with Rockwell
International in Switzerland, France and the US before Courtaulds, says he
has been hired to develop Rugby's international side, particularly within
Europe. Coatings has a very similar international portfolio to that of Rugby
 -with operations in North America and Australia - but is much stronger in
Europe, according to the French-speaking Thomson.
*****
First Leisure, Lord Delfont's discotheque, ten-pin bowling and tourist
attractions group, is to lose its finance director, Nick Irens.
Irens had decided he would like to manage a company himself and with John
Conlan, First Leisure's chief executive, firmly in place, there seemed
little early prospect of Irens taking the top job there.
Instead, after what all sides insist is an amicable departure, Irens will
become chief executive of a new company to be formed via an agreed takeover
of an existing company. Irens says, however, that although his company will
be in the leisure sector, it will not compete directly with First Leisure.
First Leisure is looking internally and externally for Irens' successor.

FT  18 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Demand for water stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER SHARES were boosted by a series of broker buy recommendations and also
by heavy demand from Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, which
yesterday announced the creation of a 'Water Basket' comprising call and put
warrants on the four water stocks in the FT-SE 100 index.
These are Anglian, North West, Severn Trent and Thames, all of which were
outstanding performers in the sector. Salomon has been a big buyer of the
four stocks over the past couple of trading sessions.
Thames was the most heavily traded (4.6m shares) and the biggest gainer in
the sector, ending 9 higher at 382p, closely followed by Anglian, 8 up at
374p, North West, 6 better at 378p, and Severn Trent, 5 to the good at 350p.
Mr Steve Doe at Smith New Court pinpointed Anglian, Southern (4 up at 340p),
North West, Thames and Yorkshire (3 firmer at 387p) as best buys in a sector
which he said: 'Fails to take account of the possibility of a Tory
government, or even a laissez-faire Labour government.'
A broad review of the outcome of the forthcoming general election by
Nomura's utilities team was highly positive for North West and Severn Trent.
BP above worst
An oil sector still bruised by last week's disappointing trading statement
from BP and worries over the group's dividend prospects was further
depressed yesterday by a negative view of the latest Opec agreement.
The agreement, by Opec members, to reduce output by around 1.4m barrels a
day disappointed oil specialists, who had expected bigger cuts. 'It should
have positive implications for equity markets but not for the oil sector,'
said Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court, who saw British Gas as 'the only
safe high-yielder in the sector'.
County NatWest was aggressively switching from BP into British Gas
yesterday, according to dealers. Mr Simon Flowers at County said that, with
BP set to underperform, Gas looked more attractive.
BP was again the most heavily traded stock on the London market, with
turnover exceeding 15m shares. It closed 5 off at 263p, but after having
dropped to 248p at one point. British Gas climbed 7 1/2 to 248p on 6.5m
traded.
Shell Transport, due to report preliminary figures on Thursday, managed a
minor gain at 468p, responding to switching from BP in a move described by
specialists as 'a flight to quality'.
Reuters still busy
Reiteration of a buy stance ahead of an enthusiastic note helped Reuters
Holdings climb 21 to 1156p with 1.1m shares traded.
Securities house Henderson Crosthwaite says the shares are on a very low
rating. A research document from Henderson, to be published today, also
argues that rival companies' products, designed to compete with Reuters' new
automated foreign exchange system, Dealing 2000-2, are experiencing
technical diff-iculties.
Analyst Mr Brian Newman of Henderson said: 'The shares look set to assault
the previous Pounds 13 high reached in July 1990.' The stock has also been
moved higher by a revival of interest from the US.
Stores firm
Stores received a boost from a report by the Confederation of British
Industry that sales in the distribution sector are showing signs of
improvement. The CBI report reinforced hopes that tomorrow's UK retail sales
data for January will show a recovery from December's fall of 0.9 per cent.
City forecasts point to a January rise of 0.2 per cent.
Hopes that the sector may lead Britain out of recession inspired a rise of 9
to 245p in Dixons, as 1m shares changed hands. This followed a recent
recommendation from Barclays de Zoete Wedd that Dixons is poised to be one
of the major beneficiaries of an upturn in consumer spending. Marks and
Spencer moved ahead 7 1/2 to 323p on turnover of 3.8m and Kingfisher put on
5 to 507p in a market trading 1.9m.
The better than expected CBI distributive trades survey encouraged Boots to
rise 9 to 461p. WH Smith 'A' also gained from hopes of a recovery in sales,
adding 14 at 457p, while Great Universal Stores 'A' improved 40 to 1479p.
Monument Oil &amp; Gas slipped a penny to 33 1/4 p; the overnight ticker
revealed that 22m shares were traded at 32p after the market closed last
Friday. The deal was believed to be the two sides of a share sale by Secab,
the investment division of Swedish group Mercurius.
PowerGen and National Power underperformed, closing only marginally up on
the day, while the Scottish generators made good progress in heavy trading
after Kleinwort Benson was said to have recommended a switch into the two
stocks. Scottish Hydro rose 3 to 107p on 4.6m shares. Scottish Power, with
6m traded, put on 2 to 103 1/2 p.
British Aerospace ended easier at 270p in nervous trading ahead of
tomorrow's full-year figures.
Engineering group Bullough gained 5 to 551p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is a buyer
of the stock and said: 'Trading on a discount to the market . . . and
offering yield premium and strong asset backing, the shares represent one of
the best recovery plays in the sector.'
Press comment benefited a number of transport-related stocks. BAA jumped 12
to 577p, while British Airways put on 4 to 258p on turnover of 4.1m.
P &amp; O bounced 10 to 388p on reports that Chelsfield, a private company with
whom it operates the Pall Mall Properties joint venture, is planning a
public listing.
Expectation of good news from the interim results on Thursday lifted Glaxo
by 25 to 840p. Analysts are looking for profits between Pounds 690m and
Pounds 730m, against Pounds 623m for the comparable half year.
Protective clothing and equipment manufacturer Wardle Storeys declined 9 to
336p after one securities house was apparently unable to place a line of
1.2m shares in the market.
Waste management group Attwoods finished 2 easier at 144p in spite of a
brokers visit to Germany yesterday and today. Analysts said there were still
worries about financial controls.
Pharmaceutical retailer Macarthy forged ahead 18 to 305p on hopes that the
Department of Trade and Industry will this week clear two rival bids for the
company.
A weekend press article revived optimism that the bids, from Lloyd's
Chemists (unchanged at 336p) and Unichem (off 2 at 207p), which have both
been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, will be cleared.
Food retailer William Low dropped 38 to 224p on a warning from the company
that difficult trading conditions and the cost of new openings meant profits
for the year to September 1992 would fall short of last year's figure of
Pounds 23.56m. Analysts were looking for profits of around Pounds 26m.
Mr Nick Irens, regarded as a significant contributor to First Leisure's
fortunes, resigned as finance director to set up his own business, although
he will remain with the company until a replacement is found. The shares
lost 2 to 294p.
Bid speculation returned to Mountleigh and Rosehaugh. Mountleigh edged up a
quarter of a penny to 10 1/4 p on busy turnover of 3m following weekend
press reports that it could be a target for Chelsfield, Mr Elliott Bernerd's
private property group, which is being prepared for flotation. Rosehaugh, a
popular bid target, was also fingered as a possible candidate, the shares
adding 1 3/4 at 10 1/4 p in active volume of 1.2m.
George Wimpey, the housebuilding group, moved up strongly to close 6 higher
at 117p, with turnover of 5.2m said to have been substantially boosted by a
series of agency crosses.
A Kleinwort Benson recommendation was behind a surge in Wickes shares, which
closed 8 ahead at 80p, after 82p. Kleinwort's retailing team described
Wickes as 'one of the best recovery plays in the sector'.

FT  18 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Shipowner cannot claim for repairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIJELA
Queen's Bench Division
(Commercial Court):
Mr Justice Hobhouse:
February 7 1992
GENERAL AVERAGE is not admitted under the York-Antwerp Rules 1974 in respect
of temporary repairs for accidental damage carried out in a port of refuge
in substitution for permanent repairs which can only be carried out
elsewhere, if the cost of permanent repairs would have constituted
particular average expenses for which the shipowners alone would be liable,
in that they were unnecessary for safe prosecution of the voyage.
Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when giving judgment for the defendant
cargo-owners and their guaranteeing banks, Oswal Steel and others, on a
claim by shipowners, Marida Ltd and others, for general average in respect
of temporary repairs to the Bijela.
HIS LORDSHIP said that by a Gencon charterparty, and bills of lading dated
November 14 1985, general average was to be settled in London 'according to
York-Antwerp Rules 1974'.
The vessel was the Bijela. Her cargo was 25,197 tonnes of shredded scrap
loaded at Providence in Rhode Island for carriage to Kandla in India.
Shortly after leaving Providence, the vessel grounded and damaged her bottom
plating.
She put into Jamestown. Temporary repairs were completed by January 26 1986
and she set sail on February 3 1986. She arrived at Kandla on March 8 and,
having completed discharge, proceeded to Singapore where permanent repairs
were carried out.
General average was declared. The initial adjustment allowed various
expenses incurred at Jamestown, but not in respect of the temporary repairs
themselves.
The shipowners were dissatisfied and instructed other adjusters. They
published a further adjustment which did make such an allowance.
There was no dispute about the facts.
The casualty was an accident which occurred without the shipowners'
actionable fault. Jamestown was a port of refuge, and the repairs carried
out there were temporary repairs of accidental damage effected to enable the
adventure to be completed.
The damage had not been caused by general average sacrifice, not were the
repairs having to be effected for the common safety. There was no problem of
damage to cargo nor risk of damage from any discharging or reloading that
might prove necessary.
In her damaged condition the vessel could not safely leave Jamestown without
discharging part of her cargo. Unless repairs were done by using divers, as
in fact occurred, the vessel would need to be put into dry-dock.
If she were dry-docked all the cargo would have to be removed first. The
nearest dry-docks which could carry out the repairs were New York or Boston,
New York being the more suitable.
The actual cost of the repairs was Dollars 282,606. If permanent repairs had
been done at New York, costs would have amounted to Dollars 535,000.
The shipowners contended that they were entitled to recover the appropriate
proportion of the sum incurred in carrying out the temporary repairs at
Jamestown as a substituted expense under the York-Antwerp Rules 1974.
Rule F of those Rules provided that any extra expense incurred in place of
another expense 'which would have been allowable as general average' was
deemed to be general average.
Rule X (a) provided that, where a ship entered a place of refuge in
consequence of an accident 'which rendered that necessary for the common
safety', the expenses of entering the place should be admitted as general
average. The second paragraph provided that when a ship was at a place of
refuge and was 'necessarily removed' to another place because repairs could
not be carried out in the first place, the costs of removal 'including
temporary repairs' should be admitted as general average.
The second paragraph of rule XIV provided that, where temporary repairs of
accidental damage were effected 'to enable the adventure to be completed',
the cost of such repairs shall be admitted as general average 'but only up
to the saving in expense which would have been incurred and allowed in
general average if such repairs had not been effected there'.
The shipowners relied on the second paragraph of rule XIV. The issue was
whether the expenses in carrying out permanent repairs would have been
'allowable as general average'.
The shipowners said they would have been allowable, under rule X.
The cargo-owners disputed that. They said that, had the vessel discharged
and proceeded to New York for permanent repairs, none of the expenses
incurred would have been allowable in general average because the
alternative of carrying out temporary repairs to enable the adventure to be
completed, or for safe prosecution of the voyage, could be carried out at
Jamestown.
Where the need to carry out temporary repairs arose, not from general
average sacrifice or considerations of common safety, but from a particular
average accident, the expense did not as such qualify as general average
expenditure (Rule A).
The cost of performing the voyage and carrying the cargo to destination was
an expense borne by shipowners alone, even if increased by the occurrence of
some accident. That was one of the risks a carrier accepted when he entered
into the contract of carriage.
In the present case, the vessel and its cargo having arrived at port of
refuge and being no longer in peril, it was the shipowners' duty to carry
out, without unreasonable delay, such repairs as were necessary to carry the
cargo to its contractual destination, and to bear the expense of those
repairs.
The prima facie position was that the expenses of repair were particular
average expenses incurred by the shipowners in the course of fulfilling
their contractual obligations under the contracts of carriage.
The existence of that obligation was not decisive. Many types of general
average expenditure were incurred in fulfilment of the master's duties to
the interests involved in the common adventure, including cargo-owners. The
function of general average was to provide a superimposed scheme for sharing
the burden of that expenditure in an equitable fashion.
But here one was not involved with a general average act and one had to
consider application of the principle in rule F as formulated for the
particular situation in the second paragraph of rule XIV.
The numbered rule had to be construed taking into account the general
principles of the York-Antwerp Rules as stated in the lettered rules. If
there was any inconsistency, the wording of the numbered rule prevailed. In
the present case there was no inconsistency.
The flaw in the shipowners' case was that it disregarded the principle on
which substituted expenditure was allowed.
Substituted expenditure was not of itself allowable in general average. It
only became allowable because it was incurred in substitution for some other
expenditure which would have been allowable.
Therefore the claim must depend on demonstration that there was some other
expenditure which, if incurred, would have been allowable as general average
expenditure.
That the shipowners could not do.
The rule they would have to rely on was rule X and they immediately
encountered two insuperable difficulties.
First, they could not show that repairs in dry-dock were necessary for safe
prosecution of the voyage. All that was necessary for that purpose were the
temporary repairs at Jamestown.
Second, to bring themselves within rule X the shipowners needed to meet the
criterion that the ship was 'necessarily removed' from one place of refuge
to another, because repairs could not be carried out in the first place.
There was no necessity for Bijela to be removed. All necessary repairs could
be carried out at Jamestown.
The shipowners could not demonstrate that the alternative course of carrying
out permanent repairs in dry-dock in New York would have given rise to any
expenditure recoverable under rule X.
If they had taken that course, all the resultant expenditure would have been
treated as particular average expenditure and would have been borne by them
alone. A substitution for a particular average expense would be a particular
average expense.
The shipowners' claim failed. The initial adjustment was confirmed.
For the shipowners: Anthony Clarke QC and Simon Gault (Lloyd &amp; Co).
For the cargo-owners: Anthony Hallgarten QC and Steven Berry (Ince &amp; Co).

FT  18 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Election defeat, scandal weigh on Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE, Asia and America all produced eye-catching performances among global
equity markets last week, but the accent was on the downside and the World
Index ended 1.2 per cent lower in local currency terms.
Tokyo combined a by-election defeat for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
allegations of a bribery scandal, a decline in futures prices and lack of
interest in a proposal by the big four brokers to revive the market. All
this brought the Nikkei index below 21,000 for the first time since January
21.
Elsewhere on the Pacific Rim, Singapore continued its recent downtrend with
investors taking profits and turning to the more buoyant Malaysia - although
Kuala Lumpur's strong rally was seen to be running out of energy later in
the week, again as profit-takers moved in.
Mexico performed well, as in North America the US ran into rising bond
yields and reduced hopes of a cut in interest rates, after recording a
mid-week high.
Latin American Securities, London based investment managers, report that
Mexico's good start to the year is continuing with foreign investors
attracted by expectations of positive fourth-quarter results. The economic
outlook is encouraging, and the privatisation programme is expected to be
concluded this year.
In Europe, Austria continued to outperform, foreign investors remaining
dominant. Mr Martin Gollner, Austrian analyst at Baring Securities, notes
that buying is now more broadly based.
Radex, Beitscher and Treibacher, companies which produce materials for steel
companies, showed strong gains on the week of between 7 per cent and 14 per
cent.
Political turbulence in neighbouring Yugoslavia and eastern Europe now seems
to have been discounted, he adds, and it would take something catastrophic
to upset the market. Nevertheless, weak performances in Italy, Sweden and
Denmark left Europe slightly down on the week.

FT  18 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Perrier loses some sparkle as
equities rise in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses saw thin trading in the absence of Wall Street, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS closed near the day's highs but volume was thin with just FFr1.6bn
worth of shares traded. The CAC 40 index ended up 16.96 at 1,882.07.
Peugeot was the day's most active share, rising FFr17 to FFr705 and
accounting for about 10 per cent of total turnover. But dealers could find
no reason for the rise.
Perrier was in the limelight, falling FFr45 or 2.86 per cent to FFr1,530
with 48,855 shares traded, as news that the French government had approved
the FFr1,475-a-share bid from Nestle and Indosuez dampened hopes of a rival
bid. Several brokers are also advising investors to take profits in view of
the stock's recent run.
However, Exor, the main shareholder in Perrier, jumped FFr53 or 3.7 per cent
to FFr1,486 in unusually heavy volume of 23,580 shares on rumoured buying by
Suez in order to help the Nestle-Indosuez camp.
Credit Local de France was another gainer, adding FFr5.20 to FFr229.70 with
a heavy 258,630 shares traded. The stock has made a steady recovery from its
unsuccessful flotation in December last year.
FRANKFURT remained subdued, the DAX index closing 4.59 higher at 1,681.07
after a 1.10 decline to 685.61 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume was
unchanged at DM4.4bn.
Among blue chips there was support for Siemens, up DM4.70 to DM668, and for
Volkswagen which reported that its January global car and van sales were up
2.3 per cent to a record high. VW shares rose DM2.50 to DM338.30.
Construction stocks were mostly weaker in spite of an industry association
forecast of 15 per cent growth in construction volume in east Germany this
year, against 2 per cent in the west. Hochtief fell DM18 to DM1,162 but
observers said that the setback was technical, with dealers getting out of
the sector after a period of relative strength.
Second-liners saw Ava up DM61 to DM751 on new rumours of buying by Asko,
which confirmed last week that it held an Ava majority. Asko rose DM13 to
DM747 following an appreciative note from County NatWest.
MILAN opened the March trading account on a sour note, failing to rise by
the 1 per cent expected at the start of a new account. Dealers said that
political uncertainty and fears of a shortfall in financing the public debt
this year weighed on the market. The Comit index rose just 1.97 to 533.18 in
turnover estimated at L100bn after Friday's L132.2bn.
Pirelli, which launched a L520bn capital increase yesterday, rose L6 to
L1,116 at the fixing as operators covered their short positions but the
stock then fell back to L1,080 after hours. Pirelli rights were settled at
L37 but then fell to L27 after hours. Dealers said Pirelli's rights issue
was not going well but that this should not affect the market as a whole
because take-up of the new shares, priced at L1,000 each, was guaranteed by
the underwriting consortium led by Mediobanca.
AMSTERDAM drifted, the CBS Tendency index gaining 0.2 to 122.0. Philips shed
Fl 0.70 to Fl 32.70, partly on rumours, later denied by the company, that it
was considering a rights issue. There is also uncertainty ahead of
Thursday's 1991 group figures, with some analysts forecasting a dividend of
50 cents against the last payment of Fl 2.00 in 1989.
Fokker moved ahead Fl 1.30 to Fl 30.50 after Friday's announcement that it
had won an order to supply a Chinese airline with seven aircraft.
MADRID was steady, the general index ending up 0.47 at 259.24 with volume
estimated at Pta10bn (Pta12bn). Electricals recorded the most activity.
STOCKHOLM recovered from morning losses of over 1 per cent to close with the
Affarsvarlden General index 1.9 higher at 940.8, but dealers noted that
volume was low and sentiment cautious.
Astra B shares closed SKr3 higher at SKr578 ahead of Thursday's results but
Volvo B shares fell SKr5 to SKr370 after the company said that the proposed
merger with Procordia might still be able to go ahead.
HELSINKI recorded its highest level for five months. The HEX Index closed up
3.1 to 905.0 in turnover of FM33.3m, against FM20.2m on Friday.
OSLO fell on news of weaker prices for North Sea oil following the Opec
ministers meeting in Geneva. The all-share index lost 5.40 to 421.51 in
turnover of NKr180m. Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceuticals group, shed NKr8
to NKr255 after reports in a medical journal questioned the benefits of one
of its products.
VIENNA continued its upswing in high turnover. The 18-share ATX index rose
27.44 to 1,094.29, its highest since mid-September last year.

FT  18 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Irish stocks unruffled by political
upheaval - The calm and composure in Dublin's stockbroking community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent months, the dealing rooms of Dublin's stockbroking community have
been a refuge of calm and composure from the frenzy and commotion in the
meeting rooms and corridors of the Irish parliament.
The political upheaval, which brought the country to the brink of a general
election and culminated last week in the abrupt termination of the 38-year
political career of prime minister Mr Charles Haughey, barely caused a
ripple on the Dublin stock exchange. As one broker remarked: 'These issues
loom larger in the media than they do in the minds of professional
investors.'
Events such as a shift in German interest rates, or a downturn in retail
sales in the UK or US, are more likely to make an impact on Irish business
prospects than party squabbles in the Dail.
After nearly 10 months of flat performance and thin trading, the Dublin
market finally staged a rally in mid-January. With some minor erosion since
then, this has left the ISEQ general index at 1,442.54 yesterday, up 4.5 per
cent since last December 31, marginally ahead of the FT-Actuaries Europe
index.
This was triggered by an upturn in New York, according to Davy Stockbrokers,
one of the 'big four' Dublin houses. 'Most of the Irish industrials depend
upon the outside world for momentum in their earnings,' says a Davy analyst.
Around 60 per cent of the earnings of quoted Irish industrial groups are
derived from overseas sales. Jefferson Smurfit, an Irish blue chip stock,
which accounts for 17.5 per cent of the Dublin stock market's IPounds 8.4bn
(Dollars 5.3bn) market capitalisation, has climbed 17 per cent this year on
the heels of the New York rally. Almost 90 per cent of its sales are
overseas.
The question being asked now is whether the market is following the pattern
of 1991, which saw a 40 per cent surge in the first quarter, and lethargy
for the rest of the year. By December, some brokers were complaining that
they were not even meeting their overheads.
Overall, however, the market grew by some 20 per cent in 1991, making it one
of the better-performing markets in Europe, and most of the Dublin broking
firms are predicting a similar outturn in 1992.
Davy expects between 15 and 20 per cent growth and National City Brokers is
forecasting 20 per cent. Solomon's, a subsidiary of Anglo-Irish Bank, noted
that 1,600 for the ISEQ index by the year-end would represent 16 per cent
growth over 1991, but would still leave the Irish market off its all-time
high, which it reached in 1990.
Mr Brian O'Loughlan, a fund manager at Irish Life, Ireland's biggest life
assurance company and a major institutional investor, sees a foundation for
all this. 'Earnings (on Irish stocks) could well be 12 to 13 per cent up
this year,' he says. 'Valuations on the Irish market are quite attractive
relative to the US and the UK, so there is room for rerating. That kind of
(market) growth is achievable.'
While Smurfit, in p/e terms, trades at a substantial discount to US paper
stocks, another Irish blue chip, CRH, is seen as cheap against its UK
counterparts. Irish food shares are similarly seen to have a good
risk-reward balance. There is an expectation, therefore, that even if the US
and UK markets flatten out, Dublin can catch up the ground it lost in 1990.
'There would be money to come in and buy cheap stocks here,' says one
analyst.
Meanwhile, there is excitement for the market in the anticipated flotation
of Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), the world's largest aircraft leasing
company. Investors are still waiting for a firm date for the flotation,
planned for London, Tokyo, New York and Dublin, which could value GPA at
between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn.
Mr O'Loughlan says that Irish institutional investors who do not already
hold a significant stake in the Shannon-based aircraft leasing company will
want to build one up for strategic reasons: 'The benchmark set by those who
already have a stake is about 7 to 8 per cent of their portfolios. The
demand for GPA shares in the Irish market would be around IPounds 75m to
IPounds 100m.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil recovery in Kuwait runs
ahead of target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT WILL be producing 920,000 barrels of oil a day by the end of the
second quarter of this year and averaging more than 1m b/d in the third
quarter, Mr Homoud al Rqobah, the oil minister, said yesterday.
The minister, just returned from the Geneva ministerial meeting of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said output was reviving at a
monthly rate of 70,000 to 80,000 b/d, well above an earlier target of 50,000
b/d a month.
More than 120 wells, out of the emirate's 1,080, are back in production and
28 have already been re-drilled in the southern fields. The oil ministry has
set a target of 100 newly-drilled wells by June and estimates that 65 per
cent of the 727 wells ignited by the departing Iraqis may be reparable at
the well head.
Mr Rqobah said Kuwait's output share of 812,000 b/d under the Opec ceiling
of 22.9m b/d agreed in Geneva represented an average of expected output for
the second quarter. Production, including Kuwait's share of output from the
joint Saudi Arabia-Kuwait neutral zone, will be 710,000 b/d by next month.
The minister portrayed the Geneva agreement as a modest, if not entirely
satisfactory achievement. 'Any agreement is better than no agreement,' he
said; '22.9m b/d is not really the best, but good enough.'
He said the deal would offer only limited support to prices in the second
quarter, and predicted a still more difficult Opec summit when ministers
meet again in May to consider an output ceiling for the third quarter. By
then, he said, Kuwait would be pumping 1.07m b/d and on target to meet its
pre-war Opec quota level of 1.5m b/d by the year's end.
Thereafter, Mr Rqobah said, Kuwait could press for an increased share of
Opec output to help recoup lost revenues. 'If there is an increment in the
Opec ceiling, we should have an increment of that,' he said.
The minister also said that Kuwait would very shortly award the management
contract for repairs to the country's three refineries, Mina al-Ahmadi, Mina
Abdullah and Shuaiba, the shortlist for which includes Foster Wheeler, Fluor
Daniel and Brown &amp; Root of the US. Present working capacity is 270,000 b/d,
and Mr Rqobah said this will be restored to 650,000 b/d by next year - about
80,000 b/d short of pre-invasion capacity.

London robusta coffee prices sank to contract lows. Dealers said possible
fund selling added to the pressure on an over-supplied market. London cocoa
prices fell as Ivory Coast arrivals continued to be higher than previously
forecast. News that an international cocoa agreement based on a withholding
system was to be formally proposed by consumers at the ICCO talks had no
apparent impact. London's freight futures market moved into free fall in
afternoon trading after a limit fall of 50 points in the morning. A 16-point
fall in the Baltic Freight Index to 1,299 sent further bearish signals.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Rebuilding finance on shaky
foundations - UK building societies' efforts to refund their debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POOR state of the UK housing market is dragging on into a sensitive
period for UK building societies, raising doubts about profitability and
credit quality as they look to refinance a substantial part of their Pounds
20bn capital market borrowings.
In total, UK building societies have Pounds 2.6bn bonds and syndicated loans
maturing this year, rising to Pounds 4.5bn in 1993 and Pounds 3.4bn in 1994.
One thing is certain: banks and bond market investors are demanding much
higher returns than in the late 1980s, when building societies were first
allowed to tap the capital markets.
In 1987, for example, Halifax, the largest building society, signed a
five-year Pounds 300m multi-currency facility which gave it access to
sterling funding at just 0.05 per cent (5 basis points) over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor).
The facility runs out in July, and Halifax would have to pay at least 30
basis points over Libor to replace it with a similar loan.
During the late 1980s, building societies faced a declining inflow of
savings from retail depositors and increasing demand for housing finance. To
meet this shortfall they expanded capital markets borrowings, to more than
20 per cent of total funding in many cases.
While demand for new mortgages has fallen sharply, there is little prospect
of replacing capital markets debts with retail deposits. Despite the
severity of the recession, building societies saw a net outflow of funds in
November and December.
Bankers are taking a cautious approach. At the end of last year, Chelsea
Building Society had to improve the terms of a planned Pounds 125m loan to
attract wary banks into the deal.
With this in mind, the bigger building societies are looking to tap other
sources of funding, such as the bond and medium-term note markets, where
better terms are available. The bigger societies now have access to a
greater variety of wholesale markets, and so have less need for 'stand-by'
banking facilities. Last June, for example, Halifax Building Society set up
a Pounds 3bn medium-term note programme.
'Since our loans were arranged in the late 1980s our wholesale funding base
has matured and the need for syndicated credits is less apparent,' said Mr
Mike Ellis, treasurer of the Halifax. 'We can now afford to be more
selective in our use of markets.'
But even in the bond markets there is upward pressure on margins. New types
of instrument will have to be used if funding costs are to be held down.
Around 40 to 50 per cent of sterling floating-rate note issues, the favoured
form of bond market borrowing for building societies in the late 1980s, are
held by banks. These are usually the same banks which lent money to building
societies through syndicated credits, bought mortgage-backed bonds and
sometimes lent money directly to UK consumers for house purchases.
As the property market has slumped, these banks have exercised a sharp
pull-back from new housing-related exposures. There are fewer willing buyers
of building society bonds.
Hence increased borrowing costs do not only reflect a decline in the
perceived credit quality of building societies. 'The level of funding that
the building societies are seeking is more than the banks are willing to
give,' said Ms Zoe Shaw, director at Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German
bank which is an active lender to the building society sector.
While the bigger societies still remain - measured against most other
financial institutions - strong and tightly regulated, there is little doubt
the credit quality of building societies looks under pressure.
There have already been some forced takeovers. At the end of last year, Town
&amp; Country, the 15th largest institution, was rescued by the Woolwich. There
is intense speculation that other building societies will have to be bailed
out.
Although the rate of residential mortgage defaults looks to be slowing, up
to 80,000 homes will be repossessed this year.
The rate of repossessions means building societies could be left managing
large, vacant residential property portfolios. Partly to avoid this, and
partly to satisfy political pressure, building societies have pledged to
provide Pounds 1bn this year to alleviate the crisis.
Most of the money will be made available in the form of cheap loans to
housing associations, which will in turn buy properties in danger of
repossession and then rent them.
If the housing associations are to charge affordable rents, the loans have
to be made at very low interest rates, as low as 3.5 per cent in London,
where property prices are highest.
Yet the cost of funds to building societies, whether from the capital
markets or from depositors, is 10 per cent or more. Hence funding mortgage
rescue loans will eat into building societies profits for some years to
come.
The societies hope to recoup losses by taking an equity interest in the
properties. If homes become vacant after five years, assuming property
prices have gone up, the housing association will have to sell on the open
market. The building society will take 80 per cent of any capital gain.
Hence the net cost to the building societies will depend on when properties
become vacant, whether property prices have risen and the cost of funding
cheap loans to housing associations in the intervening period.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Clearing banks delay plans to
join Taurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's big clearing banks have dropped plans to be among the first into
the planned paperless settlement system, Taurus, despite having earlier been
among those most eager to join.
The banks' change of heart indicates the difficulties the the UK authorities
will have in bringing leading British companies into the system, which is
due to be launched in April 1993.
The banks - particularly Barclays, National Westminster and Lloyds, which
between them control around 90 per cent of the share registration business
in the UK - had earlier been intent on being the first into Taurus. Some
believed that being in the first wave would have helped prove to their share
registration customers they were prepared for the transition.
Yet none of these three, nor Midland Bank, is preparing to ask its
shareholders for approval to join Taurus at their forthcoming annual
meetings, ruling them out from the launch. The problems they have
encountered are common to many other UK companies.
Barclays and NatWest believe it will be difficult to obtain shareholder
approval under the Taurus regulations as they currently stand. Like many
British companies, they have more than one class of share in issue. Under
their articles of association, this leaves both banks needing one-third of
their shareholders to vote in a special 'class meeting' of shareholders.
Yet neither feels confident of getting the support, given the inertia of
their institutional shareholders, many of whom do not vote even by proxy at
general meetings. Some investment managers would also need to get the
support of the beneficial owners of shares they manage.
According to an internal memorandum produced at Barclays: 'This will be both
time-consuming and expensive for all concerned, with no guarantee that the
necessary quorum will be achieved in time for the meeting.'
One possible answer, according to Barclays, is to seek a capital
reorganisation to do away its second class of shares (staff shares). The
bank concludes this is expensive and troublesome, and adds: 'For many public
companies, such a course of action would not even be within contemplation.'
The London Stock Exchange said around two-thirds of the UK's top 600
companies had more than one class of share in issue and so would need to
call separate class meetings in this way. However, it said this did not need
to cause difficulties, since class meetings could be convened with little
difficulty.
The exchange also played down another concern of the banks - that full
Taurus regulations would not be available until May, when the exchange plans
to publish its own draft Taurus rule book. The exchange said companies did
not need to wait for the publication of these details before putting a
proposal to their shareholders that they should move on to Taurus.

in the international bond market, raising Pounds 150m funding with an issue
lead managed by Warburg Securities, writes Simon London.
The five-year bonds carry a 10 5/8 per cent coupon and were priced to yield
100 basis points more than comparable UK government securities - seen as
generous by participants.
UK investment managers certainly saw the deal as fair value and bought the
deal with enthusiasm. The bonds traded up from a fixed re-offer price of
99.70 to stand at par bid by the close. At this level the yield spread was
95 basis points over gilts.
The issue was made through Sun Alliance's holding company, which is quoted
on the London Stock Exchange. The proceeds can be either injected as equity
into the insurance subsidiaries or passed on as inter-company debt.
In common with many other UK insurers, Sun Alliance has faced heavy losses
from mortgage indemnity insurance. Analysts are expecting a pre-tax loss of
close to Pounds 450m when full-year results for 1991 are announced in early
April.
Sun Alliance's solvency ratio, the ratio of capital to premium income used
by analysts and regulators as a measure of financial strength, is likely to
have fallen to around 67 per cent from 81 per cent in 1990.
This is comfortably above the level required by UK law and better than the
other four quoted composite insurers. However, Mr Peter Fiddimore, group
treasurer, said the group wanted to maintain the option of passing the
proceeds down to operating subsidiaries in the form of equity.
In the near-term, the proceeds of the issue will reduce reliance on the
company's Pounds 400m commercial paper programmes. The bonds issued
yesterday were rated A1/A by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit
rating agencies.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Bonds: European Investment Bank set to launch
Dollars 500m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Investment Bank was yesterday preparing to launch a Dollars
500m seven-year issue in the international bond market, with five
underwriting firms bidding for the new issue mandate.
Some syndicate officials anticipated that the deal would be launched at a
yield spread as low as 5 basis points more than US Treasury bonds.
Others argued that the uncertain tone of the Eurodollar sector last week
demanded a more generous spread - at least 10 basis points.
One area of uncertainty is the demand from Italian investors, usually heavy
buyers of EIB paper, which is exempt from withholding tax.
The last EIB Eurodollar deal, a Dollars 400m 10-year issue launched via IBJ
International in January, did not attract the frenzied buying by Italian
investors which is often associated with tax-exempt issues.
However, from a spread of just 6 basis points this earlier transaction has
since held its ground and EIB is likely to launch another very
tightly-priced issue today.
Elsewhere, activity was restricted to retail-targeted deals. Shell Australia
added to recent supply of medium-dated Australian dollar paper, launching a
ADollars 100m five-year deal lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets.
The 10 1/8 per cent bonds traded down to less 1.95 bid by the close, just
inside full fees of 2 per cent.
Prudential Funding added CDollars 100m to its CDollars 150m three-year deal
launched last November.
The new tranche of 8 1/4 per cent bonds, lead managed by UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, was priced to yield 32 basis points more than Canadian govern-ment
bonds, which is a pick up of 17 basis points over the outstanding bonds.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Strong rise in yen fuels demand for
Japanese bonds

THE SHARP rise in the yen against the US dollar following central bank
intervention, pushed up Japanese government bond prices yesterday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 5.47 per
cent to close at 5.39 per cent on above-average trading volume. Dealers
noted strong demand for yen bonds as the Bank of Japan and US Federal
Reserve intervened in the foreign exchange market, selling dollars for yen
when the US currency reached Y128.
Altogether, dealers estimated about Dollars 500m was sold yesterday. The yen
strengthened from Friday's closing level in New York of Y127.80, to Y126.93
on Monday. A strong yen increases the attraction of yen assets for investors
and gives the Bank of Japan more freedom to ease monetary policy and cut the
official discount rate.
A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official was quoted as being in favour of
a stronger yen, indicating the level achieved at the time of the Group of
Seven nations meeting in late January when the dollar traded at around
Y124.5.
UK government bonds gained up to half a percentage point yesterday, making
up for Friday's correction in the market and fuelled by hopes of a cut in
the UK base rate.
Traders said the gilt-edged market was oversold on Friday, following the
fall in the US Treasury bond market, but sterling's strength and hopes of
lower interest rates helped the market to recover yesterday.
The 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose from 101 1/16 to 101 1/8 while the
benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt 2003/07 climbed from 115 23/32 to 116 5/32 .
Volume in the futures market was below average as participants waited for
today's release of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures.
GERMAN government bonds ended little changed on the day in dull trade as
market participants waited for the reopening of the US market to provide
some direction.
In the futures market, the March Liffe bund futures contract traded at
87.87, up eight basis points from Friday's close after trading in a narrow
range.
US markets were closed for Presidents Day.

FOREIGN stockbrokers with representative offices and research units in
Malaysia must apply for an investment advisory licence by the end of the
year or face closure, according to Mr Nik Mohamed Din, Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) executive chairman, Reuter reports.
Foreign stockbrokers in equity tie-ups with local brokers need not apply for
a separate licence, but must move to the offices of the local partners,
under the ruling from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Foreign brokerages have rushed into Malaysia since the KLSE split with the
Stock Exchange of Singapore in 1990. Some have linked with local brokers
while others operate as research units without having to obtain an
investment advisory licence.

fall in car sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UMW, the Malaysian motor and heavy equipment group, yesterday reported a 5
per cent rise in its pre-tax profits to MDollars 208m (USDollars 79.4m) for
1991, but warned that the current year's car sales are likely to suffer 'in
line with industry expectations'.
The group's main business is assembly and distribution of Japan's Toyota
vehicles.
Many distributors have reported lower sales in the last few months mainly
due to high interest rates and tighter credit.
UMW's 1991 turnover rose by 6.5 per cent to MDollars 2.1bn from MDollars
1.9bn, and operating profit was nearly 5 per cent higher at MDollars 205m.
Associates added MDollars 3m to pre-tax profits.
Profits after tax and minorities improved 4 per cent to MDollars 113m, but
fell 9 per cent to 52.8 cents on a per-share basis, partly as a result of an
increase in equity from loan stock conversion to shares.
The group has recommended a final dividend of 7.5 cents a share, making a
total of 15 cents, unchanged from a year earlier.

at halfway stage

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JENNINGS, Australia's biggest home builder, has remained deep in the red in
the first half to December after further big extraordinary losses in its
problem areas.
The company, whose operations are at the cutting edge of the Australian
recession, reduced extraordinary losses to ADollars 32.6m (USDollars 24.6m)
net from ADollars 96.6m a year earlier.
This still swamped slightly improved operating earnings - up to ADollars
3.7m from ADollars 1.1m - and left the company's net earnings ADollars 27.9m
in the red.
Although this was an improvement on the previous half's ADollars 94.4m net
loss, directors have omitted the interim dividend compared with a 2 cents a
share payout a year earlier. The result followed a fall in sales revenue to
ADollars 301.2m from ADollars 370.7m.
Jennings is involved in a programme of asset sales, rationalisations and
debt rescheduling, moving back to its core business of house building. The
biggest item in its extraordinary losses was business writedowns and closure
costs.
The directors said asset sales came to ADollars 45.4m and disposals since
December 1990 totalled ADollars 225m.
'The company will continue to dispose of non-core assets over time and as
market conditions permit, to achieve maximum economic value for
shareholders,' they said.
'Management is targeting sales at the rate of approximately ADollars 100m
per annum over the next 24 to 36 months. The timing of sales and the
realisation values achieved will be dependent upon market conditions over
that period.'
'Whilst good progress has been made to date with the company's asset sales
programme, Jennings continues to have a substantial exposure to the
commercial, tourist and retail property sectors in Australia and the outlook
for commercial property in particular remains very clouded.
'The company's asset values would be vulnerable to any further decline in
those areas, and sales prospects are dependent upon a variety of factors
which are difficult to predict.'
The directors pointed to 'tentative signs' of the Australian economy
emerging from recession, but they said recovery in the housing sector would
depend on consumer confidence levels.
The operating profit followed a tax provision of ADollars 2.4m compared with
ADollars 295,000. Interest charges eased to ADollars 9.5m from ADollars
12.9m, while depreciation was down to ADollars 2.1m from ADollars 2.8m.

<TEXT>
CANON, the Japanese precision instrument maker, yesterday announced a 3.9
per cent rise in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y76.1bn (Dollars 618.7m)
for the year ended last December, thanks to continued strong sales of its
computer printers using new bubble jet and laser technology.
The company's announcement comes at a time when profits at Japanese
high-technology companies are being squeezed by sluggish exports and lower
profit margins.
Sales at Canon rose 15.3 per cent to Y1,073.4bn from Y931.30bn. Canon said
that sales of its office automation machinery, including its computer
printers, which rose 13 per cent to Y793bn, helped sustain profits.
Camera sales increased 25 per cent to Y220.7bn. Exports rose 18 per cent to
Y812.7bn, while domestic sales rose 7 per cent to Y260.6bn.
The company suffered exchange rate losses due to the yen's appreciation
against the dollar, but interest received on deposits rose by 18.4 per cent
to Y25.7bn due to higher interest rates and an increase in short-term funds
due to warrant-bond issues worth Y100bn.
For the current year Canon expects a slowdown in sales and profit growth,
with a 1.1 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y77bn on a
7.1 per cent rise in sales to Y1,150bn.
Canon expects to maintain capital investment at high levels at Y75bn, a 5.4
per cent increase from the previous year.

THE public offering for 30 per cent of the shares in Perusahaan Otomobil

The company - a joint venture between the Malaysian government and
Mitsubishi of Japan - received MDollars 2.1bn (USDollars 808m) in bids for
the 55.5m shares offered to the public at MDollars 5 each.
This was in spite of the company predicting a fall in pre-tax profits over

Under government listing rules, the allocation of shares must be made along

Proton employees were allocated 5.7m shares, while the balance was reserved
for government-approved Bumiputra, or Malay, investors.
Almost 98 per cent in the employee portion was subscribed; details of
Bumiputra bids were not disclosed.

MISAWA, a Japanese property group, is to take a 13 per cent stake in
Ishihara Construction, an ailing contractor, for an undisclosed sum, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
Misawa's purchase of 5.42m Ishihara shares aims to help reconstruct
Ishihara, which is in financial trouble because it guaranteed a large debt
for steel-frame maker Kyowa, a company at the heart of a political scandal.
Kyowa was declared bankrupt last May with debts of about Y200bn (Dollars
1.6bn).
Ishihara had guaranteed Y21bn of Kyowa's outstanding debt and has been
obliged to put up three Japanese properties and another in Malaysia as
collateral for the debt. The contractor had guaranteed loans totalling
Y4.6bn for Ohira Sangyo, a failed property group.
'We consider this purchase an investment in the future of Ishihara, which
has good engineers and a good reputation for high-rise building
construction,' Misawa said.
Ishihara is listed on the Tokyo stock exchange's second section. Misawa is
the main shareholder of Misawa Homes, the Japanese home builder.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sweden to launch strategy to
attract foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FREE market industrial strategy with a direct appeal to foreign investors
is about to be launched in Sweden.
'We want to turn the country into an investment market for buying companies
and commercial property,' said Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister
yesterday. 'I want to see Swedish industry become much more
internationalised.'
The main plank in the strategy is the ambitious industrial privatisation
programme due to start in the spring. There are 35 state controlled and
partially controlled companies on the list for complete transfer to the
private sector with a market value of SKr150bn, amounting to 11.1 per cent
of Sweden's gross national product.
Mr Westerberg said there will be a sizeable state share issue every spring
with a smaller one following each autumn.
Five large companies are being prepared for early privatisation. These are
the industrial group Celsius, which has a strong defence product portfolio;
the steel company SSAB; the mining group LKAB; OK Petroleum; and the food
and pharmaceutical conglomerate Procordia which Mr Westerberg insists must
be 'broad privatisation with or without Volvo'.
One of the companies will be chosen next month for complete flotation in the
early summer. None is dependent on state subsidies. All have gone through
restructuring and are making healthy profits, according to Mr Westerberg.
Only a handful of staff at the industry department will be involved in the
process. Outside expertise is being bought in from the banks, auditors and
solicitors from home and abroad.
Each company on the list will create its team complete with its own
management, representatives from the government and, in time it is hoped,
from the trade unions.
These will formulate the changes required to make their enterprises ready
for the market and decide whether further capital is required for them.
The final decision on the timing of each privatisation remains with Mr
Westerberg but he will be advised by a commission on the appropriate share
price and other conditions for each sale.
Other measures in the pipeline from Mr Westerberg will involve;
The abolition of the distinction between restricted and unrestricted shares.
This change will come into force in January 1993 with the completion of the
single internal market of the 19 nation European Economic Area although
Sweden will continue to allow restrictive access to voting shares which
still protect companies from foreign intrusion.
The introduction of policies to increase more risk capital, particularly for
small companies with changes in capital taxation and tax free loans for new
enterprises on the German pattern.
The lifting this summer of legal restrictions that hamper new companies
being created by foreigners being launched in Sweden.
The introduction of competition laws in the autumn with the creation of a
new body with teeth to deal with price fixing and monopolies.

CENTRAL-European Inter-national Bank (CIB), based in Hungary and the first
offshore bank in central-eastern Europe, yesterday reported 1991 pre-tax
profits of Dollars 33.4m, sharply up on a year earlier.
CIB made Dollars 15m in 1991 after provisions, a rise of 47 per cent, and
Central European Credit Bank (KHB), its wholly-owned Hungarian subsidiary,
contributed Ft1.4bn (Dollars 18.4m) to the result.
The 1991 earnings continue the record of lucrative returns for Banco
Commerciale Italiana, Bayerische Vereinsbank, Societe Generale, the
Long-term Credit Bank of Japan and the Taiyo Kobe Bank, the five foreign
banks which together control 66 per cent of CIB. National Bank of Hungary,
the Hungarian central bank, holds the remaining shareholding but is expected
to withdraw eventually.
The results, in proportion to paid-in capital of Dollars 35m, demonstrate
the attractions of those Hungarian financial institutions which are
relatively unencumbered by bad loans to insolvent state-owned companies.
CIB attributed the profits growth to the healthy state of its main trade
financing and short-term corporate lending business. CIB said it financed 15
per cent of Hungarian trade turnover in 1991. One of the banks' main clients
is Tungsram, the Hungarian subsidiary of General Electric, the US company.

FREIA MARABOU, the Norwegian branded chocolate, snacks and confectionery
producer, has reported a 16 per cent increase in 1991 profits, before
extraordinary items, to NKr512m (Dollars 80.9m). It plans to increase the
dividend to NKr2.25 a share from NKr1.50.
The 1990 merger of Freia and Marabou has been an unquestionable success, the
company said.
Group sales rose by 13 per cent to NKr5.401bn, while operating profit
advanced 17 per cent to NKr548m. Freia said that chocolate sales improved by
10 per cent to NKr2.911bn, while operating profit rose 12 per cent to
NKr329m.
Freia's chocolate business accounts for 51 per cent of group sales. Sales to
Germany and the UK, the most important markets for chocolate, increased
respectively by 46 per cent and 20 per cent.
Confectionery sales rose 11 per cent to NKr655m, while operating profit
improved by NKr23m to NKr33m. This was helped by better co-ordination of
business activities. Sales of snacks rose 20 per cent to NKr992m and
operating profit increased by 11 per cent to NKr111m. Freia said it had
improved as market leader in Scandinavia and commanded a 50 per cent market
share.
The group's other food products lifted sales by 10 per cent to NKr1.213bn.
Freia said that the rise in profits was due mainly to a increase in Sweden
by biscuits, breakfast cereals and ketchup.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Court set to rule in battle for
ownership of Perrier
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle over the ownership of Perrier, one of France's best known mineral
water companies, moves into the legal arena today when a court at Nimes, in
southern France, will conclude the first of the series of cases critical in
determining the outcome of the battle.
The court is considering a case lodged by Nestle, the Swiss food group that
has staged a FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile bid for Perrier, to freeze
the voting rights on the shares held by Exor, the French property group
which controls Perrier and which is allied with the Agnelli family of Italy.
Last month, Nestle, which has teamed up with Indosuez, the Paris bank, to
stage its bid, won an injunction to freeze temporarily the voting rights on
the shares held by Exor, for which the Agnellis are in the throes of a
FFr5.6bn friendly bid. Today, the court will decide whether to make that
order permanent.
Next Tuesday, the Paris commercial court is expected to deliver its judgment
on a Nestle action to try to nullify the FFr1.5bn sale earlier this year of
a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier to Saint Louis, the French sugar company
associated with the Agnellis.
Nestle, which this weekend won the French government's permission to go
ahead with its bid, has argued that the share sale is invalid because it was
orchestrated by the Perrier board, which is chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent
who is also chairman of Exor, specifically to block its forthcoming bid. The
French stock market authorities have also examined this argument and,
although they were critical of Exor's relationship with Perrier, said they
could find 'no definite proof' of a concert party.
Nestle needs to win least one of the two cases for its hostile bid to
succeed otherwise Exor and Saint Louis would be able to block its offer with
their combined 49 per cent of Perrier's voting stock.
Meanwhile, the first indications yesterday emerged of Perrier's financial
performance last year. The group, which owns a number of other food brands
including Roquefort cheese as well as its mineral water, posted overall
sales growth of 3.5 per cent to FFr13.55bn in 1991.
Perrier's mineral water division saw sales grow by 4.9 per cent to FFr4.17bn
in France and by 2.2 per cent to FFr4.62bn in other countries. Roquefort's
sales increased by 4.7 per cent in the second half.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Union Bank - have been placed on credit watch
with 'negative implications' by the international rating company Standard
and Poor's.
This follows the announcement of a FM1.7bn (Dollars 383m) net loss by KOP
last year and a deficit in 1991 of FM128m by Union Bank due mainly to high
credit losses. Standard and Poor's said that its decision to place both
banks on credit watch stemmed from their poor short-term prospects.
It added that KOP seemed unlikely to issue equity in the short term because
of the overall weakness of domestic share prices combined with the
suspension of the 1991 dividend and there was likely to be a deterioration
in KOP's core capital position.
Union Bank's results were reported last Friday as a FM128m profit. This
should should have read as a loss.

IVECO, the truck and industrial vehicle arm of Fiat, is to create a joint
venture with Tatra, the Czech vehicle producer. Mercedes-Benz recently
announced plans to acquire stakes Avia and Liaz, Czechoslovakia's other two
truckmakers.
Iveco will pay Dollars 20m for 51 per cent of a new company to which Tatra
will contribute land. Tatra expects the new company to produce 500 trucks a
year by 1993.
Tatra is Czechoslovakia's leading producer of heavy off-road trucks. In
1991, it produced an estimated 10,500 trucks, of which a large portion was
sold to Siberian oil companies.
The company intends to privatise itself using the voucher programme, which
consists of the distribution to the public of vouchers which become shares
once the country's privatisation scheme is completed.
Mercedes-Benz, part of the German Daimler-Benz group, plans to take a 31 per
cent stake in Avia as well as a 20 per cent stake in Liaz, Czechoslovakia's
other two truck companies.
Avia, which produced 9,000 light trucks in 1991, lost most of its export
markets but has successfully increased its domestic sales.
Liaz, on the other hand, produced a third of its 1990 sales level, making
5,000 heavy on-road trucks last year.
All three deals are awaiting approval of the Czech government which has
criticised some of the requirements put forward by Mercedes-Benz. These
include higher tariffs on the import of utility vehicles in Czechoslovakia
and important tax breaks.

FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: New orders at MAN fall by 14% in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW orders at MAN, the German engineering group, fell by 14 per cent to
DM8.6bn (Dollars 5.4bn) in the six months to December as a result of the
world economic slowdown and the slackening of Germany's own post-unification
jump in demand.
But the group still expects turnover and profits to be maintained for the
whole of this year (to June 1992) due to a high backlog in orders.
MAN, whose products include trucks, printing equipment, diesel engines and
industrial plant, said new domestic orders declined by 12 per cent and those
from abroad by 16 per cent.
Turnover in the July-December period - the financial year runs to end-June -
was down by 0.5 per cent to DM8.4bn; while domestic sales were 21 per cent
higher, foreign sales fell by 13 per cent.
The best performance came from MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the commercial vehicle
subsidiary, which produced a rise of 14 per cent in sales to DM3.8bn. This
unit has benefited considerably from demand connected with the supplying and
rebuilding of the east German economy. Truck sales in other markets also
advanced.
By contrast, MAN Roland, the printing equipment manufacturer, suffered a 7
per cent drop in sales to DM1.2bn. MAN Roland recently announced plans to
shed around 750 workers as a result of declining orders. The total number of
MAN group employees went down by 900 people in the July-December period to
63,700.
Because of its continuing high backlog of orders, worth DM18.4bn at
end-December, a 1 per cent rise on the previous year, MAN still expects
turnover to show an overall rise in the 1991-92 financial year.
It said profits should be roughly unchanged. Last year, MAN increased its
net profits by 24 per cent to DM406m on turnover which was 16 per cent
higher at DM19bn.

FII Group, the UK's second largest shoe manufacturer, suffered a 13 per cent
setback in profits to Pounds 3.2m pre-tax for the six months to November 30.
An exceptional provision for redundancies, reorganisation and associated

Turnover of Pounds 40.2m (Pounds 39.7m) included exports of Pounds 6m
(Pounds 5.5m). The interim dividend is lifted from 5p to 5.5p.
Directors said liquidity remained strong with cash balances of nearly Pounds

Reece, the machine tools, brick making and nursing homes group, yesterday

Directors anticipate a pre-tax loss in the second half but expect the group
to show a profit for the full year.
Indications were that the figure would be similar to the Pounds 415,000

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Revamped Wills back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAVILY reconstructed Wills Group, where CT Group, a distributor of high
specification engineering equipment, is the core business, returned to the
black in the six months to December 31.
Taxable profits emerged at Pounds 154,000, struck on turnover of Pounds
7.27m, but because of the overhaul of the company's direction and financial
position, last time's figures which showed losses of Pounds 568,000 on
turnover of Pounds 8.37m are not strictly comparable.
Since summer 1991, Wills has:
been released from bank guarantees relating to the Hawkes trade finance
businesses in Australasia and sold the group to its local managers;
raised Pounds 1.7m net from a rights issue and issued up to 11.2m warrants
to subscribe for one new share at 5p between January 1 1992 and February 1
1994;
repaid loans with Pounds 1.5m of the rights proceeds to its bankers, who
then capitalised the balance of their loans - Pounds 4.56m - into 2.4m new
preference shares;
changed its year-end from December 31 to June 30.
Consequently, Mr David Massie, chairman, said that the current results
contained only two months where Wills operated free of the constraints of
the last few years.
Basic earnings came to 0.51p (losses 3.31p) per share. A return to the
dividend list will be considered in the light of the full year results.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: A pragmatist wary of greener grass - John
Thornhill talks to Liam Strong, the new chief executive of the Sears retail
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK retailing scene has just been presented with an intriguing prospect.
Mr Liam Strong, the energetic 46-year-old former marketing director of
British Airways, yesterday took over as chief executive at Sears, the
notoriously sleepy retailing group which includes Selfridges, Adams,
Olympus, Wallis, Freemans and the British Shoe Corporation.
As the City sees it, the highly ambitious Mr Strong is a man in a hurry  -
in a business that cannot be rushed.
While at BA he developed a reputation as something of a whizz-kid, his most
famous coup being the launch of the World's Biggest Offer, a marketing
campaign which attempted to stimulate air travel after the Gulf war.
Colleagues at BA speak of a man who was fully confident in his own
abilities, unforgiving of others' faults, and impatient to implement change.
But, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Strong appeared decidedly
restrained in his ambitions for Sears.
Wisely perhaps, he offered no sweeping new visions for the future of the
company; nor did he suggest any radical remedial measures.
'Our over-riding objective simply has to be to get a better return on our
assets. Until we have done that there is little point in trying to do
anything else.'
In two sentences he summed up the City's disquiet with Sears and signalled
his determination to tackle it. Analysts have persistently criticised the
poor returns it has been able to generate on an asset base of more than
Pounds 1bn and annual sales exceeding Pounds 2bn.
From peak pre-tax profits of Pounds 273m in 1988-89 Sears fell to Pounds
147m last year as the recession and exceptional charges associated with a
continuing restructuring programme took their toll.
A further fall is expected this year; the dividend is likely to be uncovered
 -and recovery looks set to be long and slow.
Yet Mr Strong was tempted because of what he saw as clear recovery
potential.
'When I looked at Sears I saw a big company with good asset backing, a wide
portfolio of businesses, some problem areas such as footwear and menswear,
and some pluses like childrenswear. And all at the bottom of the business
cycle.'
Since November, Mr Strong has toured the company 'picking up stones to see
what lies beneath', in the words of the chairman, Mr Geoffrey Maitland
Smith.
Now he is responsible for finding solutions. Somewhat surprisingly, given
his background, he is far more an advocate of creeping incremental change
than of the grand gesture.
'The real benefits to be had in the marketplace are from getting the
commercial and operational sides of the business working well together,' he
says. 'There is a tendency in most service businesses - whether in a plane
or in a shop - for the operational side to dominate.'
He is wary of being drawn on specifics, but says he sees his role as
introducing a culture of constant challenge, redefining standards, and
applying them consistently across the business.
He suggests the emphasis must be placed on the more effective use of supply
chain management and information technology systems, and improved levels of
customer service.
He intends to launch a mangement audit to assess the company's managerial
talent and ensure that it is sensibly deployed.
'One of the things that strikes you is that some things are done very well
in certain parts of the group, but they are not applied consistently.'
Mr Strong sought inspiration from other retailers in Europe and North
America before taking up his post.
He concluded that retailing is a dangerous business that has to be carefully
played.
He exhibits a strong streak of pragmatism and adopts a wary view of
expansion either by means of launching new brands or by overseas
acquisition.
'The failure rate of developing new brands in retailing is high. Buying up
exciting formats must be a better way to go than trying to develop something
entirely new yourself,' he says.
And he has a similar attitude towards expansion in mainland Europe. 'We will
be approaching it more cautiously than anything else we do on the principle
that if it is easy someone else will have already done it.'
Overseas turnover last year was about 9 per cent of the total and will
probably be similar this year reflecting growing Euro-business.
Sears is carefully testing its Adams childrenswear franchise in the
Netherlands, its Olympus sportswear outlets in Spain, and its Wallis fashion
concessions in Germany.
It has formed a joint venture with Groupe Andre, the French retailer, to
develop business in northern Europe.
On the home shopping front, Sears has just bought a Dutch mail order group
to combine with its existing Freemans business.
But Mr Strong is aware of the potential pitfalls. 'The grass always looks
greener on the other side of the fence but that's because you know less
about it. When you move there you will fail precisely because you know less
about it,' he says, permitting himself a rare smile.
One area that he accepts may prove more amenable to rapid change is the
Selfridges department store. The business, which has a book value of Pounds
180m, has not produced the returns expected of it. The branding of
Selfridges could certainly be pursued more aggressively, he suggests.
But in spite of his innate caution, the timing of Mr Strong's move to Sears
has been shrewdly calculated.
He can expect to benefit greatly from the restructuring already undertaken
by his predecessor, Mr Michael Pickard, a tall and seemingly ponderous man
given to wearing tie-pins with his initials JMP stamped upon them.
Mr Pickard wrought a quiet revolution at Sears, helping to shift it from a
rambling conglomerate to a more tightly-focused speciality retailer.
He also introduced more rigorous financial disciplines and reorganised the
British Shoe Corporation, which embraces Dolcis, Saxone and Freeman Hardy
Willis. His initiatives at last seem to be beginning to bear fruit.
Mr Strong is astutely sending a subdued message to his intended target
audience in the City.
'What he says is what we want to hear,' says Mr Rodney Forrest, retailing
analyst at stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing. 'But it is also clearly a
reality. He will not suddenly wave a magic wand and it will all come right.
But there will be a progressive turnaround and improvement.'
Mr Strong now has it all to prove. And as he is the first to admit: 'It is
in general more difficult in life to decide how to get things done than to
decide what to do.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons signs pub deal with Brent
Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, yesterday announced that
it had signed agreements for the lease of 734 of its pubs to Pubmaster, the
Brent Walker retail subsidiary.
The deal was completed in spite of a warning from the Office of Fair Trading
that the pubs would still form part of Allied's tied estate.
Allied's legal advice is that the pubs would count towards the 2,380 which
government orders require it to free from exclusive beer supplies by
November.
Under the terms of the agreement with Brent Walker, Allied will supply the
enlarged Pubmaster estate with two thirds of its beer for seven years.
The differences between Allied and the OFT over the status of the pubs may
have to be settled by the courts, though modifications of the beer supply
agreement would probably meet the OFT's requirements.
Mr Don Marshall, Allied Breweries' commercial director, said: 'We have been
working for some time to structure the deal in such a way as to take into
account any concerns the OFT may have. In announcing the signings, we are
confident that this is a further step towards meeting the requirements of
the tied estate order.'
As part of the deal, Allied is buying 46 pubs from Brent Walker for Pounds
20.1m cash, of which Pounds 7m is deferred for one year.
Brent Walker had originally intended to sell 57 pubs to Allied but said
yesterday that 11 had been withdrawn by agreement and had been sold instead
to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hanson launches defence of dividend policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has launched a counter offensive in
response to criticism that its move to a quarterly pay-out amounts to a
dividend cut.
In an attempt to persuade fund managers and analysts that shareholders would
be better off under its new dividend policy Hanson has pub- lished a note
showing that UK share- holders with 100,000 shares would receive net
interest of Pounds 45.42, assuming 10 per cent interest rates, thanks to the
earlier payment.
To minimise its advance corporation tax liability for the year to Sep-
tember 30 1992, Hanson last week announced that it would pay its divi- dend
quarterly from July. There would be three further payments in October,
January and April.
The quarterly dividends would not be less than 2.75p totalling at least last
year's 11p by April.
Last year shareholders received 3.15p in July and 7.85p in February.
Hanson argues that while share- holders will be worse off in July, when they
will receive 2.75p compared with last year's interim of 3.15p, they will be
better off by April since they will have received three quarters of the
dividend earlier than under the old dividend policy.
At a meeting of analysts and insti- tutional shareholders last Friday, Lord
Hanson, was reported by several people present as suggesting that the total
dividend this financial year may be more than 11p.
One analyst said: 'Lord Hanson made it clear that he was irritated that some
commentators had suggested that the group's move to quarterly pay- out was
designed to hide a dividend cut and made it clear that the group was quite
likely to pay more than last year's 11p.'
Hoare Govett, the group's brokers, are predicting a quarterly dividend of
2.82p, making a total of 11.28p.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Aristuein's Pounds 5m buy creates Bank of
Edinburgh Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARISTUEIN, a company set up in 1990 with the aim of acquiring small to
medium-sized building societies, has acquired the Goode Durrant Bank.
The bank will now change its name to Bank of Edinburgh and Aristuein will
change its own name to Bank of Edinburgh Group.
Goode Durrant Bank was a subsidiary of Goode Durrant, the vehicle hire,
motor distribution and building group.
Aristuein paid Pounds 5m for the bank and as part of the deal sold Goode
Durrant Bank's loan portfolio at its written down book value of Pounds 1.4m
to another subsidiary of the Goode Durrant group.
The portfolio consisted of loans to property developers in the south of
England.
The bank, which inherits a 'stable depositor base,' according to Aristuein,
will now concentrate on taking personal savings and providing residential
mortgages.
It will market itself through the press and independent financial
intermediaries.
Mr Ken Murray, managing director of Aristuein, said it had always been the
intention of the company to secure Bank of England permission to convert
itself into a bank called Bank of Edinburgh, either before or as part of a
merger with a building society.
Aristuein was set up in December 1990 with Pounds 26m of capital from UK and
European institutions with the aim of taking over building societies and
merging them into a federation which would be strong enough to compete with
larger institutions.
Mr Murray said yesterday that it was in talks with several building
societies about possible mergers but the discussions were covered by
confidentiality agreements. 'We are very ambitious,' he said.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Surviving the gloomy prognostications -
Problems at the very British Union Discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE THE House of Lords, the City of London's discount houses have, with
monotonous regularity over the past decade, been decried as archaic
institutions, doomed to extinction.
Yet these peculiarly British securities houses, which act as intermediaries
between banks and the Bank of England, have survived all the gloomy
prognostications. Participants in the discount market were therefore
cautioning yesterday that the losses made by Union Discount in 1991 should
not be seen as symptomatic of a widespread malaise.
Though Union is one of the three biggest houses - together with Gerrard &amp;
National and Cater Allen - its problems are not typical of the industry,
because the bulk of its losses were made by a leasing subsidiary, Sabre
Leasing, which is quite distinct from its money market operations.
However, Union's discount house subsidiary - one of the oldest and biggest
of the houses - also made a loss, of Pounds 2.91m.
It blamed 'unusual trading conditions in the discount market'.
Discount houses traditionally make profits when interest rates are falling,
as they have been in the past year. 'If we cannot make profits in those
conditions, then our days may be numbered,' says a director of one of
Union's rivals.
A simplified example of how discount houses operate should help to explain
his concern. The British banks place a certain amount of their surplus cash
on deposit with the discount houses. The discount houses will typically pay
about  1/2 per cent more than the bank base rate for this money, which is
repayable on demand.
They then invest this 'call' money in bills - securities maturing in one
month or three months - which are likely to yield less than the base rate.
On the face of it, therefore, the discount houses lose money on these
transactions.
However, if the base rate falls, then the discount houses will pay less for
the money on call from the banks, but will earn an unchanged rate on the
bills until they mature. 'We are creaming it for 90 days,' says a discount
house director.
That has been the theory. The recent practice has been different however.
'Interest rates have often not fallen as quickly as we expected,' says the
discount house director. 'So we have had to continue to pay an expensive
rate for money for rather longer.'
However, Union's discount house losses appear to be the exception, not the
rule. Other discount houses said yesterday that they had been profitable in
the past year, if not as profitable as they might have been in previous
periods of declining rates.
They added that in the past few months it has become easier once again to
make profits. But most have reduced their exposure to swings in interest
rates in either direction by using the futures and forward markets.
Nonetheless the prospect of economic and monetary union may pose a
longer-term threat to the seven pure discount houses and two 'hybrids', or
discount houses which have been merged into gilt-edged market-makers, the
dealers in government bonds.
Discount houses are part of a system for controlling interest rates which is
unique in Europe. Central banks on the continent tend to deal directly with
banks. But the Bank of England does not.
It has an exclusive relationship with the discount houses, which it uses as
intermediaries when influencing the level of the base lending rate and when
lending to the money market to prevent liquidity shortages and extreme
volatility in interest rates.
This system has been in existence in roughly its current form since before
the Second World War, though the houses date from the 19th century. The Bank
of England believes it is an efficient system, which it is keen to preserve.
If any individual house ran into serious difficulties - and there was no
suggestion yesterday that Union's plight is parlous - the Bank might allow
the house to disappear. But it would make sure that any winding-up did not
damage lenders to that discount house or the financial system.
Discount houses accept that European monetary union may lead to the end of
their privileges. The continental system of dealing direct with banks might
be employed by a new pan-European central bank.
But though that would involve the extinction of discount houses - as defined
by their relationship with the Bank - the firms themselves could in theory
continue to thrive.
This is not the contradiction which it appears.
Discount houses have evolved into specialist market-makers in a range of
short-term securities. They insist that their special relationship with the
Bank of England contributes nothing to profits.
The corollary is that Union's losses should be seen as no more significant
than the losses of any other market-maker in any other market. Its market
judgment erred and it paid the price.

FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Getting to grips with the community care
market - Seton Healthcare's change of direction and its rising fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SETON Healthcare grew from a playful observation made by the company's
founder while visiting an Oldham stockinette manufacturer in 1952.
Chatting to a machinist, Mr Ivor Stoller doubled a length of knotted tubular
cotton fabric along his finger - and realised he had created a tubular
bandage.
It took Mr Stoller a long time to persuade doctors and nurses of the
contribution his new product could make to bandaging techniques which had
changed little since the days of the Egyptian mummies. In 1960 the company
started making Tubigrip, which now dominates the UK market for elasticated
tubular support bandages.
Direct marketing to health professionals has continued to be important to
Seton, which is now run by Mr Norman Stoller, the founder's son. It came to
the market in July 1990 through a Pounds 23m placing at 130p a share, and
has since seen its market value nearly triple - making it one of the stock
market's best performing shares.
Annual sales of the company have grown from Pounds 700,000 at the start of
the seventies reaching more than Pounds 30m last year. Pre-tax profits for
the period came out at Pounds 3m.
In recent years it has shifted the balance of the group away from hospitals,
where competitive contracting keeps the lid on profit margins, towards
supplying prescription products to retail chemists and the community care
market.
The trend towards more care being carried out in the community is fuelled
both by the shorter length of hospital stays, and the increasing number of
old people with chronic illnesses who need to be treated at home.
Seton claims that while people under 65 need an average of four
prescriptions per year, the over-65s need 12 and those aged over 75 average
24 prescriptions each.
The group has made a particular effort to target district nurses and health
visitors. They tend to be easier to reach than GPs, who are often besieged
by representatives from the big drugs compan-ies.
Under the Nurse Prescribing Bill, currently going through parliament, up to
28,000 qualified district nurses and health visitors will be be allowed to
prescribe for the first time, once they have undergone additional training.
Seton established a direct sales force in the eighties and now has 26 former
nurses on its books, who spend about 80 per cent of their time selling in
the community. As trained nurses, they can demonstrate products and advise
on their application for particular medical problems.
One of the group's newest products is Setopress, a high-compression bandage
used for the treatment of venous ulcers, a common condition among elderly
people. Nurses know they have applied it using the most effective pressure
when the pattern woven into the bandage is stretched to form a perfect
square.
Seton recognises that the higher margins available in the community care
side of the health business will attract competition, but is confident that
the group's sales force of trained nurses gives it a considerable advantage.
Mr Dieno George, managing director, said: 'If our competitors send in the
salesmen with shiny shoes, they are going to struggle. Nurses want help and
advice, not a hard sell.'
Seton also stressed the importance of having a direct sales force last month
when it announced the sale of its US subsidiary, SePro Healthcare, and new
distribution arrangements in the US.
Although the financial performance of its US subsidiary had improved
substantially over the last three years, Seton said SePro had no sales force
outside the hospital market, and the cost of building one up to take
advantage of the same trend towards community care in the US was beyond the
resources of the UK group.
Seton has sold most of its healthcare business in the US to Acme United
Corporation, a long-established company which has been distributing Seton's
Lyofoam range of wound dressings since 1985. Acme has a considerable sales
force in both the hospital and community sectors, and will now distribute
several other Seton products.
Seton is confident that these new arrangements will be to develop the sales
and profits of the UK group's products more quickly in North America.
The acquisition of quality brands has also been another key factor in
Seton's rapid growth. In 1990 it bought two muscular pain relief creams,
Transvasin and Lloyd's Cream, for Pounds 1.35m from Reckitt &amp; Colman, the
food and household products group.
Last year the group paid an initial Pounds 1.5m for the Steripod trade mark,
which covers a new range of the latest 'blow-fill-seal' technology. This
enables sterile pharmaceutical solutions to be delivered by plastic vials,
containers which are ideally suited to the requirements of community nurses.
Although the scale of the market caused Seton to retreat from direct selling
in the US, Seton is determined that in Europe it will continue to pursue its
strategy of 'following the patient' from hospital back into the community.
The group has established a joint venture with its distributor in the
Netherlands to share the costs of setting up a sales team which will sell
Seton products directly to the community care market.
Success in the Netherlands would provide a platform for considerable
expansion by Seton across Europe.

managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A bid to cut borrowings, Lep Group, the security and freight forwarding
concern, has sold a specialist delivery services subsidiary to its managers
for Pounds 15m.
The buy-out of Swift Transport Services, a delivery company for the
automotive and engineering industries, is being supported by institutions
led by Prudential Venture Managers. The consideration is made up of Pounds
8m cash and the repayment of Pounds 7m of inter-company debt.
Swift's external borrowings of about Pounds 4m are also being taken over.
The sale will reduce Lep's net indebtedness by Pounds 22m to about Pounds
450m.
Shares in Lep, which have collapsed from about 80p in September following a
profits warning and debt refinancing worries, fell by 1p to 10 1/2 p
yesterday. Shares in ADT, the security and car auction group which bought a
27 per cent stake in Lep at an average 175p, dropped 3p to 405p.
Lep is still considering the disposal of National Guardian Corporation, its
US securities business, and remains in discussions with its bankers about
refinancing plans. The company is due to announce full-year results for 1991
in April and has already warned of 'very substantial' write-offs and
provisions.
Swift reported profits before tax of Pounds 2.99m in 1990 with net assets of
Pounds 12.9m. Trading since then been has affected by the recession, Lep
said.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Ill health hits image of US drug groups: Safety of medical
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE corporate world is at its most vulnerable when product safety is called
into question - and nowhere is there greater sensitivity at present than in
the area of health care.
In recent weeks there has been a string of criticisms of four US drug and
medical product companies - Dow Corning, Upjohn, American Cyanamid and
Pfizer. These have buffeted the industry, raised questions about the
performance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and worried consumers.
The issues involved go beyond the safety of a few products. They concern the
basic question of how far the public is willing to trust drug companies and
regulators to look after their interests. The debate has become all the more
heated because of the way the the companies have chosen to meet their
critics head on, with forceful rebuttals.
The most public - and controversial - issue concerns the charge that Dow
Corning, a 50-50 venture owned by Dow Chemical and Corning, has misled US
authorities about the safety of silicon-gel breast implants.
The company has denied any wrongdoing, but its parents have replaced the
venture's top management. Starting today, an advisory panel to the FDA will
conduct a review of whether implants - taken off the market last month - are
safe or not.
A second controversy concerns Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed
sleeping pill made by Upjohn. The manufacturer's critics, including Dr Ian
Oswald, a retired professor of psychiatry at Edinburgh university, say
Upjohn did not disclose not all the side-effects of Halcion to the FDA. The
agency itself is accused of being less decisive than British health
authorities, who banned the drug last October.
Claims that Halcion's side-effects may cause dangerous behaviour have been
roundly denied by Dr Theodore Cooper, the combative Upjohn chairman. The
company is suing Dr Oswald for libel. Upjohn has also served writs against
the BBC - which broadcast a programme called 'The Halcion Nightmare'. Dr
Cooper said claims Upjohn had concealed data were false and reckless, and
that its critics were guilty of 'junk science.'
A third recent example is that of Pfizer, the drugs company, which says some
400 patients have either died or suffered from the internal fracturing of an
artificial heart valve it stopped selling in 1986. The company does not
accept that the valve is defective, but it has agreed to commit up to
Dollars 505m (Pounds 279m) to cover claims by recipients of the product who
become ill or die.
American Cyanamid, another US drug company, has meanwhile become the subject
of a government investigation amid claims that it falsified research data
relating to a medicine contained in animal feeds.
Among these controversies, it is the breast implant issue that has moved
most prominently from the health to the political arena. 'Any time you mix
sex, women, big business and the government, you get a political issue,'
said Mr Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the
University of Minnesota. 'If these were hip replacements, you wouldn't have
the same reaction.'
Dow Corning is the world's biggest maker of breast implants, with a
commanding share of a world market that already numbers 2m women recipients.
The company has been damaged by both the government moratorium on implants
imposed last month and by its inability to block the release of confidential
documents that suggested doubts inside the company over the product dating
back some 20 years.
One effect of these controversies is the potential threat to the US public's
confidence in health-care products. There has been no greater problem of
corporate image since the barrage of criticism over Exxon's handling of the
Alaskan oil spill three years ago.
Each of the safety issues has been simmering for many months. They attracted
public attention only after lawsuits have been filed by patients claiming
they had been injured.
In the case of Halcion, pressure on the the FDA to investigate mounted after
an out-of-court settlement last summer, in which Upjohn, while not admitting
any guilt, agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to a woman who had filed a
lawsuit alleging that she murdered her mother in a fit of madness induced by
her reliance on the sleeping pill.
The problem with breast implants, which have been on the market for decades,
first came to a head in 1988 as a result of complaints from several women.
Last December Dow Corning was ordered to pay Dollars 7.3m compensation and
punitive damages to a San Francisco woman who had brought a lawsuit linking
her ruptured implants to illness.
The company appealed against the decision, but more publicity followed
Congressional hearings called by Mr Ted Weiss, a New York Democrat.
While the FDA has some of the most stringent pre-market testing requirements
in the world, the agency has less power once drug and devices are on the
market. There is no mechanism for monitoring problems once the products have
received the FDA's formal blessing. There have been congressional proposals
to give the FDA subpoena powers so it would have access to company records.
'This is a sterling example of why the FDA needs teeth,' says Mr Caplan of
the University of Minnesota. 'As things stand, they have to wait for
anecdotal evidence to trickle in.'
Among the proposals put forward is one by Mr George Annas, professor of
health law at Boston University's school of medicine, that would require
doctors and drug companies to report problems to the FDA.
The impact of these matters, apart from adverse publicity and consumer
worries, may also be financial. While Pfizer has agreed to set aside up to
Dollars 505m, its share price was only affected temporarily. As far as Wall
Street is concerned, the problem has been addressed by provisions.
At Upjohn, the Halcion issue is one of several factors that depressed the
company's shares. Halcion, with Dollars 260m of annual sales, is Upjohn's
second biggest drug product.
Dow Corning is not a publicly quoted company, but Corning, owner of 50 per
cent of the venture, has seen its share price suffer from the publicity over
breast implants. Dow Chemical, the other parent, is less reliant than
Corning on revenues from the venture.
Despite the intensity of the public debate, it seems unlikely that there
will be wide-ranging changes in the US regulatory process in the near
future. The safety issues raised in each of these cases, however, will
continue to preoccupy critics of the pharmaceutical industry.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Fina plans Dollars 1bn joint venture with Saudi group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINA, the US subsidiary of Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, is
negotiating the formation of a joint venture with the private Saudi Arabian
company, Arabian Petroleum. The deal could be worth more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 500m).
The venture would enable Petrofina, Belgium's largest industrial group, to
sell part of a unit which has shown disappointing profits in recent years,
and secure a long-term supply contract for crude oil from Saudi Aramco,
Saudi Arabia's national oil company.
However, Fina said yesterday it had been in negotiations with APC for more
than two years.
The group said Delta International, a Saudi-registered company, would own
Fina's downstream assets under the venture, but Fina would be the operator.
Fina, based in Dallas, owns two refineries in Texas - at Port Arthur and Big
Spring - with capacity of 210,000 barrels a day. It also owns around 3,000
service stations in the US, as well as pipelines, storage facilities and
marketing operations.
Last year, Fina profits tumbled to Dollars 42m from the Dollars 125m
recorded in 1990. Its turnover slipped 16 per cent to Dollars 3.3bn. For
1991 the full Petrofina group had sales of Dollars 16.6bn.
The Middle East Economic Survey, an oil industry newsletter, said APC was
poised to spend more than Dollars 500m for its unquantified share in the
joint venture.
The newsletter said the term contract with Saudi Aramco would give Fina a
secure supply of 75,000 barrels a day of crude.
Fina produces only a 10th of the oil it puts through its refineries,
shopping around for the rest from around six sources.
Petrofina shares rose BFr175 to BFr10,500 yesterday.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Letter: Lloyd's Name says majority accept losses without
directing blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From G N M MELLERSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anyone following the continuing furore at Lloyd's could be forgiven for
thinking that the chances of an external Name being fairly treated by his
agent are so small as to be non-existent. While there are indeed Names who
have suffered appalling treatment, it is just not true that this is now
custom and practice.
Like most Names, I am facing heavy losses for the 1989 year of account and
to a lesser extent for 1990, but this does not mean I have a quarrel with my
agent. Quite the opposite, in fact, as in my first year of business, 1988, I
made a modest profit when the market as a whole suffered substantial losses.
Many of my current losses are due to participation in what has turned out to
be a disastrous Gooda Walker syndicate, but I have little cause to complain
as this syndicate made a respectable profit the previous year. Further, my
agent, himself a member of the syndicate, ensured that my exposure was
modest because of the high risks involved.
I took a long time to decide to join Lloyds, as I thought it essential to
find an agent in whom I had confidence. I also made sure I was in a position
to fund at least a couple of years' losses up to the stop loss excess point,
just in case the worst happened, which of course it has.
I can understand that Names facing bankruptcy feel they have nothing to lose
by suing everyone in sight, but the great majority of external Names accept
that, as in any business, losses can be made without it being someone else's
fault. It is time for those of us with confidence in the future of Lloyd's,
and who intend to trade through these difficult times, to stand up and be
counted.

FT  18 FEB 92 / A deal that fails to heal divisions: The delicate agreement
reached by Opec members in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international oil market was expecting a clear signal from the world's
largest oil exporters gathered in Geneva last week that they were prepared
to take significant action to bolster prices. It was disappointed by the
fragile compromise stitched together by the 13 ministers from the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) that barely hides deep
divisions within their ranks.
As a result, North Sea prices began to slide early yesterday and closed
almost Dollars 1 down at Dollars 17.50 per barrel for North Sea Brent crude
for April delivery. This follows a Dollars 4 fall in prices since November,
from around Dollars 22. When US trading opens today, after the President's
Day national holiday, the price decline is likely to continue.
The fall in prices will reinforce the feeling among many oil ministers that
they came away from Geneva with a patchy and barely effective deal. 'This
agreement will only keep the present situation - maybe prices will go down
for a few days and up for a few days, but in general it will just keep them
where they are now,' said Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister.
The market's judgment was harsh: 'My gut reaction is simple. It's an
absolutely dreadful deal,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, manager of Smith Barney's
petroleum desk in London.
Traders were disappointed on two counts: first, the size of the production
cut agreed - which will reduce output of Opec countries by about 1m barrels
per day to about 23m barrels per day - was smaller than the market had
expected. Second, the lack of unity among producers over the size of the
output cuts could make it harder for them to agree decisive action in
future.
The discord between Opec's largest producers which had obstructed agreement
during the four days of intense negotiations, was reflected when both Saudi
Arabia and Iran expressed official reservations to the final deal. This
undermines the credibility of the agreement, and signals that a fragile
alliance between the two, which has steered Opec policy since the Gulf war,
is under severe strain.
While satisfied with the overall ceiling agreed in Geneva Mr Hisham Nazer,
the Saudi oil minister, was unhappy with the production level assigned to
the kingdom and said he would produce more than the 7.88m b/d it had been
allotted. Mr Aqazadeh was disappointed that the organisation had not agreed
deeper cuts. He sought a production ceiling of 22.5m b/d in order to boost
prices.
The dissent within Opec is putting the delicate relationship between Saudi
Arabia and Iran under increasing pressure. Mr Aqazadeh is sounding more
strident in his demand for increased prices and feels that Saudi Arabia is
reneging on an understanding to push prices higher in the aftermath of the
Gulf war.
'Iran could feel it has been misled by the Saudis since the Gulf war and
that Mr Nazer is not really serious about wanting higher prices,' said Mr
Mehdi Varzi, an oil industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson. Mr Varzi stresses
that the Iranian economy is facing severe difficulties as a result of
current prices.
Political considerations also lie behind Iran's stance. Mr Aqazadeh has one
eye on upcoming elections to the Iranian parliament, when moderate forces
are hoping to gain a majority. The price of oil, crucial to the success of
economic reform, will play an important part in maintaining support for the
moderates.
Saudi Arabia has traditionally favoured moderate oil prices which it
believes are necessary for a recovery in the world economy. It is also
sympathetic to the needs of the US, an important ally, which would suffer
further economic difficulties from a higher oil price.
'The strategy is not to allow the price to fall further, but also not to let
it rise and that must have the hand of the US hidden in it, whatever they
say,' said Mr Varzi.
It was a telephone call from King Fahd, the Saudi ruler that ruined Mr
Nazer's compromise plan late on Friday. Under this plan Saudi Arabia would
have cut to 7.9m b/d as part of an overall ceiling of 22.5m b/d to 22.7m
b/d. Mr Nazer was instructed to stick strictly to 8m b/d which is what the
kingdom says it will now produce even though its allocation under the
agreement is for a level of 7.88m b/d.
'Maybe a rational man will ask - what's the difference between 100,000
barrels a day?' said one Opec official, 'but you've got to recognise the
political sensitivities at work.'
Saudi Arabia spent Dollars 5bn during the Gulf war to boost its production
from 5.4m b/d to close to 9m b/d in January, at the same time increasing its
market share for Opec oil to 35 per cent. The kingdom is unwilling to
relinquish its hard-won market share. It also faces a budget deficit of some
Dollars 8bn this year which restricts its ability to manoeuvre.
The kingdom's insistence on maintaining its large chunk of overall output
will inevitably bring it into conflict with other smaller producers. All
Opec member nations are suffering the effects of low oil prices, most have
budget deficits and most have based their economic plans for this year on a
price closer to Dollars 20 a barrel than the current level of Dollars 17
(for the Opec basket which is usually about Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 below the
North Sea price).
Some members such as Algeria, which is under emergency rule, and Venezuela,
which recently suffered an attempted coup, are pressed by political unrest
at home which has partly been caused by lower oil revenues. Mr Celestino
Armas, Venezuela's oil minister, called for a ceiling as low as 21m b/d at
the opening of the Opec talks reflecting his desire for a sharp price rise.
In spite of paying lip service to smaller producers' concerns, Saudi Arabia
has reasserted its dominance over the discordant producer's club. Its
assertive role is increasingly mapping out a future for Opec.
One significant achievement at the meeting, long sought after by the Saudis,
was a move away from historical production quotas to allocate output more
closely in line with individual countries' capacity.
'It was a major event because you've seen a change in the basis for
allocating production,' said Mr Paul Mlotok at Morgan Stanley in New York.
'They clearly haven't worked out all the details yet, but it's a very
important step.'
It presents, however, an opportunity for new disagreements. The danger of
using production capacity as a basis for allocating output levels is that
countries have a tendency to be over-optimistic in their assessments of
their ability to pump oil. In addition, the new system will enshrine Saudi
Arabia's increased clout within the organisation.
Iran and several other producers are already fighting to reverse the move
and return to historical quotas which were in place before the Gulf war. Mr
Aqazadeh has called for a return to the quotas as soon as Iraq is able to
re-enter the export market.
Iraq is currently barred from exporting oil by UN sanctions and its
production allocation under the deal is for domestic consumption only. But
the Iraqi minister told Opec last week that it is now capable of producing
2m b/d.
Similarly, Kuwait has said its output will reach 900,000 b/d in June rising
to 1.5m b/d by the end of the year. If the return of the two countries to
full production is not to plunge the oil market into crisis, other members
will have to agree significant cuts. This will lead to tough talking between
the disparate producers' coalition when the UN lifts sanctions.
When ministers meet again at the end of April to review the effect of last
week's decision, the call from smaller producers for deeper cuts will be
louder if, as seems likely, the price is no higher. Their calls will be
fuelled by the fact that some smaller producers found their new output
levels were below those included in the old quota system.
But despite the disagreements in Geneva, the spirit of co-operation in Opec
is not dead. The more generous producers: the United Arab Emirates,
Venezuela, Libya and Qatar, all agreed to cut production by more than the
average 9 per cent required under the deal to compensate the disadvantaged,
smaller producers.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Letter: Quality and the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P D MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was struck by the tone of Bryan Cassidy's letter (January 30) which
implied that cleaning up Britain's environment would make us uncompetitive
compared with countries such as Japan and the US.
A similar argument relating to product quality used to be popular in the
1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when it was claimed that quality costs money and
that it was better to allow a proportion of defective output through because
it was too expensive to engineer systems which produced defect-free output.
In reality, it was shown that 'quality' production was cheaper and that
customers rapidly understood where to purchase reliable goods.
The environment argument is very similar; low pollution processes normally
mean low waste, energy efficiency means lower waste and less initial fuel
consumption. It is often found, therefore, that low pollution equates to low
cost. Add to this the rapidly growing customer discrimination in favour of
environmentally friendly goods and it is easy to see which countries will
prosper and which will fail.
The Japanese taught us a hard lesson on quality; let us show we have
understood and applied it to the environment.

Prowse ('Save Planet Earth from economists', February 10) to castigate the
entire profession of economists.
But the sins of one economist should not be visited on all. Admittedly, the
memo, if taken seriously, is sloppy and flawed in its arguments. To judge
the air quality in Africa as 'inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or
Mexico City' because transport costs and non-tradeability of air prevent
trade in air pollution and waste is simply wrong.
'Efficiency' can only be determined taking these 'technological' constraints
such as non-tradeability into account. Also, efficiency must reflect
objectives. It could well be that former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere
and the pastoral Masai have a greater preference for clean air (relative to
income) than Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his BMW-driving
citizens.
But the assertion that a 'given amount of health-impairing pollution should
be done in the country with the lowest cost (measured as the foregone
earnings from increased morbidity and mortality), which will be the country
with the lowest wages', and that therefore 'the economic logic behind
dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable', is
a fallacy.
The discharge of an equal quantity of chemical pollutants into an Indian
lake where lower-wage people drink the water may be more harmful than if the
target of the pollution was Lake Michigan, in the higher-wage US.
Malnourished people may die far more readily from an equal dose of pollution
than well-fed people.
But, most of all, no modern economist, when his house is on fire, will pull
his father out before his mother because the father earns more than the
mother] Economists have learned, at least since the 1960s, to broaden their
analysis to include objectives (including the environment) other than just
goods and services.
Economics, properly understood and used, has much to offer in helping the
environmentalists achieve their objectives efficiently and at least cost.
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade report on trade and the
environment, issued last week, demonstrates this by taking seriously the
environmentalists' concerns over trade rules, by analysing the relative
advantages of different ways of achieving environmental objectives, and by
arguing that unilateral suspensions of other nations' trading rights are the
most expensive way to do so.
Dialogue of this kind, based on first-rate economics, should help us find
reasonable solutions to our environmental concerns. Economists and
environmentalists should join hands to create a shared success.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Letter: Minister denies UK put brake on single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN REDWOOD MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on February 10 ('UK plans to put brake on single market')
suggests that the UK is now the reason why there is no Investment Services
Directive. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The UK has always welcomed and encouraged proposals that promote more
cross-border trade and open up Community markets to companies and
individuals from other member states. We have consistently supported a
market opening Investment Services Directive.
Unfortunately, some other member states see the Investment Services
Directive as an opportunity to put back the clock and to limit the amount of
cross-border trade currently under way in the Community. This is against the
spirit of the Treaty of Rome, against the spirit of the single market and
would be undesirable to all those who are interested in promoting more
intra-European business.
The UK is not prepared to promote a protectionist proposal, but has
supported efforts to reach a compromise to try to obtain an Investment
Services Directive that would be market opening. That remains the British
government's position.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Labour and the unions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1970s, the leaders of the UK's largest unions were household names.
Jack Jones, Hugh Scanlon and Clive Jenkins were powers in the land,
commanding large and disciplined memberships. Mr Len Murray's Trades Union
Congress enjoyed direct access to the corridors of power.
Now, 13 years after the winter of discontent, few members of today's TUC
General Council would be recognised on a Clapham omnibus. Britain's unions
have lost a third of their members, much of their influence and almost all
of the power they once wielded. Under the low-key leadership of Mr Norman
Willis, the TUC has all but disappeared from sight. It seems perverse,
therefore, that ministers should be frightening impressionable minds with
threats of a return of unbridled union power if Labour wins the election.
Yet the questions raised by yesterday's Conservative attack on the links
between Labour and the unions need to be answered. The Labour party is one
of the few national institutions in which the trade unions remain
influential. They supply more than 60 per cent of Labour's income - and a
higher proportion of the party's election war-chest. Their block votes
dominate the Labour party conference.
Judging by the results of Labour's Policy Review, the unions' organisational
strength gives them considerable influence in making party policy. The
degree of this influence can be seen in the priority Labour gives to
policies favoured by the large general unions such as the minimum wage and
the removal of compulsory competitive tendering. The unions have secured
promises to ease the weight of legislation oppressing them.
Winter of discontent
Their influence is also revealed in some important gaps in party policy  -
such as the lack of a public sector pay policy, an issue at the root of the
winter of discontent which blew Labour out of power in 1979.
However, the Conservative charge that Labour would give the unions 'legal
privileges which have never before been granted' is clearly hyperbole. While
Labour's proposals on trade union law are open to criticism (for example,
for removing from the courts' armoury the ultimate deterrent of total
sequestration of union assets), the package advocated by Mr Tony Blair,
Labour's employment spokesman, would not significantly shift the balance of
industrial power. It is also much less than some union leaders had hoped
for.
Watering down
In fact, the watering down of the unions' wish list for repeal of trade
union legislation is one indicator of the degree of influence that unions
might expect under a Labour government. That is well appreciated by the
unions themselves: after 13 years of battering by six rounds of employment
legislation, they would be grateful just for a breathing space.
Labour also has a new confidence in its dealing with the unions. Mr Blair
demonstrated this on becoming employment spokesman by unilaterally reversing
the party's policy on the closed shop, effectively challenging the unions to
use their block votes at conference to overturn him (they didn't). The
unions know that they need a Labour government more than Labour needs them:
Mr Kinnock knows that too.
Also, the party is seeking to demonstrate a more arms-length relationship by
beginning to curb the influence that unions wield in its deliberations. The
reduction of the block vote now enjoys widespread support throughout the
party and unions, and is to be welcomed. In the longer term, an alternative
basis for funding political parties would be the best inducement for Labour
to break free of its union paymasters.
However, there remains a valid suspicion that a Labour government would be
susceptible to undue union influence, especially if measures unpopular with
the unions were necessary, as is likely. The unions will always have a
special relationship with a Labour government - Labour will need to work
hard to ensure that the distance looks sufficient. Meanwhile, voters will
want to read the lips of selected union barons, as well as those of the
would-be ministers.

FT  18 FEB 92 / The perils of tunnel vision: The EC is acting against its
interests over Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is depressingly familiar. A coalition of powers wins a great victory,
only to let the coalition fragment. It happened after both world wars. It is
happening once more. But no fundamental conflict of interest need prevent
the west from sustaining co-operation, and of nowhere is this more true than
trade. Even so, the Uruguay Round looks increasingly likely to expire. If it
is to be revived, the European Community must cease defending the
indefensible.
When US Vice-President Dan Quayle said that global security would be
endangered by a collapse of the Gatt round, he was right. When he forecast
that failure to agree would increase American pressure to withdraw its
military forces from Europe, he was also right. These were not threats, but
good predictions.
For the EC to insist, like some vainglorious barnyard cock, that it is too
important to yield to American pressure is absurd. For Mr Frans Andriessen,
the EC's external affairs commissioner, to say that the EC could not accept
a deal which did not seem 'suitable and profitable to the Community's
long-term economic interest' is still worse, since the EC is rejecting a
deal that would, in fact, be in its long-term interests.
Agriculture remains pivotal to a successful outcome in the Uruguay Round.
Two central issues remain: whether the EC should accept quantitative limits
on its volume of subsidised exports, which the EC adamantly rejects; and
whether the compensation payments in Mr Ray MacSharry's reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy should be put in the Gatt's 'green box' for
non-distorting subsidies, on which the EC insists.
Mr Andriessen would have the world believe that these two positions reflect
the EC's 'long-term economic interest'. But why is it in the long-term
economic interest of the EC to export farm products at lower prices than on
sales to its own consumers, making up the difference from the pockets of its
taxpayers? And why is it in the interest of the EC to pay farmers
substantial 'compensation payments' indefinitely, merely on condition that
they remain farmers?
Mr Andriessen's definition of economic interest bears no relation to
reality. This is not new. What has always characterised the CAP is its
distance from reality. High prices, the heart and soul of the CAP, could
never do more than raise land prices and increase wasteful production. They
were completely inapposite to their main purpose, raising farmers' incomes,
a point made in the excellent paper by the German agricultural economist,
Professor Stefan Tangermann, for the London-based Institute of Economic
Affairs, discussed by Samuel Brittan yesterday.
Mr MacSharry's reform proposals are an improvement, but they do not go far
enough. As Prof Tangermann points out, simpler reforms would avoid the
problems inherent in these proposals. The ideal would be lower prices, no
set-asides and direct income compensation, limited to those farming in a
period in the recent past, and granted for a defined number of years. But,
true to the first law of EC agricultural policy - that nothing simple will
be tried if something more complex can be substituted - Mr MacSharry has
added set-asides and the requirement for continued production, both of which
will require not merely complex, but permanent, monitoring.
Prof Tangermann's suggested changes to the Commission's proposals should be
made - Mr Andriessen, please note - 'for domestic reasons . . . because they
would greatly enhance the economic viability of CAP reform'. But they would
also clear the way for agreement in the Gatt. His ideas for direct income
compensation would fall inside the 'green box'. Furthermore, with support
being lowered worldwide, farm prices would rise, reducing the need for what
the EC euphemistically calls 'export restitutions'.
Unfortunately, EC leaders have long resisted external efforts to limit the
damage its farm policies have caused. They have failed to educate its public
in their wastefulness. They took almost four years to come up with an
inadequate negotiating position in the Uruguay Round. And now they are
insisting that the rest of the world must accept half-baked reforms.
Worst of all, the EC believes that this is the cause for which it should
risk both its relations with the US and the prospects for sustaining the
liberal international economy, on which the entire globe depends.
In its half-century of pre-eminent influence, the US has made many mistakes,
but it has also articulated a global vision. Even in the current Gatt round
US policymakers have mostly sought both liberalisation and extension of the
reach of trade rules.
Against this, what is the EC's vision? Is it to make the world safe for the
withered fruit of its farm politics? Many hail the EC's arrival as a great
power. On the evidence, the question must be why.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Up against the limits: The causes of economic deadlock in
Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland, erstwhile standard-bearer for radical economic reform in eastern
Europe, has run into a political quagmire. Hampered by Poland's disastrous
political divisions, all too clearly revealed in the fragmented Polish
parliament, Poland's new finance minister, Mr Karol Lutkowski, yesterday
proffered his resignation.
The resignation followed weeks of increasingly acute debate over economic
policy within the centre-right coalition government led by Mr Jan Olszewski.
That debate came to a head at the weekend after the government presented
parliament with an economic plan that Mr Lutkowski argued risked reigniting
hyper-inflation and undoing the economic and financial progress made in the
past two difficult years.
What is now clear is that the radical reforms of the first two
post-communist governments went beyond the willingness of the populace to
support them. Those governments were dominated by passionate believers in
free-market policies who argued that state enterprises which failed to react
positively to market stimuli should be allowed to fail.
The present government lacks that conviction. It is cobbled together from a
collection of Christian democrat and peasant parties, supported in the new
parliament by a shifting alliance from among the 29 parties which won seats
at last October's first free general elections.
Those elections were fought under a system of proportional representation
which has magnified Poland's political diversity, but compounded the
difficulty of building broad political support for the hard sacrifices
needed to transform Poland's economy on market principles.
This became apparent during last year's election campaign when the tough
economic stabilisation policies backed by the International Monetary Fund
and pursued by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister in the first two
post-communist governments, were attacked in increasingly populist terms by
the parties which now form or support the new government.
Mr Olszewski illustrated the general tenor of the government's economic
thinking when introducing his government's programme just before Christmas.
'If we want to maintain a democratic system we must convince the public that
the reforms are spread justly,' he said. Subsequently he promised that
future economic policy would no longer 'be built on the rubble of state
enterprises', and promised that what he called 'the good climate for
swindlers, crooks and thieves is coming to an irrevocable end'.
The main architect of the government's new economic strategy is Mr Jerzy
Eysymontt, a former central planner who emerged as the strongest internal
critic of the stabilisation programme carried out by Mr Balcerowicz.
Mr Eysymontt argues that previous governments did not pay enough attention
to the social and economic consequences of their market-oriented policies.
These curbed hyper-inflation, and stabilised the Polish currency, the zloty.
But they cut subsidies and opened up large swathes of Polish industry to
fierce competition from imported goods made cheaper by the rise in the
zloty's value against the dollar and other currencies.
Faced with rising unemployment and a rapid build-up of bad debt by Polish
enterprises, Mr Eysymontt argues that more attention must be paid to
supply-side measures to boost investment and exports without rekindling
inflation.
In order to square this difficult circle, Mr Eysymontt advocates a form of
incomes policy. Workers would be offered greater employment, but would have
to pay for it by accepting tougher wage controls and higher sales taxes,
which would translate into a 5 per cent decline in real incomes this year
after a 2 per cent rise in 1991.
It is far from clear that such an incomes policy would work under Polish
conditions, where most state-owned enterprises are controlled by strong
workers' councils hand in glove with communist-era managers. The reaction of
both to market-oriented policies has often been to cut output and raise
prices rather than to cut costs and increase efficiency. It is equally
unclear whether the aim of preserving employment in the old state dinosaurs
even makes sense.
Nevertheless, the new government's message accurately reflects the
ambivalence with which many Poles view the past two years of extraordinarily
rapid economic and social change. On the positive side, the Balcerowicz
reforms curbed hyper-inflation, restored value to the zloty and sparked off
a retail and trading revolution which has filled once empty shops.
With extraordinary speed a brash and entrepreneurial Poland has intruded
into the old egalitarian but fundamentally immobile system. Poles who for
years traded illegally throughout the former Soviet bloc jumped at the
chance to lease or buy former state-controlled shops and retail outlets.
However, while the flood of imported consumer goods and a rapid
redistribution of incomes has left some Poles better off than ever before,
millions more are feeling disoriented and defenceless.
The most aggrieved sectors of society include those employed by, or laid off
from, state sector enterprises. In the past industrial workers in the large
and medium-sized state enterprises were the most tenacious working-class
supporters of the old Solidarity alliance of workers, intellectuals and the
church. They expected better things from their heroic struggle against
communism.
Instead, workers in state enterprises have seen their pay held below the 70
per cent annual inflation rate by the hated 'popiwek' wages tax, which only
applies to state enterprises. Many have lost their jobs, as unemployment has
risen from virtually zero to 2.14m over the past two years. Unemployment is
expected to exceed 3m by the end of 1992.
Last year's 11.9 per cent fall in industrial output from the state sector
means that, overall, production in the state industrial sector is 35 per
cent below 1989 levels. Nearly 40 per cent of the 8,500 enterprises still
owned by the state or by local authorities are loss-making. Many, including
most of the 200 enterprises which formerly depended almost exclusively on
trade with the now defunct Comecon market, are bankrupt and only keep alive
by not paying bills or taxes.
Yet another consequence of liberalisation has been a rash of big financial
and banking scandals. These have underlined fundamental weaknesses in the
legal and regulatory structure of the banks and other institutions inherited
from the former communist state. The collapse of state industry and the
largely unknown potential of the new entrepreneurs have meant that some 40
per cent of bank loans are non-performing. Understaffed and inexperienced,
the banking system is a priority target for western technical assistance and
privatisation.
Meanwhile, the government, which used to obtain 85 per cent of its tax
revenue from state enterprises under the primitive communist tax system, is
owed Zl 23,000bn in uncollectable company taxes, which swells the budget
deficit. This is likely to prove inflationary in Polish circumstances, given
the government's inability to sell long-term debt.
Ironically a high proportion of the taxes owed come from non-payment of the
'popiwek'. The fact that a tax levied on former communist managements for
giving in to wage demands made by powerful workers councils is in practice
frequently not collected merely underlines the fragility of the economic
management tools in government hands.
It also underlines the importance of moving as fast as possible away from an
economy so heavily rooted in the inherited state-controlled industries. This
government, like its predecessors, has pledged to speed up the pace of
privatisation. It plans to introduce a complex system of mass privatisation
by early summer under which more than 200 enterprises will be handed over to
special investment funds run by foreign banks and institutions.
By the end of this year more than 50 per cent of the economy, including the
farming sector which remained largely in private hands throughout the
communist era, should be in private hands. Mr Eysymontt's main innovation is
to insist that the 50 per cent which remains in state hands must be taken
better care of until it can be restructured or hived off.
Since pioneering the dash for market reform in eastern Europe, Poland has
felt the constraints more keenly that any of the new democracies. There is
no desire to turn back, but the new government is testing the limits on its
freedom of action. The outcome will be closely watched by all the
post-communist states.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Arts: Stockhausen and Parker - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markus Stockhausen, the eldest of the composer Karlheinz's assorted
offspring, is a highly expert and musical trumpeter, and several of his
father's works contain prominent parts designed for him. But he has also
taken up jazz-based improvisation, which is something out of the senior
Stockhausen's range; and on Saturday he chose to share a concert with Evan
Parker, a renowned improviser on the saxophone.
On the original plan, Parker was to improvise alone throughout the first
half, and Markus (plus electronics) to fill the second half with extracts
from Karlheinz's music and improvisations thereon. In the event they decided
to play turnabout all evening: better programme-planning, no doubt, but
bemusing in the absence of a corrected programme-leaflet. Except for the
opening and the 'Farewell' from Donnerstag, one of the composer's projected
seven-day cycle of operas, which duly began the concert and ended it, we
rarely knew exactly where we were.
Certainly the famous Gesang der Junglinge, widely held to be a (perhaps the)
masterpiece of electronic music, came late instead of early, as printed. The
audience was reduced to guessing which other items were which, and which
ones might be pure Markus improvisations. Perhaps it didn't matter. For all
his jazz leanings, Markus has been steeped in the hieratic manner of his
mystagogical parent, and he delivered every note and phrase as if there were
an aura around them, fraught with gnomic meaning. One could go along with
that: the Markus trumpet is like a clarion human voice, individual,
appealingly open and persuasively confident, and it compels a sympathetic
response.
Evan Parker's virtuoso improvisations have a quite different stamp. He
sustains near-orchestral textures on his solo sax, with continuous torrents
of patterned notes defining two or three different bands at once - and in
distinct timbres, too] It is astonishing to hear (obviously he must exploit
a 'circular breathing' technique of a very advanced order), not least
because a palpable musical impulse guides the free development of his
sumptuous material. 'Personal expression' hardly comes into it: Parker's
elaborate constructions carry their own speaking but untranslatable force.
In the spirit of old Carl Ruggles' Angels, the Donnerstag close, for
multiple soft brass, is gravely beautiful. (Since his 'Zodiac' pieces,
Stockhausen has often gone in for quasi-chorales in this restrained style.)
Young Markus added his poignant trumpet-voice to the taped ensemble, whilst
Parker took up a soprano sax - or was it a sopranino? - to warble a gentle
descant. Even the crustiest, most shell-backed ear would have been struck by
how lovely it sounded, on and on and on.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Arts: Simpson's Ninth, Osborne's 'Venice' - Royal Festival
Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Rattle gave last week two concerts (sponsored by Commodore) with the
London Philharmonic - Nielsen, Robert Simpson and Beethoven on Wednesday,
Janacek, Lutoslawski, Berg and Sibelius on Sunday. British critics are
sometimes reproached for treating this young man's work with indulgence and
even favouritism; but after two such exhilaratingly communicative evenings,
so rich in their well-balanced variety, thoughtfulness and spark of
commitment, it's a charge to which one is happy to plead guilty. Any
conductor who succeeds in breaking into a South Bank winter season locked in
grey routine with as much vigour and verve as Rattle summoned up on these
two occasions deserves to be cherished.
The first concert was particularly impressive. Robert Simpson, a composer in
his early 70s passionately admired but still insufficiently widely
celebrated, wrote his Ninth Symphony in the mid-1980s; it was first played
in Bournemouth in 1987 and recorded there a year later, but until last week
it had not reached London (by which time Simpson's Tenth Symphony was
already a year old).
There are reasons, obvious if hardly admirable ones, why an orchestra might
fight shy of the Ninth. It is long (50 minutes), taxing (three movements
given without break), and entirely lacking in fashionable ear-tickling
devices or any manner of audience seduction. By adhering to a conception -
which some call conservative and others old-fashioned - of the symphony as a
vehicle for the intelligible and logical working-out of powerful artistic
ideas, Simpson's music demands attention at every moment. But he repays it,
generously, through the integrity of his vision, the muscular forcefulness
with which he addresses it in musical argument, and the intensity and
consistency with which that argument is carried through.
The Ninth takes the form of two slow-ish (marked maestoso) movements
enclosing a molto vivace scherzo, craggy in outline and stirring in its
climax. The development of the material - puritan-plain in melodic and
harmonic character, capable of being hammered out over mighty spans - will
hardly trouble those listeners at home with the symphonies of Nielsen and
Sibelius; and, given that Simpson is a noted Beethoven and Bruckner
advocate, the influence of those composers comes as no surprise. What makes
this work so fiercely concentrated and bracing an experience is the sweep,
the plain-spoken majesty accrued as the structures build up: it may not be
exactly a lovable work, but it is a hugely compelling one.
Rattle's command of its shape, size and temper betokened the fiery
conviction of a Simpson champion; the playing, though not free of passing
inaccuracy, was properly bold, broad and rhythmically hard-hitting. The LPO
is indeed at its most vital under his baton; the Beethoven Seventh Symphony
on Wednesday and the Janacek From the House of the Dead Prelude on Sunday
were particularly enthralling for the bounteous energy of their forward
movement, whether in large strides or small steps. There was equally
colourful, full-hearted orchestral execution in Sunday's Lutoslawski Five
Songs and the Three Pieces from Berg's Wozzeck - but in both, unfortunately,
Elise Ross's sympathetic personality and musicianly intelligence proved
inadequate compensation for a notably out-of-condition soprano voice.
On Saturday the Philharmonia under Claus Peter Flor played Grieg (a stiff,
poker-faced selection from the Peer Gynt music), more Nielsen (a brilliantly
pungent, characterful and sensitive account of the Clarinet Concerto from
Michael Collins) and Ravel's second Daphnis and Chloe Suite. For the first
London performance of Nigel Osborne's The Sun of Venice the composer himself
was the conductor.
The work, commissioned by and dedicated to the orchestra's president,
Vincent Meyer, is a 25-minute evocation of Venetian light, air and
atmosphere through the eyes of Turner (seven of whose paintings and
watercolours particularly influenced Osborne) and the ears of Gabrieli
(whose polychoral and polyorchestral compositions for St Mark's inspired the
layout for one main orchestra and two smaller groups spatially disposed).
The effect of the first half, as ringing, resonating sounds are passed
across the hall and vast confrontations set up, is pictorially vivid; but
thereafter the absence of any real motivic (as opposed to harmonic or
colouristic) interest, and the consequent lack of dramatic variety, becomes
worryingly apparent.

<TEXT>
The Rossini bicentennial is only one of the occasions celebrating this year,
along with anniversaries of Columbus, Piero della Francesca and Lorenzo de
Medici; but Rossini seems to have got off to a flying start. Verona has just
staged a much-praised Guglielmo Tell with Renato Bruson and Chris Merritt,
and the Rome Opera opened its season with a televised, over-touted Barber of
Seville produced by the film comic Carlo Verdone - a delightful actor and a
successful film director (of his own vehicles) but a disappointment in the
opera house (at least to judge by what was seen on TV), prone to gimmickry
and sight gags and very short on real perception.
Bologna, one of the cities most associated with the composer, has two of his
operas in its current cartellone: Tancredi, in a production borrowed from
the Pesaro Festival, and, later this spring, a new production of Cenerentola
with Cecilia Bartoli. The Pesaro Tancredi, which Pizzi designed and staged
several years ago, is handsome, colourful, yet sober in movement and
restrained in invention. Avowedly inspired by the traditional Sicilian
puppets, whose versions of Tasso and his heroes Tancredi, Roggiero, and
company are a national treasure, the Pizzi staging avoids any hint of
cuteness or send-up. Even the wooden horses mounted by the singers and
propelled by supers seem to possess a natural gravity. The great vitrages,
one in shades of blue, one in reds, that serve as backgrounds, allowing
imaginative play of lights, gave the successive scenes the quality of
illustrations - a reminder that Tancredi is, in a special sense, a literary
opera, referring to a whole narrative tradition with which, ideally, the
spectator is familiar.
On another level, of course, the work can be enjoyed as a musical feast, a
constant outpouring of orchestral vitality and vocal virtuosity. And, in
Bologna, the singing was almost always a joy to hear, especially when
Bernadette Manca di Nissa - the Tancredi - was on stage. Mezzosopranos in
trouser-roles can sometimes be an embarrassment (one thinks of Marilyn
Horne's cocky strut and over-plumed helmets, of Simionato's elevator-heel
boots); but Manca di Nissa solved the gender problem simply by not acting
like a prima donna. She walked, gestured - sparingly - and sang with
conviction and spontaneity. Her emotions were always so patently sincere
that she inspired only total acceptance. The voice itself is beautiful,
warm, agile, but not plummy and never hooty. This singer is already familiar
to followers of the Italian musical scene; now she seems to have moved into
a new, even more exciting phase.
As Amenaide, her beloved, Mariella Devia was vocally almost faultless, but
the artist lacks personality, charm, pathos. When this production was first
seen in Pesaro, the role was sung by Katia Ricciarelli, less secure
musically perhaps, but a more credible, more vulnerable heroine. The tenor
William Matteuzzi has an appealing voice and a graceful stage presence, but
he does not really possess the necessary agility, and some of his coloratura
sounded strained. The Orbazzano, Natale De Carolis, is a promising young
basso; he did not have a great deal to do, but he did it more than
competently. And, as usual in Bologna, the smaller roles were well-handled:
Monica Bacelli was Isaura, and Barbara Briscik, Roggiero. The chorus was a
bit dim at first, but then brightened up.
The conductor, Gianluigi Gelmetti, is a Pesaro Festival regular, and a
reliable artist. His Overture was well-judged, played not as a concert
showpiece or, worse still, a star turn for band, but rather as an
introduction to the whole work. He began as he intended to go on, without
excesses. Here and there, in the course of the performance, he let the
rhythm sag. But, all in all, his was a well-controlled, intelligently
conceived reading.
Rossini's birthday comes on February 29; but the leap year celebrations will
continue long afterwards. La Scala will stage a new Donna del Lago, La
Fenice will revive two of the Venetian operas: L'italiana in Algeri and
Semiramide. A decade or so ago there would not have been enough singers
capable of interpreting Rossini to cover all these productions; but, thanks
partly to the popularity and the proselytizing work of Pesaro and the
advances in scholarship, a whole generation of Rossini interpreters has
grown up and, with them, an audience capable of appreciating them.
Scholarship, however, has two faces. Not all discoveries have the same
value. In 1974 some musicologists, including the super-Rossinian Philip
Gossett, tracked down a 'tragic' ending of Tancredi, composed by Rossini
shortly after the Venetian premiere (February 6 1813) which had the happy
ending expected at the time, culminating in a chorus of joy. Naturally, the
Pesaro Festival performed the newly-discovered pages, but - unwilling to
sacrifice anything - the original happy ending was performed as well. So,
after expiring, with a brief recitative - on stage, in a blackout, Tancredi
rose again to life, slipped back into the wings, to emerge again,
resuscitated, to share in the joyous finale.
For a scholarly, festival production, this double-ending was permissible;
but for a normal performance it is frankly a nuisance. The tragic ending
loses impact, and the joyous ending seems diminished. Scholarship is a fine
thing, but Rossini wrote for audiences, not for paleographers.

Will democracy tear Kenya apart? The possibility is advanced by President
Arap Moi who laments that, a mere 28 years after independence, democracy is
being imposed on his country by western aid donors. This, he warns in
Assignment (7.45 BBC2), may lead to tribal warfare.
Amazing, isn't it, how tolerant men are: imagine the bleating that would
ensue from the distaff side if you tried to run a series called 'Women
Behaving Badly', yet here is ITV starting a comedy called Men Behaving Badly
without a word of protest from masculinists. Not so excitable, you see,
emotionally more stable. Murder Squad (9.00 ITV) has so far supplied a
remarkably drab picture of a job which television normally portrays as
vividly dramatic. Perhaps today's case, the first of two parts, will be more
like the conventional television version. Rides is a new six-part drama
about an all-female minicab firm. We are told 'the series is about women
managing their lives'. Golly how advanced: we'll be having a female
sovereign next, or even a female prime minister (9.30 BBC1).
Viewpoint 92 considers the life of Andrei Sakharov 'father of the Soviet
H-bomb' but later greatest of the Russian dissidents.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Swiss vote yes to animal
testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss are generally known to be sensible about most things, but they
have developed a surprising tendency recently to shoot themselves in the
foot.
Thus, there was considerable anxiety in some quarters as the latest in a
long series of referendums on the difficult question of animal rights
approached.
On Sunday, the demand by animal rights activists that nearly all experiments
on animals be halted was rejected by an unexpectedly large 60 per cent
majority.
Strong popular opposition to genetic engineering experiments has already
driven the three big Basle-based chemical and pharmaceutical groups,
Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, to shift a significant portion of their
research and development activities out of the country.
However, neither side can take much comfort from Sunday's result.
For one thing, it was preceded by a brutish campaign that shed little light
on the troubling issues raised by the use of animals in scientific
experiments and in the testing of products aimed at humans.
For another, the animal rights campaigners already have another referendum
proposal in the works, so there is little doubt that the Swiss are going to
have to face the issues again.
Animal rights activists have long appealed shamelessly to people's emotions
in their campaigns, presenting heart-rending photographs of cuddly animals
in pain. In this campaign, their opponents responded in kind with posters
showing a person suffering from cancer or Aids, and punching home the
message, 'We must not let him down'.
There was almost no serious discussion of the potential for developing
further alternatives to the use of animals in R&amp;D or of improving the
delineation of limits and controls on the practice.
The animal rights campaigners would argue that their proposed amendment to
the Swiss constitution did attempt to set reasonable controls, but it was a
sly text. It said that all use of animals should be forbidden unless it
could be shown that an experiment would be of 'decisive significance for the
preservation of human or animal life or the relief of considerable
suffering.' It is, of course, in the nature of R&amp;D that the results of an
experiment cannot be known in advance.
The scientific community, led by the big pharmaceutical companies, stood on
its record and on the lack of alternatives to the use of animals for some
vital experiments. The companies claim a 50 per cent reduction in the use of
animals in experiments since the mid 1970s.
But how much credit is due to them and how much to the Swiss government
which, goaded by animal rights activists, has cracked down on perceived
excesses, is debatable.
Nevertheless, it does seem that frivolous uses, such as in cosmetic testing,
are on the way out, leaving only two hard core types of animal use. First,
most basic biochemical experiments must be carried out on fresh tissue, and
so there would seem to be no alternative to the large-scale use of mice -
other than to curtail the experiments. Second, for testing new
pharmaceutical products, there comes a point when a compound has to be
tested on a live, complex organism so that all its actions can be
discovered.
In the area where only fools and knaves could comfortably provide firm
direction, it is probably a good thing to have a mechanism for a fairly
regular public review of current practice and thinking - even if the actual
debate is less enlightening than one might hope for.
Perhaps the Swiss have not lost their touch after all.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Technology: Services grow on branches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays, the largest of the UK banks, has launched a six-month trial into a
new generation of automatic teller machines which carry out functions
previously performed by bank staff.
The NCR machines, which include full-colour touch screens, have been
installed at nine locations across the UK for customer trials which will
last until June and cost Pounds 800,000. The bank will then decide whether
to install self-service touch-screen banking in all of its branches.
Barclays believes that its trials go further than any other bank has done so
far in providing an all-round branch service through ATMs.
Customers can get the following services:
Personalised information on mortgages or insurance with on-the-spot
quotations.
Information on their standing orders and direct debits.
Travellers cheques and foreign currency.
Travel insurance.
Customers get access to the system through their cash cards, though anyone
can use the terminals to gain information about mortgages and insurance
products by answering a series of questions.
Each ATM contains a dot-matrix printer and customers are given print-outs of
information ranging from bank statements to insurance quotes. The basic cost
of each machine is Pounds 12,000, not including software and installation
costs.
The machines are designed to have as short a turn-around period for each
transaction as possible.
Andrew Bailey, manager of self-service banking, who is in charge of the
trials, says: 'We have been pleasantly surprised by the number of people who
try out the services.'
Barclays has not given details of the possible roll-out it is planning for
the ATMs after June, but the implications for many of its 2,600 branches are
far-reaching. The trial is being carried out in small towns such as Selby
and Wantage, as well as in London and the home countries.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Production increase at Honda seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRM prediction that Honda will move fairly quickly to production of
200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 300m plant now under construction at
Swindon, Wiltshire - twice the officially-declared capacity - was made
yesterday by Professor Garel Rhys, a senior motor industry economist.
The forecast was based on the size of component purchases Honda has
indicated it will make in Europe, and on the economy of scale disadvantage
the plant would otherwise face in comparison with Japanese competitors in
the UK.
Prof Rhys, of Cardiff Business School, said Honda envisages spending between
Pounds 600m and Pounds 800m a year in full production. Toyota was planning
spending of about Pounds 700m at its 200,000-cars-a-year plant due to come
on stream in Burnaston, Derbyshire, and Nissan Pounds 850m at the
300,000-car-a-year level in Sunderland. Because of this, said Prof Rhys, it
was 'virtually inconceivable' that Honda would not move to at least 200,000
units annually, perhaps by the mid-90s.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Big energy users seek nuclear cap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE ELECTRICITY consumers will today ask Mr John Wakeham, the energy
secretary, to cut their bills by capping the subsidy they pay to the nuclear
industry.
A group of large customers, including Blue Circle Cement and United
Engineering Steel, has already threatened to stop paying the subsidy, which
represents 11 per cent of their electricity bills, in April. According to
the Major Energy Users Council, some large customers may also refuse to pay
the increase in the energy charge, which represents the bulk of their
electricity bill.
The council is meeting Mr Wakeham in the first of a series of talks intended
to resolve the row over the increase in large consumers' bills since the
electricity industry was privatised in 1990.
Council representatives said yesterday that capping the subsidy was one way
of getting bills down to the level enjoyed by their European competitors.
Another option was to cut the charges levied by the National Grid Company.
The large users indicated that refusing to pay the nuclear levy was
primarily a tactic to show they believed that the government, which collects
the levy, was to blame for their high bills, rather than the electricity
generators.
One council representative said the government's decision to create only two
electricity generators in England and Wales - National Power and PowerGen -
with too much market share, had left large users unable to negotiate
competitive prices. 'We all know competition will emerge but the transition
needs to be smoothed, and that is the government's responsibility,' he said.
Several council members also accused Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
electricity regulator, of failing to refer the generators to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission because a referral would be damaging to the
government in the approach to the election.
Mr Peter Rost, council chairman, said Prof Littlechild had suggested
alternative ways of helping the large users, including capping the nuclear
levy.
But the council members said the group was disturbed that the price at which
Nuclear Electric was offering power - about 2.6p a unit - was being used by
National Power and PowerGen as a benchmark to determine the price at which
they would sell electricity to large users.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard condemns Labour's 'evil'
links - Unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday fielded no fewer than six ministers at a press
conference in an attempt to raise the profile of Labour's trades union links
in the election campaign.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, warned that a government led by
Mr Neil Kinnock would return Britain to the industrial relations chaos of
the 1970s.
Flanked by among others, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, and Mr
Chris Patten, the party chairman, Mr Howard described Labour's policies as
'made for the unions by the unions'. Referring at one point to the 'evil'
links which gave trade union leaders control of Labour's policymaking
machinery, he added that it would:
Wreck industrial relations legislation and give the unions all the rights
and privileges they wanted.
Introduce a national minimum wage, putting up industry's costs and throwing
up to 2m people out of work.
Hamstring Britain's 'training revolution' by letting the unions dominate
Training and Enterprise Councils.
Mr Howard will take up the theme in a Commons debate today in which the
government hopes to rekindle memories of the winter of discontent, which
brought down the last Labour government in 1979.
His comments were derided by Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary. He
said in a statement that the charges were 'a pathetic attempt to divert
attention from the Conservatives' mismanagement of the economy'.

BRITAIN'S financial-services sector should be one of the main beneficiaries
from the new agreement between the European Community and the European Free
Trade Association (Efta), Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, told the Commons
last night, Ivor Owen writes.
He envisaged that the agreement would lead to 'significant economic gains'
for British industry and for British consumers.
Mr Sainsbury said there would be free movement of capital, services, goods
and people in the single market.
There would be a mutual recognition of professional qualifications, covering
accountants as well as other specialists, throughout the area.
Welcoming the agreement from the Opposition front bench, Ms Joyce Quin
emphasised that the parties to the new agreement should seek to promote
world trade as a whole and seek to dispel ideas of a 'fortress Europe'.
She hoped that the agreement would be used to strengthen economically
deprived regions in Britain and other countries.
Mr Kenneth Warren (C Hastings and Rye), chairman of the cross-party trade
and industry select committee, urged the European parliament not to look for
ways of obstructing the agreement.

no evidence to support recent allegations.
Ms Mahon asked whether Mr MacGregor was satisfied the security services were
not trying to smear Opposition MPs.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT compensation for people infected with HIV, the virus that can
lead to Aids, during National Health Service blood transfusions and tissue
transfers, was announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, the health
secretary.
The package, which will cost about Pounds 12m, follows a Pounds 42m scheme
announced in November 1990 to help haemophiliacs who suffered in the same
way. There were 74 reports at the end of December of HIV infection in people
who had blood transfusions or tissue transfers. The maximum payment will be
Pounds 80,500.
The circumstances of each infected transfusion or tissue recipient will be
considered individually to establish that the treatment was the source of
their infection.
A panel of experts, chaired by Mr Benet Hytner QC, will be set up to
consider cases where necessary.
Payments will be made as soon as possible.
Mr Waldegrave said the government did not accept the argument for a general
scheme of 'no fault' compensation for medical accidents, but ministers had
decided to treat patients infected with HIV as a special case.
Labour welcomed the change in the government's position, although it
criticised the delay in reaching the decision. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour
leader, suggested the shift 'may well have more to do with the approaching
election than with the existing injustice to people tragically and
accidentally infected with HIV'.
The amounts of payments to be made are Pounds 41,500 for each infant, Pounds
43,500 each for single adults, Pounds 52,000 for each married adult without
dependent children and Pounds 80,500 each for infected people with dependent
children.
These sums comprise the variable amounts paid to HIV infected haemophiliacs
following the settlement of litigation, and the payments of Pounds 20,000 to
each HIV infected haemophiliac which were announced on November 23 1989.
Mrs Margaret Jay, director of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The
government's decision is welcome, but late. It could have saved long months
of unnecessary hardship by making this announcement earlier.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Big trade deficits 'threaten' Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S progress towards European economic and monetary union might be
jeopardised by large current account deficits, a group of private-sector
economists warned yesterday in a report which reflects Labour party
thinking.
The economists say the big import bills expected as Britain moves out of
recession will mean a rise by 1996 in the current account deficit, possibly
to 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product.
Such large deficits could damage investor confidence and hinder efforts to
reduce UK inflation and interest rates ahead of Emu, which Britain has
indicated it might join towards the end of the century.
The analysis comes from economists at the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, London Business School, Oxford Economic Forecasting and
Warwick University. It was co-ordinated by Mr Jeremy Bray, the Labour
spokesman on science and technology, who also has an interest in economic
modelling.
The Treasury disputed the conclusions, saying it was difficult to look far
enough ahead to predict likely deficits in the late 1990s. There was 'no
evidence' to suggest Britain would find it difficult to finance any deficits
that arose.
The economists say the current account deficit - which fell to Pounds 5.8bn
last year after Pounds 15.2bn in 1990 - reflects structural difficulties in
the economy which will become more apparent during the expected upturn.
It argues that as imports rise due to increased demand, any matching rise in
exports will be insufficient to prevent a large increase in the de-ficit.
Over the period to 1996 the deficit will increase to between 1.5 per cent
and 2 per cent of total UK output, from about 1 per cent last year,
according to the group.
In a 'worst case' - assuming exports rise only slowly with a large jump in
imports - the deficit could reach 3.2 per cent of output.

deal

<TEXT>
MR JEAN-NOEL Jeanneney, the French foreign trade minister, yesterday accused
the US of blackmail in the Uruguay round of world trade negotiations and
said there was no reason to conclude a rapid agreement purely to accommodate
the US elections.
Speaking to the Franco-Thai Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok along with Mr
Amaret Sila-On, his Thai counterpart, Mr Jeanneney condemned Washington for
focusing on agricultural trade in the negotiations and demanding what he
called one-sided concessions from Europe.
'We are bound to denounce this blackmail,' he said. 'We and you both are
victims.'
He reiterated the rebuttal by France and the European Community of the draft
agreement prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
In January, the EC trade and farm ministers agreed that the draft was a
'reference document for the final phase of negotiations' but said that
'insofar as the 'Dunkel paper' calls into question the foundation of the
Community's agricultural policy, the paper is not acceptable and therefore
has to be modified'. The French minister yesterday suggested that the
proposed March 31 deadline for concluding the deal could be set aside.
'We will not accept . . . a bad agreement, to beat a deadline set only by
the American electoral timetable,' he said.
Seen from a developing country such as Thailand, the dispute between the EC
and the US over farm trade looks like an argument over the relative merits
of different types of protectionism. Mr Amaret politely but pointedly
contradicted the French minister and urged that Mr Dunkel's text be adopted
as the basis for the final Gatt negotiations.
'Thailand believes that all countries are justified in wanting to protect
their farmers and all of us have done foolish things in that regard,' he
said. 'But we achieve nothing by finger-pointing. Thai fingers are too small
to be noticed by the Europeans or the Americans anyway.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government will today announce an acceleration of its
programme to lower import tariffs as part of its fight against inflation,
writes Christina Lamb, recently in Brasilia.
The measures are designed to curb the oligopolies and cartels that have been
keeping their prices artificially high and thus fuelling inflation  - which
last month hit a monthly 26 per cent.
Under the new timetable, the next round of tariff reductions will be brought
forward from January 1993 to October this year. Brazilian import tariffs are
currently the highest among the large Latin American economies, at an
average 21 per cent and maximum 65 per cent. In October, the average will be
reduced to 17 per cent. Tariffs will be reduced further in July 1993 to an
average of 12 per cent and maximum of 35 per cent.
At the same time, new export financing will be made available to foreign and
national companies in an attempt to stimulate exports. Mr Marcilio Marques
Moreira, the economy minister told ambassadors from Group of Seven
industrialised countries last Friday that he expects exports to increase by
20 per cent on last year's Dollars 31.6bn (Pounds 17.4bn).
In a separate move, many companies and sectors have been called in to the
Economic Defence Secretariat to explain 'abusive price rises' and
'cartel-like behaviour'. Twenty-eight legal suits have been filed against
companies, which could result in heavy fines. Sectors under investigation
include bakers selling bread rolls at the same price and three manufacturers
of cleaning materials that have been raising prices at a rate in excess of
inflation.
Ms Dorothea Werneck, the national economy secretary, explains that bread
prices have been government-controlled for 40 years and milk for more than
30: 'There have been so many price freezes that producers are afraid to put
lower prices in case they get caught out by another one.'

JAPAN has requested an urgent meeting to modify the draft agreement for the
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), a senior
government official said, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'I know this would reopen negotiations and might unravel them . . . but
otherwise there will be major confusion, because not only Japan but others
do not agree with the draft,' said Mr Jiro Shiwaku, vice-minister for
international affairs at the Agriculture Ministry.
Negotiators are expected to present their country's reply to the market
access parts of the draft by March 1.
However, Mr Shiwaku said that Japan could not make its reply based on the
draft because it was unfair.
'If the draft were implemented export subsidies would remain legal while
import controls would become illegal,' Mr Shiwaku said. Under current Gatt
rules, Japan controls dairy products imports.
Japan also opposes the tariffication system - converting non-tariff farm
import barriers into tariffs - because it fears that if its rice market were
open, it would not be able to maintain self-sufficiency in what is its
staple food.
Mr Shiwaku declined to say if Japan would refuse to reply to Gatt on March 1
over farm products to be imported under tariffs.

SIR Leon Brittan, the vice-president of the European Commission, yesterday
cautioned Japan against striking bilateral trade agreements with the US at
the expense of Europe, writes Stefan Wagstyl from Tokyo.
Sir Leon expressed his concern during a meeting in Tokyo with Mr Kozo
Watanabe, the minister for international trade and industry.
Sir Leon referred to the agreements reached between Japan and the US during
President Bush's visit to Tokyo last month, which included a pledge by
Japanese motor companies to increase purchases of US-made parts and to make
efforts to import more US-made cars into Japan.
Sir Leon said such measures to boost imports should apply to Europe as well.
Japan's import promotion policies applied equally to all countries.
The EC commission has reserved the right to call an adjudicatory panel of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if it judges the US-Japan
bilateral agreement to have infringed free trade rules.
Sir Leon Brittan, whose brief covers financial services and competition
policy, yesterday urged Japan to further liberalise its insurance market.
In a speech given during a visit to Tokyo, Sir Leon said a long-standing ban
on insurance brokers was a major barrier to the entry of foreign insurance
companies into the Japanese market. Other obstacles included very strict
controls by the authorities on the wording of documents and on premium rates
on non-life insurance.
Sir Leon welcomed various reforms in the Japanese financial markets, but
urged further action in areas such as interest rate deregulation.

THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) yesterday
extended a DM125m (Pounds 43.5m) loan to help finance a new joint venture in
Hungary, which amounts to the largest direct foreign investment in the
country, and the bank's single largest loan to date.
General Motors Hungary (GMH), a joint venture formed by General Motors,
Raba, the state-owned manufacturer, and the State Development Institution, a
state financial body, will help finance a DM501m engine manufacturing and
car assembly plant in Szentgotthard, western Hungary, close to the Austrian
border. General Motors will hold two-thirds of the shares.
An EBRD banker said the deal would help 'upgrade' Hungary's manufacturing
and industrial base.
GMH aims to produce engines for General Motors Europe car assembly plants in
Spain, Germany, the UK and Belgium. It also plans to assemble Opel Astra
cars for the Hungarian market.
The new plant begins operations later this year, will create 600 new jobs,
and at full capacity, will assemble 15,000 Opel Astras, and 200,000 engines
annually.

FT  18 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Italy sees need for an exports revival -
Competitive pressures biting even in areas of traditional strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE revival of Italy's fortunes as a leading exporter has become a matter of
urgency.
This has been underlined by a two-day conference on the country's foreign
trade, organised by the trade ministry and the Institute for Foreign Trade
last week. The conference and its accompanying papers portrayed a picture of
declining competitiveness against a background of growing international
competition in those sectors where Italy had been traditionally strong, such
as footwear, machine tools and textiles.
It also emphasised the significance of export earnings in an economy lacking
in natural resources and heavily dependent on imported energy. This is
particularly so at a time when the balance of payments is deteriorating
because of lower tourist earnings, greater spending by Italians abroad,
fewer emigrant remittances, high-technology payments, the increasing cost of
foreign debt and a hunger for imports. This week provisional balance of
payments figures for 1991 were released showing a swing from a L 15,156bn
(Pounds 7bn) surplus to a L 8,571bn deficit in a year.
This has meant that it is no longer enough for Italy, with a traditional
trade deficit, to maintain its share of world trade. That share has even
increased over the last decade from 6.3 per cent to 7 per cent, although
there has been a shift in trade volumes from developing countries, notably
the oil producers, to the EC and other leading industrialised nations. The
EC now absorbs 58 per cent of exports and Italy has done well in boosting
its share of the German market.
By contrast, Italy's penetration of the North American market has remained
stationary and little advantage has been taken of the Asian
newly-industrialised countries.
The most disturbing trend has been a decline in the balance of trade in
manufactured goods. From a high of L 26,195bn in 1986 the balance has now
dropped to L 18,573bn. Conference papers argued the trend had begun in the
early eighties but was concealed at first by relatively cheap raw material
prices, especially energy.
This has been combined with a pattern of export growth in the late eighties
which has been consistently behind the increases in the export markets where
Italian companies are trying to sell.
There was little disagreement at the conference over where Italy's problems
lay. These could be summed up as follows:
Italy had lost its long-held comparative price advantage through rises in
wage, social security and general production costs in the eighties.
Small labour-intensive companies, the backbone of the country's export
performance, had concentrated on consumer sectors where the
newly-industrialised countries in Asia, of late in Latin America and more
recently in eastern Europe had begun to compete.
Small scale family-run businesses which constituted the bulk of Italian
industry were ill-equipped to confront the internationalisation in the
global economy where there was increasing need for sustained sophisticated
marketing and after sales service.
The large companies, both public and private, had failed to invest
sufficiently abroad in joint ventures and concentrated too much production
domestically.
Faced with increased competition abroad, exporters had reverted to the
continued relative protection of the domestic market and were now suffering
from recession.
Small companies had traditionally financed ex-ports out of cash flow and at
a time of recession and high interests lacked export finance which anyway
favoured large companies.
Too much export finance had been politically motivated to favour
government-to-government deals in areas of high risk.
Insufficient attention had been paid to moving out of mature sectors and
into more profitable high-technology areas such as information technology.
The fear of Japanese competition had led Italian industry to turn its back
on Japanese investment and the lessons to be learned from Japan's economic
strength. As a result Italy was now importing Japanese goods produced in
other EC countries.
The conference was less coherent in providing strategies for the future.
There was general agreement that Italian companies had to become more
international in outlook, creating more overseas joint ventures and
investment.
This in turn would entail improved financial back-up from the banking system
and greater concentration among small companies either in the form of
co-operative ventures or through mergers.
If Italy was still to compete in such sectors as clothing, footwear and
textiles, companies had to do so on the basis of quality, innovation and
technology rather than price.
Behind all this lay two broader and incomplete debates. The first was
whether the Italian government, like the French, should earmark and actively
promote new strategic sectors.
With a large public sector and the state heavily involved in two thirds of
the most technologically advanced companies, there is a clear temptation to
pursue the French path. However, with a huge public sector deficit this
course risks conflicting with the declared need to accelerate privatisation.
This touched on the second element of incomplete debate - the relationship
between the public and private sector in Italy and the role played by
politics in economic decision-making. And with an election pending in April,
it is unlikely that this controversial issue will be clarified until later
in the year, if then.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S industrial output last year grew at 2.1 per cent, the slowest pace
in five years, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
yesterday. The report confirmed accumulating evidence of a sharp slowdown in
the Japanese economy.
Miti also revised downward estimates for December industrial production.
Factory and mine output fell by 1.9 per cent in December, compared to a year
ago, a half percentage point below earlier estimates.
Equally significant, Miti increased estimates for the rise in inventories
during the month from 12.8 per cent to 13.1 per cent.
Mr Russell Jones, economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, said: 'There is no
doubt in my mind that the manufacturing sector is in recession.'
Mr Jones said that after taking into account the gradual decrease in
inventory levels made possible by technical change, inventories were now at
the highest level for more than 15 years.
The high level of inventories points to a further decline in factory output
in the months ahead as manufacturers try to balance output with demand.
The Nihon Keizei Shimbun, the economic daily newspaper, said that capital
investment by Japanese companies would decline by 4.5 per cent in the fiscal
year starting in April, according to its own survey. This would be the first
drop in six years.
Manufacturing investment is expected to be hit hardest, with a decline of
11.1 per cent.
Adding further to the economic gloom, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation
reported that steel production fell for the sixth consecutive month and, at
8.1m tons, was 14.8 per cent below a year ago in January. This was the
lowest production since September 1987.
Production of steel products for the construction industry declined by 23.6
per cent.
Tokyo retail sales were also sluggish in January.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION by Taiwan's central bank to restrict the flow of equity
investment funds into the island has stunned foreign fund managers and
sparked a dispute over financial policy within the government, Reuter
reports from Taipei.
The decision threatens to damage the confidence of foreign investors and
hurt Taipei's efforts to internationalise its stock market, which opened to
foreign institutions at the start of last year, industry analysts and
officials say.
'If you want foreigners to invest in your market, the free flow of funds is
a condition . . . Taiwan loses credibility because of this,' said the vice
president of a foreign securities firm.
'Taiwan can no longer justify the use of such measures,' said one Finance
Ministry official, adding that his ministry hoped to persuade the central
bank to alter its policy.
The central bank began earlier this month to delay its approvals of
remittances of funds by foreign firms investing in the island's equity
markets, according to Finance Ministry officials and foreign securities
firms.
The policy aims to curb pressure for appreciation of the Taiwan dollar
against the US dollar by reducing the capital flowing into the island.
The Taiwan dollar, buoyed by a trade surplus and domestic interest rates
well above US rates, has risen to about 25 to the US dollar from 27 at the
end of June last year, threatening the competitiveness of Taiwan's exports.
The central bank yesterday continued to refuse to make an official policy
statement.
But the Commercial Times, a leading financial daily, quoted Mr Samuel Shieh,
central bank governor, as saying inflows of foreign equity funds would be
restricted indefinitely as the central bank monitored foreign exchange
developments.
News of the policy pushed share prices sharply lower yesterday. The market's
weighted index fell 3.3 per cent to close at 4,859.48.

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW between China and Britain over control of the media after 1997 has
grown more likely with Beijing making it known through the Hong Kong press
that it opposes plans to change the status of Radio Television Hongkong
(RTHK), the colony's English-language broadcaster.
The plans, which if enacted would change RTHK from a government department
to a statutory corporation, are the subject of negotiations between Britain
and China in the Joint Liaison Group. Britain tabled the plans in December,
but Beijing has not yet given a formal response.
However, Wen Wei Po, a Beijing mouthpiece, has accused the British
government of seeking to make RTHK independent so the network could continue
to serve British interests after 1997.
'In the past the (Hong Kong) government has always recognised the need to
keep RTHK as the official broadcaster . . . What is the motive behind the
plan to hive off the station and deprive the future government of its
services?'
Beijing has often used sympathetic Hong Kong newspapers to ventilate its
views on Sino-British relations. The tone of the article is in keeping with
the conspiratorial gloss Beijing often applies to bilateral Hong Kong
issues.
Plans to change RTHK's status date back to just after Britain and China
signed the 1984 Joint Declaration, the basis for China's resumption of
sovereignty in Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong government has dragged its feet.
A government inquiry in 1985 recommended that RTHK should become independent
of direct government control. In 1987, the government accepted the
committee's advice and plans were laid for RTHK to be run by a board of
governors. The government returned to the decision in 1989, deciding that
RTHK needed to be more independent and should be changed into a public
corporation.

CHINA'S paramount leader Deng Xiaoping says his country's commitment to
economic reform must last for a century, a Beijing-funded Hong Kong
newspaper reported yesterday, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Deng also promised the southern province of Guangdong that it could become
Asia's fifth economic 'dragon' within 20 years, the newspaper Wen Wei Po
said.
Deng has recently toured the province's special economic zones, Zhuhai and
Shenzhen. He noted the success of the booming province but said it must work
harder and faster to catch up with the four dragons - the dynamic economies
of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.
In a clear signal that the push for economic reform does not include any
hint of political change, Wen Wei Po said Deng supported 'grasping two
things at once', economic opening and control of spiritual values.
Deng and his supporters believe economic reform is possible without the
Communist Party surrendering power.
The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has
apparently convinced Beijing that to survive, the Chinese Communist Party
must push ahead with economic reforms while suppressing political dissent.

THE European Community has complained at China's special trade deals with
the US which, Brussels alleges, discriminate against the EC.
Foreign ministers of the 12 EC states also yesterday reviewed the
Community's attitude to the communist government's record on human rights.
Despite a Danish-led push to toughen the EC's political stance towards
Peking, the Twelve decided to maintain their 1990 policy of gradual
normalisation of relations with Peking.
However, EC officials stressed they made no link between the trade and human
rights issues, because to do so would open the Community to political
blackmail over commercial issues.
The European Commission has complained that China recently signed an
exclusive shipping agreement with the US, requiring US-Chinese trade to be
carried in boats of the two countries.
This, say EC officials, goes against the EC's agreement with China which has
a no-discrimination clause in it.
Brussels' other complaint is that China has given US companies better
treatment than other foreign firms on intellectual property by awarding them
retrospective rights. The Commission has now written to Peking asking for
equal treatment with the US. If it gets no satisfaction, the EC side will
raise the issue at next month's meeting of the joint EC-Chinese working
group on trade.
A similar row over discrimination arose a couple of years ago when Brussels
complained that South Korea was giving preferential treatment to the US on
intellectual property rights.
Eventually the EC persuaded the Seoul government to treat European companies
on a par with their American counterparts and the issue was defused.
Brussels is hoping to achieve the same with China.

THE SOMALIAN capital, Mogadishu, was rocked by street battles and mortar
bombardments yesterday despite pledges by rival warlords that they would
comply with a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire, relief officials reported,
Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Clan forces of Mr Mohamed Farah Aideed are apparently trying to surround
Mogadishu's northern Karan district where a rival faction leader, Mr Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, is making a last-ditch stand, according to relief workers who
are in contact with the city by radio.
For several days fighting has concentrated along a road linking Karan with a
vital airstrip and the outside world. 'People are deeply pessimistic whether
a ceasefire will work out at all,' one official said. A human rights worker
who arrived in the Kenyan capital yesterday after being flown out of
Mogadishu said that shelling had been constant.
Some 5,000 people are believed to have been killed and a further 12,000
wounded since war erupted on November 17.
Late on Sunday, the Aideed faction, which controls most of the city, said it
would comply with the UN ceasefire which was agreed at talks in New York
last Friday. In a Radio Mogadishu report, monitored by the BBC, Mr Aideed
said he was ready to implement the UN resolutions to immediately halt
fighting and to sign a formal ceasefire by the end of the month.
Relief workers said few medical supplies had reached the district controlled
by the Ali Mahdi clan since an International Committee of the Red Cross team
of doctors was forced to pull out of a hospital last week.
This left an estimated 4,000 wounded in makeshift hospitals without proper
treatment. Scores of new casualties are being suffered daily. Aid workers
said hospitals in the Aideed faction's part of Mogadishu had been receiving
up to 330 casualties a day. The Radio Mogadishu report monitored by the BBC
quoted Mr Aideed as saying he was ready to host a peace conference in the
capital. He also appealed to international organisations for more aid.
After United Somali Congress (USC) fighters ended the 21-year rule of Mr
Mohamed Siad Barre just over a year ago, Mr Ali Mahdi - a wealthy hotel
owner who had financed the guerrilla group - declared himself interim
president.
Mr Aideed, who seeks power himself, said the action broke agreements made in
exile with other anti-Siad Barre groups from the north and south of the
impoverished country.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAITI government is planning to privatise its telecommunications
network through a public flotation, the first public service to be sold to
the private sector. The sale could raise up to Dollars 1bn.
A first tranche of shares would be floated on the Kuwaiti stock exchange,
possibly as early as next year.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK firm advising the government on the sale, has just
submitted an interim report on the privatisation. A final report is due in
May.
Privatisation of the network would first require a change in the law on the
government's virtual monopoly on telecoms.
Mr Abdul Aziz Al-Ayoub, under-secretary at the Telecommunications Ministry,
said yesterday he hoped the sale would be underway by the end of 1993.
Under privatisation, all the government's telecoms assets would be
transferred to a separate authority, which would establish a company to
transfer assets to the private sector.
The government plans to invest about Dollars 300m in the system before
privatisation, including conversion to a fully digitalised network.
The government intends to maintain a stake in the new company for an initial
period during the phased sale. It would also continue to regulate the
telecoms market. A proportion of shares would be offered for sale to Kuwaiti
citizens.
The telecoms service had to be privatised if it was to improve efficiency
and keep pace with new technology, Mr Al-Ayoub said.
Ericsson, the Swedish telecoms group, supplied more than 90 per cent of the
government-controlled market before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
However, other foreign companies, most notably AT&amp;T of the US, have been
battling for a share of the estimated Dollars 400m repairs and replacement
of equipment damaged during the war. Less than Dollars 100m worth of
contracts have been awarded so far.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Land issue distracts Mugabe's donors: Zimbabwe aid
conference runs into some political barbed wire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JUST SIX weeks ago the signs were that the western country donor meeting on
Zimbabwe which starts in Paris today would be relatively straightforward.
True, there has been some slippage in the implementation of Zimbabwe's
five-year economic structural adjustment programme which western donors
backed to the tune of Dollars 700m at a similar meeting in Paris last March.
But a 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar last year, the lifting
of controls on most prices, the virtual freeing of interest rates - with the
important exception of mortgage lending - a partial return to collective
bargaining in the labour market, substantial increases in the export
retention scheme and the launch of trade liberalisation reflect strong
government commitment to economic reform.
This is no mean achievement given the extent to which the reforms contradict
just about everything President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party stands
for. At three general elections, it promised voters socialist transformation
of the economy, free schooling, improved health facilities, more and better
jobs and housing and - above all - land redistribution.
Today, it stands for a reduction in the fiscal deficit from almost 11 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1991 to below 8 per cent. School fees have
been re-imposed at primary level; 25 per cent of the public service
workforce (excluding teachers and nurses) are to be laid off by 1995, price
controls abandoned, parastatals commercialised or privatised and subsidies
virtually abolished. So much for socialism.
As a result, the voters are deserting Zanu-PF in droves to the point where
few political analysts believe it can win a fourth term. What is fortunate
for the government, elections are not due until 1995 and there is no viable
opposition on the horizon yet, though Harare is thick with rumours that a
broad front for multi-party democracy - like those established in Kenya and
Zambia - will soon be launched.
Zanu-PF's deepening unpopularity explains the decision to trundle out the
Land Acquisition bill. Due to go to parliament at the end of this month, the
bill seeks to give the state the power of compulsory acquisition of
commercially-owned (largely white) farmland. The initial target is some
850,000 hectares, adjacent to the 'communal' (black peasant-farmed) lands
where overcrowding and environmental degradation have long been a problem.
The principle of compulsory acquisition is not disputed, but the means are.
The bill's provisions for compensation are inadequate, there is no recourse
to the high court and the principle of 'designation' has already struck at
the very heart of the structural adjustment programme.
The bill is an enormous embarrassment to donors, not just because it
violates the principles of accountability and transparency which they
believe are crucial to sound development strategies but because it threatens
to undermine what has long been the dynamo of the Zimbabwe economy -
commercial agriculture. Last year, for instance, when GDP grew 3 per cent,
the main impetus came from tobacco, the bulk of which is grown by white
farmers.
Some donors, and especially the World Bank, are anxious to ensure that the
land issue does not divert attention from the undoubted virtues of
structural reform. The British, who part-financed previous
largely-unsuccessful land resettlement in the early 1980s, had hoped to
build a consensus among donors to force Harare to rethink the compensation
provisions of the bill. But other bilateral donors show little enthusiasm
for this.
Zimbabwe's finance minister Mr Bernard Chidzero, who can have no illusions
about the bill's potential for economic damage, will seek to calm the
critics, trotting out the line that the legislation is merely political
symbolism that won't be activated - if only because there are no funds - and
should not be allowed to undermine the adjustment programme's grander
designs.
As a result, the donors, believing - with some justification - that Zimbabwe
has a better chance than most of making a go of structural adjustment, are
likely to stump up the Dollars 380m needed in 1992 and a further Dollars
700m for 1993. This on top of some Dollars 350m from the World Bank and the
African Development Bank and an SDR400m (Dollars 564m) three-year IMF
extended fund facility.
But that will not be enough now that severe drought has forced a radical
downward revision of earlier targets. These projected a 4.4 per cent rise in
real GDP in 1992, 10 per cent growth in exports, a debt-service ratio of 20
per cent and a fall in inflation to 15 per cent at the end of this year from
28 per cent last December.
So serious is the drought - and so ill-conceived government's agricultural
pricing policies - that there is a real danger of a food crisis in April.
Zimbabwe has enough maize to see it through until the end of next month, but
will then need to import up to 1m tonnes to tide it over.
Falling farm output and substantial food imports will force the donors to
upgrade their support for Zimbabwe. Last year's current account deficit of
almost Dollars 700m (12 per cent of GDP) was at one stage forecast to
decline to Dollars 600m in 1992. Some forecasts are now for an increase to
Dollars 900m.
The best-case scenario is one of zero growth in 1992 and a limp recovery in
1993. The worst-case scenario - that looks more likely by the day - implies
GDP falling 2-3 per cent while more than half the population of 10m people
require food-aid assistance of some kind.
There is a temptation to dismiss the Land Acquisition bill as an
irrelevance, certainly in its present form. But to do that is to
misunderstand the determination of some in the government to deliver
elements of their political agenda, no matter what other indignities they
have been forced to undergo by the donor community.
There is also the lingering - if improbable - hope that land resettlement
might just be enough to win the party the next election.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Mexico raises environmentalists' hopes: Extension of reserve
in Lacandona rain forest wins go-ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MEXICO'S decision to enlarge the Montes Azules biological reserve in the
Lacandona tropical rain forest has raised environmentalists' hopes for the
creation of the long-planned Ruta Maya - an eco-archeological park
stretching from Honduras to southern Mexico.
The measures will extend the Monte Azules reserve eastward by 55,000
hectares to River Usumancinta, on the Mexican border with Guatemala, and
include the Mayan ruins Bonampak and Yaxchilan. The reserve will border a
similar ecological zone in Guatemala, that includes the ruins of Piedras
Negras, Tikal and El Mirador.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will be visiting his Guatemalan
counterpart next week. The establishment of a joint environmental park is
likely to be raised in the talks, according to Mr Homero Aridjis, founder of
the Group of 100 environmental organisation.
The Lacandona is North America's largest tropical rain forest. Since 1970
some 60 per cent of the Lacandona has been destroyed, in part because of
previous Mexican policy to populate the sensitive border with Guatemala.
The Mexican finance ministry has released another string of favourable
economic figures, showing that the government ran a budget surplus last year
of 15.5bn pesos (Dollars 5.07bn) or 1.8 per cent of GDP. Excluding revenues
from privatisation, the budget was in deficit by 12.99bn pesos, 60 per cent
less than the deficit last year.
In the third quarter economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 3.1 per
cent, bringing growth in the first nine months of last year (again at an
annual rate) to 4.1 per cent. The slowdown from second quarter growth of 4.9
per cent reflects the dampening effect of the US recession on the Mexican
exports, and capital spending.
The government revealed that internal and foreign debt as a percentage of
GDP fell to 38.1 per cent last year, from 62.4 per cent in 1988.
The cost of servicing the debt fell to 5.8 per cent of GDP from 16 per cent
in 1988, mainly thanks to the substantial fall in interest rates over this
period.

<TEXT>
PERU is to sell 19 state companies, its most serious venture yet into
privatisation.
President Alberto Fujimori said the government had designated small
'privatisation committees' for each of the companies, charged with selling
this initial group of companies 'at the best possible price ..and in the
most transparent fashion possible'.
The first sales are expected within two months.
Privatisation revenue will be used for development projects, improvements to
infrastructure and job creation schemes, but not to balance the state's
budget, Mr Fujimori said.
The companies for immediate disposal include mining concerns Minero-Peru and
Hierro Peru; bus company Enatru-Peru; two petroleum industry service and
transport companies; and the liquid gas concern Solgas.
Some loss-making state companies are to be wound up, including the
heavily-indebted state steamship company Compania Peruana de Vapores,
fishing companies Flopesca and Lilly SA as well as fishmeal producer San
Jose.
State-owned Banco Popular is also to be privatised. Mr Fujimori said his
government's aim was to promote competition in the financial sector, which
he called 'a cartel, or at least an oligopoly'. The state-owned Banco
Continental could be sold to 'an international entity' - competition, he
believed, would force local banks to cut costs and interest rates.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Luck and good management behind IMF success: The astonishing
turnaround in the Dominican Republic's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE octogenarian president of the Dominican Republic spends most of his
evenings between 7pm and 9pm signing the cheques to pay the central
government's bills.
Surrounded by ministers and advisers, President Joaquin Balaguer, though
blind, is reputed to be painstaking. He will not sign a cheque if there is
no money to cover it, an approach that sounds like a perfect way to ensure
the government balances the budget.
In fact, it has guaranteed no such thing: by focusing purely on cash in hand
and bills when presented, it takes no account of the transactions being
undertaken on the government's behalf. Furthermore, it ignores the
operations of the central bank, with which central government was running up
substantial arrears, and the rest of the public sector.
This was why, despite a Victorian housewife's approach to the central
government's budget, President Balaguer's government was printing money at a
rate sufficient to produce unprecedented inflation of over 100 per cent in
1990.
In the second half of 1990, the Dominican Republic appeared on the brink of
financial collapse. Many households were suffering power cuts for 20 hours
or more a day, many lost water supplies for much of the day. Petrol and food
shortages developed, damaging the important tourist trade.
The net foreign exchange reserves were negative and the government was
behind in payments to all its creditors, forcing the World Bank, an
important source of development capital, to suspend disbursements on its
loans.
However, since then, there has been an astonishing change. Most estimates
suggest prices rose by less than 5 per cent in 1991. Most forecasts for this
year suggest it will climb back, perhaps into double figures, as the economy
recovers from the sharp decline of the last two years.
Because interest rates were freed, and adjusted for inflation yielded
positive returns for depositors, Dominicans have started to bring money back
from the US, where interest rates have dropped. Perhaps up to Dollars 300m
entered the country because of this last year, helping to stabilise the
exchange rate.
This was expected to have declined to 14.50 pesos to the US dollar by the
end of last year, according to the economic programme agreed with the
International Monetary Fund in the middle of last year. Instead it has stood
since April at around 12.50 pesos to the dollar.
Dominican central bank figures show the public sector deficit dropped from 6
per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1989 and 5.1 per cent in 1990 to
0.1 per cent last year. Arrears to the World Bank and other international
organisations were cleared in April.
Rarely has the IMF seen such a rapid turnround. The programme was launched
only in August 1990 by President Balaguer soon after he started his sixth
term of office. Dismissing the former central bank governor, President
Balaguer appointed Mr Luis Toral, a party official but no economist.
Mr Toral appears to have taken the advice of the IMF, which could not lend
money immediately while the government was behind in payments to
international financial institutions. But by not signing an agreement with
the Fund until last July, Mr Toral has managed to create the impression
domestically that the new programme was entirely fashioned in the republic.
This approach may have helped avoid riots such as those that greeted
previous IMF austerity measures in 1984, even though the economy has shrunk
considerably since the measures were introduced.
Official figures suggest GDP fell 5 per cent in 1990 and stayed static last
year. With official data in the country often unreliable, some private
estimates suggest GDP may have fallen by a further 2 per cent last year.
The government's success in bringing down inflation, and the renewed
prospects for growth, suggest a rare combination, for the Dominican
Republic, of good luck and good economic management.
The measures included a unification of the four exchange rates and a
liberalisation of the exchange rate regime, and the interest rate
liberalisation. They stopped the central bank issuing currency without money
from central government, and most significantly slashed subsidies on many
goods including electricity and petrol, which having more than trebled in
price is now close to world levels.
The government used the sharp rise in oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait as the pretext for raising gasoline prices. When prices
subsequently fell, Dominican consumers saw no benefit.
The government coffers did, however. Mr Andres Dauhajre, executive director
of a Santo Domingo pro-market study group, the Economic and Development
Foundation, estimates the rise in oil prices lowered the public sector
deficit by the equivalent of 2 per cent of GDP.
The government now makes money on every gallon of petrol sold, and petroleum
imports have dropped from 50,000 barrels a day to about 34,000.
Structural reforms, such as reforming the customs code, have also been
undertaken. Tax reform and financial sector reform are also firmly on the
agenda.
The difficulty is that, while much more remains to be done to convince those
inside and outside the country that some reliable and consistent rules will
apply to economic activity in the Dominican Republic, much of what has been
done so far has been accomplished by decree. Thus they are not fixed in law
and can easily be cancelled by decree by this or future administrations.
Neither are people convinced that the government's economic policy is guided
with a medium or long-term aim in mind. Policy appears to be decided still
'on a day-to-day basis', according to Mr Hugo Guiliani Cury, a former
central bank governor and now a bank president.
Still, the measures appear to have generated more optimism than has existed
for years over the prospects for the Dominican economy.

depletion

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN and Chilean scientists are to begin studying the depletion of the
atmosphere's protective ozone layer over Chile.
The joint project will be backed by the air force of Chile (Fach) and the
Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which signed a
scientific protocol in Santiago at the weekend. Russia will provide a M-17
aircraft equiped to study atmospheric conditions at high altitudes. The
research team will include Fach meteorologists as well as scientists from
both countries.
The involvement of the Chilean air force is an indication of how widespread
concern has become over the problem of ozone depletion. Last spring, farmers
and fishermen in Chile's far south raised the alarm by reporting that sheep,
wild rabbits and salmon were going blind.
The inhabitants of these remote parts also began to suffer from eye
irritations, allergies and severe skin burns. The symptoms were blamed on
the growth of the springtime ozone hole over the Antarctic, which is
beginning to extend over parts of southern Australia, New Zealand and Chile.
The ozone hole, caused by the accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
above the Antarctic, allows increased levels of cancer-causing ultraviolet
rays to reach the earth.
Apart from the Russian-Chilean project, another team of Chilean scientists
began this year to monitor levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the
entire length of the country. Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, has
also sent a fact-finding mission to the southern tip of Latin America.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Granite state's voters warm to domestic issues: Prospects
for Democrats and Republicans in today's New Hampshire primary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL EYES turn to New Hampshire today as the granite state, so often the
graveyard of presidential ambitions, holds the first primary election of the
1992 campaign. The results of the Democratic and Republican races are
eagerly expected, not just because voters will deliver their verdict on
President George Bush's three years in office.
In a broader sense, New Hampshire marks the start of a landmark election -
the first of the post-Cold War era, now that anti-communism, which has
defined the political terrain in every US election since 1948, has seen its
enemy vanquished in its own citadel.
Domestic issues - primarily whether the US economy can produce a higher
standard of living for future generations of Americans - have become
paramount. Thus the performance of each candidate will show how voters rate
their prescriptions on matters ranging from trade, industrial policy, tax
cuts and health care.
For Mr Bush, the stakes are high. Having looked invincible six months ago,
he has appeared defensive, waiting like Mr Micawber for something to turn up
to suggest an economic recovery.
In New Hampshire, where voters are more conservative than elsewhere in the
US, the president faces an unpredictable challenge from Mr Patrick Buchanan,
the right-wing television commentator and former speech writer for
presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. A strong showing by Mr Buchanan
would increase the impression that Mr Bush is vulnerable, if not beatable,
in the November general election.
New Hampshire should be fertile ground for a protest vote.
In three years, the state has gone from boom to bust: unemployment has
tripled; bankruptcies have increased five-fold; the empty shopping malls
which line the highways are a testimony to the over-building and speculation
which characterised the 1980s.
Mr Buchanan is counting on holding the president's support to something less
than 60 per cent of the Republican vote, with his own candidacy locking on
to more than 33 per cent.
'Anything less than a 2-1 margin for Bush is a win for us,' says Mr Frank
Luntz, the young, bearded, Oxford-educated pollster for Mr Buchanan. 'It
will allow us to raise the money to fight on in the south.'
This prospect of civil war within the Republican party may not match the
historic split forced by right-wing Senator Barry Goldwater when he took on
liberal governor Mr Nelson Rockefeller of New York in the early 1960s. But
it may herald the crack-up of the coalition forged by Mr Richard Nixon and
Mr Ronald Reagan which led to five Republican victories in the last six
presidential elections.
The question is whether the current crop of Democratic candidates can
present a credible alternative to Mr Bush, making a national leader who
could appeal to the blue-collar workers and suburban middle-class voters who
deserted the Democratic party in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period it
was dominated by liberal factions more interested in catering to minorities
and heavy public spending.
On Sunday night, all five Democratic contenders showed off their wares in a
strangely subdued debate. Former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, the
front-runner, sounded more like a Republican with his proposals for relaxing
anti-trust law, and support of free trade and a capital gains tax cut.
But Mr Tsongas is a little too pious and self-conscious about his rise from
obscurity. 'Anti-charisma only gets you so far,' says Mr Michael Barone, a
political commentator. Mr Tongas has benefited from Governor Bill Clinton's
troubles.
Mercifully, the Arkansas governor was not asked about charges of draft
dodging during the Vietnam war; but he needs at least a good second place in
New Hampshire to carry on the fight in his native south.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the Japan-bashing liberal, would cut the US
defence budget by 50 per cent in the next 10 years and introduce a Franklin
Roosevelt-style public works programme.
Whether voters buy the meeker version produced on Sunday night will depend
on his closest rival for third place, or better, Senator Robert Kerrey of
Nebraska.
Mr Kerrey, Mr Harkin and their fellow Democratic candidate, California's
Governor Jerry Brown, were yesterday criss-crossing the state, hoping for a
last-minute shift in their favour and vowing that no matter what happened on
Tuesday, they were in the race until the end.
Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic party, says he expects the
Democratic presidential nominee to emerge from the present field and plays
down the chance of a late entry by an outsider such as Governor Mario Cuomo
of New York. Judging by the thinly-attended 'draft Cuomo' event on Sunday
night in Manchester he may be right.
The risk is that New Hampshire will not offer a decisive result for the
Democrats. But there are signs that the candidates are starting a coherent
attack on the past 11 years of Republican control of the White House, when
the US tripled its national debt, turned from being the world's largest
creditor nation to the largest debtor, and saw its schools, inner cities and
infrastructure crumble.
However different their prescriptions, both Mr Buchanan and the Democratic
candidates believe they can make a good case against Mr Bush, the guardian
of the status quo. New Hampshire will offer the first clue as to whether
they are correct, or whether the powers of incumbency will prove too
formidable.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish government's economic policies suffered an embarrassing blow
yesterday with the resignation of Mr Karol Lutkowski, the finance minister.
Mr Lutkowski, who has only been in office for two months, cited 'significant
differences' between himself and the rest of the government's economic team
as the reason for his 'irreversible' move.
The resignation came as Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, unveiled the
controversial economic programme which switches emphasis from the
anti-inflationary line of the last two governments to one of stimulating the
economy to overcome recession. Mr Olszewski declined to comment on the
reasons for the resignation but said it had not yet been accepted.
Mr Lutkowski saw the premier yesterday morning - only a few days after the
government accepted the plan. It was presented to parliament over the
weekend but has not been debated.
The finance minister said yesterday he felt there had been insufficient
support in the cabinet for his policies and efforts. He also expressed his
fear that moves to change and tinker with monetary controls 'signified a
threat for Poland's transformation to a free-market economy'.
Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the minister responsible for the new plan, said
yesterday he intended to keep this year's budget deficit to within 5 per
cent of GDP. 'We are fully aware that allowing hyperinflation would wipe out
any effort to reverse the recession'.
Mr Eysymontt announced that the government intended to concentrate on
boosting exports and investment, adding that he did not see 'any possibility
of increasing consumption over the next three years'.
He said the government target was to reduce inflation to between 40 and 45
per cent by the end of the year, against 60 per cent in 1991, while the
growth in money supply would 'slightly exceed prices growth'.
The minister added the government intended to stabilise the level of
unemployment next year. A government policy document said recession had to
be overcome for reform to continue and that the pace of privatisation would
be maintained.

FT  18 FEB 92 / Bundesbank puts pressure on pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN steelworkers' pay deal should not be used as a yardstick for
forthcoming wage settlements, the Bundesbank said yesterday, adding that
moderate wage agreements could help speed economic recovery in east Germany.
Its criticism of the steel settlement strongly suggests that it intends to
keep interest rates high in the near future, having raised them by half a
point in December. Citing the recent New York meeting of Group of Seven
finance ministers and central bankers, it said: 'Other countries also see
scarcely any scope for Germany at present to ease monetary policy.'
In its monthly report the central bank said that unit wage costs in Germany
were 7.5 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of last year than in the same
period of 1990. Current wage claims of 10 per cent or more contained
'considerable risks for growth and employment, as well as for the price
climate'.
The west German economy had already entered 'calmer waters,' it added. Gross
national product was an estimated 0.5 per cent lower in the fourth quarter
of 1991 compared with the third quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and
only 1 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of 1990.
'Nor does the outcome of the wage dispute in the steel industry suggest a
reduction of the wage cost burden,' the Bundesbank continued. The steel
settlement comprised an increase of 5.9 per cent on basic pay and a one-off
payment of DM175 (Pounds 61), which brought it up to 6.35 per cent.
The bank said it viewed the agreement as a carry-over from the 1991 wage
round. 'But the danger that the steel settlement will be seen as a signal
for the next pay round cannot be dismissed.'
The Bundesbank has not specified what level of pay increases it envisages,
although it has indicated that settlements of between 5 and 6 per cent would
be acceptable. Last year's pay deals were around 7 per cent. Both the public
sector and banking unions have taken a hard line over their present wage
claims and the most important pay talks will come in the engineering
industry, whose contract expires at the end of March.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, made clear earlier this
month that he was unhappy with the steel settlement. It would be 'highly
questionable', he said, if the steel pay deal was used as the measure for
other wage agreements.
The bank linked its concern about pay to trends in east Germany, where it
said economic recovery was making definite progress. While manufacturing
output had been assisted by state guarantees for exports to eastern Europe
and liquidity transfers from the Treuhand privatisation agency, it said
production would have to match market conditions in the long run.
'Wage settlements which are more in line with productivity improvements than
in the past two years could help considerably to speed up economic recovery
in east Germany.' Manufacturing industry still lagged behind the
construction and service sectors in the east German upturn. Existing
companies in east Germany were mostly uncompetitive and new ones needed time
to build up production.

FRANCE'S extreme right-wing National Front took a commanding lead in the
first round of voting in Sunday's by-election in Nice, confirming recent
indications that the party will make large gains in next month's regional
elections.
The by-election also saw a steep drop in the socialist vote, continuing a
run of electoral setbacks for the government.
Mr Jacques Peyrat, the National Front candidate, won almost 38 per cent of
the vote in the 14th canton of Nice, well ahead of the centre-right UDF
candidate, who secured only 15.8 per cent of the turnout. The Socialist
party vote dropped more than 9 percentage points to barely 12 per cent.
Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of the Socialist party, described the result as
'frightful' and called on party supporters to resist the National Front's
advance.
Mr Fabius also invited the Communists and centrist parties to join
Socialists in thwarting the National Front and mainstream conservatives in
the regional elections on March 22.
The National Front's showing in Nice could well be repeated throughout
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, a key political battleground, in regional
elections.
A recent survey suggested the traditional conservative parties were
marginally ahead in the region, but that the National Front was a close
second.

FT  18 FEB 92 / European Diary (Germany): German film is US hit but hard to
see at home - It's true, but is it cinema art?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEMPERS are running high in Germany's film world. Causing the controversy is
a film which has won critics' plaudits and a leading award in the US, but
has been denied a shot at the Oscar because a German jury refused to submit
it for the Hollywood prize.
At a time of earnest debate about the failing artistic and financial health
of the German film industry, an Oscar nomination would have provided a vital
shot of confidence. German cinemas are dominated by Hollywood films and
home-grown efforts often find it hard to get a showing.
But what makes this more than just a local spat is the fact that the film,
Hitlerjunge Salomon, deals with the highly opportunistic survival of a young
Jew in Nazi Germany.
Described by the New York Times as 'wrenching and darkly funny', it is based
on a true story. Solomon Perel, now in Israel, stayed alive by fleeing
wartime Germany and then Poland to Soviet-held territory and then, after his
capture by German troops, passing himself off as an Aryan.
Thus the jury's decision has raised charges by the film's makers of a
refusal to look too closely at Germany's anti-Semitic past, as well as of
inattention to the film industry's own interests.
In the US, where it is called Europa, Europa, the film - shown in German,
with subtitles - has taken more than Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.2m). Last month
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded it the Golden Globe award
for the best foreign film of 1991, regarded in the industry as second only
to the Oscar.
'It's a hit,' says Mr Tom Bernard, marketing vice-president at Orion
Classics, the US distributor. 'It's on the way to becoming the highest
grossing German film ever in the US.'
Such a film, you would think, must be easy to see in Germany. But you have
to search hard. In Frankfurt it can be seen in one small cinema, outside the
city centre, and until recently had only an early evening showing.
Cinema owners clearly expect little from a film which deals with such a
sensitive subject and which Die Zeit, the heavyweight weekly, described as
'a mixture of truth and striving for effect, of bitter seriousness and sheer
sentimentality'.
This comment hints at the reservations over quality which clearly swayed the
eight-man jury charged with making the Oscar nomination in the best foreign
language film category. Comprising representatives from the production,
distribution, technical, and commercial side of the industry, the jury has
stuck to its controversial decision of last October.
'This is shocking,' says Mr Bernard, all too well aware that an Oscar would
enhance the film's bankability and prestige. In an open letter in Hollywood,
top German directors such as Werner Herzog, Volker Schlondorff (maker of the
Oscar-winning Tin Drum), and Wim Wenders, actress Hanna Schygulla and others
stated their deep regret at what they called the jury's 'painful' decision.
Apart from the question of quality, the film's artistic origins also have to
comply with Academy Award rules. The main creative influences have to be
German for the film to qualify. But Hitlerjunge Salomon was a German-French
production, with a Polish director, Ms Agnieszka Holland, and a strong
non-German element on the technical side. Much of the funding came from
Germany, however.
In the end, the jury seems to have decided against Hitlerjunge Salomon on
both the quality and 'artistic control' counts. Mr Artur Brauner, the joint
producer, is incensed. So is Ms Holland, another film of whose (Angry
Harvest, also produced by Mr Brauner) was put forward by the jury a few
years ago.
The story itself is compelling, tragic, and humorous, qualities that not all
critics feel are fully evident in the film version. As the Suddeutsche
Zeitung wrote: 'The story of Solomon Perel is authentic. The film removes
this quality.'

FT  18 FEB 92 / Rotating environment planned for EC agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has lost patience with French obstructionism over
where to site the European Environment Agency.
The Community decided to set up the agency 20 months ago, but France has
refused to agree on its headquarters until Strasbourg is confirmed as the
permanent home of the European Parliament.
Senior officials say Brussels is expected tomorrow to announce a provisional
plan designed both to get the agency up and running, and force member states
to think seriously about a permanent home for what is seen as a vital tool
in EC environmental policy.
The Commission will suggest that board meetings of the agency rotate
throughout the Twelve along with each six-monthly presidency, but that
agency staff and computer services should be sited in Brussels, officials
said.
They acknowledged there was resistance both in the Commission and among
member states to create more 'transient' institutions like the European
Parliament itself.
The latter has its plenary sessions in Strasbourg, its committee meetings in
Brussels and staff in Luxembourg, under a 10-year-old provisional compromise
to constrain competing claims to host it.
But after the last four summits of EC heads of government ducked the issue,
the Commission believes further procrastination would badly damage Community
credibility in environmental politics, especially in the run-up to the June
'earth summit' on global warming in Rio de Janeiro.
Brussels officials hope nevertheless any decision from the Twelve to rotate
the agency will be a provisional solution. Competition to host EC
institutions will increase as a result of the programme agreed at last
December's Maastricht summit to introduce economic and monetary union by
1999 at the latest.

FT  18 FEB 92 / European new car sales rise slightly in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW CAR sales rose modestly in western Europe last month
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
by an estimated 0.7 per cent to 1.23m. Small declines in Germany and Italy,
as well as a further 6 per cent fall in UK sales, were offset by a big jump
in Spain.
Many of the medium-sized and small European markets also achieved higher
sales in January than in the same month a year ago. Sales last month were
higher than a year ago in 11 of 17 markets across the region.
In the leading western European markets new car demand fell by an estimated
3.8 per cent in Germany, by 2.4 per cent in Italy and by 6 per cent in
Britain, where sales are now in their third year of continuous decline.
In Spain, however, sales have begun to recover strongly. Demand in January
was 31.5 per cent higher than the very depressed level a year ago.
The Fiat group, which includes Alfa Romeo, Lancia and Ferrari, was the main
loser among the big six volume carmakers in Europe in January. Fiat has been
suffering a rapid erosion of market share over the past two years, but last
month it was dramatically overtaken by Peugeot (which includes Citroen),
General Motors (Saab), and Ford (Jaguar).
Three years ago Fiat was challenging the Volkswagen group for European
market leadership; last month it dropped to fifth from second place a year
ago.
Fiat is still dangerously dependent on its domestic market, where it has
come under heavy attack, particularly from Ford. Its share of the Italian
market slipped again in January to 43.6 per cent from 47 per cent a year
ago.
The Fiat group will also come under increasing pressure from Japanese
carmakers in the Italian market. Italy has previously been largely sealed
off from Japanese competition as direct vehicle imports from Japan have been
limited to very small volumes. However, Nissan in particular has started to
make inroads into the Italian market - from a very small base - with car
exports from its UK plant.
By the end of the year Honda and Toyota will also have started production at
their first European car plants, which are both located in Britain.
By contrast to Fiat's demise the Peugeot group of France is staging a strong
recovery and in January it took over second place in the west European car
sales league from Fiat.
It achieved the fastest sales volume growth with a jump of 9 per cent and
boosted its share to 12.7 per cent from 11.7 per cent a year ago.

FT  18 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Companies hit back over river pollution
criticisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 19th February 1992) appended to this article.
BRITAIN'S biggest companies yesterday insisted that they were taking their
environmental responsibilities seriously, in spite of a report which said 27
of them exceeded limits for discharging effluent into rivers.
The 27, among the largest 50 companies in the FT-A All-Share index, were
listed in a report by the Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris), based
on records for the last three years from the National Rivers Authority and
the River Purification Boards in Scotland. The incidence varies from
exceeding limits once in the last three years to 35 times in the last year.
The companies named are not necessarily the worst polluters, but they are
the largest companies responsible for pollution.
The reaction of most companies was that given their size, the number of
incidents was lower than might be expected.
Several said the breaches referred to by Eiris occurred up to three years
ago, and that measures were being taken to ensure they were not repeated.
Guinness, for example, has had problems with nine of its 31 malt whisky
distilleries in Scotland. Unlike the rest, these nine were discharging
treated effluent directly into rivers.
Since 1990 Guinness has implemented a Pounds 2m programme to install
treatment plants to bring discharges within agreed levels.
Courtaulds is listed as exceeding discharge consents only once in the last
three years. In June 1989 a fractured water main at the acetates factory at
Spondon in Derbyshire led to acetile acid being discharged from the cooling
system into the river Derwent.
The company said: 'Acetile acid reacts in water. It takes out the oxygen,
and some fish were suffocated, but it did not cause any long-term damage.'
Courtaulds said systems had been put into operation to prevent similar
incidents.
Cadbury Schweppes said the rivers authority had recorded four cases of
discharge limits being exceeded at its Bournville, Birmingham plant in 1989.
But improvements in monitoring and control had prevented any recurrence of
the problem in 1990 or 1991.
Grand Metropolitan said some infringements had occurred at two Express
Dairies plants, which were sold to Northern Foods in November last year.
Controls had been improved to ensure the plants met their discharge
standards. One had since won an environmental award.
Other problems had occurred at the Auchroisk distillery in Moray, but
GrandMet said the distillery, built in 1974, had tighter permitted discharge
levels than older plants. The company is spending Pounds 250,000 on a
treatment plant to ensure that it meets the more stringent standards by
April.
BP said the Eiris comments were 'perfectly valid', adding that it was
working to reduce water pollution. It is spending Pounds 37m at the
Grangemouth refinery on the Forth on a water effluent treatment plant which
should be in operation by the end of 1993.
Each of BP's three main operating companies, covering oil, exploration and
chemicals, has a body supervising environmental control.
Many of the companies named by Eiris including GEC, Cadbury Schweppes and
Hanson, admitted that they had no central monitoring system or register of
pollution problems, but said that subsidiaries had their own environmental
units.
Correction (published 19th February 1992).
IN a report on water pollution published in yesterday's Financial Times it
was stated that General Electric Company had no central monitoring system or
register of pollution problems. In fact, GEC has a central register of
pollution problems and a group adviser on safety and the environment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 12th February 1992) appended to this article.
SPAR, the grocery chain, yesterday withdrew two own-label brands of Italian
wine from its shelves after contamination fears.
The Valpolicella and Soave wines came from the same supplier as Pinot Grigio
and Merlot wines recalled by Marks and Spencer after fungicide was found in
the drinks.
Gateway, the food retailer, said it had withdrawn one of its Italian white
wines, Pinot Bianco del Zenato, which came from the same Italian supplier.
Correction (published 12th February 1992).
IN some editions of yesterday's issue, it was stated that Gateway, the
supermarket chain, had withdrawn from sale one of its Italian white wines,
Pinot Bianco del Zenato. Gateway says that this was an error in its press
release and the wine withdrawn was in fact Pinot Bianco del Veneto. No
Zenato wines are involved in the recently reported withdrawals of wines
feared to be contaminated with fungicides.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Lloyd's, and other troubles of the rich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a real effort of will for those of us not directly involved to
discuss the Lloyd's crisis with the long Sunday face which ought to be
appropriate. The spectacle of Conservative 'names' assiduously feeding
information to Labour's City team, and thus helping to stir up a scandal
which could lose some of them their seats as well as their investment, is
really a sign of desperation and ought to be seen as tragic. It looks comic,
though.
Their complaints, which are basically that insiders have been profiting at
the expense of outsiders, also have their unintentionally comic side.
Financial markets are basically markets in knowledge, where those in the
know have always prospered since the days when the Rothschild fortune was
consolidated by early news of the victory at Waterloo - and attracted only
rueful admiration. The one gain from the affair is that no-one will for a
long time begrudge such names as stay the course their profits in the good
years.
In any case, it seems that there is a good deal of hindsight in the
judgments now being offered: anyone who has avoided large loss is seen as
suspect rather than competent. To be sure, nobody will believe any internal
investigation which reaches this conclusion; Lloyd's self-regulation must
now have a very limited life expectancy.
The fact is that what made self-regulation work was self-interest. As long
as the investors were grandees with large power and patronage, it was pure
commonsense to cosset them. The democratisation of investment in Lloyd's
will have very much the same effect as the breaking up of the old City club,
in which the blackball was far more effective (and infinitely less
expensive) than any fraud office or rule book could be. That is the
inevitable price of progress - if you think it is progress. The government's
effort to democratise equity investment will also make things steadily more
cumbersome if it succeeds.
The logical end of the road we are travelling will be an increasingly
American system with a powerful regulator and, no doubt, a tangle of
taxpayer-financed investor protection as a safety net. This does preserve
confidence in the market; but as the Americans are discovering, it can
involve very large additions to the national debt if vigilance is relaxed
even for a few Reagan years.
And it does not seem to achieve much else: the American system has not
delivered the industrial efficiency promised, and it has not encouraged
saving. It seems to be a game played for its own sake. The contrast with
Japan, where savings and growth are a legend, but the bursting of the
financial bubble has revealed scandals which make our own look like errors
in etiquette, is striking.
It is fashionable to sneer at academics like Colin Mayer of the City
University Business School, who draw the obvious conclusion - that there is
some contradiction between an obsession with highly liquid markets, and a
need to finance massive fixed capital; but they may have the last laugh.
Enterprise seems to work best where it is known to be a risky business, and
probably a little risque too. Our own attempt to reduce risk to a footnote
in small type ('The value of securities can go down as well as up') is
really a hypocrisy. It leads to envy: if we fool ourselves that investment
is safe, then large profits look suspect.
Meanwhile the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington has declared
war on another kind of insider - the executive with excessive hidden
rewards. Since boardroom pay has become such an obsession on this side of
the Atlantic, there is no need to go into the issues; again, it is the
imbalance between reward and perceived risk that makes executive
featherbedding rightly unpopular.
The American solution, based on the idea of transparency, will no doubt
prove moderately effective, and may well inspire calls for a similarly
powerful regulatory body here; but it is surely tackling the problem from
the wrong end. What would be good for enterprise is to increase the risk
rather than reduce the reward: to outlaw long contracts of employment, and
ensure that incentive schemes work so that pay, like share values, can go
down as well as up. But this argument is a bit theoretical and can be
challenged from experience: Japanese rules impose quite moderate pay in
return for lifetime security. Symmetry is the thing.
There is no symmetry, though, in the political effect. Recessions throw
large rewards, whether from salaries or from the capital markets, into
painful prominence, and encourage egalitarian protest. This is an important
long cycle, according to a recent book by Andrew Tylecote*, who has examined
all of the long cycle theories which people love to revive at times like
these. He has concluded that there is nothing in most of them; but the
inequality cycle - which provoked, among other incidents, the French and
Russian revolutions - may be peaking again now.
There is very probably rather less in this than meets the eye; but there is
no question, surely, that rich is not only unfashionable at the moment, but
likely to remain so for quite a long time. For that reason it is surely
prudent to assume that even if President Bush manages to get re-elected, his
successor is likely to be a Democrat; and equally that Mr Major may be the
last in his line for some time.
Meanwhile the real economic cycle moves on. In the US, something of a
consumer-led recovery really is under way, as is shown not only in the house
market, but now in the car market too. Sales are not only sharply up, at
some 15 per cent above this time last year, but far ahead of expectations.
This does not mean that happy days are here again; even the more optimistic
projection for the US still show an anaemic recovery by past standards. A
recovery, all the same.
Not here, though. In the US interest rates are low, and both corporate and
consumer debt has been reduced. Hence the upturn. None of these statements
is true of the UK.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Poland prepares for reform of economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish government, led by Mr Jan Olszewski, will today announce an
important shift in economic policy which reflects growing popular pressures
on east European governments.
The new policy aims to ease the rigours of market-oriented policies which
have led to rising unemployment and declining living standards, especially
in state-owned industries.
The strategy downgrades the fight against inflation and aims to combat the
recession by raising investment and exports. It implies a sharper
devaluation of the zloty to improve export competitivity and reduce imports
and is part of a wider strategy to speed up the pace of privatisation. The
message is contained in a policy document accepted by the government on
Friday and sent to parliament at the weekend.
The shift in emphasis away from the anti-inflation priorities established by
Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former finance minister and deputy premier, is
expected to gain conditional approval from the International Monetary Fund.
The IMF suspended disbursement of its Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) extended
loan package last September when the budget deficit and other indices
overran agreed targets.
It is concerned that Poland faces a 'severe risk of a return to
hyperinflation' but recognised last autumn that the country must boost
export earnings to shore up diminishing foreign currency reserves.
This year's plan expects inflation to slow to about 40 per cent from 60 per
cent in 1991. The aim of reducing inflation to single digits, targeted by Mr
Balcerowicz for 1991, has been put back until 1994.
Two key elements of the plan are tougher wage controls to cut real income by
5 per cent, and higher taxes on consumer goods. Last year real wages grew by
2 per cent despite a sharp rise in unemployment, while consumer goods
imports rose 126 per cent to Dollars 4.1bn on the back of a strong
revaluation of the zloty.
The government, which hopes to limit the expected budget deficit to Zl
70,000bn (Pounds 3.3bn), or 5 per cent of GDP, plans to raise turnover taxes
on alcohol, tobacco, petrol and 'luxury' items in April.
The government hopes that the increased flow of money to the economy, lower
wage costs, higher exports and less competition from imports will bolster
company profits, increase budget revenues and stem the threat of mass
bankruptcies.
Under the new plan, economic growth could range between zero and a fall of 5
per cent, according to a top government adviser, Professor Stanislaw
Gomulka. Last year GDP was estimated to have fallen 8-10 per cent.

FT  17 FEB 92 / City watchdogs plan list of suspected fraudsters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CENTRAL directory of suspected fraudsters and other wrongdoers in the
financial and corporate worlds is being planned by City and government
officials.
The directory would be used to link intelligence collected by the City's
investment watchdogs, the Bank of England, the Building Societies
Commission, the Stock Exchange and the companies investigation division of
the Department of Trade and Industry. It could be extended to embrace the
Serious Fraud Office.
The creation of a central directory would make it possible for investigators
inquiring into an individual or company to find out whether any other body
had information which could help. Sharing information in this way could lead
to better communication between the many bodies in the UK charged with
investigating suspected fraud or other financial misdemeanours.
Regulatory bodies already share information and claim that the current
arrangements work well. However, it is impossible at for a watchdog to tell
whether any other body has information that might be of use it in a
particular case.
The initiative to create the central file has come from the Securities and
Investments Board, the chief investment watchdog. It is understood the SIB
is close to reaching agreement with other City regulators on the directory.
The Department of Trade and Industry has yet to agree to the idea, which is
modelled on a proposal for a central database on fraudsters put forward by
the House of Commons' trade and industry select committee in a report on the
handling of company investigations.
The SIB's proposal would not lead to information being pooled centrally.
Instead, the central file would be an index of individuals and companies and
would list which agencies had information on them. The investigator would
then seek the information directly from the agency concerned.
Regulators hope this would overcome the resistance of some bodies which are
concerned about pooling sensitive information in a central system which
would be widely available.
Mr Kenneth Warren, chairman of the select committee, welcomed the plan.
'It's a major step forward,' he said. 'Those on the 'shop floor' have known
for a long time that it was needed - people in the legal profession, and
international crimed prevention.' A link between the planned file and
similar systems maintained by regulators overseas was also needed, he said.
The DTI said of the plan: 'It is something we are aware of and we are in
discussion with SIB.'

promotion on seniority alone - will disappear from British industry at the
end of next month.
Rail commuters may not immediately notice the difference but from March 29
nearly 30,000 British Rail station staff will be promoted on merit rather
than length of service.
Although the Buggins principle seems quaintly old-fashioned in the era of
performance-related pay it was considered a step forward by the rail unions
when they forced the private railway companies to concede the principle in
the early 1900s.
Mr Lawrie Harries of the transport union RMT said: 'In those days there was
a lot of nepotism and favouritism on the railways with managers picking
their blue-eyed boys regardless of merit.'
The union says it is no longer opposed to the principle of suitability as
opposed to seniority in selecting job candidates and has already conceded
the point for most other rail workers.
But some reservations remain about giving management complete discretion.
The introduction of an unpopular system of promotion assessment was one of
the causes of the 1989 London Underground strike, led by RMT.
Also, the union argues that because of the non-transferability of many rail
skills, such as train driving, long-serving staff should be compensated for
their limited options outside the rail industry by preference for promotion
within it.
The union-favoured compromise, which already applies to train drivers and
will probably now apply to station staff, is that seniority should determine
the order of applicants for promotion even if suitability will remain the
final test of whether someone gets the job.
RMT will today present a claim to BR for a substantial increase in pay and a
reduction in hours to 35 a week. Average earnings for hourly paid rail
workers are pounds 266 a week but that includes a large amount of overtime.
The national average of hours worked each week is 52.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Opec agrees to cut production: Deep divisions remain over
future policy on oil prices despite deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS from the Organ-isation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)
agreed on Saturday night to cut their production by just over 1m barrels a
day in a desperate bid to shore up oil prices.
The deal was a hasty compromise stitched together after five days of the
toughest talks amongst oil producers since the Gulf crisis. But the deal
failed to hide deep divisions within the organisation over its future policy
on oil prices.
The agreement, designed to underpin world oil prices, could be undermined as
Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of Opec's largest producers, expressed doubts
about its terms.
Saudi Arabia called the credibility of the deal into question when Mr Hisham
Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister, said he was dissatisfied with his
country's production allocation. Mr Nazer was under strong pressure from
King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, to resist attempts by other producers to force
the kingdom to cut its output below 8m barrels a day (b/d).
Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister, would have liked to have seen
the organisation implement a substantially larger production cutback to help
make prices firmer. He said: 'I cannot accept this ceiling and believe it
cannot help the price.'
The overall production ceiling agreed by Opec's 13 members calls for a
reduction in the flow of oil to 22.9m b/d from current production of 24.2m
b/d, with members reducing output by an average of 9 per cent. But since
Saudi Arabia has said it will not abide by its allocation of 7.9m b/d and
will produce at around 8m b/d, overall Opec output will be slightly higher
than 23m b/d in the next two months.
There was general agreement that it was crucial to signal to the market that
producers were willing to cut production. Prices since last November have
declined by over Dollars 4 a barrel.
According to Mr Mike Rothman, senior energy futures analyst at Merill Lynch,
an agreement to cut production to 23m b/d will do little more than keep oil
prices where they are now - at about Dollars 18.50 a barrel for North Sea
crude.
Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's oil minister said: 'I don't believe it's
enough to bring about a meaningful price recovery which we'd all hoped for,
but it's large enough to arrest a further deterioration of the market.'
Saudi Arabia invested billions of dollars during the Gulf crisis to help
make up for the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude from the market. It is
unwilling to slash output back to its former level of 5.4m b/d.

FT  17 FEB 92 / A further step towards separatism: The Minsk meeting on the
future of the CIS was disunity disguised as co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday, the day after the meeting in Minsk of the heads of state of the
Commonwealth of Independent States - a meeting described by the presidents
who gave public statements afterwards as 'taking co-operation to a higher
level' - Russian news agencies reported that 'patriotic forces' had met in
the city of Nizhny Novgorod to establish a Russian-only organisation to
'defend the Russian people'.
They also reported that other organisations had met in the same city to hear
Mr Gavril Popov, mayor of Moscow, say that the Commonwealth had no future;
that the commander of a battalion in Sevastopol was removed from his post by
the commander of the Black Sea Fleet for taking an oath of allegiance to
Ukraine; that the fighting between Armenians and Azeris in Nagorno Karabakh
grew fiercer; and that the president of Azerbaijan, Mr Ayaz Mutalibov - who
had left the 'constructive' meeting in Minsk early because of the worsening
situation in the region  - was appointed leader of the self-defence forces
in Karabakh.
The facts of daily life in the CIS render hollow the declarations of Minsk,
as they have all other declarations of the two-and-half-months-old body. And
though Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the chairman of the Belarus parliament and
the host at the Minsk summit last Friday, bravely tried on Saturday to
persuade the public that 'the CIS is the structure without which we will
never survive', the fact is that soon it will be the survival of the
structure itself which will be at stake.
All judgments on the proceedings of the CIS should be preceded by the
warning: 'as far as can be told'. That is because the information put out
after the meetings is confused, rhetorical, accompanied by no written
declaration or summary of the agreements reached, and with no explanation of
what the aims of the meeting were, and how far they were realised.
Within these strict limitations, what seems to have happened at Minsk last
Friday was this.
All 11 members of the CIS (the three Baltic states and Georgia - in Minsk as
an observer - are not members), from the former Union's 15 states agreed to
remain under a unified strategic nuclear command.
Three of the 11 - Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine - have ceased to pretend
that they will take part in a unified CIS army, and will continue to form
their own armies. Two states - Belarus and Uzbekistan  - will get out of the
CIS united forces as soon as they can. Those left in the unified command for
a 'transitional period' of two years are Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan,
Kirghizia, Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan. The last five are very poor, and
getting poorer. They are desperate to hang on to what Russia can offer them
in the way of cheaper resources and (especially in the case of Armenia)
protection.
The rest was window dressing or technical. There were some 20 agreements on
issues such as economics, energy and transportation links and on the army
being able to draw its supplies from all participating republics. Officers
are to be given guarantees about their ranks within national or unified
forces and assurances about housing and wages.
Both what has and what has not been agreed leave vast questions which go to
the very root of the Commonwealth - and, more important, to the nature of
the independent states themselves. The problems which have arisen from the
collapse of the Soviet Union, many of world importance, are so vast and
require such courageous and consistent work on their solution that it is no
wonder that leaders shrink from them, sign agreements which cannot be
honoured and put off until the next meeting (as they have done at every
meeting so far) issues which they cannot face resolving. According to those
present, the proceedings in Minsk lacked structure and preparation and
documents which were barely understood were nonetheless signed.
Foremost among the outstanding questions, certainly as far as the world at
large is concerned, is the nuclear issue. Though the states have preserved a
common line, it remains unclear what their new strategic doctrine is; or,
rather, it is clear that such a doctrine does not yet exist. Any doctrine
which did emerge would have to make clear whether the nuclear force
protected only the four states which hold the strategic weapons or the
entire Commonwealth. Since the weapons are no longer to be targeted on the
Nato countries - as Mr Yeltsin has said - new priorities would need to be
set. (This is also a matter which, in reverse, the west must resolve for its
own nuclear forces.)
It is by no means certain that the member states of the CIS nuclear alliance
will always have the same defence interests, particularly now that the
Central Asian states are developing links with countries such as Iran, which
may not in future be allies of Russia. By the end of two years, if the
statements of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine are carried through, only
Russia will possess nuclear arms of any kind. Any state renouncing weapons
would have to be very sure that a nuclear neighbour on its border would not
one day dispute it.
More immediately urgent are the effects of the Minsk settlement in the
sphere of conventional weapons. Before Mr Yeltsin apparently agreed to form
a common defence force with the five other republics, opinion among Russia's
parliamentarians, and many of its senior military people, was that Russia
must form its own army in order to stop the breakdown in morale and
coherence with which the 'united' force is now faced. Mr Yeltsin was said to
be ready to sign a decree on the creation of a separate army; is he now to
back away?
After all, what has been agreed is that there should be unity for a two-year
period of transition, presumably leading to separate armies. It is difficult
to see how and why the instruments for a united force should be forged in a
short period during which, simultaneously, the member states will also wish
to make preparations for individual forces.
Even if such a united force can be maintained, there now must be a
negotiation (put off to the next CIS summit meeting in Kiev on March 20) on
the division of army property to allow those who are leaving to have a basis
for their separate forces. This will be highly contentious, especially since
Ukraine has a disproportionately large share of tanks and advanced weaponry
 -a legacy of its forward position in the defence of the former union.
The question of the Black Sea Fleet remains to be settled, largely between
Russia and the Ukraine, but necessarily within the context of the
Commonwealth since the fleet is formally Commonwealth property. Remarkably,
though this has been the main point at issue between Russia and Ukraine for
over a month, neither of their presidents - according to Mr Leonid Kravchuk,
the Ukrainian president - raised it.
The underlying question is the crudest: can they trust each other?
Territorial questions are everywhere being raised, and are paraded in the
national legislatures, much of whose rhetoric is increasingly bellicose, as
the old pretences of comradeship are stripped away. Economic crisis
envelopes them all, with no relief in sight. It would be strange if populism
and chauvinism did not take root and grow.
Mr Shushkevich was right to say in Minsk on Saturday that the states had
better hang together than hang apart, for they are all in desperate straits.
Some of the agreements, on the joint maintenance of transportation and
energy links are encouraging. But a further protocol agreed to divide the
assets of the former state bank, Gosbank, between them - assets which were
in part its republican branches and which have anyway already become the
central banks of the new states. Russia monopolises the supply of money and
credit, and has laid claim to the gold. What was needed to continue the
operation of a common currency zone was a banking union - but it seems this
is no longer even to be attempted.
Minsk, in short, was a further step towards separatism: disintegration badly
dressed up to look like co-operation. The Commonwealth has no independent
existence or authority. It has only a tiny secretariat and is able to do
nothing between brief and ill-prepared meetings. It may be that the former
Soviet states will realise that they must co-operate and create a vehicle
for doing so. But that moment has not yet come, and is not in view.

How much a year does the average London bobby spend on photocopying? Answer:
Pounds 464. Another Pounds 198 is spent on postage and Pounds 927 worth of
telephone calls are made, according to the Metropolitan Police's internal
costs guide released by the Association of London Authorities.
Chief Superintendents use the reckoner to cost local budgets and staff
allocations for football matches and other public events. The figures give a
fascinating insight into police priorities. A police dog costs Pounds 20.50
per day (what do they feed them?), but one can get 17 police dogs for the
price of a commander (Pounds 349 per day).
Police horses are a bit more pricey but you can still get six of them for
the price of one constable (Pounds 145 per day). More conventional means of
transport start at 70p a mile for police motorbikes rising to Pounds 2.38p a
mile for a police coach.
And the cost of investigating unauthorised leaks of such sensitive
information?

An affront to the intelligence of the great British press? Not necessarily.
Finding 30 questions to ask about air conditioning on a damp, foggy Friday

The opinion polls may show the two main parties in immovable deadlock. But
there is no doubt who is winning the war to catch the ear of political
journalists at Westminster. After years during which they were left standing
by Labour's slick pr machine, the Conservative spin-doctors have seized the
initiative.
The balance has been tilted by the permanent presence in the House of
Commons press gallery lobby of Tim Collins, a former adviser to employment
secretary Michael Howard. The inexhaustible and well-briefed Collins is
available day and night (including Sundays) to provide a suitable
ministerial quote for a 'friendly' story or to highlight the latest 'gaffe'
by a Labour opponent. Meanwhile the Labour side is still suffering from the
departure two years ago of the irascible but highly-skilled Peter Mandelson
and, more recently, that of his deputy Colin Byrne.
Political journalists, used to being spoon-fed, have started giving the
benefit of the doubt to the Conservatives.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Observer: Pirelli's retread
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Step forward Marco Tronchetti Provera, 44, the new man at the helm of
Italy's troubled Pirelli tyres and cables group. Little known outside the
company until last December, he moved into the limelight when chairman
Leopoldo Pirelli told an astonished press the takeover bid for German tyre
giant Continental had collapsed.
Tronchetti Provera, who, like the 66-year-old Pirelli himself is a
substantial shareholder in the company, is thought to have been cool about
Conti from the start. His scepticism has now paid off. Although Pirelli, a
keen sailor, stressed the need for a firm hand on the tiller while the group
was still in troubled waters, it now seems that hand will be Tronchetti
Provera's.
The change was not unexpected, although many expected Pirelli would wait
until the agm later this year before announcing his retirement. As it
happens, he will remain non-executive chairman, while Tronchetti Provera
takes over the job of executive deputy chairman as well managing director.
Undoubtedly, the move is a blow to genealogists, who would have liked to see
another Pirelli in charge. As it happens, Leopoldo's son, Alberto, 38, is
still on the bridge. But Pirelli-watchers think it may not be long before he
too, jumps overboard, to return to studying marine biology, which they say
is his true love.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Rocket men think it's going to be a long, long time: A look
at the delays to the Asraam missile project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRIALS of British Aerospace in an era of tight and declining defence
spending are not yet over. After a fresh wave of cuts in its military
activities this month - costing 1,900 jobs - the UK's largest defence
contractor is awaiting the denouement of one of the country's longest and
most troubled arms procurement sagas.
At stake are not only hundreds more jobs but also the outlook for BAe's
independent existence in the missile business, which it has dominated in the
UK until now.
The Ministry of Defence is to decide soon whether it wants to go ahead with
BAe's Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (Asraam) or buy an alternative
close-combat weapon for the RAF.
The final verdict on the contract, expected to be worth about Pounds 700m,
will probably be made at cabinet level, as BAe's future in guided weapons
largely rests on the decision.
After more than a decade of work on Asraam the MoD has indicated it wants to
move quickly to a decision.
For BAe, it represents the only new missile development programme in
prospect, and the chance to open up a multi-billion-pound market. Failure
could cost up to 1,000 engineering and production jobs at its Dynamics
division - which has already shed 10,000 jobs since 1989. It has announced a
further 450 redundancies this month, leaving a workforce of 6,000.
The group's strategy was scuppered last year when it failed to agree with
Thomson-CSF of France on terms for merging their guided-weapons businesses
to form a dominant European manufacturer.
GEC-Marconi, the company that has made the guidance systems for BAe weapons,
is meanwhile setting itself up as a maker of complete missiles through the
planned takeover of Ferranti International's activities in the sector. In
conjunction with Matra of France, it is leading the competition to BAe for
the new close-combat missile.
Not even BAe could claim that the Asraam project has gone smoothly. Veteran
air force chiefs and MoD civil servants wince at the mention of it.
It began with a transatlantic memorandum of understanding in 1980, covering
two types of missile. The US would develop a medium-range missile - known as
Amraam - to replace the Sparrow weapon. The plan was for this missile to be
produced under licence in Europe, under BAe's leadership. That idea has
since been forgotten. Europe was to take charge of developing a replacement
to the short-range Sidewinder, which has dominated the market for more than
30 years.
With Germany in the lead, a joint venture was set up between BAe and the
specialist German company Bodensee-werk Geratetechnik (BGT). Norway and
Canada joined the Asraam project, and over the years the four defence
ministries put about Pounds 100m into it. The venture was not a success,
however.
In 1988, when the programme should have been going into full-scale
development, the UK took over the lead role, with BAe as prime contractor. A
year later the German government pulled out, leaving a 40 per cent gap in
funding. Norway and Canada also withdrew. BAe, needing a partner to provide
the infrared seeker for the missile, turned to Hughes Aircraft of the US,
lead company in the Amraam sister-programme. In September 1990 BAe was
poised to be told to go ahead when the MoD decided to open the programme to
competition.
That led to further delay. In the meantime, attempts to hold the US Defense
Department to the original agreement under which it would be committed to
buying the European-development short-range missile were becoming futile.
The MoD 'invitation to tender', a 7lb document, was issued last April. Bids
were submitted in August, and 'best and final' offers presented by January
30.
Ranged against the original Asraam are a proposal by GEC-Marconi and Matra,
based on the French Mica missile, and an upgraded version of the Sidewinder,
proposed by none other than BAe's former partner, BGT. The US manufacturer
Raytheon was reported to want to enter its own improved Sidewinder, but did
not submit a bid.
Both BAe and GEC-Marconi argue that even an updated Sidewinder would fall
short of the requirements for the RAF's European Fighter Aircraft, due to
come into service in the late 1990s. But a cheap new version of the US
missile would be a strong competitor in export markets.
BAe is worried not only about its competitors but also about possible
further delay. Its funding from the MoD dried up two years ago. It says it
desperately needs a firm UK contract in order to start marketing Asraam in
the US.
BAe estimates a potential worldwide market of more than 30,000 missiles,
worth at least Pounds 5bn, out of total estimated requirement for Sidewinder
replacements of 85,000 units.
The initial contract, however, is likely to be much smaller than was once
anticipated. When there were four partner countries in Asraam their
requirements were put at 10,000 missiles. It is understood that the
quantities for which companies were asked to bid were scaled down from
between 2,000 and 4,500 missiles to a range of 1,000 to 3,500. BAe says that
even 1,000 missiles are a worthwhile proposition.
Both BAe and GEC-Marconi say their missiles would be mostly British-made -
80 per cent for BAe's Asraam, in spite of having a Hughes Aircraft seeker
system and a warhead from Germany's Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, and 70 per
cent in the case of the Franco-British proposal.
Several other British companies have a lot at stake on Asraam - notably
Thorn EMI, maker of the missile's infrared proximity fuze.
'This is the only guided weapon we see coming in the next five years,' said
Thorn. It has a 'unique UK capability' in fuze technology, and will have to
make redundancies if it loses the Asraam programme. 'If in 10 years the MoD
came back and wanted another guided weapon fuze, we would not be able to do
it.'

FT  17 FEB 92 / Hitachi enters white-goods market

<TEXT>
HOOVER is to sell washing machines to Hitachi for marketing under the
Japanese company's name.
This is the first step into the white-goods market for Hitachi and will
cause tremors in an industry which is suffering from considerable oversupply
and falling demand.
In an allied move Hoover is to reorganise production in Britain and is
closing its distribution depot in Bolton, Greater Manchester, with the loss
of about 250 jobs. It will concentrate distribution at its new Pounds 14m
centre in Merthyr Tydfil, opened last autumn.
Hoover, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maytag of the US, is to move production
of motors for washing machines and dishwashers from Cambuslang, near
Glasgow, to the white-goods lines in Merthyr. The company is spending an
estimated Pounds 4m a year on fuel to transport units to Wales. Mr Bill
Foust, managing director of Hoover UK, would not comment on the plans, which
are being discussed with unions.
Hitachi has a television production plant at Aberdare, four miles from
Hoover's plant in Merthyr.
The moves are expected to add about 200 to 250 to Hoover's workforce in
Merthyr. Some jobs will be lost in Cambuslang, but Hoover intends to
continue production there of motors for upright vacuum cleaners.
Hoover's Merthyr works - it once employed more than 5,000 but the workforce
is down to fewer than 1,300 - has troubled successive owners.
Performance at the factory has improved recently. Mr Foust said last month
that productivity rose 44 per cent last year.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Toshiba plant to make air conditioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOSHIBA has opened the first Japanese-owned factory in the UK to produce
air-conditioning units. The move is part of a plan to to expand the
company's presence in the relatively untapped European market.
A former Toshiba microwave plant in Plymouth has been converted and extended
at a cost of Pounds 10m. The Plymouth plant is Toshiba's first
air-conditioning unit factory outside Japan.
The plant is likely to intensify competition in the UK market for commercial
air conditioners.
Sales in the sector have fallen about 25 per cent in the past year because
of the effect of the recession on construction and retailing.
The move could also increase Japanese dominance of the market for small and
medium-sized air conditioners. Five Japanese companies including Toshiba
have captured between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of the UK market in small
to medium-sized air conditioners in the past 20 years.
Employment at the Ply-mouth plant is expected to rise from the current 135
to 220 when full production is reached early next year.
The plant will then be capable of producing 25,000 units a year of various
sizes, worth Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m. About half of production will be
exported.
Toshiba, with Japanese companies in other manufacturing sectors, wants to
secure its position ahead of the European single-market reforms.
EC tariffs on imported Japanese air conditioners are about 5 per cent, and
the Japanese want to anticipate any pressure from European producers for an
increase.
The compressors and controllers for the units produced at Plymouth will be
imported from Japan. The aim is to double the local or EC-produced content
from 30 per cent to 60 per cent by January.
Mr George Williams, managing director of Toshiba's UK audio-visual and
air-conditioner division, said he expected the plant to be trading
profitably by next year.
Japanese air-conditioning equipment producers are attracted to Europe by its
long-term growth potential. The use of air conditioning in the UK commercial
sector is much lower than in Japan.
Toshiba hopes full production at Plymouth will coincide with an upturn in
demand in the UK and Europe.
Its UK sales have fallen only about 5 per cent in the past year, thanks to
strong technology and targeting of the few remaining buoyant market niches.
UK air conditioning unit sales prospered between 1982 to 1990 because of the
high level of shop refurbishments, but the fall in high-street spending has
hit most refurbishment programmes.

FT  17 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Rover deal on work changes likely
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP is expected to conclude a deal with unions today on radical
changes in working and bargaining practices. They will include the
introduction of single status for all employees and a 'jobs for life'
agreement which commits the company to avoiding compulsory redundancies.
Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union and the
main union negotiator, said yesterday that there were a few details to be
agreed today. But, after several weeks of plant-level consultations,
agreement was now 'a strong possibility'. The unions have already agreed in
principle to single-table bargaining in which all the blue-collar and
white-collar unions would negotiate together. That eases the way to a single
set of conditions for all workers and probably means that hourly paid
workers would no longer have to clock on.
It would also bring a single-status sick pay scheme and salaried status for
all employees.
Agreement in principle has been reached on setting up machinery to allow
disputes to be referred to binding arbitration if both sides agree to it.
Leaders of manual unions are now expected to accept company flexibility
proposals which originally said that 'full flexibility related to work
procedure and between jobs, areas and all categories of employees will be
the norm'.
Rover's push for change and adoption of some aspects of Japanese-style
industrial relations, have been prompted by increased competition from
Japanese carmakers in the UK.

FT  17 FEB 92 / More Japanese banks in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of Japanese banks in London has overtaken the total of US banks,
according to a survey of foreign bank offices.
Noel Alexander Associates, the banking consultancy, says that at the end of
last year there were 49 US banks in London compared with 54 Japanese banks.
The number of US banks in London has been declining steadily since 1982,
when there were 77.
In all, 31 foreign banks set up offices in London last year, while 15 left.
This contrasts with a net loss of four foreign banks in 1990.

NATIONAL SAVINGS increased by a net Pounds 334.7m last month, the largest
net rise since February 1987, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. The increase
follows an advertising campaign by National Savings,
The largest contribution came from fixed-interest savings certificates, with
a net Pounds 98.8m from gross receipts of Pounds 230.2m. The net addition
from index-linked savings certificates was Pounds 80.4m from gross receipts
of Pounds 112.7m.
The accrued interest in January was Pounds 160.9m, of which Pounds 101.3m
was paid, leaving a net addition of Pounds 60.6m. The total invested in
National Savings at the end of January rose to Pounds 38.9bn.

FT  17 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Barclays moves on pay penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK has offered to delay until next year plans for withholding pay
rises from staff whose work the bank thinks is unsatisfactory.
The offer is part of an effort to win support for one of the lowest proposed
pay deals for several years among the big four banks.
In talks with union leaders last week Barclays raised the amount of money on
offer in its original proposals tabled in December. Rises for the
non-managerial staff covered by the proposed deal will range from Pounds 230
to Pounds 535 a year against the previous Pounds 200 to Pounds 470 a year.
Barclays Group Staff Union estimates that this translates into rises of
between 2.5 per cent at the top of the scale to 4 per cent at the bottom.
The Barclays talks will have an influence on pay negotiations in many
financial services companies. They might even have a more general effect on
white-collar pay, which has been held up in recent years by generous rises
in the financial sector and may might now be pushed down by very low rises.
Lloyds Bank has settled its 1992 pay negotiations with one of the two unions
with which it deals. The 4 per cent offer there will probably prove
unusually high for the sector because it was made in part to settle a
separate dispute over pay restructuring.
In its latest offer, Barclays told staff it could ill afford to increase
costs in current economic circumstances. The staff union is balloting its
members on the revised offer.
A survey of 100 companies by Industrial Relations Services, the pay research
group, shows that more than half have a formal policy on smoking
restrictions and a further third have informal restrictions. Two fifths of
the companies have banned smoking in shared or open-plan offices and just
under two thirds provide employees with access to designated smoking areas.

FT  17 FEB 92 / High-tech blitz on crime against business: Police cameras on
the ground and in a helicopter will monitor industrial sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HELICOPTER-MOUNTED television camera, hydraulic barriers outside shops to
deter ram-raiders and the use of a computerised geographical information
system to analyse and predict crime are among measures proposed to reduce
the highest crime rate in the country.
Encrypted radios, infra-red detection equipment on a police helicopter and
the installation of closed-circuit television systems to monitor urban
centres and industrial areas are also proposed by the Northumbria police
force in a submission to the Home Office.
Mr John Stevens, chief constable of the Northumbria force, which covers Tyne
and Wear and Northumberland, said the force's area had the country's highest
crime rate per 1,000 population and per police officer.
The government has chosen Northumbria, Merseyside and West Yorkshire police
forces for its one-year Urban Crime Fund experiment, to start in April. Each
will receive about Pounds 3.6m for innovative measures involving local
communities in the fight against urban crime.
Mr Stevens who became chief constable after last September's riots in North
Shields and Newcastle upon Tyne, has pledged to make crime against business
a priority in his use of the urban fund money, to which the Northumbria
police authority is adding Pounds 1.2m.
'Business confidence has been affected by the riots and the amount of
crime,' he said last week at a Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce seminar in
Newcastle.
He expects the private sector to help pay for closed-circuit television
(CCTV) in Newcastle city centre and North Shields.
He also plans to extend a Business Watch project in which co-ordinated
security on a Gateshead industrial estate, paid for by local companies, has
reduced burglaries.
Northumbria police believe the new, virtually crime-free Newcastle Business
Park, where the management charge covers CCTV, is a model of how to tackle
crime. Mr Stevens also plans a registration scheme for pub and club doormen.
His Urban Crime Fund proposals for Northumbria ally high technology to a
heightened police presence on problem housing estates where, he says, a hard
core of criminals are respected and emulated. Officers will target known
offenders, protect witnesses and stamp on harassment of local people and of
police officers and their families.
He proposes a 'drop-in' centre on one Sunderland estate, where police could
'interact' with residents. He has also recommended rewards for information.
The 3,500-strong Northumbria force has been pressing for extra manpower
since budget problems forced a cut of 116 officers this year. In November
last year the Home Office granted 27 extra posts, but the authority is
bidding for 80 more officers in 1992-93. Mr Stevens has switched many
officers to patrol duties, and under his crime-fund plans recruitment of
civilians will free a further 65 officers for front-line work.
Crime has been estimated to cost businesses nationally between Pounds 5bn
and Pounds 10bn a year, according to the Confederation of British Industry
and Crime Concern, a crime-prevention charity set up by the Home Office.
There is concern in Tyne and Wear that crime may deter investment and
job-creation. Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce,
said: 'Anything which disrupts performance or endangers business survival
and confidence has to be tackled.'

FT  17 FEB 92 / Lilley cautious over Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Lilley, trade and industry secretary, indicated yesterday that he
does not intend to impose reform on Lloyd's in spite of the political storm
over allegations of malpractice at the insurance market.
About 25 MPs will today press for action to restore confidence in the
regulatory system at a lunch hosted by Lloyd's. One Tory MP said yesterday
that Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, was a 'public relations disaster'
in spite of his strengths as an underwriter.
Suggestions that Lloyd's activities were being seriously disrupted as
members threatened legal action were dismissed as 'evident nonsense' by Mr
Alan Lord, chief executive.
The row follows allegations by Labour MPs last week. These included claims
that working Names were given preferential access to better-performing
syndicates - an allegation dismissed by Lloyd's. Names are the individuals
whose assets provide Lloyd's capital.
Mr Lilley, speaking on TV-am, said such allegations could be referred to
Lloyd's regulators, to the Serious Fraud Office or to the courts. All those
paths should be explored 'before we have to consider whether there's any
change in the legal structure that is required'.
He added: 'We are obviously keeping under close review - as we do - that
market and financial markets generally.'
Mr Richard Page, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry
committee, said the government was right to give Lloyd's time to reform
itself. 'But the proviso is that they have got to get on and do it . . .
Time delays increase the pressure on the government to take some action,' he
said.
Mr Lord said it was not true that Lloyd's was running out of money.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Clothes retailers show pressure on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST CLOTHING retailers are making little or no profit in the highly
competitive UK market, according to a report by Verdict, the retail
consultancy.
The sector had its third consecutive year of sales decline in real terms
last year. Sales rose 0.7 per cent to Pounds 17.3bn - but fell 1.2 per cent
in real terms.
The effects of weak demand have been exacerbated by rising costs, widespread
discounting and overcapacity.
Verdict estimates that clothing sales space has grown by 25 per cent since
1982 but says many big retailers, such as Burton Group, Next and Sears, have
reduced their outlets.
Sales of specialist retailers fell faster than the market average last year,
with mail-order companies and market stalls reversing the trend of and
recovering market share.
Even Marks and Spencer, by far the biggest clothing retailer, lost market
share last year. Its 15.4 per cent share was 0.1 percentage points lower
than in the previous year.
The report says, however, Marks and Spencer has been better able to defend
its margins because of its low cost-base, buying power and refusal to
indulge in widespread discounting.
The report suggests it is no coincidence that three of the
strongest-performing clothing retailers - Littlewoods, C&amp;A, and River Island
 -are all private companies, which have similarly been able to adopt
longer-term trading strategies during the current downturn.

FT  17 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Most settlements in January below 5%,
IDS study shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PAY settlements in January have fallen below the 'psychological
barrier' of 5 per cent, making it unlikely that rising real incomes will
help end the recession, according to a report by Incomes Data Services, the
pay analyst.
The IDS findings tally with the latest manufacturing pay estimates by the
Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation.
The CBI says that average settlements in the final quarter of last year
dipped to 4.1 per cent, the current rate of inflation. The federation says
that in December the settlement average was 4 per cent.
IDS says: 'Until recently the 5 per cent level tended to be a floor for pay
rises. Throughout the 1980s, even when inflation dropped to 2.4 per cent in
the summer of 1986, few pay deals gave increases of less than 5 per cent.'
The IDS data show that three quarters of deals in January were between 4 per
cent and 5.9 per cent. But 'a growing number' were worth 3 per cent to 3.9
per cent.
A comparison with the beginning of last year shows that pay rises have in
effect been halved. In January last year, with 9 per cent inflation, most
settlements were in the range 8 per cent to 11 per cent. In January this
year, when inflation was at 4.5 per cent, the majority of settlements were
in the 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent range.
Average earnings continued to rise at 7.25 per cent in December. The CBI
says that settlements in service industries were running at an average of
6.1 per cent in the last quarter of last year. With much lower rises in the
finance and insurance sector, however, the average level of settlements in
the services sector could also start to fall.

FT  17 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): ILO is criticised for being 'moribund'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORK of the International Labour Organisation, founded in 1919 to
establish an international code of workers rights, 'looks positively
moribund' compared with the European Community's Social Charter, according
to an analysis published today.
Professor Keith Ewing, professor of public law at King's College, University
of London, says in the new London-based magazine International Union Rights,
that the ILO's attempts to create an international code of rights 'have to
some extent run into the sands'.
He says: 'Although worldwide labour is on the defensive, very few really
significant conventions (ILO rulings) emerged in the 1980s to add to the
code.'
He adds that many of the most significant conventions have never been
ratified by some countries.
The US, for example, has never ratified conventions 87 on freedom of
association and 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining. But
even where conventions have been ratified, the ILO has no way of forcing
governments to comply with their terms. 'The problems here have become acute
as more countries have chosen to deregulate labour law as a means of helping
to prevent further economic decline.'
The UK government has been repeatedly found in breach of convention 87 over
the banning of unions from the Government Communications Headquarters
(GCHQ).
'It has refused to comply and there is nothing that can be done to compel it
to do so,' says Prof Ewing.
According to the Trades Union Congress the British government will this year
receive the worst possible reprimand the ILO can deliver, a special mention
at the organisation's annual conference for 'grave and persistent' violation
of conventions.
Prof Ewing believes that the ILO should not be written off, adding that,
while the ILO condemned banning unions at GCHQ, the European Commission on
Human Rights did not. He also says that the ILO was an inspiration for those
drafting the EC Social Charter. But he concludes that a 'stronger
organisation is required with a greater influence on the nations throughout
the world'.

FT  17 FEB 92 / University research income increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH AND contract income generated by British universities is growing at
more than Pounds 100m a year, but their student-staff ratio is worsening,
according to figures published today by the Universities Statistical Record
(USR).
Between 1988-89 and 1989-90 universities' total income from research grants
and contracts grew by 20 per cent, from Pounds 629m to Pounds 752m.
Of that sum, income from overseas organisations - including the European
Community - increased by one third, with funds from research councils rising
23 per cent and those from UK-based charitable bodies increasing 18 per
cent.
Over the same year universities' total revenue grew by 14 per cent, from
Pounds 3.41bn to Pounds 3.89bn. Almost half came from direct government
grants, with 14 per cent from student fees and support grants, 7 per cent
from research councils and a similar proportion from residences and
catering.
Student numbers increased by 6 per cent over the year to 382,000, but the
number of full-time academic and academic-related staff grew only 3.7 per
cent, to 58,480 - evidence of a progressive increase in the student-staff
ratio, now about 12:1.
The USR also reports strong growth in continuing education. It says the
number of courses and student enrolments rose by more than 40 per cent in
the five years to 1990.

FT  17 FEB 92 / School funding move attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR alleged yesterday that the Pounds 25m allocated by the government for
improving technology facilities in state schools has become a further unfair
subsidy for schools that have opted out of local authority control.
The Department of Education has announced that 20 per cent of the Pounds 25m
intended for 1992-93 will go to the opted-out, or grant-maintained sector,
which contains only 3.5 per cent of secondary schools.
Such schools already receive favourable capital funding allocations from the
government. They also benefit from a funding formula which obliges local
education authorities to top up the schools' budgets by an extra 16 per
cent. That is intended to meet administration costs no longer provided by
the local authority, and is fixed irrespective of the costs incurred.
In the approach to the election the latest figures will fuel controversy
that the government is seeking to 'bribe' schools to break free from local
authorities.
Mr Derek Fatchett, a Labour education spokesman, said: 'These figures
illustrate the government's double standards in education. We need to
improve resources for technology teaching, but there can be no justification
for giving nearly seven times as much to children in grant-maintained
schools.'
In recent reports on school technology teaching school inspectors criticised
standards.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Labour sees recession as its election winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR leadership yesterday insisted that the recession would win the
general election for the party, in spite of weekend opinion polls showing it
neck and neck with the Tories.
Senior Labour spokesmen refused to appear disappointed by the opinion polls
carried out late last week. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, said the party's
current level of support was 'a very good platform from which to work.'
The economy has become the central part of Labour's campaign. Mr John Smith,
the shadow chancellor, is expected to use reports of Treasury briefing
papers arguing that Britain should not pay more to the European Community
because of its lower relative prosperity to fuel further attacks on economic
mismanagement by the government.
Senior Tories expressed relief yesterday, however, that Labour had failed to
establish a lead in spite of the gloomy economic statistics. Both Labour and
the Conservatives are anxious to ensure that their opponents do not manage
to pull away in the opinion polls and begin an unstoppable 'bandwagon'
effect.
The Harris poll for the Observer, conducted last Wednesday and Thursday, put
Labour on 40 per cent and the Tories on 39 per cent. An ICM poll for the
Sunday Express, carried out after Thursday's sharp rise in unemployment
figures, put Labour on 39 per cent and the Conservatives on 40 per cent.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday retaliated by saying that lower
inflation and mortgage interest rates were boosting real incomes. Mr Norman
Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, urged Mr Major to concentrate on
Conservative strengths such as the economy, defence and foreign affairs and
pledge to cut taxes. He should not worry about pleasing all voters, Mr
Tebbit said on BBC television. 'What he wants is that extra 2 or 3 per cent
above what he's got now. One has to upset some people.'
Meanwhile, Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour foreign affairs spokesman, said private
Labour polls showed the party 'has been substantially ahead for months'.
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, blamed the Tories' US-style
'negative campaigning' for his party's failure to establish a convincing
lead. It was 'the reaction of a Tory party on the verge of defeat'.
He said on London Weekend Television: 'We will catch up, overtake and move
further forward in the weeks ahead as the true horror of the recession . . .
sinks into the public mind.'

<TEXT>
FEWER small and medium-sized companies are optimistic about commercial
prospects than three months ago, according to a survey by 3i, the venture
capital group, Peter Marsh writes.
The study supports indications that business confidence has fallen recently,
although it says the ingredients for a recovery are in place.
According to the survey of 1,000 companies in which 3i has a financial
stake, 45 per cent expect sales to improve over the next three months. The
proportion was 49 per cent in the autumn survey.
Confidence appears to be higher in the south and Midlands than in the north,
with service companies having a rosier view than those in manufacturing.
Staniland Hall, a business research company, forecasts a 1.9 per cent
increase in consumer spending this year, exactly balancing the fall last
year. It says it is 'cautiously confident' of a general economic upturn.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Cook to spell out proposals for health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will set out this week its alternative to the government's
fund-holding scheme for GP's as part of a package of proposals for modifying
 -but not reversing - the government's health service reforms.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, will set out Labour's plans later
this week after a further attack today on the government for 'privatising'
the National Health Service.
Under Labour's plans hospitals which have converted to trust status would be
returned to the control of local health authorities. An incoming government
would also introduce a scheme of incentive payments for hospitals that
increase efficiency and treat more patients.
A senior party official accepted yesterday that the long-awaited policy
package would 'not tear up' the changes to the NHS made by the government -
including the creation of trusts and GP fundholding. Nevertheless, they
represented 'pretty substantial revisions' aimed at improving patient care.
Labour will stress the choice between tax cuts under the Conservatives or
investment in the health service and education under Labour.
Last night Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, said Labour had 'tried
to produce policies which look and sound different but to achieve the same
ends' as the government. He said they would 'impose a totally unnecessary
upheaval on the NHS just at the time when the new system is starting to
deliver real improvements'.
Labour is expected to say how GPs would be given opportunities to
participate in decision-making at a local level but would no longer be able
to buy individual treatments for their patients.
The Liberal Democrats will unveil their health policy today, including
proposals for abolishing the fund-holding scheme while still giving GPs some
freedom in choosing where patients should be treated.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Tories to pledge inner-cities agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES are to give an election pledge to set up a new development
agency to oversee the regeneration of England's crumbling inner cities.
But the plan being urged by Mr Michael Heseltine, envi-ronment secretary,
will fall short of the creation of the agency which he has long sought as a
vehicle to create new public-private sector partnerships in deprived areas.
Senior ministers said yesterday there was broad agreement in the cabinet
that the manifesto should give new focus to efforts to rebuild the inner
cities.
The general view among ministers is that, in spite of the substantial sums
spent on urban programmes, the government is widely seen as indifferent to
the plight of inner cities. Mr Heseltine is also anxious to find a suitable
umbrella organisation to oversee his plans for extensive new development
along the east Thames corridor.
The new agency would take charge of the urban programme and of the 10 urban
development corporations in England. The implication is that it would
receive substantial additional funding, although the Treasury insists that
there can be no commitments beyond those allowed in present spending plans.
On present plans it would continue to operate under the sponsorship of the
Department of the Environment, although there are suggestions that if Mr
Heseltine moved after the election, the responsibility might be transferred
with him.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Government 'gave up' Pounds 2.3bn of water privatisation
proceeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL Audit Office report on the privatisation of the 10 water
companies in England and Wales sparked off a political row at the weekend.
Labour claimed the report showed that, in its haste to sell off the
companies, the government gave up Pounds 2.3bn of potential proceeds.
Labour also demanded an explanation of apparent 'collusion' on the drafting
of the report between the Department of the Environment and the Audit
Office, the independent public-expenditure watchdog.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow environment minister, said the report showed 'water
privatisation cost the taxpayer billions of pounds', and that that there was
no proper planning or timetable. A Labour government would take the water
industry back into public ownership, she added.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, agreed that the water
privatisation had been hurried. That was 'because we were so keen to get the
rising levels of investment and environmental enhancement that privatisation
has produced'.
The report showed that in mid 1989 the Department of the Environment was
looking for net proceeds of Pounds 5.7bn from the water sale. But when the
sale took place in December that year, it yielded net proceeds of only
Pounds 3.6bn. The primary reason for this was that the government, having
envisaged giving the companies a Pounds 435m cash injection, ultimately made
one of Pounds 1.5bn.
A decision to increase the sum was made after meetings between Mr Michael
Howard, then an environment minister, and the company chairmen at the end of
July.
Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office, says in his report that
the department's original calculations of the possible proceeds were based
on 'hypothetical assumptions and were not seen as achievable in practice.'
Mrs Taylor said she would be demanding an explanation about suggestions at
the weekend that the Environment Department was closely involved in drafting
the audit office's report.
'The audit office is a body which claims to be totally independent of
government,' she said.
'The apparent collusion between the audit office and the government gives
considerable cause for concern, which is further heightened by the release
of the report on a Saturday, the first time ever the office has released a
report on a weekend.'

FT  17 FEB 92 / Boost seen for liability insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS and senior managers of UK companies are becoming more aware of
their potential personal legal liabilities when their businesses go wrong,
according to a survey published today by Wyatt Company, management
consultants.
The survey shows a sharp increase in the use of directors and officers (D&amp;O)
insurance, policies which cover directors and officers or senior managers
for the cost of legal awards made against them.
Wyatt, on the basis of a questionnaire sent to 109 companies, found that 62
per cent of industrial companies have D&amp;O cover compared with 26 per cent in
1989. One in four financial-sector companies also have coverage, against 17
per cent in 1989.
Mr Pierre Laurin, a director of Wyatt, said awareness had been assisted by
recent high-profile cases, including a number in which directors had been
found liable under the Insolvency Act 1986 for breach of fiduciary duties.

FT  17 FEB 92 / BR sell-off plans face further delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET ministers are preparing the ground for a further delay in
publication of plans for the privatisation of British Rail. The government
had previously hoped to release details before the general election.
Clashes between ministers over how the rail network should be restructured
seem unlikely to be resolved in time for a white paper before April 9 - the
most likely election date.
A senior minister said yesterday that the imminence of the election was
likely to mean that only broad proposals would appear in the Conservative
manifesto. The white paper would follow if the Tories were re-elected.
That would be at least the third delay for the white paper. When Mr John
Major, the prime minister, unveiled his Citizen's Charter last summer the
white paper was promised by the end of last year. This was subsequently
delayed until January and then to before the election.
The dispute has been caused by Mr Major's preference for reviving the
pre-war regional railway companies. This conflicts with the determination of
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, to keep intact the InterCity
service.
Mr Rifkind had hoped for agreement on a compromise that would have kept
InterCity in one piece and sold to a private operator, but with new regional
companies being able to run services on BR tracks.

OMAN announced yesterday that a domestic bank has taken over the local
operations of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI), allowing all BCCI depositors in the sultanate to be repaid in full,
AP-DJ reports from Manama.
The central bank of Oman said BCCI's local assets and liabilities had been
transferred to Bank Dhofar al-Omani al-Fransi.
'By this action the Sultanate of Oman becomes one of the first countries in
the world where (BCCI) depositors and creditors will receive their funds
without any deductions, notwithstanding the deficit in the balance sheet
which resulted from mismanagement abroad,' the central bank said in a
statement.
Banking sources said Oman will inject OR19m (Pounds 26.9m) into the merged
institution to cover the shortfall.
Oman shut down BCCI's local branches on July 5, soon after the Bank of
England and other regulators seized the bank amid allegations of widespread
fraud.
The Abu Dhabi government owns a majority stake in BCCI and is currently
involved in negotiations to liquidate the bank and provide partial
compensation for depositors.
BCCI Oman had a loan book totalling OR44m and deposits of OR57m, which will
all now be assumed by Bank Dhofar, according to the bank's general manager,
Mr Noreddin Nahawi.
He said Bank Dhofar had boosted its paid-up capital by OR10m to OR15m ahead
of the merger.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Further reductions in corporate tax pledged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN industrialists have been promised a second round of corporate tax
cuts before the end of the year, after criticising last week's government
tax reforms as inadequate to improve competitiveness, writes Quentin Peel.
At the same time they stepped up at the weekend their campaign calling for
further substantial tax cuts, and warning of the dangers of big increases in
the current round of wage negotiations.
Both the federation of German industry (BDI) and Mr Jurgen Mollemann,
economics minister, agreed in separate statements that top marginal rates of
both corporate and income tax should be cut to 46 per cent, from 50 and 53
per cent respectively.
However, while Mr Mollemann promised a second round of tax reforms this
year, the industrialists voiced doubts that it would be possible, given the
strain on the state budget.
The BDI issued a sharp critique of the tax package approved on Friday in the
Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, in spite of government
jubilation at having split the Social Democrat opposition when forcing the
bill through a months-long negotiating procedure.
By offering German states, especially the five in former East Germany, a
significant transfer of tax revenues, including the entire benefit of an
increase in value added tax from 14 to 15 per cent next year, the central
government had left itself no further room for tax reform manoeuvre, the BDI
said.
The package - which would originally have given the business sector overall
cuts of about DM7.4bn (Pounds 2.57bn) through increased thresholds for
business property tax and tax on trade earnings, and the abolition of
trading capital tax - was watered down to a net gain of only DM4.4bn in
negotiations.
The trading capital tax will now be retained.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, sees no compelling motivations
at the moment to either raise or lower German interest rates, according to
an interview published in Der Spiegel, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt.
He also admits in the German magazine article that the Bundesbank's
middle-range goal of a 2 per cent inflation rate will not be reached this
year. However it was possible that the rate could show a '3 before the
decimal point' if certain conditions were met.

ONE of two rival parliaments in the Serbian enclave of Krajina voted
yesterday to oust Mr Milan Babic, the president, over his opposition to a UN
peace plan, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
About half the deputies in Krajina's parliament met in the Serb-controlled
town of Glina, central Croatia, and voted to oust the enclave's government.
The move was apparently directed by Serbia, which has politically
marginalised Mr Babic over his opposition to the UN initiative.
Mr Babic denounced the decision as illegal and said he had 'no intention of
stepping down'.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Vukovar adapts to post-war 'normality': Neither Serbs nor
Croats are yet committed to the city's renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE in Vukovar, scene of the worst fighting during the seven-month war in
the breakaway republic of Croatia, is returning to normal. That is according
to Serbia's state-run media.
In the streets, the picture is different. The federal army has cleared the
corpses from the streets. It has bulldozed away the rubble left by the war.
But the charred skeletons of buildings bear testimony to last year's
three-month-long battle for control of Vukovar between Serb irregulars
backed by the Yugoslav army and the Croat national guard.
Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, has promised to help rebuild
this city. Serbian news reports boast of progress in the renovation of
Vukovar, currently under federal army control. But neither Serbia nor
Croatia will commit themselves to rebuilding Vukovar, set on the banks of
the River Danube in the contested fertile plains of eastern Croatia, until
the question of borders is settled.
Not a single structure in the city centre escaped damage. The trees are
blackened by battle. The altar of the Catholic church stands at a bizarre
angle. The rest of the building has crumbled under grenades.
An army officer married a local Vukovar bride at the weekend in the Serbian
Orthodox church. The priest says a bomb planted in the church last November
tore away the roof and destroyed all but one of the 250-year-old frescoes.
'I have lost everything. All I own are the clothes on my back' says Mr Jovan
Njegic, weeping in the church. Mr Njegic, a 63-year old retired accountant
who is a Serb, says: 'Before the troubles started, we never asked about
people's nationality. Now there there is no one left to ask.'
His wife, a Croat, fled to Croatia last autumn. Two of his three children,
who married Croats, have abandoned the town fearing reprisals by Serb
fighters who seized control of the local government. One of Mr Njegic's
sons, an architect, remained to help in the rebuilding of Vukovar. But the
buildings which can be restored, even if funds were available, are a tiny
minority.
The people who have remained in Vukovar have nowhere else to go. Mr Zeljko
Vicetic, a former factory worker now a policeman, is clearing out refuse,
the destroyed belongings of the former tenant. Mr Vicetic, a Serb, says the
local government gave him permission to restore the flat for his aunt. The
fate of Mr Andrija Sabosos, a Croat who used to occupy the flat is unknown.
'He is either dead or in prison. He was Ustashe,' says Mr Vicetic, referring
to the brutal Croat fascist regime during the Second World War.
From his swaying balcony the once-pretty view is one of ruin. Next door, Mrs
Marija Lukic, a 51-year-old Croat factory worker, says: 'During the fighting
I huddled in my fourth-floor flat with my Serbian neighbours. I told my
children to leave, that my fate was to protect the little we had.'
Mrs Lukic, who was seriously wounded when mortars shattered the walls of her
flat, just one week before Vukovar fell to the army on November 18, is
uncertain about her future. The fighting destroyed the Borovo rubber factory
where she was employed. She receives no benefits from Croatia or Serbia. She
and the few thousand people who have returned to Vukovar survive on handouts
from the army.
They take their meals at the local barracks, which despite claims of a Croat
siege were barely damaged during the fighting. Army check points at every
village leading to Vukovar require inhabitants to show a special pass.
Many of Vukovar's inhabitants appear to welcome the arrival of the UN
peacekeepers who will replace the army. But they are clearly unaware of the
terms of the UN plan. Uncertain about a life under UN protection, they say
the peacekeepers should not be stationed in Vukovar.
But most people do not leave Vukovar. Mr Njegic says he has no money to
travel anywhere. Waiting for help, he will remain amid the ghosts of a once
harmonious population. He says: 'No one will give any real aid until they
decide who Vukovar belongs to.'

FT  17 FEB 92 / Exploding some 1980s 'unemployment' myths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING unemployment rates in the US and across Europe are injecting a new
urgency into the search for effective policies to help the unemployed return
to work when these economies eventually recover. That makes now a good time
to expose the fallacies which underpin one supposed cure for the problem of
long-term joblessness: limiting the period that the unemployed can claim
unemployment benefit.
The latest proponents of this view are Professor Richard Layard and Dr John
Philpott of the London-based Employment Institute. In a recent booklet
entitled Stopping Unemployment, they argue that unemployment benefits should
be limited to a maximum of 12 months, and combined with extensive
counselling and retraining. Their policy recommendations are based on two
pieces of evidence: first, that those countries which restrict the duration
of unemployment benefit, in particular the US and Sweden, have not suffered
from persistent long-term unemployment in the 1980s; and second, that the UK
government's Restart programme, which since 1986 has required every
unemployed person to attend regular interviews to ensure they are 'actively
seeking work', has encouraged many of the long-term unemployed to return to
work.
At first sight the evidence does appear to support Layard and Philpott's
conclusions. The US and UK unemployment records are tracked in the top two
diagrams, which show the relationship between available job vacancies and
the adult male unemployment rate in each year between 1970 and 1990. US
unemployment tended to rise in recessions, when vacancies were low, and fell
back as vacancies recovered. But in the UK in the early 1980s this downward
sloping curve appeared to shift to the right. Vacancies rose yet
unemployment remained stuck above 10 per cent. Only after 1986 did
unemployment fall rapidly. So limiting the availability of unemployment
benefits does appear to sharpen the incentives for the unemployed to apply
for vacant jobs.
Yet a closer look at the evidence suggests a different conclusion. The
problem is that the OECD's unemployment rates only tell half the story and
are thus a misleading way of measuring how much of the population is out of
work. They include only those people who are actively seeking work, thereby
excluding all those 'discouraged workers' who have stopped searching. A
better measure of joblessness is the non-employment rate, the percentage of
the population which is not in work regardless of whether they are looking
for work.
Measuring 'unemployment' using non-employment rates reveals that the UK has
not had more male joblessness than the US over past decade. Instead, as the
lower charts show, the UK has spent the last two decades catching up with
the US. By 1990 the US and UK had the same male non-employment rate. But the
US had a higher male non-employment rate over most of the last 20 years.
Similarly, Restart does not appear to have succeeded in helping the
long-term unemployed to return to work. While the UK unemployment rate
almost halved between 1986 and 1990, the non-employment rate fell by just
0.5 percentage points. Instead, the long-term unemployed have largely been
re-classified out of the unemployment statistics. Following their
interviews, many of them appeared to be claiming sickness and invalidity
benefit instead. In 1986, 900,000 men were claiming this benefit, just
50,000 higher than in 1980. But between 1986 and 1990 male recipients rose
by 25 per cent to 1.12m, while the number of women claimants more than
doubled.
Why does the US have so many more discouraged workers than the UK? One
reason might be the limited duration of US unemployment benefits. The US
long-term unemployed have no incentive to appear to be searching for work
and thus feature in the OECD's unemployment rate, whereas in the UK, where
benefits are only paid to active job-seekers, they do have such an
incentive. So while the duration of benefits does not appear to affect the
level of non-employment, it may well determine the distribution of the
non-employed between being classified as unemployed and economically
inactive.
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data
for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly
and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the
percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and
are positive unless otherwise stated.  The unemployment rate is shown as a
percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading
indicator are end-period values.

All series seasonally adjusted. Statistics for Germany apply only to
western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales
volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy
(value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales
except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department
stores only). Industrial production: data from national government
sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water
supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK
(also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD
standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different
definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate
indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian
employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US -
help wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France -
all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies.
Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of
series, cyclical fluctuations which usually precede cyclical
fluctuations in general economic activity.

Industries (IMI), one of the country's biggest state-owned weapons
exporters, and staged an angry demonstration outside Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's office to protest at plans for heavy lay-offs at the loss-making
company, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The one-day strike at IMI, best known for producing the Uzi sub-machine gun,
follows a steep decline in the fortunes of Israel's military manufacturers.
It is an uncomfortable sign for Mr Shamir's government, which faces a
general election in June, of growing unease at the level of unemployment -
at more than 10 per cent of the workforce.
Mr Shamir and Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, met the IMI workers'
leaders after some 7,000 demonstrators broke through police lines. The
ministers agreed to seek ways of preventing implementation of plans by IMI
to dismiss up to 1,500 of its 9,000-strong workforce.

DENMARK achieved a record DKr14.1bn (Pounds 1.27bn) surplus on the current
balance of payments in 1991, up from DKr8.1bn in 1990, which was the first
surplus for 27 years, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The 1991 surplus included a DKr51.5bn surplus on the balance of trade in
goods and services, about 6 per cent of the gross domestic product.
The country's strong external account and its low, 2.5 per cent inflation
rate are, however, associated with other less satisfactory developments.
Unemployment is higher than ever at a seasonally-adjusted 10.9 per cent in
December, while an expected recovery in growth last year failed to emerge.
Revised official GDP estimates for the first three quarters of 1991 indicate
an increase in real GDP of only about 0.2 per cent from the same period in
1990. The government expected a growth rate of about 1.7 per cent as
recently as December.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Musawi killing likely to promote Shia extremism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE killing of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the leader of the Lebanese Hizbollah, by
Israeli helicopter gunships yesterday is likely to favour the re-emergence
of more extreme elements in the Shia Moslem movement and destabilise the
fragile political consensus in Lebanon.
Sheikh Abbas, who acceded to the leadership of the 'Party of God' in May of
last year, presided over the Hizbollah through the denouement of the western
hostage crisis. Unlike his predecessor, Sheikh Sobhi Tofeili, he said the
hostage-taking had been a mistake.
In recent interviews he spoke of the possibility of participating in
mainstream Lebanese politics, even saying he could envisage the day when
Hizbollah would elect deputies to parliament and have cabinet ministers to
defend the interests of Lebanese Shia.
Only last month, Sheikh Abbas defused a crisis between the Lebanese army and
Hizbollah, personally visiting army officers in Tyre after pro-Israeli
Maronite Christian officers ordered the arrest of Hizbollah fighters during
a funeral service for guerrillas killed in southern Lebanon.
A soft-spoken cleric, born 38 years ago in the Bekaa Valley village of
Nabihsheet, Sheikh Abbas wore the black turban of a sayyid or descendant of
the prophet Mohamed. Like his mentor, Sheikh Mohamed Hussein Fadlallah, he
studied in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf, seat of Shia theology.
A photograph of Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani sat on the desk of his
office in Beirut's Bir-El-Abed district. Asked in a recent interview whether
it was true that Hizbollah had broken links with Hojatolislam Ali-Akbar
Mohtashemi, the former Iranian minister of the Interior who founded the
Lebanese movement, Sheikh Abbas responded: 'Our links are with the
government of Iran - not with individuals.'
Mr Rafsanjani's government negotiated the release of the last remaining
British and American hostages; Mohtashemi's parliamentary faction is known
to have opposed the resolution of the hostage crisis.
On the question of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and the
continued imprisonment of more than 200 Shia Moslems by Israel in Khiam
prison in southern Lebanon, Sheikh Abbas was implacable. He constantly
demanded the liberation of Sheikh Abdul-Karim Obeid, the Hizbollah cleric
who was kidnapped by Israeli troops in July 1989.
'Our hatred for Israel will never change,' he said. While the Lebanese
government disarmed other militias last year, he obtained a special status
for the Hizbollah by convincing the Lebanese and Syrian governments that
Hizbollah was a 'resistance movement' which could not be disbanded before
Israel ended its occupation of southern Lebanon.
Sheikh Abbas came close to claiming the October 1983 attacks against US
Marines and French paratroopers of the multinational force. 'The greatest
achievement of Hizbollah during this period was to evict the multinational
force from Lebanon,' he said.
Under Sheikh Abbas, Hizbollah improved its sometimes confrontational
relationship with Damascus, and Syria is certain to be enraged by his
murder. By encouraging the Hizbollah to attack the Israelis and their proxy
militia forces in southern Lebanon, the Syrians retained a valuable
bargaining card in their negotiations with Israel.
In the aftermath of Sheikh Abbas's death, Israel stands little chance of
retrieving the bodies of several servicemen still missing in Lebanon or of
obtaining the freedom of Israeli airman Ron Arad. Arad was captured by an
Amal militiaman when his aircraft was shot down over Sidon in 1985. When the
militiaman defected to the rival Hizbollah, he took his Israeli prisoner
with him.
Sheikh Abbas's killing can only worsen the security situation in Lebanon. A
leading member of Islamic Jihad, a Hizbollah offshoot, predicted last autumn
that attacks against western interests would resume if the Israelis
continued to kidnap Shias in southern Lebanon.
Six men were abducted by the Israelis from Sheikh Obeid's village of
Jibsheet last month, three of whom were later released. Sheikh Abbas Musawi
was a relative moderate in an extremist movement. His violent death will
provoke demands for revenge. And if the Hizbollah cannot attack the Israelis
directly, they may vent their rage on easier targets.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Perez firm on economy after attempted coup: Venezuelan
president predicts growing support for government reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Venezuelan president, Mr Carlos Andres Perez, sees no reason to
backtrack on economic reform because of an attempted military coup two weeks
ago and predicts support for his government will grow this year as the
benefits of reform become apparent.
Mr Perez said: 'We are at the point where the benefits are beginning to
percolate all sectors of the society.'
In an interview in his office in the battle-scarred Miraflores Palace, he
said: 'There is no reason to delay any privatisation.' The government
managed to complete a small hotel privatisation on February 5, the day after
the attempted putsch.
He said the coup was being planned before his administration came to power.
However, public opposition to the economic programme might have led the coup
leaders to believe that the climate was right to take over the government,
he said.
He admitted a lapse in the military intelligence system that failed to
detect the planning of the coup. His government might not have taken
sufficient notice of political opposition which had given the impression of
'immense discontent' in the country.
He had ordered a significant restructuring of the armed forces, affecting
not only personnel but also their general conditions. Officials close to the
armed forces have said the military has been granted a 30 per cent pay rise,
higher than the increase earlier planned.
Although only a minority of the army backed the attempted coup, with the air
force, navy and national guard remaining loyal, a deep investigation into
its causes was none the less necessary.
However, Mr Perez saw no need for a civilian defence minister in place of
the traditional military one, despite there being no constitutional obstacle
to such a change.
Mr Perez renewed a call for a mechanism that would allow international armed
intervention to restore democracy where a military coup had taken place.
This would be important in Latin America where 'military coups have been
frequent in history'.
On the economy, he predicted that as his economic programme's benefits
became more extensive, opposition to it from political parties would weaken.
'It will be difficult for the parties to deny this reality,' he said.
His economic policy has been opposed in the Venezuelan Congress, in
particular by his own Democratic Action party, throughout the three years of
his administration.
The president said that popular discontent over the programme was strongest,
not among the poor as has been widely depicted, but among the middle
classes. He admitted that this sector of society had suffered as a result of
his economic programme, but defended it as necessary.
Venezuela had been 'the most subsidised economy in the region', and an
economy which was 'almost completely artificial'.
He was pursuing a policy of 'rapprochement and dialogue' with the parties,
and had invited them to take part in the preparation of new social
programmes announced at the end of last year.
The government was on the verge of completing negotiations over loan
agreements with the World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank on a
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn), five-year social programme to improve health and
water supplies, education, child care and nutrition in poor areas.
He said corruption in government - a cause of widespread discontent - had
not been ended in Venezuela. But many measures taken by his administration
had 'eliminated the discretion of the government to define relations in the
commercial, industrial and economic life of the country'.
These included the abolition of preferential exchange rates, import
licensing and the introduction of a bidding process for public works.
He defended the decision, criticised widely inside and outside the country,
to censor the press in the days immediately after the coup attempt. This was
not meant to curb freedom of expression, but was taken for military reasons,
to prevent the spread of false information that could affect the morale of
the armed forces. Since then, leading journals have agreed to exercise
self-restraint and the curbs have been lifted.
The president said he was armed with a machine-gun as he made his escape
from Miraflores on February 4 to a television station. The coup attempt
began to collapse after his broadcast to the country.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Bank of Portugal attacks OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Portugal has dismissed Portuguese inflation forecasts made by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its
latest report on the economy as inaccurate and 'unhelpful'.
Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, bank governor, said the OECD's forecast of
10.5 per cent inflation for 1992 was 'clearly nonsense and imprudent' at a
time when the government is locked into conflict with public sector unions
over this year's annual pay awards.
'This will create problems internally. It is the net contribution of the
OECD in these negotiations and confused state of affairs,' he said.
The government hopes to keep inflation at 8 per cent this year, down from
11.4 per cent in 1991. Mr Tavares Moreira admitted it might be difficult to
meet that target, but said price rises would remain clearly below 9.5 per
cent this year. In line with its target, the government announced just over
a week ago that it was imposing an 8 per cent pay settlement for public
administration employees. This angered public sector trade unions which have
called a one-day national strike for tomorrow in protest.
Mr Tavares Moreira said it was likely the government would not be able to
reach a formal agreement with the unions over wages this year, but that no
agreement would be better than one allowing excessive wage rises.
He also criticised an OECD suggestion to allow the escudo to appreciate
freely against other currencies.
'We think this would be extremely dangerous for the economy and would
jeopardise restructuring efforts in many sectors. The OECD suggestion that
we should completely free the exchange rate is unacceptable and goes too
far.'

FT  17 FEB 92 / Tory jet charter points to April 9 election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE party managers have signed an agreement to charter a corporate
jet to carry the prime minister and his top aides between mid-March and
April 10, the firmest confirmation to date that the government is planning
an April 9 election.
The BAe 146 jet, an 80 to 100-seat medium-range aircraft, will carry Mr John
Major, and the entourage of journalists and television crews accompanying
him, around the country for the four-week campaign.
Details of the contract, including the name of the leasing company, remain
confidential both for security reasons and to mask the implications about
election timing. The contract can be cancelled if the opinion polls dissuade
Mr Major from calling an April election. The aircraft is due to be returned
on April 10, however, with the clear implication that the vote is expected
to be the day before.
While politicians of all parties have been convinced for some time that Mr
Major will call an election for April 9, until now there has been no
corroborating evidence from the parties' campaign plans.
Mr Major will not make his final decision until he has analysed the polls in
the week following the March 10 Budget. But most senior Tories now believe
that only disastrous opinion poll figures will stop him from calling an
early April ballot. In the interim, Tory campaign managers are now clearly
planning for an April 9 election. The contract for the jet charter will
almost certainly have included a significant cancellation clause, penalising
the lessees if they fail to take up their option.
Journalists wishing to travel with the prime minister during the campaign
have already been told that the deposit alone on a 'season ticket' has been
fixed at Pounds 3,000 and the final cost may be substantially higher.
At normal commercial rates, the rental of a BAe 146 would vary between
Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a day, depending on crewing, routing and
other factors. A lengthy hiring such as for an election campaign would
command large discounts, however, particularly in a recession when business
is scarce.
Conservative Central Office yesterday would neither confirm nor deny the
signature of an air charter contract with an April 10 return date. 'There
are preparations for a range of dates and they are not all April 9,' an
official said. Labour and the Tories were level pegging in weekend opinion
polls, in spite of gloomy economic statistics last last week, with support
for the Liberal Democrats increasing, Ralph Atkins writes. But Labour
leaders were yesterday confident that as perceptions about the economy sank
in, their support would rise.
Labour has set the recession as the central part of its campaign strategy
but will also focus on health and education, including attacks today on the
'privatisation' of the National Health Service. The Tories will respond with
claims about Labour's continuing links with trade unions.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Bayer to use ewes for rare protein supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER, the German chemicals giant, has signed a multi-million pound deal to
use a valuable substance produced by a genetically engineered Scottish
super-sheep called Tracy.
The deal in which Tracy will produce the chemical while grazing in a field
near Edinburgh, is thought to be the first sizeable commercial venture in a
controversial branch of genetic engineering.
It could mark the first step in the commercial use of genetically engineered
animals as biological factories.
Tracy, the first sheep in what her Scottish inventors hope will be one of
the most lucrative flocks in history, makes a substance that costs Dollars
100 a gramme. A litre of her milk could be worth up to Dollars 7,000.
She was genetically engineered by the injection of a piece of human genetic
material into a newly fertilised sheep egg. The human material instructs
Tracy to produce alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a protein.
Most humans make their own AAT, but one in every 2,000 people suffers from a
lack of it. In about 10 per cent of cases, the shortage is severe enough to
cause problems such as liver failure or emphysema. These people are either
treated with a course of injections of AAT, which can cost up to Dollars
20,000 a year or they are treated for the side effects of AAT deficiency
such as liver failure or lung disorders. There is a world shortage of the
protein. The super-sheep could ease the shortage by augmenting or eventually
replacing the traditional method of producing AAT by extracting it from
human blood.
Bayer has paid around Pounds 10m to secure exclusive delivery of the partly
purified substance made by Tracy and her descendants. The AAT would be
extracted from her milk. Bayer will conduct clinical trials and submit the
AAT for approval by health regulatory bodies around the world.
Not only does Tracy produce vast amounts of AAT by comparison with the
laborious process of blood extraction, but has now doubled production
capacity by giving birth to a daughter, Tracy Two.
Using the sheep, Bayer intends to make two tonnes a year of AAT from 1997.
It will take at least until then to complete clinical trials.
A flock of around 3,000 Tracys should be enough to treat the 100,000
sufferers of AAT deficiency that Bayer estimates there are in Europe and
North America.
Both animals are owned by Pharmaceutical Proteins, a venture capital
start-up based in Edinburgh which tried to interest two of the UK's largest
drug companies in Tracy's AAT, but was turned down.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Israelis kill Hizbollah chief: Helicopter rocket attack on
Sheikh Abbas's convoy in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEIKH Abbas Musawi, leader of Lebanon's Shia Moslem fundamentalist
organisation, Hizbollah, was killed yesterday in a rocket attack by Israeli
helicopters as he was travelling in a convoy of vehicles in southern
Lebanon.
The attack, 30km from the Israeli border, ended a weekend of violence in
Israel and Lebanon which seemed bound to escalate political tensions ahead
of the next round of Middle East peace talks due to open in Washington early
next week, involving Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians.
Nevertheless, Syria and Lebanon said within hours of Sheikh Abbas's death
that they would attend the talks, an announcement likely to be welcomed by
Washington as a sign of the durability of the peace process, despite
continuing violence on the ground.
The killing of Sheikh Abbas, a key figure in the negotiations last year for
the release of western hostages, followed earlier Israeli aircraft and
helicopter strikes on Palestinian refugee camps in south Lebanon. These were
reprisals for the killing of three Israeli soldiers at an army camp in
Israel late on Friday night. At least four civilians were reported killed in
the air attacks on the refugee camps.
Sheikh Abbas's wife, six-year-old son and at least five bodyguards were also
killed in the attack.
The Israeli army said the Hizbollah leader had been in the village of
Jibsheet meeting a number of Hizbollah officials responsible for organising
attacks on Israeli forces.
Israel made no connection between Hizbollah and the death of the Israeli
soldiers. The assailants were believed by Israel to be Palestine Liberation
Organisation activists who escaped into the occupied West Bank.
But it was clear that even if not a direct reprisal, the operation to kill
Sheikh Abbas offered the government and the defence establishment,
embarrassed by Friday night's security lapse, added opportunity to mount a
show of force.
Mr Moshe Arens, the Israeli defence minister, said last night: 'This is a
message to all the terrorist organisations that whoever opens an account
with us, we will be the ones to close the account. This is true for all the
bands, for all the terrorist organisations, for all the leaders.'
Mr Arens also said that Sheikh Abbas was a man with 'lots of blood on his
hands. This was an attack intended to hurt Hizbollah.'
In Washington, the State Department said the US 'was concerned at the rising
cycle of violence' and urged all sides to 'exercise maximum restraint'.
Sheikh Abbas was secretary-general of Hizbollah, the Iranian-backed group
best known in the west as the primary Lebanese organisation involved in
hostage-taking. He was regarded by Israel as being behind a persistent
guerrilla campaign against Israeli forces and their allies in southern
Lebanon where Israel occupies a 'security zone' along the northern side of
its border.
The strike was the most dramatic attack by Israel on Hizbollah since it
kidnapped Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid in mid-1989 in a failed attempt to secure
the release of Israeli servicemen held by Lebanese militia.
Yesterday's action may have been prompted by the collapse of United Nations
efforts to obtain the servicemen's release. However, one side effect may be
further to complicate efforts to free two remaining German hostages.
International condemnation has not deterred Israel from continuing to make
armed incursions deep into Lebanon. It brushes aside complaints that it
violates international law by saying the Lebanese authorities are incapable
of preventing attacks on Israel from their own soil, and are manipulated
against Israel's interests by Syria.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Optimism in retail sector offers hope for economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GLIMMER of light for the UK government over the economy comes with a
Confederation of British Industry report out today, which indicates an
increase in sales volumes in the hard-pressed distribution industry.
The sector - retailers, wholesalers and car dealers - thinks sales volumes
this month will be well up on a year ago. It also expects to order more
goods from suppliers as the economy picks up.
Although sales volumes in the sector remain depressed, the increased
optimism will cheer government ministers who, ahead of the election, are
looking for pointers that the economy is on the turn.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday said falling inflation and
interest rates were increasing real earnings and would 'boost spending in
high streets up and down Britain'. About 2.5m householders, whose mortgages
are fixed annually, were due for substantial cuts of up to 3 percentage
points, he said.
The distribution sector - which reflects the fortunes of both manufacturers
and consumers - has been among the industries worst hit by the 18-month
recession.
The CBI's latest report on the sector is cautious about predicting an
upturn. Even so, its tone is more upbeat about growth prospects for the
economy than recent government statistics, which have painted a picture of
the UK stuck in deep recession.
According to the survey, sales volumes for the industry rose unexpectedly
last month compared with a year ago. However, the impact on company finances
may have been diluted by the sharp price cuts introduced to spur demand. In
the survey, covering 15,000 trade outlets, 40 per cent of distributors said
they expected sales volumes this month to be higher than a year ago, with 24
per cent looking for a fall.
Government figures due this week are thought likely to support the tone of
the CBI study, and show that retail sales volumes showed a small increase
last month on December's depressed levels. Other statistics are expected to
indicate that the recession has so far lasted for six quarters.
The CBI survey failed to impress the Labour party, which said signs of
recovery were 'as remote as ever'.
Clothing and shoe shops - which marked down prices drastically in January -
saw a 'sharp turnround' in sales last month compared with a year before,
according to the survey. The CBI said retailers of electrical household
goods saw only modest increases.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (16): Graphics from the Winter
Olympics - Notebook computers: Application case study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LANCE BELL, pictured here, a London graphics journalist with Reuters'
international wire service, is using a portable computer at the 1992 Winter
Olympics to create on-the-spot illustrations to complement news stories this
week from the Alpine mountain slopes of France.
He is using a notebook-sized Apple Macintosh PowerBook 170* with modem,
based at a studio in the main press centre at Albertville during the 16 days
of the Winter Olympics. He is able to rapidly prepare diagrams and maps not
only at Albertville - the flagship town on the games - but also at any of
the ten mountain locations where the games are taking place.
Lance Bell's graphics for newspapers and TV programmes in many parts of the
world help to illustrate such events as cross country and speed skiing,
cross country, freestyle and bobsleigh contests - spread over the 750 square
miles of mountainous terrain which is hosting the Olympic programme.
In bad weather, there could be delays of perhaps four hours before graphic
details could normally be brought by road and transmitted from the main
press centre. But now, with the powerful notebook computer, Mr Bell can
transmit graphics via modem from any of the centres where events are taking
place.
'The newly-created graphics are transmitted to a Reuters' database in
Toronto, Canada,' explains Mr Corrie Parsonson, editor of the graphics news
service. 'Subscribers to the service can then access the graphics and
download them to their own Macintosh systems at newspapers, magazines and TV
studios around the world.'
Reuters graphics service, which was set up in May 1990, issues between four
and six graphics a day, in colour and black and white, to complement news
stories news, financial articles and other features.
*The PowerBook 170 is the highest-performance member of the Macintosh
Powerbook notebook-sized computer range. It weighs 6.8 lbs; the system is
priced from Pounds 2,975.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (15): Laptop users: senior
managers and directors top the list - Increasing interest being shown in
insurance, banking, auditing and sales and marketing sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   INTRIGUING extremes are emerging in the laptop computer market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one group of end-users seeks high-performance and highly-functional desktop
machine substitutions, while another group demands smaller, lighter weight,
battery-powered computers for more simple solutions.
These trends are highlighted in a report on portable computer markets by the
Market Intelligence Research Corporation (MIRC), which estimates that world
sales for these machines this year could be more than Dollars 5.6m. This
represents an annual growth rates of 10.2 per cent, rising to 11.8 per cent
next year.*
PROFILES OF TYPICAL USERS
But who are main users of portables - particularly laptops?
In the US, there is a higher percentage of users among direct sales teams
and mobile workers than in the UK, but this will change with the lively
interest being shown in Britain in such sectors as insurance, banking,
auditing, sales and marketing, field engineering and management
consultancies.
A survey in the UK of computer-users working in companies with more than 500
employees, the majority of users - for the moment - are senior managers or
directors, (54 per cent).
One-in-five are professionals and consultants, according to the report by
AST Europe, the personal computer manufacturer, and IDG Communications. The
percentage of portable computer-users and their job titles were as follows:
Director, partner: 18 per cent.
Managing director, principal: 11 per cent.
Data processing manager, information technology manager, 11 per cent.
Other managers: 14 per cent.
Professionals, consultants: 19 per cent.
Engineers, scientists: 5 per cent.
Administrators, 8 per cent.
Analysts, officers: 11 per cent.
In companies where users have both desktops and portables, they spend an
average of 3.52 hours a day on the former and only 2.35 hours a day on the
portable. But those without desktop machines use the portable for an average
of 3.8 hours a day.
In a survey of use by locations, portables were used for 37 per cent of the
time in the office, 34 per cent at home and 19 per cent in other people's
offices.
More than half of users said they found their portable to be 'even more
valuable' than they originally expected. One-in-five said they were also
using the portable for new applications.
While portability was considered the main benefit of the machines (35 per
cent); the executive's ability to work outside the office was rated at 10
per cent, with increased efficiency and ability to work more productively
rated at eight per cent.
MANAGEMENT RESEARCH PROGRAMME
Despite the increasing number of managers who use portable computers,
surveys of senior executives attending development courses at a leading
management training centre in the UK show that 'only a small percentage have
any realistic appreciation of information technology in the management
process.'
Monica Seeley, programme director of the Sundridge Park Management Centre at
Bromley, Kent, says that information processing tasks, traditionally
performed by middle managers, can now be undertaken by the senior manager on
his or her laptop, wherever they may be.
'The power and ease-of-use of today's portables leads to the radical
conclusion that only the computer-aided manager will survive and flourish in
the 1990s,' says Ms Seeley.
Now the centre has begun a three-year research programme to study the impact
of information technology (IT) and how managers should organise their career
paths in order to acquire IT and managerial skills to operate more
effectively.*** This research will be conducted jointly with Professor John
Beaumont at the School of Management at Bath University.
'Analysis will identify what exactly are the skills and mind-set of managers
who use IT effectively in business,' adds Ms Seeley. 'This will be done by
comparing the career paths of 'IT advanced' and 'IT retarded' managers.
'A comparison will also be made of the organisational frameworks which
advance and retard the effective use of information technology.'
BARCLAYS GOES PORTABLE
In one of the largest portable computer contracts ever placed in the
financial services industry, Barclays Life Assurance - part of the Barclays
group - has ordered 1,500 Toshiba computers for its entire sales force.
The machines will be used to help build Barclays life assurance, pensions
and investments business. The company made a six-month appraisal of
portables computers on field tests from various manufacturers before
deciding on the Toshiba model T2000SXe.
The machines will run tailor-made 'Supercasp' software, developed by
Microlex Systems of Derby. The system enables Barclays Life sales staff to
make swift and detailed presentations and forecasts for customers. Toshiba's
researchers claim that executives 'can expect around a 30 per cent
improvement in sales performance using the latest in portable sales
technology.'
SALES FORCE COMPUTES ON THE MOVE
Life Association of Scotland, (LAS), the financial services company, has
bought 260 Tandon Notebook portable computers for use by its direct sales
force who need lightweight machines while on the move.
The LAS evaluated eight models of notebook computers from various suppliers
before selecting the Tandon NB/386sx which runs at 20 MHz and weighs just
6.6lbs (3.1kg). The model has a 10 ins VGA monochrome backlit LCD display
which allows the user to operate industry-standard software while on the
move.
FAST-GROWING PORTABLE PRINTER MARKET
More than 300,000 portable computer printers are likely to be sold in Europe
this year, according to a new survey by Citizen Europe, the computer printer
and monitor manufacturers. This figure is likely to rise to 550,000 units a
year in 1995.
'At least one-in-four buyers of portable computers also require a printer,'
says Anthony Odhams, a senior manager at Citizen. 'Our forecasts suggest an
overall market growth from 1990 to 1995 of nearly 244 per cent.'
What is claimed to be one of the world's smallest A4 portable printers has
been launched by Citizen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Citizen Watch
company of Japan.
At 1.17kg, the PN48 Notebook Printer is half the weight of many of its
competitors and easily fits into a standard briefcase.
The machine is a non-impact device with a high resolution printhead to give
letter-quality print, comparable with the output of some laser printers.
Text and graphics can be combined on one page at print speeds of 53 cps in
letter-quality. The UK retail price: Pounds 325, plus VAT; (includes NiCad
battery).
Among innovations in the sector, the Irish-based company, Ferrotec has plans
to produce its new plain paper portable printer (the H200PM) both in France
and Ireland. Serrib, part of Groupe Bull, has the capacity to produce 3,000
printers a month. Ferrotec's new printer will be launched at next month's
CeBIT '92 exhibition in Hanover.
Among contenders in the portable printer market - they include Toshiba's
201, Canon's stylish Bubble Jet (BJ-10ex), the Kodak Diconix 150+, the
Seikosha dot-matrix LT-20 and the Mannesmann Tally MT-735 - small is
beautiful in the race to win market share.
The compact, high-quality Mannesmann printer can emulate both dot-matrix and
laser printers.
Toshiba claims to have the smallest and lightest portable printer on the UK
market in the ExpressWriter 201, which weighs 1.9lbs (0.85kg) and measures
11.9 by 3.1 by 1.7 ins. It uses 24-dot thermal transfer and prints on
thermal or standard office paper, using a ribbon, to produce letter-quality
output. The ExpressWriter is priced at Pounds 265. It will print
continuously for an hour using a detachable battery (weighing 0.55kg),
available as an option for Pounds 40.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (14): From palmtops, notebooks
and lapbooks .. to notepads, pen-based systems and laptops - For the buyer,
there is a daunting array of portable computers on offer. A look at a
selection of machines in each catergory, from top-of-the-range to budget
models
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH a flood of new portable computers coming on to the market, the
competition will become even hotter during 1992 as the players fight for
market share. However, while you - as buyer - win because prices become
keener by the day, you could lose if you buy the wrong machine.
Continual improvements in technology mean the life-cycle of a portable PC
today is about nine months at best. You could easily find that, by the time
you have signed on the dotted line for the machine of your choice, it has
already been superseded by a more powerful, lower priced version.
What is the answer if increased performance is anticipated? Accept the fact
that you might want to change your portable every year or look for a machine
that can be upgraded, ie the working memory can be expanded from the initial
1Mb or 2Mb to 8-10Mb or more; the display screen can be changed from, say, a
mono to a colour; and there are expansion facilities for adding additional
storage facilities, modems, printers and so on.
Unless you are a first-time user wanting to cut your teeth on a basic
portable PC or simply need a portable for occasional personal use at home or
away, beware being tempted to buy a unit simply because it is dirt cheap. It
will be a total waste of money if it is based on old technology that cannot
support the applications you want to run.
There are, quite literally, hundreds of portable machines to choose from
ranging in price from Pounds 199 for an A5 size palmtop PC to Pounds 10,000
for a power-breaker transportable based on the 80486 processor.
There are many variations in between and, with increased competition from
Korea and Taiwan, there will be many hundreds of models to choose from over
the coming months.
A survey commissioned by portable computer suppliers AST found that 75 per
cent of users make their own decision on which portable PC to buy. Even
among corporate buyers, 53 per cent is down to personal preference.
So what do they look for? The most important criteria in the selection
process were screen quality, keyboard, hard disk drive, processor power and
RAM.
Of secondary importance were weight/portability, battery life, design,
price, manufacturer's reputation and service support; although the last two
were higher up the scale for corporate purchases. The choice of machine will
depend, essentially however, on what you want to do with it.
To give an example, a palmtop will be more than adequate if you need a
pocketable unit that can handle spreadsheets, diary and address book
organisation, basic text processing, data capture (eg stock control) and
database enquiries.
If you are a graphics designer or engineer wanting to run sophisticated
applications such as desktop publishing and computer-aided design software,
you will need a power portable boasting a fast processing speed, large RAM
(working memory), high resolution colour screen and high capacity hard disk
storage, with each graphics image taking up the space of four pages of text
on average.
The most popular applications, according to AST, are based on Windows 3.0.
Wise buyers will look carefully at software licences. Until recently, you
had to buy a separate software package for your portable PC or de-install
your desktop version to avoid falling foul of the copyright laws.
WordPerfect took a lead by allowing users to make a copy of WordPerfect for
Windows, providing only one version of the software is being run at any one
time.
A point to bear in mind is that Windows requires at least 2Mb of RAM, ipso
facto you are going to need a more powerful portable, perhaps one with a
colour screen, the quality depending on whether it is simply for personally
viewing, for business presentations or for detailed graphic design
applications, (see page four for article on software).
Another point to bear in mind is that there are a number of different
display technologies, some of which are very difficult to view at the best
of times, (see page 6 for article on screen technology) is the amount of
detail you wish to see.
For the latest in mono displays, look for the VGA (video graphics adapter)
standard, with 32 grey-scale levels.
Weight will be important if you intend to carry your portable around in a
briefcase for any length of time.
A notebook PC may only weigh 5 lbs, but add an extra rechargeable battery
pack, mains adapter and external floppy disk drive and the weight could well
match that of a power portable.
Incidentally, if you intend to use your portable overseas, watch out for
mains power adapters that plug straight into the socket.
When plugged into an intermediate international power converter, they tend
to slip out because of the weight. (For more details about battery power,
see page four).
Other points to bear is mind include compatibility with your desktop PC,
particularly if you want the convenience of being able to use the same
disks; expandability, with extra sockets important if you want to add a
modem, printer, and fax card; data integrity, with solid state disks being
less vulnerable to damage than rotating magnetic media; and storage
capacity, particularly if you are an information hoarder who hates to delete
files.
PALMTOPS - PERSONAL ORGANISER OR PC COMPANION
Palmtop PCs are small and light enough to carry in an overcoat pocket; they
use little power to provide several days of red-light use per battery
charge; can exchange files with a desktop PC; and are affordable, being
priced between Pounds 199 to just over Pounds 1,000.
For those on a budget who do not need to run standard PC applications but do
need a personal organiser, diary scheduler, calculator, basic text editor
and address book, units to look at include the Sharp IQ and the Microwriter
AgendA, which offer PC communications, ie provide you with the ability to
upload/download information in ASCII text format, as opposed to fully
formatted documents.
If you need MS DOS compatibility, ie want to run standard PC applications,
in a machine no bigger than a video cassette, the palmtops to consider
include the Poqet PC and the various units designed with the help of DIP,
the British pocket computer experts.
They include the DIP Pocket PC, Atari Portfolio, Hewlett Packard HX 95LX,
Sharp PC-3000 and Telematica Leo.
DIP is convinced that the best seller in 1992 will be the Sharp PC-3000.
Priced at Pounds 749 plus Vat, it features 2MB of system memory; 77-key
Qwerty keyboard; 640 x 200 resolution black and white LCD screen; inbuilt
software which includes diary, phone book, calculator and text editor; and
optional external 3.5in floppy disk.
Most interesting of all, it is PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association) compatible, which means it can take solid state
memory cards which offer low power consumption, greater storage capacity and
increased reliability, (see page 6).
Backed by such leading industry players as Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Lotus and
WordPerfect, PCMCIA is set to become the pocket computer standard, enabling
users to plug in and go with all the popular PC-compatible software.
The Poqet PC (Pounds 999) also takes PCMCIA-compatible slot-in memory and
application cards, provides 100 hours of use on standard AA-size alkaline
batteries and features a full 80-character by 25 line display. Touch typists
will particularly like the newly designed 77-keyboard with its more positive
action and separation of cursor keys from the shift key.
PC software available includes Lotus 1-2- 3, Lotus Agenda and Lotus Works,
WordPerfect 5.1.
PALMTOPS - FOR TECHNOPHOBES OR ACTION MEN
Though to some afficiandos, the Psion MC range is still one of the more
innovative around, its potential hampered only by the lack of long promised
peripherals, Psion believes that its computer saviour will be the handheld
Series 3, which has won a number of awards since its launch last Autumn,
including the Best International Product award at Comdex/Fall exhibition in
Las Vegas.
Priced from Pounds 199.95 inclusive of Vat, it is MS DOS compatible and
supplied with built-in applications software which includes a fully-featured
word processor and database.
Using the same SSDs (solid state disks) as the MC range, it features a very
clear screen, 16-bit processing power, multi-tasking operating system and
graphical user interface. Thus, even technophobes should not suffer a long
learning curve.
If you are looking for a handheld computer that will stand up to a hard
life, the Husky 16 is worth considering. It comes in a tough, knock and
water-resistant sealed case, making it ideal for service engineers, local
government data collection, quality control, surveying, time recording and
warehousing as well as applications in public utilities and the armed
forces.
The most recent addition to the Husky ruggedised range of portables is the
FS/2 which features a backlit LCD screen, weighs in at 26 oz and provides
over 30 hours of battery run time. A 512Kb budget model is priced at Pounds
1,249, a 4Mb version Pounds 2,649.
NOTEBOOKS - STATE-OF-THE-ART OR BUDGET PRICED ?
If you are constantly on the move and work mainly from vehicles or hotel
rooms, a notebook is an ideal solution.
Small and light enough to be carried in a briefcase, able to run off a
battery, car cigar-lighter system or mains power, there are budget priced
models or power versions capable of handling most applications.
A drawback may be lack of expansion slots, which means you get only what you
see, with no upgrade path. Notebooks like the TI TravelMate 2000 and Sharp
PC-6220 which do not have an integral floppy disk drive will be a bonus to
large organisations not only because cost will be lower but data security is
enhanced since users will not be able to insert disks from unauthorised
sources that may contain viruses.
Epitomising notebook PCs with integral 1.44Mb 3.5in floppy disk drive is the
new Bondwell B330SX which weighs in at 8.4 lbs; uses a 25MHz processor to
provide a processing speed up to 95 per cent faster than a conventional
16MHz machine; and features rechargeable NiCad batteries and advanced power
management system to give up to 4 hours of red-light use.
Priced from Pounds 2,499 list, it also has 2Mb RAM as standard, a 60Mb
capacity hard disk, 1.44Mb 3.5 ins floppy disk drive, triple supertwist VGA
screen and a PC alarm to guard against both physical removal and
unauthorised access to data.
If you want to run your portable all day on battery power, then the state of
the art is the Zenith MastersPORT 386SL notebook (see page one). It uses the
Intel 386SL processor which has been designed specifically for portable PCs
to prevent mid-day battery failure or data loss.
The machine gives up to eight hours' use from one battery charge and, to
conserve power further, features the Premier Management Systems with Rest
Resume mode, which freezes your work at any point and saves it for up to 30
days.
Priced at Pounds 2,995, it is one of many portables PCs available at low
prices from the mail order company Action Computer Supplies.
The new Compaq LTE Lite/25 and Lite/20 386SL-based notebooks are based on
the same processor with the most notable features being hardware and
software security, enhanced battery-life control, improved keyboard layout
and stand-by and hibernation modes.
Action prices are Pounds 1,859 and Pounds 2,149 respectively. Also
386SL-based, the new Toshiba T3300SL notebook features a 64Kb cache memory
which is claimed to make the 25 MHZ processor operate over 50 per cent
faster than Intel's 20MHz 386SX chip; six hours of battery life; and
PC-to-mainframe communications capability.
For those on a budget, keep your eyes peeled for the numerous special deals
advertised in the national and computer press. As an example of the drop in
prices, the Tandy 1100FD notebook is now some Pounds 300 lower at around
Pounds 425. It may only have a single 720K floppy disk drive, which could be
inconvenient if you use an AT-compatible desktop PC but, on the plus side,
it runs for 4.5 hours on a rechargeable battery, is supplied with DOS and
applications software which includes a text processor, has a full-size
84-key keyboard, parallel and serial interfaces, modem port and optional 1Mb
expanded memory card.
Notebooks now priced around the Pounds 850 mark that do incorporate the
higher capacity 1.44Mb floppy drive include the Panasonic CF-170. With 640K
memory, 20MB hard disk, 9 ins easy-viewing backlit supertwist LCD screen and
parallel/serial interfaces, it offers four hours of battery life.
But if you need more power at your elbow, expect to pay Pounds 2,251 for the
386SX-based Panasonic CF-370. Another example of lowering prices in the
power end of the Notebook market is the 20MHz 386SX-based TravelMate 3000
from Texas Instruments which was priced at Pounds 3,395 when launched a year
ago. Now priced at Pounds 1,795, it is A4 size, no more than 46mm thick and
weighs in at 2.5Kg, which include a 20Mb hard disk, integral 1.44Mb 3.5in
floppy disk, 2Mb memory expandable to 6Mb, 10 ins sidelit supertwist LCD
display with 32 grey levels, full function well- designed keyboard and
LapLink file transfer software.
NOTEPAD COMPUTERS AND PEN-BASED PCS
A variation on the notebook in terms of size and, indeed, processing power,
the notepad is different in that it has no keyboard; you write on it with a
cordless pen. There are a number of systems poised to enter the market, held
back mainly by the lack of software - although over 250 software developers
are doing their best.
Ideal for collecting data in the field, typical applications include retail
stocktaking, surveying and data-logging at industrial sites. The first
pen-based PC was launched by GRiD Computer systems, now part of Victor
Technologies, which supplies a broad range of portable PCs, see page seven.
The GRiDPad pen-based unit incorporates a blue reflective display which
makes it ideal for use by anyone who works at night or in adverse lighting
conditions, eg truck drivers, repair crews and the police. Customers include
Commercial Union, Equity &amp; Law, Ford, LandRover, the Armed Forces and
Audatex, the vehicle damage assessment company.
The latest version is the GRiDPad/HD which incorporates a hard disk drive
and is priced at Pounds 2,549. The new GRiDPad/RC is priced at Pounds 2,049
and uses PCMCIA-compatible static RAM cards. The most recent package to be
launched is PenForms which enables any user to design custom screen layouts
for any kind of electronic form-filling in the field.
The other main contender in this market is NCR. Said to be the first to
understand everyday handwriting, the pen-based NCR 3125 has the potential,
say the company, to have as dramatic an effect on working life as the
introduction of the photocopier or personal computer.
Based on the Intel 80386SL processor and priced at Pounds 2,995, it is able
to recognise and record upper case, lower case and annotations and is
designed to provide a cost-effective solution for users who find a keyboard
an impediment to data input or who are struggling with time-consuming
paper-bound procedures.
LAPTOPS - FOR FINANCE AND SALES
IBM is targeting the financial services sector with its PS/2 L40SX laptop
which provides full support for client service and sales management. Priced
at around Pounds 2,800, it is based on the 20 MHz 80386 microprocessor for
fast execution of advanced business programs, including those designed for
IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, it is supplied with a 60Mb hard drive, super
slim 1.44Mb, 3.5 ins floppy drive. Plus-points include an 85-key keyboard
with full-sized keys; 10 in supertwist nematic VGA LCD display with 32
levels of greyscale; and an optional autosensing AC adapter which adjusts
for local power conditions in any country.
Expansion facilities allow instant connection of external VGA, serial,
parallel and keyboard pointing devices as well as the IBM desktop expansion
unit. It uses an advanced NiCad battery with battery backup and advanced
power management systems, with optional quick charger and car adapter.
You may expect to see a whole series of portable PCs from IBM in 1992. At
the budget end of the power laptops is the Lapbook SX from AEG Olympia which
is slightly larger than an A4 notebook size PC and less than half the weight
of a laptop (3.6 kgs).
Based on the 80386SX processor running at 20MHz, it incorporates a fast
access 40Mb hard disk drive, 1.44Mb 3.5in floppy drive and 1Mb of memory
which is expandable to 5Mb. It also has a low power page white backlit LCD
display and uses batteries giving 3 hours of use. List price is Pounds
1,699, which includes free on-line telephone support.
COLOUR - FOR PRESENTATIONS AND COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
An example of state-of-the-art in portables offering business
presentation-quality colour screens is the Sharp PC-8501 which is based on
active-matrix TFT (thin film transistor) backlit LCD technology which
supports 256 displayed colours simultaneously out of a total palette of
262,144 colours and offers a high contrast and definition regardless of
viewing angle.
It has a 2Mb memory (ideal for Windows applications) and features a 100MB
hard disk drive, a capacity designed to support disk space hungry graphics
applications.
The drawbacks? It is mains-powered only and the list price is Pounds 5,995,
down from the launch price of Pounds 8,000; although available through
Action Computer Supplies at Pounds 4,195.
Those on a budget can still get access to Sharp's high performance colour
display capability, but on the new ACL-386SX 20MHz laptop from Amstrad, the
UK market leader in terms of portable PC sales. Expected to become the
company's best seller for 1992, the list price is Pounds 3,999 plus Vat and
it incorporates 4Mb of main memory and a 120Mb removable fast access hard
drive for high capacity storage and data security.
A bonus is that it runs off a removable rechargeable battery pack with
built-in charger and internal auto-switching mains power supply and utilises
a 20MHz microprocessor.
DUAL PURPOSE - FROM PORTABLE TO DESKTOP
Anyone having to work to tight business budget, has limited desk space
available or wants the convenience of a two-in-one computer, then a
dual-purpose portable-cum-desktop unit is really worth considering.
Typifying the genre is the Walkstation range of notebooks and laptops,
designed, developed and manufactured in Germany by Triumph-Adler, part of
the Olivetti Group.
Innovations include zero-pressure connection to a desktop 'docking' station
and docking printer; a detachable clip-on mono screen which can be replaced
with a colour display at a later date - making it virtually 'future-proof.'
It also has an integral mouse and, for the foreign traveller, an intelligent
power unit that can work across many voltages and frequencies and the
ability to interface to a range of peripherals including CD-ROM drives.
The current promotional price of the top of the range 386/33 60Mb version is
priced at Pounds 2,999, (normally Pounds 4,199).
At the top end of the dual-purpose portables is the 386-based Unisys
PowerPort DX1 which comes with 120MB drive, 3.5 ins 1.44Mb floppy drive and
4MB RAM expandable to 16MB. Priced at Pounds 3,530, it is mains powered
only; with the battery operated, less powerful SX1 priced at Pounds 2,520.
Both are supplied with DOS and Microsoft Windows 3.0, with SCO Unix and
Microsoft OS/2 available as options.
Good points include full-sized 85-key keyboard with 12 function keys in
standard arrangement and full travel keystroke; and magnesium casing, which
is lighter and tougher than plastic cases and, being porous metal, breathes,
dissipating heat faster than plastic and eliminating the need for a noisy
fan. For graphics: a VGA screen with up to 32 shade of grey, double the
norm, which can be unclipped and exchanged for a desktop VGA monitor.
Each system comes with two telephone jacks; optionals include a modem/fax
board. The active docking station supports industry-standard AT circuits
cards enabling it to be linked to major LANs such as Novell and IBM
Token-Ring.
DESKTOP COMPATIBILITY - FROM DESKTOP TO PORTABLE
Graphic designers and other dedicated Apple Macintosh users will want to
look no further than the notebook-sized PowerBooks which are based on
Motorola's 68030 microprocessor and are priced from Pounds 1,375 for the
smallest and lightest model 100 which comes with 2MB of memory and 20 MB
internal hard drive, to Pounds 2,975 for the top-of-the-range model 170,
pictured left. This features a fast 25MHz processing speed, a backlit
active-matrix LCD display that provides supper screen performance in all
lighting conditions, 4MB of working memory, a 40MB internal hard drive and a
1.4MB IBM-compatible SuperDrive.
An optional extra is an internal fax/modem card which can be used in any
country to transfer data, log-on to remote information systems or for
electronic mail.
UPGRADEABLES - START SMALL, GROW BIGGER
The main advantage with Toshiba portable PCs, which range from low- priced
notebooks to high performance colour portables, is that there are a number
of third party developments which not only upgrade performance but provide
additional capabilities.
For example, the Wonunder Cradle from Gravatom is an expansion chassis,
priced at Pounds 299, which takes the Datavoice ISDN PC card enabling
Toshiba notebooks to be connected to Integrated Services Digital Network to
provide access to remote computers; fast file transfer at 128 kbps; or
logging on to local area networks.
Another development is the MicroQuin-NT from Kerridge Network Systems, the
first internal modem to provide Toshiba notebooks with reliable data and fax
communications over cellular networks. As well as supporting PC-to-PC,
PC-to-LAN, PC-to-Unix; and PC-to-DEC connectivity, it enables users to
access Viewdata and Telecom Gold.
POWER PORTABLES - STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS FOR 1992
The most advanced this year in terms of power will be portables based on the
Intel 80486 processor, with prices ranging from around Pounds 4,500 to over
Pounds 10,000 and many contenders with products in the wings. Those already
in this 'go faster' race are Compaq, IBM, NEC, Toshiba, Zenith.
As examples, the new Toshiba 486-based T6400DX runs at 33MHz and has a gas
plasma display (Pounds 3,419 from Action) while the T6400SX is a 25MHz TFT
colour portable (priced to be advised, but should be under the list price of
Pounds 6,499).
The Compaq Portable 486C is based on the i486 processor running at 33MHz and
supported by 4Mb of RAM which expandable to 32Mb. It has either a 120 or
210Mb hard disk drive, features an a high quality active matrix TFT LCD
display and will be list-priced at around Pounds 7,000.
SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE
A final point worth mentioning when it comes to buying portable computers
is: mobile maintenance. Most machines are sold with 12-month return to (UK)
supplier warranty, which will not be much good if you are away from base
with an urgent report to complete.
In terms of warranty length, Sanyo is showing the way by supplying its brand
new range of four notebook PCs with a three-year warranty to cover parts and
labour throughout all EC countries. Mobile maintenance for UK-based users of
Vortec Laptec notebooks means, we are assured, a first-year, free-of-charge,
no-quibble guarantee, whereby an engineer will be on-site to repair a faulty
machine within eight working hours.
Should the problem turn out to be a major one, the engineer will transfer
all your hard disk data - or the hard disk itself - to an identical
replacement machine.
In the corporate arena, organisations needing pan-European support for large
field sales forces and mobile executives will welcome the Siemens Nixdorf
initiative. This allows advanced notebook PCs to be purchased in packs of
ten at a substantial discount. If a machine needs servicing anywhere in
Europe, the user simply contacts the nearest service centre where they will
be provided with immediate fault diagnosis and a replacement notebook within
two hours if needed.
The scheme applies to the PCD-3nx/16, a 16MHz unit with 1Mb memory and 40Mb
hard disk which is offered at Pounds 14,990 for ten, compared with the
single unit price of Pounds 2,795; and the PCD-3Nsx/20 which has a 20MHz
clock speed, 2Mb memory and 60Mb hard disk which costs Pounds 17,990 for
ten, compared with Pounds 3,195 for one.

How portables help sales force automation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES force automation was largely impractical until the appearance of the
laptop computer. Computer-help for field sales people used to be limited to
what could be mailed to or from them on disk or be telephoned to their home
PC, via its modem.
Now software packages abound, claiming to make the nomadic sales person more
productive. Some systems are little more than glorified electronic diaries,
but others are genuine marketing tools, cutting down on paperwork and
handling all routine computerised elements of a sales person's work, such
as:
Customer requirements analysis and recording.
Quotation compilation.
Personal organisation facilities.
Planning and developing sales prospects.
A closer look at these headings might reveal facilities for recording
customer details, relevant products, history of sales (and failures), past
visit reports, current sales order management, and forward action for taking
up new business opportunities.
The transfer of information between the sales executive and head office is
important. Thus, a package may allow information to be extracted for
progress reports and for creating more lengthy reviews requiring
pre-composed texts and calculations, in word processing fashion. There
should also be an electronic mail link.
The tasks may be interpreted in different ways, but should not be discrete:
for example, an entry in one section should update, in spreadsheet fashion,
the effects on entries in other areas.
A change of contact name, to take a simple instance, will need updating in
the diary, account record and future prospects reminder.
Among the hundreds of packages for sales force automation, a handful are
starting to acquire a name.
Among these, Sales Technologies, for instance, is a leader in the
pharmaceutical industry. Market Solutions, Prosper Systems and Ensure Sales
Technology have well-known, but more general purpose offerings. In the
insurance sector, the Business Partner system comes from industry-sponsored
Origo Services.
The insurance industry, as with all pioneers of computer applications, had
to write its own early software. Many user-companies now combine in-house
systems with off-the-shelf automation modules to add value.
Sun Life of Canada, for instance, uses in-house software to gather
information on the client, analyse it identifying needs and generate product
illustrations. They also have a proprietary SFA system called Portex from
Showerings and there will soon be an automatic data transfer from one to the
other.
Allied Dunbar's famous application of sales force computers has evolved into
customer-needs analysis and point-of-sale product calculations combined into
a personal financial planning system. They are now adding enhanced functions
such as financial health checks and graphical sales tracks to a practice
management module covering sales force functions. This last point
illustrates the need for pick-and-mix systems design. Sundridge Park
Management Centre at Bromley, Kent, has an accumulation of expertise on
sales force automation.
But Monica Seeley, the centre's programme director, adds a warning: 'Some
purveyors are jumping on the bandwagon. Potential users must closely look at
the needs of their sales force and make sure the software they buy really
fits those requirements.
'For example, are sales people selling low-price items in bulk or high-value
items in individual negotiations? Do they sell to wholesalers who know the
trade or to end-users who need educating?
'Does each sales person have large or small numbers of customers and how
well does he or she have to get to know them? Issues like these need to be
set out clearly, because most packages are written with one or another type
of salesforce in mind.
'Indeed, there may be a mix of 'sales types' in the company - regular sales
people out on their patch and others on national accounts. It is rare that
one system can serve all these people, but where different packages are used
they will need 'pipelines' between them.'
Another link is needed between the sales team's laptops and the head office
sales management system - thence to the company's order, production,
delivery and accounting arteries.
Such a link allows a sales person to update head office territory records,
send in orders as they are taken, and so on.
The head office, in turn, sends out details of fresh enquiries, price
changes, promotional information and other data.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (11): More power for the
palmtop - Handheld Computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE MORE than a decade ago, the only 'portable' computers were the size,
shape and weight of luggable sewing machines, and IBM PCs, with 64K of
memory, were just beginning to grace office desktops. Since then, technology
has enabled computer manufacturers to pack more and more power and memory
into ever-smaller boxes and make the computer-on-a-chip all but a reality.
Laptops replaced the early transportable computers, and then came the
clam-shell notebook computer. The latest notebook portables boast colour
screens, massive hard disks and Intel 80486 processors, giving them the
power of the fastest desktops, all in a package smaller and lighter than an
average telephone directory.
For some users, however, it seems that even the notebook computer is too big
to carry around. Enter the palmtop, or handheld computer, some of which are
little bigger than a large sardine can and weigh less than half a bag of
sugar. A growing number and variety of palmtop computers are now available.
Some offer little more than the features of an electronic organiser, while
others cater for specialist niche markets such as on-site data collection.
But many of these are now beginning to mimic the full-function desktop
computer.
According to some analysts, the worldwide market for hand-held computers
will be worth Pounds 3bn by 1994. At the same time, palmtop machines are
already taking a larger share of the portable computer market. Zenith Data
Systems has estimated that palmtops' share of the portable market will reach
10 per cent by 1995.
The palmtop computer market was pioneered in the late 1980s by Sharp, the
Japanese consumer electronics giant which claims to have invented the
electronic organiser, and Psion, the UK-based manufacturer of the successful
Psion Organiser.
Some machines, such as the Casio SF9500 and the Sharp IQ range, clearly
derive from the early electronic organisers which began to replace the
calculator and paper-based personal organisers a few years ago. One, the
Kyocera Refalo, actually comes in the form of a ring binder. Typically,
these machines are equipped with built-in functions such as calculator,
clock, address book, scheduler and notebook usually accessed via a set of
dedicated menu keys, that are now near-standard.
More sophisticated machines, like the Sharp IQ 8000, use plug-in flash
E-Prom cards to expand memory and provide other tailor-made programmes
including spreadsheets, translators, and specialised scientific and business
calculators - thus, one for the Sharp will calculate the size of radiators
needed in a central heating installation.
Although they generally do not run industry standard software, most palmtops
can also exchange data with a desktop computer via software and a hard-wire
link or over the telephone line using a modem. Since most of them have small
and difficult-to-use keyboards, downloading data from the office machine for
use while on the move is a particular attraction.
A second group of machines has begun to appear on the market in the last
year or so. These can lay claim to be more like shrunken full-function
desktops - although nearly all have some limitations in terms of absolute
compatibility. This group includes Sharp's recently unveiled but
not-yet-released PC3000 video cassette-sized palmtop, the Hewlett-Packard
95LX, the Poqet PC, the dip Pocket PC, the Psion Series 3 and the
Microwriter AgendA. The first four run MS-Dos or an equivalent from Rom
memory chips and can therefore run standard PC software - but with some
limitations due to Ram memory size and the physical limitations of keyboard
and screen.
Though most of the new batch of machines resembles each other, all have some
special features. The British-built Psion Series 3, the successor to Psion
Organiser, uses a PC-style processor but does not run MS-Dos. Instead, it
can be programmed in a Basic-like language that Psion calls OPL. Its
powerful built-in applications, which include a spreadsheet compatible with
Lotus 1-2-3 and a word processor compatible with Microsoft's Word, can share
data with programmes on a PC and files are saved to its two Flash E-Prom
memory card slots in MS-Dos format.
The AgendA is distinctive for several reasons, including its innovative
rapid entry microwriting language - substituting just five keys for the
usual 26 needed to produce the full range of letters, and its screen which
unlike all the others is not in a hinged lid. As for the Sharp 3000 and the
Poqet PC, their liquid crystal screens, while still not of VGA standard, are
able to display a full 80 columns by 25 lines.
However none of the screens is backlit, which saves battery power, a
precious commodity. In general, the new palmtops manage to run for between
40 and 120 hours on small AA batteries or Lithium packs aided by a high
level of integration, low power consumption chips and advanced power
management techniques.
With the exception of the AgendA, all come with somewhat cramped Qwerty
keyboards, but of strikingly different qualities and are generally more
appropriate for short memos than for producing large documents. All provide
built-in functions such as address books, calculators, diaries and notepads
or slimmed down wordprocessors, often under a dedicated menu key, while some
boast additional features including tone telephone dialers, communications
programmes, databases and spreadsheets.
The Pocket PC, with its single expansion card slot, is equivalent to the
Atari Portfolio and can run all the Portfolio's software cards. With eyes
clearly on the individual business user several offer Lotus 1-2-3-compatible
spreadsheets and the HP 95LX comes bundled with a version of Lotus 1-2-3
itself. Most either produce files which are compatible with desktop
applications or will convert files into formats that can be used by other
machines. Removable memory cards are also a common feature, together with
software and cables to allow them to be hooked up to modems, printers and
desktop PCs.
Most of the machines still use proprietary slot-in cards for memory and
additional software applications but a de facto palmtop PC standard is
emerging. The Hewlett-Packard, Poqet and Sharp palmtops all come with new
Flash Ram memory card slots conforming to the PC Memory Card Interface
Association and an optional PCMCIA card adapter is available for the Pocket
PC. These lightweight cards, the size of a small stack of credit cards, can
be read-only or read-write and hold up to 2Mb of data at present although
larger capacities, up to 64Mb, are on the drawing board.
PCMCIA cards are expensive at around Pounds 350 for a 1Mb card, but prices
should begin to drop as more manufacturers adopt the standard. An external
card drive can be bought for about Pounds 165 and plugs into the parallel
interface, allowing data to be exchanged with a desktop - or another
palmtop.
A third specialist group of hand-held computers - some derived from machines
mentioned above - is designed primarily as data collection devices or for
use in industrial or other non-office environments. Psion, Tandy's Victor
Technologies/Grid subsidiary and Husky Computers among others manufacture
hand-held machines used as portable input/output devices mainly by meter
readers, market researchers or for stocktaking, using a bar code reader or
other input device.
The market for this type of machine is growing rapidly. Prudential Insurance
has just placed what it claims is the world's largest order for hand-held
computers, spending an estimated Pounds 7m for 7,600 Husky Hunters to
improve the reliability of data capture and reduce the time between
collecting data and sending it back to a local or central office. The
computers will replace the old paper-based collection book carried by the
insurers' door-to-door salesmen.
Overall, the palmtop computer market is becoming increasingly competitive,
but it is also still a young and diverse product market with few established
standards. It may therefore be some time before it matures and becomes a
cut-throat commodity-type market like those for larger computers.
Inevitably, the human body imposes limitations on the workable size of
screen and keyboard which designers have so far failed to overcome. As a
result, palmtop computers, even the latest generation, are designed around a
series of compromises.
Some analysts predict that notepad computers will grab 20 per cent of the
portable market by the mid-1990s - overtaking palmtops themselves.
Communication between computers, including palmtops, is also likely to
become simpler and more automated. Several manufacturers, including NEC and
Poqet, have already developed radio communication versions of their
portables and Hewlett-Packard's palmtop includes an infra-red 'window' in
its casing which allows it to communicate without wires with other HP
machines.
The prospect of combining the palmtop with a cellular telephone or other
wireless transmitter raises the possibility of computer-to-computer
communications anywhere without any cables.
The latest palmtops are already a far cry from their earlier portable
cousins, but there is still some way to go before the dream of real
pocket-sized computing power becomes a reality. What is certain is that
this, too, will come sooner rather than later.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (9): Capacity soars - Memory
Technology / Further big increases in portables' memory capacity are on the
way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEMICONDUCTOR technology is readily predictable. This makes it a relatively
simple task to work out what the future for portable computer memory
capacities will be like. The real question, therefore, is not how much
memory can be made available, but how it is to be exploited.
Random access memory (RAM) chips, the most commonly used in personal
computers, now hold 4 megabits (MBits) of data, equal to 0.5 megabyte
(MByte) or roughly equivalent to some 85,000 words. Over the next year, the
first examples of chips with four times that capacity, 16Mbits, (2 MBytes or
nearly 350,000 words) will start to appear.
Top-end portable computers already come with around 4 Mbytes of RAM as their
main user memory, so it is relatively easy to predict that this will rise
over the coming years to 16 Mbytes, and then 64 MBytes (roughly 10m words).
The same chips can and will be used in smaller portable computers as well,
such as the popular notebook machines, and the handheld 'palmtop' and pen
computer systems.
In terms of memory capacity and processor performance, there is now only one
technical reason why the capabilities of the largest desktop PC cannot be
put into a palmtop machine, and that is the display technology available.
There was one other technology hindering such a development, the magnetic
disk drives used for on-line data and program storage, but at a technical
level this has largely been overcome by the growing availability of cards
built to the standard defined by the Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA), which numbers over 180 computer
companies in its membership, many of them leaders in their field.
This standard exploits the increasing capacity and functionality of
semiconductor technology to, at the base level, provide an alternative to
the magnetic disk drive for small portable computers.
The technology developed for the PCMCIA standard, however, is capable of
providing much more than just memory capacity. It can couple that capacity
with additional functionality and intelligence. This is not to suggest that
the magnetic disk drive has lost its role in portables. The technology
continues to be developed aggressively, with both the physical size of the
units and the cost-per-megabyte stored coming down rapidly.
Physically, disk sizes of 2.5 ins diameter are now commonplace, with
capacities of 20 MBytes and 40 MBytes now typical. This will rise to 60
MBytes and 80 MBytes this year, according to leading drive manufacturer,
Conner Peripherals.
At Pounds 10 per megabyte stored on a Conner 40 MByte drive, it is
impossible for semiconductor technology to beat disks on price. In terms of
size, unit price and capacity, therefore, the majority of laptop and
notebook portables will still be using magnetic disk drives.
Their one major weakness - power consumption - will be tackled in part by
the reduced physical size of the drive motor and actuators needed, and in
part by improving software to manage the power consumption. There is little
chance, however, of this weakness being overcome sufficiently to accommodate
the needs of the growing palmtop computer market.
Users here are seeking longer than three to four hours working life from
their batteries, a capability the smallest hard disk drives cannot provide,
even if the latest developments of 1.5 ins diameter disks means that
credit-card-sized units can be produced.
It is with the palmtop machines that the PCMCIA standard card format is
starting to make an impact, though its presence is starting to be felt in
notebook portables as well. The standard defines a physical form factor for
add-in cards - about the size of three or four credit cards stacked one on
top of another. It also defines the connector pin-out and what can be
achieved with them.
The objective, as with all standards, is to have as many hardware suppliers
using it as possible, thus creating a market for card suppliers in all their
guises. This is greatly helped by the convergence last year of PCMCIA
standards with those of the Japan Electronics Industry Development
Association, (JEIDA).
The two are now claimed to be fully compatible, allowing JEIDA-standard
cards to be used in PCMCIA-compliant computers and vice versa. The most
obvious guise for PCMCIA cards is as a hard disk alternative. Here a variety
of solutions are on offer, including battery-backed RAM chips linked
together as a module.
More recently, flash memory technology, a variant of electrically erasable
programmable read only memory (EEPROM) technology from companies such as
Intel, has come to the fore. For systems designers, the trade-off between
the two is capacity, price and flexibility.
RAM-based units currently hold more data, but need to have a small lithium
battery as part of the card design, in order to maintain the data as stored.
Typical capacities to date are up to 10 MBytes per card, though Santa Clara,
California-based SunDisk, the company of PCMCIA president, Mr John Reimer,
claims the lead with a 15 MByte card.
Predictions are for 100 MByte cards to be available within three years,
though these will not beat magnetic disks on price per megabyte stored.
Flash memory, on the other hand, retains the data as a read-only memory
(ROM) does, without any need to keep refreshing it, but allows the system to
re-write the data as required. This is analogous to magnetic media.
According to Mr Reimer, the most important aspect of PCMCIA is as a prompt
for entirely new developments, particularly in applications software
distribution. Companies such as Lotus Development Corp have already ported
its 1-2-3 spreadsheet to this format with success, where the application
code is held in ROM together with RAM chips for the data the application
generates.
Mr Reimer expects many other applications providers to follow Lotus' lead,
especially as its joint effort with Hewlett-Packard in the development of
the HP95LX palmtop has led to sales of around 50,000 units per month.
As the latest, Version 2.0, of the PCMCIA standard also includes the
definition of other input/output capabilities, the potential opens up for
combining memory with other functionality.
At present, cards offering fax/modem and local area network capabilities are
under development, but as Mr Reimer says, 'developers are limited only by
their imagination in what they can now produce with PCMCIA technology.'
One of its most interesting advantages stems directly from its exploitation
of semiconductor technology - 'we are reaching a point where the data held
in a card memory is worth more than the cost of the system that generated
it,' says Mr Reimer. 'Because of the technology, these cards can withstand a
500g drop and still function. A palmtop or pen computer can easily be
dropped, breaking the machine and losing the data. With PCMCIA cards, that
data can be recovered by putting the card in a new machine.'

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (8): Strong demand for clearer
displays - Screen Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRISPER, clearer colour screens are increasingly in demand from portable PC
users, who no longer see their machines as executive toys. Some users want
to take advantage of more powerful colour software programs, some want to
make a splash in business presentations and some simply want to join the
in-crowd.
Now a handful of personal computer manufacturers is trying to meet that
demand with high-definition, flicker-free, active matrix displays. Until
now, users have had to suffer a variety of slow, low-resolution liquid
crystal displays (LCDs) using passive matrix technology.
Among the active matrix coterie are Sharp, NEC and Toshiba with its
80486-based T6400 machines launched last month.
The T6400s use the first active matrix screens from Display Technologies,
the joint venture set up by Toshiba and IBM Japan, two years ago.
So far, the duo is believed to have invested Pounds 214m in the technology
and these 10.5 ins screens are the project's first offerings.
The largest TFT (thin film transistor) screen so far manufactured, at 16.5
ins, was shown in Japan last month by Sharp, but neither this nor its 14 ins
screen, seen two years ago, is yet in mass production.
Both passive and active matrix displays work on the same principle. By
illuminating the right combination of pixels behind red, green and blue
filters, they create the illusion of colour in the same way that colour
photographs do in a newspaper.
But active matrix displays use three times as many pixels, each one
controlled by a separate transistor. This independent control prevents light
bleeding into neighbouring pixels to change the colour mix.
Active matrix screens are also sensitive to tiny changes in voltage, so they
can display many thousands of subtle colours, depending on the software
drivers.
This, combined with the independent control of one transistor per pixel,
makes them brighter, with better contrast and colour saturation than passive
matrix screens.
But active matrix displays - using thin-film transistor technology - are
difficult to make. To produce a TFT screen to VGA resolution (640 by 480
pixels) requires about a million individual transistors.
Not surprisingly, manufacturing defects are high and the result is many dead
pixels. Because light can pass through these, thin-film transistor screens
become punctured with distracting points of light.
Despite manufacturing improvements in the past six months, only 40-50 per
cent of new TFT screens - which must be made in a single sheet - are usable.
Sometimes the yield is even lower. Until recently more than 90 per cent of
screens were scrapped because of pixel damage, even though some
manufacturers allow up to 10 dud pixels per screen.
As a consequence, the price of TFT portables is high: at Pounds 6,000-Pounds
7,000, two or even three times the equivalent of passive matrix machines.
Besides passive and active matrix screens, there are two other relatively
common technologies in use: gas plasma and electroluminescence.
Unlike LCDs, which need back or sidelighting, gas plasma displays generate
their own light. A gas discharge trapped between two layers of glass
generates the characteristic copper-coloured text on an almost black screen.
One particular advantage of the technology is that the screen refresh-rate
is fast. This means users will not 'lose' their cursors in Windows-type
applications.
For the cost-conscious buyer, the price of gas plasma portables is
considerably less than active matrix systems.
Toshiba's gas plasma T6400 runs Pounds 2,000 cheaper than the TFT version,
at Pounds 4,500. IBM, NEC and Grid still offer gas plasma machines.
Electroluminescence (EL) is less popular even than gas plasma, as EL screens
tend to be powerhogs.
They do have certain advantages, though: the refresh rate of their yellow
and black screens is particularly fast and they are cheaper than TFT
screens.
Electroluminescence can also support much larger resolutions than TFT:
Toshiba's Sparc LT laptop workstation for programmers, for instance, with
its 12 ins Sharp screen, has a resolution of 1,152 by 900 pixels.
Two relatively new screen technologies - ferroelectric LCDs and
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) screens - have yet to make their way into full
commercial production, but could eventually supplant TFT technology.
The first ferroelectric LCD, demonstrated last autumn by Canon, was a
monochrome screen with a resolution of 1,310 by 960 pixels. Canon expects to
manufacture colour screens, too, at an even better resolution and up to 24
ins in size.
Although the mass production of ferroelectric LCDs (FLCDs) may be three
years or more away, these screens are likely to be significantly cheaper
than TFT systems.
Sharp, one of the market leaders in screen technology, does not yet
manufacture FLCDs, but has gone as far as to say that they will probably be
the displays of choice for future portables.
Portable personal computers, using metal-insulator-metal (MIM) screens, are
likely to offer brighter whites and may eventually be cheaper than TFT
machines. Again, however, mass production techniques for MIM screens have
yet to be devised.
The first prototype MIM notebook, from Seiko-Epson, was shown in the US last
year with a price tag of about Pounds 4,500.
As far as buyers are concerned, the precise technology behind portable
screens is immaterial. But they do need to know what to look for: clarity,
brightness and contrast control are important, to enable users to run the
machine under different lighting conditions.
Response time, too, is worth investigating, especially for power software
such as Windows.
Something else to look for, especially if the machine is needed for
presentations, is a screen that can be seen from a wide viewing angle.
Perhaps the key question buyers should ask is whether they need colour at
all.
The demand for colour is certainly high, say manufacturers, which will keep
the cost of colour portables up for a year or two at least.
'Consumers are expecting the cost of these machines to fall quicker than
it's going to,' says Mr Yan Edbrooke, product manager for Apple's notebook
computers.
'Demand is stronger right now than the production technology can deliver, a
phenomenon that'll last through 1992.'
In many ways the intense demand for colour portables is illogical.
Toshiba research shows that 70 per cent of portable users are interested
only in word processing. So buyers should seriously consider monochrome
portables before plumping for a colour machine simply because it looks good.
Moreover, unless buyers can afford the best - which really means TFT at
Pounds 6,000 plus - they will have to make do with dimmer, slower, fuzzier,
passive matrix screens. And the colours on many of these are poor, says Mr
Nick Phillips, professor of physics at Loughborough University of
Technology.
'The screens on portables that I've seen are an insult to the intelligence,'
he says.
'Those companies that have tackled the attempt to get good black and white
have done the right thing.'

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (10): Handheld system helps cut
costs - Application case study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NOTEBOOK computers are the thoroughbreds of the portable computing
stable, handheld machines are the workhorses.
Limited in functionality but easy to use, light in weight and low in cost,
they are suited to a range of business purposes for which larger machines
are either too sophisticated or too expensive.
Or perhaps too bulky and inconvenient for easy use by a salesperson.
Gallaher, the UK-based international group with its origin in the tobacco
business, thinks so, anyway. Its involvement with handheld computers for its
sales force stretches back 13 years and it is already debating plans for its
next generation of systems.
The company is one of the world's largest tobacco enterprises but it also
has extensive interests in spirits - Vladivar vodka is one of its brands -
optical products, retail distribution and houseware.
It is a sophisticated user of computer systems for conventional data
processing; its involvement with handheld machines, however, takes it into
more controversial areas - strategic use of information technology for
competitive advantage and alignment of IT strategy with business strategy.
The tobacco business is on the decline but that is not, according to Mr
Michael Friend, general sales manager, reflected in Gallaher's performance.
It has about 40 per cent of the UK marketplace and is selling more cigars
and cigarettes than ever before - but in a different fashion.
Tobacco is not immune from the sweeping changes that have changed the face
of retail distribution. Independent retailers now tend to obtain their
stocks from cash and carry operations or from wholesalers, while the large
chains are increasingly turning to centralised warehouses.
Evidence of the change comes from the decline in the number of Gallaher's
direct accounts: from 50,000 ten years ago to around 19,000 today.
Gallaher's response was to look for a better way to deploy its 250-strong
sales team. It believed it could improve efficiency and service by combining
the roles of direct and indirect sales in a single force.
The precedents were not encouraging. Gallaher's competitors had tried
similar moves with only limited success. It made sense, therefore, to carry
out a large-scale trial in a single region before rolling out the new
approach nationally.
The region chosen was Western Division; the trial began in 1989. Gallaher's
first experience of handhelds was with a simple device, the M55 , marketed
by Unilever Computer Services, since taken over by Electronic Data Systems
of the US. Interestingly enough, the group's move into handheld computing
was not driven by one of the company's young turks, but by Mr Tony Goodburn,
a sales engineer of mature years who has since retired.
Today it is using a more sophisticated machine developed by Victor
Technologies part of the Tandy Group based in the US. Victor was a pioneer
in the personal computer business, but lost its way in the 1980s. Under
Tandy's ownership it is recovering its bounce; it is, for example, one of
the leaders in portable computer systems in which keyboards are replaced by
handwritten input.
The Victor machines allows sales people on the road to place orders from
customers and print invoices as well as receiving messages through
electronic mail. Printing the invoice is a big plus, saving hours of
paperwork. It also calculates VAT automatically.
At the end of the day, the sales people send the result of their endeavours
to the company's main computers at Northolt, Middlesex, over the telephone
network. There is no cabling or interfacing to worry about; the computer is
laid on a 'plinth' - essentially, a telephone terminal equipped to receive
information from the computer through an infra-red link. Mr David Adams,
sales programme manager, notes the importance of a lack of obvious or
complex equipment where salepeople are working from home.
The trial has been a success; Gallaher executives say it would not have been
possible to combine the two sales forces in one without the computers.
The reason, Mr Adams says, is the amount of paperwork necessary for each
kind of account. Different order and invoices are used for direct and
indirect sales. Both are stored in the computer and called up at the press
of a key. Without electronic help, the salesperson would risk drowning in
paper
work. The system has now been implemented across the country at a cost of
some Pounds 500,000. That represents a large chunk of Gallaher's data
processing budget. Mr Adams said it was justified to senior management on
grounds of cost-cutting. Delivering order data automatically over the
telephone meant that fewer staff were needed to handle mail orders.
There were, inevitably, teething problems with the system and not always
obvious ones. The units are battery powered and at one stage Gallaher found
it was going through batteries at a remarkable rate. It discovered that
unbeknown to Victor, the composition of the springs which retain the battery
had been changed by a supplier. The result was a reaction which drained the
battery. Every set of springs had to be changed to solve the problem.
Then there was the tiny printer which sits on top of the computer to issue
invoices operates by leaving an image on thermal paper. The sales team was
issued with plastic wallets to file the copies. Again, a chemical reaction
between the plastic and the paper meant that in weeks the invoices faded.
Leather replacements for the wallets solved the problem.
The company is measuring the success of the trial by improvements in service
to its customers. It believes it has shaved 24 hours off the average
delivery time. In today's fiercely competitive markets, that is an advantage
well worth having.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (7): Quest for longer battery
life - Research intensifies to improve power management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS PORTABLE computers have shrunk in size and weight, more attention has
been focused on one of the less glamorous parts of the PC: the power supply.
Almost all portable computers, except for heavyweight transportables, depend
upon batteries to supply the power they require. This means that there are
only a limited number of options for extending operating life between
replacing or recharging batteries.
Unfortunately, battery technology has lagged behind developments in almost
every other sector of electronics. Analysts bemoan the fact that battery
technology for portables has improved a paltry five per cent a year.
Except for palmtop computers (the babies of the portable computer family),
most portables use rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Generally, they
can only provide enough power between charges to keep a notebook PC running
for between one and three hours, depending upon usage. More power could be
delivered by larger batteries, but this would add weight.
Nickel-cadmium batteries have several other disadvantages. Chief among these
is the so-called 'memory effect.' Unless they are fully discharged before
recharging they gradually loose capacity - or the ability to be fully
recharged. Several alternatives have been tried, but have generally either
proven to be unstable or have shown little power-to-weight advantage over
NiCad cells.
Lithium cells pack four times as much energy into a given size and weight
than NiCad batteries but can be very volatile - one Japanese businessman's
lithium-powered portable telephone reportedly exploded while he was using
it.
So far, the most promising, and safer, alternative has been nickel-metal
hydride powerpacks initially developed in Japan by Sanyo. NiMH batteries
have recently started to appear in new portables including those from
Toshiba and Dell. Manufactures claim they can extend normal use operating
time over NiCad batteries by up to a third and have the added advantage of
being more environmentally friendly.
Some indication of the expected demand for these new powerpacks is given by
Matsushita, one of the big four Japanese battery-makers, which began
producing NiMH batteries in late 1990 and said in November that it expected
to quadruple production by the middle of this year.
However, the limited progress in battery technology has forced portable
computer manufacturers to turn to other solutions to extend operating life
between charges.
Until recently, most attention has focused on software implemented power
management and on reducing consumption by using low power components like
the CMOS chips - which made the first laptops possible  - or highly
integrated components.
Toshiba pioneered software power management systems by introducing features
like auto-resume, pop-up battery power indicators and battery-backed 'hard
RAM.' Other power manage ment systems switch off power-hungry components
such as screens and disk drives when they are not being used; some also
monitor battery recharging.
Software-based power management solutions can enhance battery life, but some
risk introducing compatibility problems, and more fundamental solutions are
required to achieve the substantial power savings which portable PC users
are beginning to demand.
More complex power management systems therefore depend upon a combination of
hardware and software features. The most dramatic recent development in
power management has been the complete redesign of the 80386 chipset by
Intel to produce the power-saving Intel 80386SL chipset unveiled at the end
of 1990. The first notebook computer to take advantage of the new Intel
chipset was the Zenith MastersPort 386SL launched last July to popular
acclaim.
Other manufacturers including Toshiba, Sharp, Compaq and Dell have now
launched 386SL-based notebooks. Dell's machine, the System 325NC, is a
colour notebook using the 386SL 25Mz chipset and a Dell-developed power
management application specific integrated circuit (Asic) resulting in
battery life of up to three hours of normal use - longer than many
monochrome machines.
Zenith itself has launched a faster, second generation machine, the
MastersPort 386SLe running at 25Mz. The US-based company, which is now a
subsidiary of the French Groupe Bull, reached the market first because it
had worked closely with Intel during the design phase and had a head start
in designing the operating system necessary to take advantage of the SL's
special features. The SL chipset is actually two chips replacing 11
components in the standard 386 design, but the real key to the way it saves
power is its ability to switch sections of the computer off when they are
not being used and run them slower when peak performance is not required.
The use of an in-built 64k processor cache also helps by reducing the need
to provide the standard RAM (random-access memory) with more than a drop of
power.
'What is special about the SL is not the power it uses, but the power it
does not use,' says a Zenith official.
What is more, the sophisticated power-management systems are mostly
'transparent', so the average user does not even need to be aware of them.
Using the chipset, the Zenith MastersPort SL machines have three power
modes: in use, standby (which is equivalent to dozing), and sleep, which is
like being in a coma but not quite dead.
When the machine is running flat-out with disks whirring and screen on full
brightness, there is little if any power-saving over the standard 386
chipset. But when the machine switches to the standby-state, its power
consumption drops to about 15 per cent of the peak rate.
In this state most of the essential functions are kept alive and some of the
hardware runs very slowly, but moving a mouse or touching the keyboard is
enough to arouse it.
By contrast, in a 'coma' almost nothing runs and power consumption falls to
just 0.5 per cent of the peak rate. In this state the processor slows to
1Mz, essential data is stored safely away and the machine is all but
switched off.
But it can be revived almost instantly either by pressing the power button
or by a timer utility and returns to exactly the same place and function as
when it powered down. Using a setup facility in ROM (read-only memory), the
power switch can be configured either to trigger the sleeping state, or to
turn the computer off in the normal way.
The setup facility also provides user access to the machine's other
power-saving features.
Zenith is properly cautious about making exaggerated claims for its
machines; however, in 'coma' mode, the batteries would last about a month.
More importantly, powered-up and in normal use, they should last six hours
or effectively a full working day, even when running 'Windows.'
Toshiba, which launched its rival T3300SL 25Mz machine with NiMH batteries
last month, said the SL chip offers 'power management facilities similar to
those pioneered by Toshiba on previous portable PCs,' and will give a
battery life of up to four hours.
Some analysts are already predicting that shipments of SL chips will
overtake shipments of standard 386SX chips in the notebook market segment
within a few years.
But Intel is unlikely to have the market all to itself. Intel's arch-rival,
AMD, has developed microprocessor technology which it claims will double the
battery life of a portable PC without compromising processor performance.
The new devices, which follow the Intel's DX and SX architecture, are
designed to operate at 3.3 volts instead of the normal 5v and thereby also
allow the use of low-cost alkaline batteries.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (6): Widening horizons -
Software developers exploit growing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODERN portable computers are now powerful enough to be used for software
applications that were once confined to desktop machines. Faster processor
'chips' and more advanced display screen technologies allow portable
computers to be used for far more than simple note-taking and 'personal
organiser' tasks.
Software developers have recognised an opportunity to exploit a new and
growing market.
Later this spring, personal computer software giant Microsoft will introduce
a new version of its popular Windows environment - version 3.1 - which
incorporates features aimed specifically at the portable computer market.
Microsoft hopes to extend its dominance of desktop computing - with the
Windows/MS/DOS standard - to the portable computer market.
Other software developers are keen to exploit the mobility and power of
portable computers. Some build on existing applications and others bring
innovative new applications to the market. There are signs, however, that
there will be differences between the mature market for desktop software and
the new market for portables.
Mr Stephen Arnold, chairman and managing director of the UK portable
applications specialist Softa, points out that there are different types of
portable computer user and different demands for applications software -
'some people want a portable desktop - similar in function to the one in
their office. Other portable users want something more job-specific.'
Mr Arnold notes that job-specific, 'field-force' software applications -
such as those used by service engineers and sales staff - require
specially-built software and there is less need for standardisation -
'although historically people were bitten by the lack of standardization on
the desktop - it is not so necessary on portables - especially if you have
to develop special applications software.'
'Many players in the portable computing market are offering high-quality
proprietary software. In the end, it is the context of the application that
dictates what software you use - so you don't need to blindly assume that it
must be standard MS/DOS,' he says.
There are other signs that MS/DOS might not achieve dominance of the
portable market. Toshiba, the Japanese manufacturer which dominates the
portable computer market, announced in January that it would no longer
'bundle' MS/DOS with its computers - allowing purchasers to make their own
choice.
And companies like Psion, which produces a range of hand-held computers,
have equipped them with their own proprietary operating software.
Despite this, it seems likely that MS/DOS - and, when the new version
arrives, Windows - will be the basis for much of the software for portable
computers.
'The power of portables has improved so much that we can offer a full
Windows environment now,' says Mr Mark Edwards, Windows product manager at
Microsoft in the UK. 'We are introducing three specific features which will
be important for portables: advanced power management; mouse 'trails' and
optimised backgrounds for LCD screens.'
The power-management features will be particularly welcome. Battery life on
portables has improved - but it still needs to get better. The new Windows
environment will be able to detect when the screen and disk drive are not
being used and turn them off to conserve power.
The mouse 'trails' make it easier to keep track of the cursor on the screen
by leaving a trail of cursor marks. And the special backgrounds will make
screens more readable.
Established software developers are happy that MS/DOS and Windows will make
the transition to portables and are building applications in key areas.
Nextbase, a UK software specialist, has created Autoroute Express, a
route-planning application, which sits well on a portable computer - even
the hand-held Poqet computer.
'Our software is widely used on portable computers.' says Ian Mercer,
managing director of Nextbase.
Autoroute is, essentially, a simple application which lets you work out the
quickest or shortest route from one town to another. The product covers all
of Europe and the US - with more detailed versions for the UK and France.
Directions and maps can be viewed on the screen or printed out.
'We recognised the potential for the product on a portable and built the
software to work well in a low-performance computer,' says Mr Mercer.
Looking to the future, Mr Mercer says that the company plans to bring out a
version for Microsoft Windows - 'in my opinion, MS/DOS and Windows are so
universal that they will be much more popular than proprietary systems.
People don't want to have to learn new ways of working.'
Nextbase also intends to exploit the advantages of portability by using the
emerging Global Positioning System (GPS), which uses satellites to transmit
longitude and latitude co-ordinates.
'The price is still high - but it won't be long before it tumbles down to
below a Dollars 1,000. We have done some work into putting GPS into the
Autoroute software. Then you will be able to see where you are on an
on-screen map,' says Mr Mercer.
Other software companies are working on the communications potential of
portable computers. Kerridge Network Systems, a UK communications
specialist, claims a world 'first' with a British-designed high
specification modem for portable computers which comes with a wide range of
software options.
'We have worked closely with Toshiba to develop communications software for
the corporate environment both for remote and loc al connections,' says Mr
Nigel Hawley, general manager of Kerridge Network Systems.
Kerridge's products allow a portable computer to work like an old-fashioned
terminal to a large mainframe system or as a participant in a local area
network - 'we've used special hardware which allows us to change the
function of the modem using clever software. You can connect simultaneously
to a remote mainframe and, say, a viewdata system,' explains Mr Hawley.
The Kerridge range brings portable computing full circle - giving it the
potential to form an integral part of traditional data processing
applications. This will certainly help to put portable computers alongside
desktop computers as 'windows' moves into the corporate network and beyond.
It might even mean the eventual disappearance of the desktop computer
altogether.
Software suppliers are introducing innovative products for portables

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (5): Pressures force changes -
Computer Distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT tumult in the computer industry has taken its toll on those who
distribute their products and many small retailers in the UK have gone to
the wall in the current recession.
While the market for personal computers was flourishing, the manufacturers
did not pay undue attention to the means by which their products were
distributed. Now that the market has become even more fierce, such
competitive factors have grown greatly in importance. The computer
distribution market looks ripe for change.
Some computer manufacturers such as Dell, the US group which also has a
strong presence in Europe, have moved to supply products direct to the
end-user themselves. The company argues that by being responsible for the
distribution of its products, it can offer greater flexibility and improved
levels of service. But other forms of distribution, such as superstores and
mail order look set to account for a growing proportion of computer sales.
At present, however, the market for portable computers in the UK still
remains largely in the hands of distributors and dealers, although it is not
as yet a highly profitable segment of the personal computer market.
Toshiba claims it has seen two developing trends in the market for portable
computers - 'the first is a move towards mass merchandising. As the price of
portable computers diminishes, they are increasingly being sold through
computer superstores and mail order outlets,' it says.
The second development is that value added resellers (Vars) - which sell
individually-tailored hardware and software packages to companies - have
also seized a growing slice of the market for portable computers.
'The value added resellers (Vars) are becoming more important in selling an
integrated solution as the portable computer increasingly becomes a
component of a company's IT strategy,' Toshiba says.
The value added resellers are selling a business solution rather than a box.
Big insurance companies, for example, are buying portables for use by
on-the-road salesmen to give immediate quotes. Such portables are often
supplied by the value added resellers who design specialist bespoke software
needed to run the sales programmes.
Mr Jan Murray, who runs Vision Technology, a computer mail order company
which last year opened the first computer superstore in Europe under the
logo PC World, concurs with Toshiba's interpretation of the main trends in
the market.
'I would say that portable sales are definitely growing compared with other
forms of computers. But we have found that it has become a commodity market
very, very quickly. Prices are coming down a lot faster than people thought
and a lot of manufacturers who piled into the market have found that they
have had to reduce prices to maintain market share,' he says.
His company has reported buoyant sales of portable computers both through
its superstore and on its mail order side but he argues that the market is
swiftly changing.
He detects a rapid move towards the notebook computers - 'laptops are
already becoming seen as old technology,' he says.
PC World, which is run from a 30,000 sq ft site in Croydon, south London,
sells mainly to small and medium-sized businesses but is also selling direct
to individual business executives.
'If you are of a certain status, then you are likely to buy a machine to use
in conjunction with desk top machines,' Mr Murray says.
He claims that PC World is performing well and that the superstore concept
will be extended this year. He plans to open a second store in the Brent
Cross area of north London at the beginning of May.
But the consumer market for portable computers is generally proving a
difficult one to crack. Mr Alan Dickinson, buying director for Dixons, the
UK's biggest electrical retailing group, says that the growth rate for
mobile computers has not matched the early projections.
Dixons sells most of its mobile computers, ranging from Pounds 599 upwards,
to individual consumers or small businesses. But he claims there is still
considerable resistance to their high price, which can be 30 to 35 per cent
higher than desk top computers with identical functions.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (4): Notebooks claiming lion's
share - The European Market / European makers' best hopes may lie in niche
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN companies have still to make much of a mark in the fastest growing
segment of the personal computer market.
Some 48m personal computers should be installed throughout Europe by 1994 of
which almost 20 per cent will be portable, according to the market research
consultancy, Romtec; and notebooks will account for 73 per cent of the
portable market, equivalent to about 6m units.
Mr Bolko Kast, marketing executive director for Siemens Nixdorf's reseller
division, argues that notebook machines are already claiming the lion's
share of the portable market and will soon, through superior ease of use,
put paid to the bulkier laptop machines.
But the world and European leaders in portable machines are the same:
Toshiba of Japan, Compaq of the US and Zenith Data Systems, a US company now
owned by Groupe Bull of France.
European-owned companies may have a strong presence in their home markets,
but it is not reflected across the continent.
Amstrad, for example, leads the UK laptop market with a 32.5 per cent share
by volume ahead of Compaq with 18.5 per cent and Toshiba with 17.5 per cent
according to the latest figures from Romtec. (By value, Compaq leads and
Toshiba is in second place).
The challenge to European-owned suppliers, however, remains to learn to
compete with the major US and Japanese producers.
And they will be fighting on their own territory. Toshiba not only sells
computers in Europe, it manufactures there as well. Its Regensburg, Germany,
production facility makes about one third of the Toshiba portables sold in
Europe.
The company's investment in the Regensburg plant now comes to about DM80m;
it has just begun production of printed circuit boards there.
The plant includes research and development facilities. According to
Toshiba, 'by situating such research and development departments directly in
Europe, Toshiba has made sure that despite recent pressure in the portable
market, it will continue to retain leadership of the European market in
terms of technology as well as market share.'
Compaq has been manufacturing systems for European distribution since 1988
at its 530,000 sq ft manufacturing plant at Erskine near Glasgow in
Scotland.
It makes its most advanced portable computers there, partly, it seems to
avoid onerous US duties on 'active matrix' colour flat panel displays.
The US government's decision to place a duty on the expensive TFT colour
displays gives Compaq and other US manufacturers of high performance laptops
a curious problem.
The duty, designed to protect a handful of US manufacturers of similar
displays, applies only to separate displays.
It does not apply to complete systems. If a display fails, the company would
have a dilemma. Whether to ship the machine out of the country to replace
the faulty part, or simply to replace the whole machine so great would the
cost be to import and fit a new display.
The problem has a echo in the 14 per cent duty charged on semiconductors
imported into Europe.
Organisations like the European Association of Manufacturers of Business
Machines and Information Technology Industry (Eurobit) argue that the duty
is damaging European competitiveness, adding an average 2.5 per cent to
manufacturing costs.
Semiconductors can make up to 60 per cent of the total cost of a personal
computer or workstation. Eurobit is asking for the duty to be abolished,
arguing it reduces investment and the competitiveness of European
manufacturers.
What prospects are there for European-owned makers? There is no shortage of
innovation. The UK company DIP, whose handheld miniature computer is the
basis of the Atari Portfolio, showed that, as did Psion with its
notebook-style Mobile Computer.
Both companies may have been somewhat ahead of the market. Psion, in
particular, was unfortunate in failing to co-ordinate the launch of hardware
and software for the Mobile Computer. The result was a missed window of
opportunity; Psion is now concentrating on its core expertise in handheld
devices for personal and commercial use.
Innovation in personal computing is, however, rapidly giving way to standard
technology - microprocessors from Intel, operating software from Microsoft,
tiny but high capacity disk drives. The secret of success is volume
production and effective distribution.
Groupe Bull of France bought its position in portables through the
acquisition of Zenith Data Systems of the US; the company has since suffered
from distribution difficulties and from declining sales in the US.
A deal with IBM giving Bull access to IBM technology in exchange for equity
and a promise to take substantial numbers of Zenith portables may prove a
turning point for the company.
Olivetti of Italy designs and manufacturers laptop and notebook computers
through its Triumph Adler subsidiary.
Features include a common 'docking station' - a desk-top unit into which
portable computers can be fitted to give communications and other
facilities. There is also an integral mouse pad to drive the screen pointer.
The Triumph Adler machines are sold under the Olivetti label but also under
the DEC logostyle in Europe. Philips of the Netherlands retained its
personal computer interests when it sold most of its computer business to
DEC last year. Now, according to the market consultancy Dataquest, it is
fifth in Europe in notebooks. It is also a pioneer in systems which
substitute input by finger or stylus for conventional keyboards. It intends
to announce a product using this technology before 1993.
Siemens Nixdorf announced a high end notebook computer at the end of last
year; it has been working with Matsushita of Japan to develop what Mr Kast
of Siemens Nixdorf describes as a 'mobile desktop' - a docking unit in which
the notebook machine can be securely locked to prevent theft. Mr Kast
believes that this kind of computer system will eventually replace
conventional desk top computers.
Europe's best hope may lie in niche markets. The UK company Husky, for
example, specialises in ruggedised handheld computer for use in the field;
The Prudential has bought 7,600 to equip its field sales force.
Logitech, an international company with its headquarters in Switzerland, is
developing devices to humanise the computer; it markets a range of mice and
trackerballs specially suited to portable computers.
It claims its 'Trackman Portable' mouse is the most ergonomic available.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (3): US notebook market surges
ahead - Dozens of clone-makers enter the fray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTABLE personal computers are one of the few bright spots in the
recession-plagued US computer market. While sales of most types of computers
have stagnated over the past year, demand for light-weight, carry-along
portables is growing apace with the introduction of dozens of new 'notebook'
models driving market growth.
After disappointing sales in 1990, when shortages of disk drives, flat panel
displays and semiconductor chips stunted market growth, US notebook computer
sales took off last year, rising to an estimated 1.4m units.
By the mid 1990s, annual US portable computer sales could rise to 6.2m units
according to International Data Corporation market researchers. However, the
notebook computer market is not recession-proof. Although sales volumes are
growing, prices are falling precipitously.
Dozens of 'clone' makers, searching for more profitable ground as desktop
personal computer prices plummet, have entered the notebook computer market
offering lower-cost alternatives to the brand-name products that until
recently dominated the field.
Apple Computer which entered the notebook computer market just four months
ago, has already cut the US price for its low-end Powerbook notebook
computer by 12 per cent.
Simultaneously , Dell Computer cut its notebook prices by about 15 per cent
while slashing the price of desktop personal computers by up to 38 percent.
Other computer manufacturers are expected to follow suit, extending the
industry's desktop computer price war into the portable computer segment and
bringing the average price of a notebook computer down to well under Dollars
2,000.
Early market leaders in the US portable computer market have been Compaq
Computer and Tandy of the US, the Zenith Data Systems division of France's
Groupe Bull, and Japanese makers Toshiba and NEC.
Over the past year, however, some 40 or more computer companies launched new
portable computer products in the US intensifying competition and driving
down prices.
Sitting strangely on the sidelines of the notebook computer market is
computer giant International Business Machines. After several failed
attempts to penetrate the portable computer market IBM is expected to launch
its first 'true' notebook computer later this month with an aggressively
priced model that matches the performance and features of competing
products.
IBM also has agreed to resell portable computers manufactured by Zenith Data
Systems, a unit of Groupe Bull as part of its technology sharing pact with
Bull.
IBM's entry comes as the focus of the notebook computer market is shifting
from the individual purchaser to corporate buyers.
Like their desktop predecessors, notebook personal computers were first
adopted by computer enthusiasts and then by those who recognised their value
as a business tool. Now numerous US companies are equipping their field
personnel - sales and customer service representatives - with notebook
computers.
Large-volume contracts to supply these machines are coveted by all
manufacturers and deep discounts on list prices are typical.
Even as the pricing patterns of the portable computer market are aligning
with those of the more mature desktop arena, technology advances are
creating opportunities for portable computer makers to differentiate their
products and avoid the low-margin 'commodity' product trap.
Flat panel display technology, for example, is rapidly evolving to create
crisper, colour, high resolution screens for portable computers. Flash
memory chips are emerging as a compact and more rugged alternative to
magnetic data storage technology-based disk drives.
Power management technology is another area in which computer makers find
room to differentiate one notebook computer from the next.
Compaq Computer's latest offerings in the notebook computer category, for
example, focus upon the pressing demand for prolonging battery life.
Compaq has developed a patented low-power backlighting system for the
computer display, normally the most power-hungry element of a notebook
computer. The Compaq lighting system saves up to 50 per cent of the power
consumed by earlier display designs.
Semiconductor technology advances are also contributing to the effort to
reduce power consumption and extend battery life. The portable computer of
the future will incorporate 'wireless communications' according to many
industry experts.
Among US computer manufacturers, Apple Computer is actively pursuing this
trend. Last year, Apple filed a petition with the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) that, if approved, would let computers transmit and receive
information over radio waves instead of through a wired network.
Miniaturisation of the personal computer has not stopped at the 4 lb to 7 lb
'notebook' size.
A new category of personal computers that is beginning to show promise is
the hand-held or pocket computer. US industry leaders in this emerging
market include Hewlett-Packard and Poqet Computer.
On the horizon is yet another new type of portable computers known as slate
computers. These notebook-sized devices will replace the familiar keyboard
with an electronic pen. The user will simply write on the 'slate' or point
to icons to select functions.
Numerous applications are envisaged for these pen-based computers among
people who do much of their work while standing or moving around.
Doctors and nurses might use them to update patients' notes or order tests,
for example. Software that enables the computer to interpret hand-written
notes has been developed by Go Corporation, a California start-up.
Microsoft, the leading supplier of PC software, is also developing
handwriting-recognition software that could be used as an extension of its
existing PC operating systems. Grid Systems, one of the pioneers of the
portable computer market, offers a slate computer with handwriting
recognition capabilities.
IBM and Apple Computer have both expressed great interest in the potential
for this new technology. Market researchers at BIS Strategic Decisions
predict that sales of slate computers will top Dollars 1.5bn by 1995 and
could become a Dollars 7bn market by the end of the decade.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (2): Strong stimulus for
further research in Japan - The large potential market for portable
computers in Japan may provide the home platform' for manufacturers to make
an even bigger impact in world markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international success of Japan's portable computer makers is an anomaly.
In nearly every industry in which Japan has made an international impact,
from cars to television sets, Japanese manufacturing companies have first
established successful products in the home market. With the home base
secure - often effectively closed to foreigners - and products well tested,
they moved overseas, modifying products only slightly and achieving greater
economies of scale in manufacturing.
In portable computers, however, the pattern was reversed. Toshiba, formerly
an also-ran in the Japanese computer market, in the last decade established
a big presence first in Europe with its innovative IBM PC-compatible laptop
computers, then in the US, and finally in Japan itelf.
It was Toshiba's experience overseas that helped it crack the Japanese
market, where it now claims up to a third of portable computer sales.
Toshiba's experience is a reflection of the broader strengths and weaknesses
of the Japanese portable computer industry. While Japanese PC-makers have
built a strong presence in the international market for portables, they have
not, as in some other industries, simply smashed the competition.
Japan's technology for making computer hardware may be second to none, but
for the export market Japanese makers still depend on foreign-designed
operating systems and software that have not yet caught on fully in Japan
itself. Japan therefore has not provided the kind of secure and stable
market for computers that has supported other export industries.
Indeed, Toshiba faces a constant struggle to maintain its market share
everywhere. It is sometimes trumped by a new product offered by Compaq
overseas, and in Japan it has failed to keep NEC, Japan's biggest PC-maker,
out of its established territory in the portables market.
While Toshiba enjoyed a 43 per cent share of the laptop and notebook
computer market in Japan in 1989, this fell to 33 per cent in 1990, although
its Japanese sales grew by 25 per cent to 250,000 units.
In the current fiscal year, to the end of March, its market share is thought
to have fallen again, with sales projected at 225,000 units, according to
the company.
In contrast to Toshiba's experience, NEC, the unchallenged champion of the
Japanese market with over 50 per cent of desktop and portable PC sales, has
made little impact overseas in PCs.
NEC has been handicapped outside Japan by the lack of an internationally
accepted computer operating system.
NEC uses a proprietary Japanese language system that accounts for about 60
per cent of the Japanese market (including sales by Seiko Epson of
compatible machines), but is completely useless overseas. The option of
simply exporting what succeeded in the home market therefore never existed.
NEC's domination of the home market has been eyed enviously by every other
manufacturer, from Toshiba and IBM to Apple. Last year, IBM led 22 other
computer companies in establishing a common operating system in an attempt
to spur sales.
The system, DOS/V, is a derivative of the MS DOS operating system used in
IBM PCs worldwide. It can run software written for IBM PCs and also handle
Japanese language applications.
While the new operating system may eventually provide a stronger platform
for the Japanese makers, it also provides an opening in the market for
foreign makers who now need to make few adaptations to their machines to
make them saleable in Japan.
IBM has aggressively marketed in Japan its PC/55 notebook computer, which
uses DOS/V operating system. Compaq is planning to boost its presence in
Japan.
Apple, whose sales of desktop machines in Japan have been rapidly growing,
has also made a successful launch of its Powerbook notebook computer, which
is manufactured by and designed jointly with Sony.
And yet, in spite of all of this activity that challenges NEC, NEC's PC 9800
series computers so far appear unstoppable. Competitors admit that NEC's
share of the market for portable computers continues to grow. According to
NEC, its share of all PC sales now comes to 53 per cent, including 38 per
cent of laptops, and 37 per cent of notebooks in the first half of 1991.
With 4.84m PC 9800 series computers already delivered to the market, many
customers are readily returning for smaller, more powerful versions of the
same machines so they will not have to scrap old software and programmes.
And while Toshiba was a leader in introducing powerful computers in a small
package, the lead has now basically vanished.
Toshiba's main selling point is that users will have instant access to an
international body of software. Yet for most users, the 12,400 software
packages available for NEC computers, plus the cost of switching operating
systems will be enough to keep them buying NEC products. The good news for
all the companies is that there is plenty of growth left in the market since
the penetration of PCs in Japan has been much lower than in Europe or North
America. NEC, for example, believes that only 20 per cent of potential
demand has been taken up so far.
The stunning improvements in the capabilities of notebook computers since
they were introduced a few years ago has in itself been an important
stimulant to demand in Japan. This is because full-sized desktop machines
were often difficult to accommodate in crowded Japanese offices.
In spite of the poor economic climate, domestic PC shipments were up four
per cent in the six months to the end of October, while the market share for
notebooks computers rose from 28.4 per cent to 31.1 per cent.
Even though demand has probably fallen off in the subsequent months, the
prospects for further growth in the portable end of the market will provide
plenty of stimulus for computer companies to continue research into areas
where they are already strong, including LCD displays, memories, miniature
disk drives, batteries and miniaturisation in general.
The Japanese market could yet provide the platform these companies need to
make an even bigger impact overseas.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (1): Manufacturers' motto is
'smaller, faster, lighter' - Now the line between portable and notebook
computers is hard to draw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTABLE computers are now set to play a central role in the fast-moving
drama that is the world computer industry. The evidence can be seen in the
wide-ranging deal struck last month between International Business Machines,
the world's largest computer manufacturer, and Groupe Bull, the French
national computer champion.
Included as one of its more important provisions is an agreement for Bull to
supply IBM with a substantial number - perhaps up to 100,000 a year - of its
Zenith Data Systems (ZDS) portable computers. ZDS, bought by Bull two years
ago, is, along with Toshiba of Japan, a pioneer in portable computing.
The deal also provides for IBM and Bull to work together on the future
development of Zenith's portable machines.
IBM, is the world leader in desk-top personal computers, but it has a dismal
record in portables, where innovation counts for more than market muscle.
Toshiba is the market leader in portables outside Japan. The deal with Bull,
therefore, plugs an important gap in IBM's product line while providing a
welcome source of extra volume for the French company's manufacturing
facilities.
Further evidence comes from Apple Computer, the world's second largest PC
company. It moved last year into 'notebook' computers, lightweight computers
capable of being carried in a briefcase, and sold 100,000 of its PowerBook
systems in the first three months of its fiscal year. The result was
earnings well above market expectations.
If further proof was necessary, newcomers to the market are electing to make
portables rather than any other kind of personal computer. An example is
Nippon Computer Company, a subsidiary of the Japanese giant, Nippon Steel.
It is manufacturing notebook computers only, arguing that is the
fastest-growing segment of the marketplace.
It is also marketing its products outside Japan for the time being, hoping
to build a solid market base in the West before tackling the world's most
competitive notebook market.
What, these days, constitutes a portable computer? In the 1970s and 1980s,
it was a machine that could be transported safely in a car boot. Compaq
Computer of the US pioneered many of the design and manufacturing
technologies that made it possible to lug around several kilogrammes of
delicate electronics without damage.
The introduction of notebook machines, courtesy principally of Japanese
manufacturers, capable of being carried in a briefcase, but featuring a
full-size screen and keyboard, changed that perception of portable machines.
Now the dividing line between portable and notebooks is difficult to draw.
Performance is similar - both operate off either mains power or batteries.
Both have full-sized screens and fully-featured keyboards. Both use the most
powerful microprocessor chips available with memory capacity to match. The
motto for computer manufacturers has become 'smaller, faster, lighter.' It
is however, easier to distinguish between notebook computers and the latest
variety of portable machine to attract attention: handheld, palmtop or
pocket computers.
These are more versatile than electronic organisers of the Sharp IQ variety,
and more sophisticated than handheld terminals.
Among the manufacturers of pocket-sized computers are Psion and DIP of the
UK, Hewlett-Packard of the US and Poqet, a California-based company in which
Fujitsu of Japan has a substantial stake.
They offer many of the functions found in full-sized PCs of IBM design. The
best-selling Hewlett Packard model, for example, takes the user into the
Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet with a single keystroke.
The problem with all handhelds, however, is the miniature keyboard which
makes touch-typing virtually impossible, and the small screen. Based on the
best liquid crystal technology, these screens nevertheless cannot match a
back-lit display for legibility.
Handheld computers can have important roles in business (for example,
Gallahers' use of Victor machines, see page six in this survey), but the
future of portable computing seems to lie with notebooks. These light,
powerful machines are winning the fight for the hearts and minds of computer
users, but the battle for their pockets is proving stiffer.
Like the rest of the computer industry, the portable sector has been hit by
the recession in the US, parts of Europe and Australasia and by plummeting
prices. Even the once-buoyant Japanese market has lost some of its bounce.
The result is that explosive rates of revenue growth predicted for most
areas of the portable market were not sustained through 1991.
The market for notebook machines, for example, which some thought would grow
by 80 per cent last year grew only about 40 per cent, according to data from
IDC Europe. It suggests the overall market for portable machines in 1991 was
3.8m units and that the overall market grew by 39 per cent between 1990 and
1991.
Accurate numbers are hard to come by in the computer business, however.
There is, for example, wide variation between IDC's calculations and those
of Market Intelligence Research (MIRC).
Portable makers are, however, optimistic that there is substantial pent-up
demand for their products and believe that if the economic gloom lightens,
they will see substantial growth through to 1993.
Their optimism is justified by the fact that that portable computers seem to
be putting the 'personal' back into personal computing. A key element of the
PC revolution was the freedom from dependence on the data centre that it
gave individual users. Now users are seeking freedom from the physical
restraints of a desk-bound machine. The breakthrough has come about through
a series of advances in technology which have made it possible to
buildportable machines without serious compromises over performance or
price.
Where a combination of portable and desktop computing is essential, there
are docking pods, desktop units to receive the portable processing unit
providing it with better screen, keyboard and communications with other
computer systems.
There are a couple of caveats: there is some way to go in power management
techniques and the development of full colour, high definition screens
before portable computers will be the equal of desk-top machines.
High definition liquid crystal colour screens are already available, but in
small quantities. They are complex to manufacture. Yields are low - less
than 50 per cent, at times - and prices are high. Amstrad of the UK, one of
the first of the low-cost suppliers to realise the growth potential in
portables sells its ACL 386SX for Pounds 3,999 in the UK. Sharp's equivalent
is Pounds 5,995; Toshiba's is Pounds 5,450. There is a market where
conventional IBM clones can be had for Pounds 1,000 or less.
Battery technology, despite research which has made possible
nickel-metal-hydride and lithium batteries as a potential replacement for
the common used nickel-cadmium cells, is advancing more slowly than any
other aspect of portable computing.
The most promising technique to data has been power management - controlling
software which switches off the power to any part of the computer not
actually being used. Rotating disk drives and illuminated screens soak up
power rapidly, for example.
The performance of the tiny disk drives found in portable computers has
improved remarkably.
IBM, for example, has developed a 3.5 inch drive which it calls 'Corsair'
capable of storing a gigabyte(billion bytes) of data. In a short time, the
60 megabyte (million bytes) drives commonly found in today's portables will
look like museum pieces.
Rotating magnetic memory, however, may well give way to 'flash eprom',
semiconductor memory which retains information stored in its circuitry even
when the power is switched off. Flash memories can easily be programmed and
erased.
Intel of the US, the world leader in flash memory has recently signed an
agreement with Sharp of Japan to develop jointly succeeding generations of
flash memory chips.
Announcing the deal, Mr Richard Pashley, Intel's general manager, looked
forward to a portable computer less than an inch thick and weighing only
about 250 grammes. At a price of Dollars 200 and with a 200-hour battery
life, he thought such machines would be available by the end of the decade.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (12): Popularity and pragmatism -
Profile of Ramon 'Monching' Mitra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAMON MITRA, the 63-year old Speaker of the House of Representatives, used
to run barefoot to school, earned pennies herding cattle on horse-back and
was apprenticed to a crocodile hunter at the age of 11.
Unlike many of the presidential candidates who rediscover humble origins as
elections approach, his claim to 'know the pain of hunger and what it means
to sleep without having your dinner' carries a ring of truth.
As Speaker he has cut political deals and came closest to uniting a
fractious set of congressmen behind President Corazon Aquino's party, even
if a number of his bills have been shot down in the Senate.
Such a mixture of populist politician and pragmatic party man should make Mr
Mitra the 'candidate to beat' in presidential elections on May 11. But he
lacks one important ingredient: President Corazon Aquino's support. Last
month, Mrs Aquino threw her support behind his opponent in the ruling LDP
party, retired General Fidel Ramos, even though the party had chosen Mr
Mitra at a party convention as the candidate.
Mrs Aquino's reservations appear to be based on the commonly aired view that
Mr Mitra, who has built the strongest party machinery throughout the
country, is a 'traditional politician'. This less-than-flattering epithet in
the Philippines contains the suggestion of unacceptable amounts of
patronage.
Having lived for 20 years with President Marcos's brand of patronage
politics, many Filipinos view almost any form of political horse-trading
with deep suspicion.
Mr Mitra has also been linked with illegal logging in Palawan through a
local concessionaire and old friend. He denies the charges but some of the
mud has stuck, at least in Manila.
Whether his image is tainted in the countryside remains to be seen. His
early life certainly could not have been better scripted for a politician. A
rich businessman by the time he became House Speaker in 1987, he was born
the illegitimate son of a half-American mother and the superintendent of a
penal colony on Palawan Island.
His mother died when he was 11 months old after his father left for Manila
and he was raised in poverty by her family. After escaping from the Japanese
army during the Second World War, he was reunited with his father - by that
time a Philippines congressman - and began an expensive education that led
him to journalism, foreign service at the United Nations, commercial farming
and politics.
On the economic policy front, Mr Mitra espouses much of the market
liberalisation on which many businessmen are pinning hopes of recovery. He
is in favour of opening up the economy to foreign investment and competition
and letting the peso find a more realistic international exchange rate.
And his solution for the burgeoning domestic debt problem is textbook
economics: not new taxes, but better collection of existing ones. This
suggestion has been less than enthusiastically received in Manila. It
explains, he believes, why his candidacy has yet to gain popular support.

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (9): Recovery hopes - Regional
Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN miles south of Manila airport, in rolling agricultural land, there is a
frenzy of factory building quite at odds with the widely-held view that the
Philippines economy is stagnating.
Cavite Province's rice fields are sprouting a crop of industrial parks,
export zones, new arterial roads and microwave communications links on the
back of a wave of enthusiasm from foreign and local investors.
Once called 'The Badlands' because of its reputation as a refuge for
bandits, Cavite is now the focus of efforts to develop an industrial belt to
the south of Manila.
Governor Juanito Remulla says his zone of 'industrial peace and
productivity' has attracted 20bn pesos of investments since 1986 and has
directly created 45,000 new jobs. About half the investment is from Japan,
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the US and the rest from large local groups
such as San Miguel.
With the Philippines economy shrinking in real per capita terms last year by
2.5 per cent, Cavite is one of several regional pockets of activity that are
keeping recovery hopes alive.
Cebu City, on the central island of Cebu, is perhaps the best known example.
In the past three years it has left the rest of the country behind in terms
of growth, investment and attractiveness to foreign investors.
A bustling port and trading centre, it is dominated by Filipino-Chinese
businessmen with little time for what politicians and government are doing
in Manila. It has marketed an image of a peaceful 'Island in the Pacific'
divorced from the problems of politically fog-bound Manila.
'The Manila businessman spends his time trying to influence government to
get grants and policy changes,' says one Manila-based Filipino banker. 'The
Cebuano knows he has no access so he just dives in and swims. He could not
care less about government policy.'
As a result, Cebu has developed a thriving native furniture export industry,
a large trade in seaweed to the US and an active coconut oil export
business.
About half the companies operating out of the Mactan export processing zone
are Japanese. Exports from this area have grown about 15 per cent annually
over the past three years, despite a wayward typhoon in 1990 which damaged
infrastructure and threatened to derail the regional boom.
For the domestic market, Cebu has also become the southern Philippines
centre for cement production, scrap iron consolidation, and a large flour
milling and beer brewing centre.
Common to Cebu and the newer but equally promising Cavite, are strong
provincial leaders and access to international airports. Cebu's was upgraded
by the Americans during the Vietnam war. Governor Emilio Osmena in Cebu is
pressing ahead with plans to upgrade the regional infrastructure. With one
of the largest local developers, Ayala Land, the local government has tapped
private capital, issuing the country's first municipal bonds or CEBU's (Cebu
Equity Bond Units).
He has also attracted pledges of more than 5bn pesos in development
assistance from Japan and has cut swathes through Manila's red tape,
encouraging a 'can-do' mentality.
In Cavite, the firm hand comes from Governor Remulla who has taken 10 years
to consolidate diversely-held land holdings so that more than 4,000ha are
now available for industrial uses. 'Local government should concentrate on
inviting in investors to get exports and more foreign exchange,' he says.
The most advanced development is the 277ha export processing zone at
Rosario, Cavite where more than 100 companies have invested or are about to
start building. Investors include a glass manufacturing joint venture
between Yamamura of Japan and San Miguel; the US computer components maker
Commodore Electronics; Yasaki, the Japanese car parts maker; Maxon, a Korean
portable telephone manufacturer; Clarion, the Japanese audio company; and
Cavite Apparel, a local exporter of suits and garments.
About half the investment in Cavite has so far gone to the export processing
zones where exporters are exempt from import levies and have their own
dedicated customs officials to reduce bureaucratic delay.
But Mr Remulla is also encouraging development of private business parks and
export zones. The biggest are the 160ha Gateway Business Park where the
developers, the local de los Reyes family, claim 'Asia's greatest rewards
await', and the 500ha First Cavite Industrial Estate, a joint venture
between Marubeni of Japan and the government's National Development Corp.
Throughout the country these export zones accounted for about Dollars 819m,
or 10 per cent of the country's exports in 1991. The industries they attract
are mainly assembly operations adding little local value other than labour -
as the Dollars 584m figure for imports into the zones suggests.
Nevertheless, with foreign exchange and import liberalisation likely to
improve local quality and competitiveness, economists expect domestic
sourcing for exports to increase.
Just as regions such as Cebu and Cavite are seen as small engines of
recovery, so regional development has received an additional boost.
Last October, the senate approved a new local government code which will
allow local authorities, particularly in the cities, to spend more of the
taxes they collect.
It is a bold experiment in local democracy, after years of centralisation,
that was driven by frustration with Manila's slow disbursement of funds.
Businessmen and economists agree the new code should allow more local
leaders to develop the infrastructure from which more Cebus could sprout.
