FT  08 FEB 92 / Major pledges more scrutiny of councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, will today reinforce the government's
commitment to legislation which will subject councils to more independent
scrutiny. He will also underline the extension of private ownership,
individual freedom and choice in a speech to the Young Conservatives'
conference in Eastbourne.
The prime minister will use his speech to set out more details of his
party's manifesto and to try to frustrate Labour's hopes of exploiting
voters' dissatisfaction with council services.
Councils are setting poll tax levels and households may start to receive
bills early in April - close to one of the dates thought likely for the
general election. Tory efforts so far have focused on blaming Labour
councils for setting high bills.
Mr Major's speech will set out plans for publishing league tables of
councils' performance. There would also be more contracting out of council
services if the Tories won the election.
Details of how more independent scrutiny could be introduced have yet to be
worked out, but could involve an enhanced role for the Audit Commission, the
local-government watchdog.
Mr Major's speech will build on the principles behind the Citizen's Charter
which he unveiled last year. He will say that the re-election of a Tory
government will mean 'no more municipal cover-ups and no hiding place for
incompetent and uncaring councils'.
Besides seeking to increase Tory appeal to young voters, Mr Major will
outline four principles of his Conservative philosophy: ownership,
responsibility, choice and individual freedom. Part of his speech will be
aimed at encouraging the growth of a 'property-owning democracy', in spite
of the flat housing market.
He will also launch a fresh attack on Labour's economic policies, saying
that the Opposition party has no proposals for strengthening the economic
recovery when it comes, but many which would lead to a perpetual recession.
Tories want to use the conference to counter claims that it has run out of
ideas.
Mr Major is particularly keen to emphasise that the Citizen's Charter
involves a long programme of legislation for another four or five-year
government.
However, Labour and the Liberal Democrats continue to focus largely on the
economy - particularly the job cuts announced yesterday by Ford, the
carmaker.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, last night said Britain had
suffered 'the worst problems of boom and bust, exaggerated by
mismanagement'.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Kinnock pours scorn on 'complacent' PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday signalled a fresh readiness to hold Mr John Major
personally responsible for the government's failures, claiming that his
monument would be 'the longest recession since the 1930s'.
In a speech that echoed Labour's 1964 slogan of '13 years of Tory misrule',
the Labour leader claimed that the government had 'no new policies, no fresh
ideas and no positive solutions'.
His keynote address to Labour's annual local government conference in
Blackpool was also squarely aimed at tarnishing Tory efforts to project a
'softer' image in the run-up to the election.
In a series of scornful attacks, he repeatedly portrayed Mr Major as
deluded, complacent and out of touch.
Taking up a recent reference by the prime minister to people sleeping rough,
he said Mr Major's withdrawal of benefits from people aged 16 to 18 when he
was social security minister meant he himself was 'the architect of
cardboard city'.
The Tories sought to pre-empt the occasion by challenging Labour to use the
conference to spell out its own local government plans.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, used his first setpiece press
conference of the pre-election campaign to launch a broad attack which
included assaults on the cost of Labour's plans and the behaviour of Labour
councils.
Mr Kinnock countered the attacks on Labour councils' records by claiming
that authorities under his party's control had persistently topped the
leagues for the provision of a wide range of public services.
He turned to the government's economic record, arguing that the government
had squandered Pounds 100bn in North Sea oil revenues and Pounds 34bn in
privatisation proceeds.
'They have run through more taxes than any British government has ever taken
from the British people in history,' he said. 'At the end of it all, they
have higher unemployment, wider poverty, run-down services, closed
industries, greater insecurity and homelessness.'
As a result, the UK was enduring skill shortages alongside mass
unemployment, a trade deficit in a slump and a collapse in investment in an
oil-rich economy.
Speaking confidently to some 800 delegates, Mr Kinnock concentrated his
speech on the Tory record. He argued that 'investment must come before tax
cuts', and said the Tories had promised a thriving enterprise economy but
had delivered only a weakened economy deep in recession. 'They promised a
classless society, a society at ease with itself, but they have made a
society that is scarred by poverty, by disadvantage and by insecurity. They
have had their chance.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Bank issues new gilt-edged stock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is creating a 20-year government bond in its first issue
of a new gilt-edged security for nearly four years.
The Bank's announcement yesterday that it is issuing Pounds 1.25bn of the 9
per cent Treasury stock due 2012 was well-received in the gilt market. The
issue will be available from Monday and is expected to appeal to domestic
and foreign institutional investors such as pension and life funds.
The Pounds 1.25bn gilt is too small at present to provide a useful 20-year
benchmark, but the Bank is likely to issue further amounts of the stock to
create a more liquid issue.
With the government's return to borrowing in the gilt-edged market last
year, the Bank will have issued a total of Pounds 15bn in gilt-edged stock
during the 1991-92 financial year, including the latest issue.
The Bank took advantage of the strong performance of the bond market this
week to sell Pounds 550m of medium and long-dated gilts.
Economists at UBS Phillips and Drew expect the Bank to issue up to Pounds
33bn in the 1992-93 tax year.

A BILL designed to combat cheque fraud completed its passage through the
Commons yesterday.
The Cheques Bill seeks to impose a legal requirement on banks to ensure that
cheques crossed 'account payee', either with or without the word 'only', are
not transferred to any other account.
The private member's bill was introduced by Mr Conal Gregory, Conservative
MP for York, and had all-party support. It gives effect to representations
made by the Banking Ombudsman and the Consumers' Association.
The bill, which now goes to the House of Lords, would also impose a
liability on banks if they accept cheques bearing fraudulent endorsements.

THE BEHAVIOUR of some companies selling timeshare properties borders on the
'fraudulent', Mr Andrew Hunter, Conservative MP for Basingstoke, told the
Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He secured an unopposed second reading for a private member's bill requiring
a 14-day 'cooling-off' for timeshare contracts. Mr Edward Leigh, consumer
affairs minister, promised full government support.
Mr Hunter said the offer of prizes persuaded some people to attend
'presentations' during which 'every trick in the book' was used to induce
them to sign a contract.
Mr Leigh said the Department of Trade and Industry received more complaints
about the timeshare sector than about any other in industry.

FT  08 FEB 92 / New rules on package holidays proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced draft regulations for package holidays,
but postponed a decision on how to protect consumers when travel companies
collapse.
The regulations, which were announced by Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs
minister, were immediately attacked by the Association of British Travel
Agents (Abta) for failing to protect consumers adequately against
unjustified surcharges and negligence by tour operators.
The draft rules set out information to be included in travel brochures and
the circumstances in which surcharges can be imposed. They follow a 1990
European Community directive which requires regulations to protect package
tourists to be brought in by the end of the year.
Ministers want to consult further on how best to deal with the most
contentious provision of the directive. This says that tour organisers and
travel agents should provide security to ensure that tourists can be
repatriated and receive refunds if their holiday company collapses.
The government has said it will require all companies offering package
holidays to be licensed, but it has not decided who should be responsible
for issuing licences or how many licensing authorities there should be. It
said it hoped to produce proposals on licensing within the next few weeks.
One option would be to allow the Civil Aviation Authority, which licenses
charter-flight tour operators, to regulate all package tour companies. Some
travel companies believe the government might also be considering allowing
the industry to establish its own regulatory bodies.
Earlier proposals presented in July were criticised for suggesting
restrictions on surcharges that were less onerous than those in Abta's code
of practice. The government had suggested that tour operators should not be
able to impose surcharges within 20 days of departure, compared with 30 days
under the Abta code.
Mr Leigh said the new regulations on surcharges were in line with those in
the Abta code.
Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's president, said that the surcharges would be
inadequate without an effective monitoring scheme.
He added that the regulations also provided consumers with inadequate
protection against acts of negligence by tour operators.
Mr Dunscombe said: 'I am particularly disappointed that our argument for
liability insurance has not been accepted by the government, and we shall
continue to push for its acceptance.'

FT  08 FEB 92 / Curbs on direct power sales by generators are eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's largest generating companies are to be allowed to sell more
electricity directly to big industrial consumers rather than through
regional distributors.
The move, announced yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild,
director-general of electricity supply, is intended to sharpen competition
among suppliers and help ease recessionary pressures on industry. It is part
of Prof Littlechild's longer-term plans to reduce regulatory barriers in the
power market.
The move comes only days after some of the UK's largest companies threatened
to withhold payment of the Fossil Fuel Levy in protest at recent electricity
price rises. The levy, which is added to bills, goes to subsidise the
nuclear industry in England and Wales.
Prof Littlechild said yesterday: 'There is no doubt that the present
recession, combined with the recent and prospective increases in electricity
prices, have hit many large customers very hard indeed. The need to purchase
electricity on the most competitive terms possible is more important than
ever.'
At present there are limits on how much electricity the generators can sell
direct. In most of the 12 regions in England and Wales this is 7 per cent of
the electricity sold, though in some industrial areas it is up to 12.5 per
cent.
Prof Littlechild said yesterday that he was raising the limit to 9 per cent
in most areas, and up to 17.5 per cent in the industrial areas, from April
1. The limits will be removed from April next year.
Initially the new limits apply only to National Power, which represents 40
per cent of the generating market, but they are expected to be extended soon
to PowerGen, which accounts for a further 30 per cent. The rule allowing
generators to sell electricity only to companies whose maximum demand is
more than 1MW will remain.
Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users Council and Conservative
MP for Erewash, welcomed the move but said many of his members were still
worried that this year's electricity supply contracts would contain large
price increases. Some of them might go ahead with the boycott of the Fossil
Fuel Levy.
National Power also welcomed the change. It said an outbreak of aggressive
selling was unlikely because negotiations on many of this year's contracts
were already nearly complete. But the company was up against its limits in
many of the regions, and the change would 'ease the position', it said.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Tokyo cleared in mercury poison case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COURT yesterday cleared the Japanese government of responsibility for a
notorious outbreak of mercury poisoning, which became a symbol of the price
Japan paid for its rapid industrialisation.
About 1,200 have died since the poisoning was first detected in the 1950s in
villages around Minamata Bay in southern Japan. More than 100,000 are
believed to have been affected through eating fish poisoned by mercury
pumped into the bay by Chisso, a chemicals company.
The victims have pressed various law suits against Chisso, the government
and the prefectural authorities alleging negligence. They claim the
authorities should have controlled the discharge of effluent from the Chisso
plant and the sale of fish.
Yesterday, the Tokyo district court, hearing a claim by a group of 64
victims, confirmed a 1987 lower court ruling that Chisso was responsible for
the poisoning. But it overturned a judgment against the government and the
prefecture.
The court ordered Chisso to pay compensation of Y4m (Pounds 18,000) to 42
plaintiffs. The judge ruled that the remaining 22 had not necessarily
suffered from the poisoning, called 'Minamata disease'.
Mr Shinji Arai, the judge, urged the government and the prefecture to settle
out of court with the victims, since they bore 'political responsibility'.
Lawyers for the victims immediately said they would appeal to the Supreme
Court, a process which could take several years. The victims held protest
meetings outside Chisso's headquarters in Tokyo and the offices of the
government's environmental agency.
With the suit likely to go to appeal and other cases involving 2,000 more
plaintiffs still outstanding, the victims have a long fight ahead. They
scored their first success 20 years ago when Chisso agreed to start paying
compensation (without admitting full legal responsibility.)
A major argument concerns government procedures for identifying those
entitled to compensation. By the end of last year 15,838 Minamata victims
had either applied or were applying for compensation. Of these only 2,942
were formally approved and 7,405 had been rejected.
The 64 whose case was heard yesterday were among those who had not been
approved - the fact that 42 of them were judged by the court to qualify for
compensation raises questions about the government's tests.
Minamata victims shocked the world and embarrassed Japan when they attended
a world environment conference in Stockholm in 1972. A group plans to go to
Rio de Janiero for this year's United Nations Earth Summit to show that
their case is not yet closed.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Drugs industry declares record trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pharmaceutical industry had a record trade surplus last year of Pounds
1.17bn, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
The figure represented an increase of 6.7 per cent on the previous year.
Exports grew by 12.8 per cent to Pounds 2.54bn while imports increased by
18.5 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn.
The figures will support the industry's arguments for maintaining the
present pricing structure, which encourages investment.
The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, which ends in November, fixes a
cap on the return on equity employed by companies. By investing in research
and development or manufacturing in the UK, pharmaceuticals groups are
allowed, under the scheme, to charge higher prices.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health minister, said last month that she intended
to create an open and competitive market providing safe and effective
medicines at an acceptable cost to the taxpayer. She added that she
recognised the important position of the pharmaceutical industry in
continuing research.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Local poll in Romania will test ruling National Salvation
Front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S first democratic local government elections in Romania for over
five decades are expected to show if the ruling National Salvation Front
(NSF) will retain the majority in the forthcoming parliamentary elections
and if a united opposition can emerge as a strong political party.
The elections for 40,000 mayors and 109,000 commune councils will also
reveal if the power of the mayors in the 40 counties can finally be broken,
and brought under greater accountability.
Under the Ceausescu regime, and the NSF government which was catapulted into
power following the violent overthrow of the Ceausescus in December 1989,
communist mayors have wielded enormous political, economic and social
influence at the local level.
Despite winning a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections in June
1990, the NSF is no longer confident it can retain control over local
government which serves as one of its main power bases.
Not only is the NSF divided between conservatives/former communists, and
social democrats anxious to speed up reform; it also faces what appears to
be the beginnings of a united opposition movement.
In most counties in Transylvania, for example, the Liberal and National
Peasant parties, the two 'historic' parties of the inter-war period, which
together obtained only 13 per cent of the vote in 1990, have united with the
local Hungarian Democratic Union party.
Even in Bucharest, the capital, all the opposition parties, including the
party of the Civic Alliance, a movement of intellectuals, are standing on
one ticket.
Beset by economic difficulties, the NSF, led by Mr Petre Roman, former prime
minister, has responded to this united opposition by playing the nationalist
card.
Sections of the media are whipping up anti-Hungarian and anti-semitic
sentiment, and calls are increasing for re-unification with the neighbouring
former Soviet republic of Moldova.
In several counties in Tranyslvania the NSF has united with the ultra
nationalist Romanian National Union Party (RNUP).

SERB leaders from the republic of Croatia yesterday called for a referendum
on a United Nations plan to deploy 10,000 peacekeepers in a move which
coincides with a report by a prominent international human rights
organisation alleging Croat atrocities against Serbian civilians.
Mr Zdenko Tosic, a spokesman of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of
Krajina, southern Croatia, said that within one month the people of Krajina,
southern Croatia, would vote on the UN peace initiative.
Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president, opposes the UN plan on the grounds that
the plan will not bring a 'lasting peace' to Krajina. He also objects to
plans by the UN to disband Krajina's Serb irregulars, as well as the
withdrawal of the federal army from Krajina when UN peacekeepers have been
deployed.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, is trying to persuade local
politicians in Krajina to support the plan with promises of food and aid.
Meanwhile, Ms Jeri Laber, the director of Helsinki Watch, the New York-based
human rights organisation, earlier this week told a human rights commission
of the US Congress that 'Croatian forces have abducted Serbian civilians,
many of whom remain missing or have been found bestially murdered.' The
report alleges that last October uniformed Croats abducted between 130 and
150 Serbs.

FRANCE'S opposition parties yesterday called for early general elections, in
a censure motion condemning the government's handling of the Habash affair.
The opposition motion was tabled during an emergency parliamentary debate on
the controversial hospitalisation last week in Paris of Palestinian leader
Georges Habbash.
The censure motion, which will be voted on next Tuesday, is almost bound to
fall short of the necessary majority, because the Communist Party has said
it will not vote for it.
Introducing yesterday's debate, Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister,
accused the opposition parties of exaggeration. She said they were trying to
make a political affair out of what was really an 'administrative error',
which had rapidly been put right.
But the opposition claimed 'the authority of the state has been compromised
by the serious disorders which affect its functioning, and by the moral and
political crisis of the country'. Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
has proposed that the National Assembly should respond by passing a law
dissolving itself.

<TEXT>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and French President Francois Mitterrand
pictured yesterday exchanging a treaty on a new partnership based on
'confidence, solidarity and co-operation'.
Signed at the end of a three-day state visit by the Russian president, the
agreement is entitled 'Treaty between France and Russia', and effectively
replaces the 'Franco-Soviet Treaty of Understanding and Co-operation' signed
with President Mikhail Gorbachev in October 1990, but never ratified, writes
Ian Davidson from Paris.
The treaty promises more intensive consultations between the two countries,
and says the two governments will co-operate with a view to the conclusion
of a European security treaty. The two governments also stress the
importance of nuclear disarmament, which they say should aim to bring down
nuclear arsenals to levels of 'minimal sufficiency'.
France insists that it will not take part in nuclear disarmament until the
arsenals of the superpowers have been brought down to comparable levels,
though President Mitterrand now says that France may be prepared to slow its
nuclear modernisation in response to nuclear disarmament by the superpowers.
President Yeltsin said he respected the French position.

FT  08 FEB 92 / Hurd sees 20-member Community by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is looking forward to an enlarged European Community of up to 20
members by the turn of the century, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary said yesterday.
Mr Hurd, addressing the Cambridge University Conservative Association, said
there was a consensus that the Community could not 'put up the shutters' on
the nations in the other half of Europe.
The first wave of enlargement was likely to come from the ranks of the
European Free Trade Association. It would involve countries such as Austria
and Sweden, who had already applied for membership and, in the longer run,
probably Finland, Norway and Switzerland.
Issues such as agriculture and neutrality would need careful negotiation
with these countries, but it should be possible to welcome new members by
1995.
That would be only the first step, however.
The association agreements concluded by the Community with Poland, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia last December should be seen as a preparatory phase for
full membership.
'There should be no doubt about our determination to welcome them as full
members. I hope to see this achieved by the year 2,000 at the latest.'
While it was not possible at the moment to predict how many members the
Community could accommodate or in what timescale, it would be foolish to
start ruling out membership of any European democracies when they were
ready, including even the newly independent republics of the former Soviet
Union.
Mr Hurd recognised, however, that the enlargement of the Community raised
questions about the institutional structure of the Community. It had been
designed originally for six member states and had been adapted to work for
twelve. But it was much more doubtful whether it would be suitable for as
many as 20 or 30 members.
The foreign secretary rejected greater centralised powers for the
Community's institutions as a way of dealing with wider membership.

<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in orders for west German manufactured goods in December was an
important indicator of the 'unstable' business climate, Mr Jurgen Mollemann,
economics minister, said yesterday. But Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank
director, said later that he was not worried about the economic situation.
The 2.5 per cent fall in real terms, announced yesterday, followed three
months of flat demand, and added to the gathering concern about medium-term
economic prospects.
The week began with an inflationary 6.35 per cent pay award for steel
workers, closely followed by news that the manufacturing production index
had dropped almost four points in December.
Then the government published figures which showed a surge in unemployment,
taking the national jobless total to more than 3m.
Mr Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, said the effects of Christmas
holidays made it difficult to interpret industrial data.
Domestic industrial orders fell 4 per cent in December, although there was
some encouragement in a 0.5 per cent rise in export demand, the first
increase since last July.
The results for the full year showed an overall increase in orders of 0.4
per cent, thanks mainly to a rise in domestic demand of around 4 per cent,
which cancelled out a 6 per cent decline in export markets.
Most economic growth forecasts, recently down-graded, and suggesting a 1.5
per cent increase in GNP this year, assume falling domestic demand and a
gradual increase in exports as foreign markets recover from recession.
The government, Germany's largest employer, went on the offensive yesterday
at the start of a crucial bout of pay negotiations with public service
workers.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, said the 2.3m federal, state and local
authority employees in west Germany could not expect an increase 'even
approaching' last year's 6 per cent award.
'Everyone involved in these negotiations must be clear that we are not
talking only about public servants' pay, but also about the stability of the
D-Mark and the redevelopment of the new (eastern) federal states,' he said
in an opening address.
And he warned that 'recession would be almost unavoidable' if the conflict
between monetary and pay policies sharpened.
OTV, the main union, which has asked for 9.5 per cent and an extra DM550
(Pounds 191.60) holiday pay, promised 'bitter resistance' if the employers
tried to turn the pay talks into a 'punishment mission' against its members.
But Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, the OTV leader, stressed her willingness to
negotiate. 'Pay claims are not dictates', she said, urging the employers to
make a negotiable offer quickly.
Mr Seiters' aggressive speech, aimed also at the 350,000 railway and post
office employees seeking the same deal as OTV, reflected concern in Bonn
that last weekend's 6.35 per cent increase for steel workers has been
adopted as this year's 'guideline'.

FT  07 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The striking thing about the price deal announced yesterday between eight of
the UK's regional electricity companies and their regulator was the ease
with which it was reached. Clearly the RECs could teach the generators a
thing or two about keeping on the right side of the Office of Electricity
Regulation (Offer). Granted, Offer adopted a moderate position from the
outset last October, so the odds were always on the companies avoiding a
damaging confrontation. Yesterday's modest settlement on next year's price
increases means they will not have to compromise their progressive dividend
policies. Consumers have less reason to be pleased. But at least the
settlement means they will pay Pounds 35m less next year in compensation for
having been overcharged before.
Neither do the RECs have much to fear from Offer's remarks on the general
need to reduce the role of inflation forecasts in setting prices. The
implication seems to be that Offer would prefer to impose its own central
forecast. That might prove awkward if Offer were to err persistently on the
low side; but if so, it would bear the blame for subsequent price increases.
True to form, the RECs' shares barely reacted yesterday. Over the last year,
the shares have been moved principally by political sentiment. The curious
thing is that the sector's present yield premium to the market is not far
short of past peaks coinciding with Labour's largest leads in the opinion
polls. While the market is demanding such a wide degree of comfort, there
seems little additional investment risk attached to a Labour victory. If the
Tories were to be re-elected, the shares would be correspondingly cheap.

FT  07 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the next few days the shares of Redland, Steetley and Tarmac - worth
Pounds 3bn combined - should be left to political insiders. Sharp price
movements in all three seem likely next week when Brussels gives its verdict
on whether the proposed Tarmac-Steetley joint venture in building materials
should be dealt with under EC or UK law.
This is the first time London has asked to handle a case which, strictly
speaking, comes within the scope of EC merger rules. The outcome looks
finely balanced, though slightly tilted in favour of the UK. Mr Peter
Lilley, trade and industry secretary, is on solid ground given that the
activities to be put into the joint venture are all based in the UK. But
when sensitive questions of Brussels competence are concerned, one can never
be sure.
The most intriguing question, though, is the implication for Redland's
Pounds 600m bid for Steetley, which is too small to be referred to Brussels
in the first place. Redland has made most of the early running and, subject
to any trump cards Steetley has up its sleeve, looks the probable winner.
But since the competitive issues in the two bids are broadly similar, it
obviously matters a good deal whether they are dealt with in the same
jurisdiction, namely the UK. If so, it is equally crucial whether they are
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission without disposal
conditions, or whether they are allowed to give undertakings to dispose of
clay roof tile and/or brick plants in a way that makes their deals
acceptable.
In both cases it is possible to make a regional case for and against
excessive concentration in bricks. But it is hardly strong. Continued
overcapacity and record stockpiles mean that there is little danger of big
price jumps even in the medium term. Given the chance, the OFT's outgoing
director general, Sir Gordon Borrie, should for once set aside his
suspicions of the building materials industry and let both deals be decided
by shareholders.

FT  07 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: The logic of the contrarian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,534.3 (-12.8)
The world seems to have taken on a particularly bearish tone just lately. A
few days ago, the head of one of the UK's biggest companies suggested
privately that economic recovery, in the sense of a return to the good days
of the 1980s, was not going to happen at all. Yesterday the chief central
bankers of both Japan and Germany said that they saw no reason to ease
interest rates. James Capel, normally one of the chirpier London brokers,
has just published a circular dwelling on the dire hypothesis that the next
big Tokyo earthquake is overdue. It is enough to make the contrarian buy
anything on sight.
The first step might be to look at what has fallen furthest in the past
year. In the UK market, this produces the usual suspects: contracting,
property, composite insurers and metal-bashers: or among FT-SE stocks,
Tarmac, British Aerospace, Lonrho, Royal Insurance and British Steel. Some
of the stocks might be worth considering for their takeover potential. When
it comes to the sectors, there is a broader question: what are the economic
conditions which would make them cheap?
The obvious answer is the traditional one; a fall in real interest rates,
produced by the usual combination of lower nominal rates and rising
inflation. This is just the solution the German and Japanese central bankers
were explicitly rejecting yesterday. In the UK's case, it would also involve
a strong inflationary rise in asset prices - houses especially - and of
course devaluation. There is a theoretical alternative, consisting of real
productivity-led growth in output. But that would take time, and would also
involve the UK outpacing its international competitors. It all comes back to
a familiar conclusion: the only quick fix for the UK economy is to leave the
ERM, and damn the consequences.

Wall Street
The secondary market rally ran out of steam yesterday afternoon and primary
stocks dithered in a narrowly mixed range as investors waited for today's
release of January's employment figures, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.01 lower at 3,255.59 in moderate
volume of 238.2m shares. Big board advancing issues led declines by 894 to
773. The Nasdaq composite, gave up its highs on the day but consolidated its
record closes on Wednesday and Tuesday by adding 0.70 to 637.67 in late
trading. On Wednesday, the Dow closed at 3,257.60, down 15.21.
Among featured issues, Owens-Corning surged Dollars 7 5/8 to Dollars 36 5/8
after the newly-appointed chairman of the glass fibre group said that the
company had taken a non-cash charge of Dollars 800m against fourth quarter
earnings to cover future asbestos claims.
The prospect of fewer problem loans at Continental Bank helped the company's
shares climb Dollars 1 to Dollars 15. Other bank stock's continued to rally
including Citicorp, up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 7/8 and Chemical Bank,
Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 30 5/8 .
Strong chain store sales figures for January, albeit on the back of sharp
price-cutting, helped a number of retailers post gains, as the market
responded to reports of lower inventories. Wal-Mart ended the day down
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 54 3/4 . But Sears closed Dollars 1 1/2 higher at
Dollars 43 7/8 , JC Penney rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 59 7/8 and May
Department Stores was up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 58 3/8 .
In the oil services sector, Dresser Industries rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
20 3/4 in active trading after it announced plans to spin-off its industrial
and mining equipment divisions to shareholders. Transportation stocks
continued to firm, with the Dow Jones Transportation Index adding 8.78 to
1,392.19 after a gain of 15.14 on Wednesday. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, the
last of the big US-owned tyre makers, edged Dollars 1 1/4 lower to Dollars
62 1/8 .
Eastman Kodak, which led the Dow lower on Wednesday when it dropped Dollars
4 1/4 on the back of its fourth quarter loss, added Dollars 1/4 to Dollars
46 3/4 yesterday in active trading.
Canada
TORONTO share prices strayed little from the previous closing level, but
trading remained strong.
The composite index edged 0.85 points upwards or 0.02 per cent to 3,606.70,
as advancing issues topped decliners 310 to 286. Volume was 30.3m against
32.1m the day before, with trading value CDollars 383.8m against CDollars
323.7m.

to stabilise

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN GOLD production is forecast to stabilise at about 230 tonnes over
the next five years, after reaching an estimated 235 tonnes in 1991-92, the
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics said yesterday.
Production of 235 tonnes in 1991 was above levels forecast last year and was
achieved in spite of the removal of a tax break for gold companies and low
world prices.
Mr John Cairns, the bureau's principal research officer on ferrous and
precious metals, said production forecasts for the next five years had been
raised because of expectations of stronger nominal prices, based in turn on
forecasts of a recovery in world economic activity.
He thought that Australian gold export earnings would rise moderately to
about ADollars 3.8bn (Pounds 1.56bn) this year and to more than ADollars
3.5bn in 1992-93, before easing slightly in real terms in the three ensuing
years.
He added that foreign sourced gold was expected to remain a significant
component of the total export value and could exceed forecast levels if new
refining contracts could be obtained.
Meanwhile Mr Campbell Anderson, the chief executive of Renison Gold Fields
Consolidated, said that mine production this decade would be driven largely
by gold consumers, principally those buying jewellery.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU leader calls for
market-friendly farming - David Naish believes UK growers accept the need
for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW INVESTMENT, falling incomes, job losses and uncertainty over political
reforms have continued to batter the UK farm sector over the past 12 months
since David Naish became president of the National Farmers' Union.
But he believes that the farmers have taken on board the need to change
their attitudes and get a lot closer to the market. He will be urging his
members to become even more businesslike when he addresses his first annual
general meeting as president on Tuesday next week.
'The willingness of farmers to accept new disciplines has been amazing,' he
said. This does not apply only to the marketing side of farming. 'Four years
ago could you have seen farmers through their trade organisation offering an
animal welfare policy, a pesticide residue policy, an environment policy?
They recognise they've got to actually live with all the other organisations
and people who care about what happens in the countryside.'
But the need for professionalism when it is time to sell the crop remains
uppermost in his mind. 'I am extraordinarily keen that farmers don't believe
that they can just respray themselves and be professional market men.'
The Food from the Countryside scheme is a key part of the NFU's new policy.
A help desk has been set up each of the nine regional offices for people who
are even thinking about simple collaborative ventures. In April a series of
workshops will start with speakers from successful collaborative ventures as
well as food industry representatives and buyers who can explain what they
are looking for from the farmers.
All the other professional bodies needed to create a successful venture will
be represented, including all five clearing banks, accountants, and
management consultancies.
The workshops will be followed up with a series of regional food fares where
the multiple retailers, manufacturers and caterers will be available to any
groups who are thinking of becoming what Mr Naish terms 'reservoirs of
British produce'.
But he does not believe it is in the farmers' interests to form millions
more ventures. Rather they should join existing organisations, not just to
get more muscle against the supermarkets' buying power but in order to be
'to be able to guarantee the level of supply that's required to get access
to those multi-distributional warehouses or the manufacturity of supply to
keep the warehouses running'.
Much criticism has been aimed at the supermarkets by the farming community.
At the recent Oxford Farming Conference, one of the speakers had to
apologise after jokingly asking the difference between a supermarket buyer
and a terrorist. Answer: you can negotiate with a terrorist. However, Mr
Naish refuses to be critical of supermarket profits.
'I'm not going to snipe in any way at retailer markets because they get
those margins either because we're weak sellers or they're very strong
buyers and I believe we are weak sellers and we've got to get over that.'
He recognises that farmers have to get more from the market place, no
question of that, and the way to get more from the market place is to grow
what your customers want, not what you want to grow. 'Then you're in a
position to ask a realistic payment for it.'
He is not above criticising the farmers themselves, and repeatedly stresses
the need for discipline. There are a lot of examples of farmers, having said
they were going to collaborate, trying to duck under the net and evade their
responsibilities, he believes.
'The successful co-operatives have a very high degree of discipline at the
moment and I believe that's the major route to success,' he says.
He quotes his own experience to illustrate the rapidly changing nature of UK
farming. Six years ago he did not know where any of the potatoes grown on
140 acres on his farm went after harvest. 'I now don't put a potato in the
ground that has not got a market at the other end, providing it meets
quality standards.' He is similarly certain of markets for his peas, oilseed
rape and lamb, 'although I haven't done it properly yet with the cereals'.
He is proud of UK farmers' record in the past, when the need for production
overrode every other issue, and points out that at the end of the 1970s
government white papers were predicting food shortages now. Many of the cows
that are still milking today were being born then, he says.
Cultural differences in the UK, particularly the system of primogeniture in
land inheritance, have held back development of the co-operation from which
continental European farmers have benefitted. But there are also fiscal
differences throughout the EC, and Mr Naish knows that attaining an
equitable trading environment will be anything but easy.
He detests the uncertainty surrounding the two major issues facing European
farmers - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and reforms of the
Common Agricultural Policy. The NFU wants a Gatt settlement - but it does
not want to see things settled in favour of the Americans. Mr Naish is
strongly critical of Gatt director-general Mr Arthur Dunkel's proposals to
break the Gatt deadlock, and believes proposed changes in tariffication on
imports will lead to 'extraordinarily competitive' prices for US wheat.
This might lead to some healthy consumer prices in the UK, he admits, but
'frankly you'll see huge disruption, both to agriculture and the
countryside, which I believe is the adverse proportion to the goodness that
will be gained from getting that Gatt settlement'.
He is resentful of any suggestion that the NFU is merely reacting to
Brussels decisions and not putting forward policies of its own. He has
forged strong links with Copa, the association of EC farming unions, which
believes supply management is the right way forward for professional farmers
on commercially viable holdings. However, Copa's proposals have been ignored
by the politicians.
Meanwhile he is under no illusions of the task ahead for the UK's farmers.
The industry has been stripped of its excesses and is still going downhill,
weakening the base from which its business can be run. 'Your readers
generally will say that is what has been happening in industry - but we've
been having it for 10 years.'

<TEXT>
NEW measures to dilute the impact of trading in Nikkei 225 stock futures and
options on the cash stock market were implemented yesterday by the Osaka
Securities Exchange, the second largest stock exchange in Japan.
Derivatives trading on the OSE has been blamed for the volatility in the
cash market. Alarmed authorities, especially those at the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, which has seen trading commissions plunge due to low volumes, have
been pushing for controls on derivatives trading.
The move comes at a time when tensions between the OSE and the TSE are
mounting. Trading in the Osaka-based Nikkei 225 futures index rose 2.7 times
last year, and accounted for 56.2 per cent of the OSE's trading revenue.
At the same time, revenue at the TSE plunged as small-lot investors have
become intimidated by the price fluctuations claimed to be created by
futures-linked arbitrage.
Traders said the OSE's move would not affect derivatives trading
drastically.
The closing time of futures and options trading is being shortened to match
the close in stock trading after criticism that speculative futures trading
after the stock market closed often affected prices on the following day.
New Japan Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, said it would close
four domestic branches at the end of March.

CHRYSLER, the financially stretched US car manufacturer, yesterday reported
fourth quarter net earnings of Dollars 97m.
However, it lost Dollars 74m at the pre-tax level and warned that it might
lose substantially more than that in the first quarter of 1992.
The earnings, which worked through at 33 cents a share, were in line with
market expectations and were flattered by a Dollars 127m one-time after-tax
gain on the sale of its 50 per cent stake in Diamond-Star Motors, its US
joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors.
Chrysler, in common with Detroit rivals General Motors and Ford, continues
to lose money on its core car manufacturing operations due to the recession
in the US market and severe price competition.
The company is relying heavily on two significant new product launches this
year - the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and the LH series of mid-sized saloons -
to improve its financial health.
Mr Lee Iaccoca, chairman, said the first quarter was going to be tough
because the economy had yet to revive and the company would have substantial
pre-production and launch costs. As a result, it would incur a pre-tax loss
which could 'significantly exceed' the fourth quarter's Dollars 74m.
The fourth-quarter figures compared with earnings of Dollars 31m, or 14
cents a share, in the same period of last year. Sales totalled Dollars
8.2bn, against Dollars 7.6bn previously.
For the full year, the company lost Dollars 795m, or Dollars 3.28 a share,
after a Dollars 257m accounting charge, compared with 1990 earnings of
Dollars 68m, or 30 cents a share.
Chrysler Financial, its financial services arm, made Dollars 276m in the
year, down from Dollars 313m, and said that the idea of selling a minority
interest in the business had been put on hold.

WASTE Management, the largest US waste disposal company, yesterday reported
a fall in 1991 profits to Dollars 606.3m from Dollars 684.8m a year earlier.
But the reduction comes after a special after-tax charge of representing the
company's estimate of its share of future liabilities relating to the
clean-up of old disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Liability and Compensation Act.
The company warned last month that the clean-up charge would be taken in the
fourth quarter, and yesterday its shares gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 46
1/4 .
Before this extraordinary item, annual profits increased from Dollars 709.3m
to Dollars 787.3m, on revenues up from Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7.55bn, and
fourth-quarter profits improved from Dollars 195.6m to Dollars 207.5m.
Earnings per share for the year - which saw Waste Management acquire Wimpey
Waste Management in the UK via a joint venture partnership with Wessex Water
 -fell from Dollars 1.44 to Dollars 1.23, with the charge accounting for 37
cents.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is in talks with Solectron, a California
electronics manufacturing and assembly contractor, about forming a long-term
partnership covering the assembly of computer circuit boards.
Such a deal would provide IBM with contract circuit-board assembly services
in the US and France.
The move is in line with IBM's strategy to focus its operations upon areas
to which it brings special expertise while sub-contracting other functions
to third parties.
Solectron would gain access to certain IBM technologies and processes, the
companies said.
IBM would become a minority shareholder in Solectron, and Solectron would
acquire an IBM production site in Canejan, Bordeaux, France, and a building
with an assembly operation in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Financial details were not disclosed. The companies said they aimed to
complete contracts later this year.

SHARES in Owens-Corning, the large US manufacturer of fibrous glass
products, moved sharply higher yesterday after the company announced that it
was taking an Dollars 800m non-cash charge for the uninsured cost of future
asbestos claims against its fourth-quarter earnings, writes Nikki Tait.
The company maintained that this should cover cases occuring up to 2000. 'We
will, of course, make adjustments to our reserves if that becomes
appropriate, but this is our best estimate of these uninsured costs,' said
Mr Glen Hiner, Owens-Corning's new chairman and chief executive.
The announcement was welcomed on Wall Street as a move to clear the decks.
Shares in the company surged Dollars 7 3/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 .
After the charge, Owens-Corning's operating figures showed a Dollars 757m
loss in the fourth quarter, compared with a Dollars 7m deficit in the same
period a year earlier.
For the 12-month period, the group's net loss stood at Dollars 742m,
compared with a Dollars 73m profit in 1990, with sales down from Dollars
3.1bn to Dollars 2.8bn.

US TREASURIES marked time yesterday as investors waited for today's
employment figures for January to give some sign of the state of the US
economy.
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond ended the day about  1/4 lower at 102
13/16 , yielding 7.75 per cent, after posting gains in morning trading.
Shorter-dated maturities were unchanged to  1/32 higher.
Among intermediate issues, the 10-year note reversed direction in the
afternoon, sliding  1/8 after firming about  7/32 earlier in the day.
With Fed funds trading at 4 per cent, in line with the Federal Reserve's
perceived target for the rate, the Fed refrained from operating in the open
market for a second day.
Wednesday's Treasury refunding announcement helped calm a market which is
focusing on today's employment data.
There was little reaction to yesterday morning's release of jobless claims
for the week ending January 25, which fell 10,000 to 450,000.
UK government bonds ended mixed with short-dated issues almost unchanged on
the day while longer-dated issues weakened slightly.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 116 3/8 to 116 9/32
. The Liffe gilt future contract traded down from 97.29 to 97.28 on average
volumes.
There is some speculation in the market that the Bank of England may
announce further tap issues today or early next week following the success
of the three tap issues which it sold on Wednesday.
GERMAN government bond prices rose, helped by a combination of strong buying
interest from traders and the US Treasury bond market lead in the afternoon.
Traders said the Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 87.90, traded
up to 88.04 by late afternoon, breaking through an important resistance
level. 'The higher prices helped to entice new buyers into the market,' said
one trader.
Dealers said the main switch trades yesterday were out of the Dutch
government bond market into French government bonds, and out of the Danish
and German markets into Sweden.
SHORT-covering helped to push up Japanese government bond prices which ended
higher yesterday after a volatile trading session.
The market opened on a firm note helped by the strength of the US Treasury
bond market following Wednesday's favourable announcement on the US Treasury
refunding.
However, early gains were wiped out after the Bank of Japan governor said
that conditions for well-balanced, sustainable growth in Japan could be in
place by June.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.465 per cent and traded in
a range of 5.385-5.52 per cent before closing at 5.395 per cent.

AVON Products, one of the world's biggest manufacturers of cosmetics and
toiletries, yesterday unveiled an 8 per cent improvement in 1991 operating
earnings on sales which rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.59bn.
Net income for the three months ended December 21 rose 5 per cent to Dollars
92.6m from Dollars 88m a year earlier on flat sales of Dollars 1.23bn.
Earnings per share grew 10 per cent to Dollars 1.29 from Dollars 1.17,
thanks to fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter.
For the year, Avon earned Dollars 135.7m or Dollars 1.89, including a
one-time non-cash charge of Dollars 75m in the third quarter for
discontinued operations. In 1990, Avon earned Dollars 195.3m or Dollars 2.60
a share.
Income from continuing operations rose 8 per cent to Dollars 210.7m in the
year and 5 per cent to Dollars 92.6m in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Avon's US operations came under pressure from restrained consumer spending
in the second half of last year.
Softer domestic sales depressed Avon's US pre-tax income in the fourth
quarter, which fell 3 per cent. This was partly off-set by the company's
performance overseas, where pre-tax earnings rose 1 per cent on flat sales.
More than half of Avon's sales and earnings come from foreign business.
The company said a dismal US market for luxury goods cut into earnings and
sales of its up-market Giorgio fragrance subsidiary, which had sharply lower
pre-tax profits for the full year.
Avon reduced debt to Dollars 354m in 1991 from Dollars 542m in 1990.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, yesterday filed with the
bankruptcy courts a reorganisation plan which would involve unsecured
creditors swapping their claims for equity in the ongoing company.
The carrier has had talks with various possible merger partners and
potential investors over the past year - including Northwest Airlines and,
at a very preliminary level, with the now-bankrupt Trans World Airlines.
It said yesterday that the filing of the plan would not preclude a deal in
the future, and suggested that it might even induce some parties to enter
discussions. Continental added, however, that 'nothing is in the offing' at
present.
Under the scheme, existing ordinary and preferred shareholders would get
nothing. Subordinated debt would also be eliminated.
Continental said that obligations to secured debtholders would generally be
scaled down, and that the plan overall would reduce long-term liabilities
from around Dollars 5.8bn to Dollars 1.7bn. It estimated that the total
annual saving on interest and lease payments would be approximately Dollars
270m.
On the operational side, however, employees - around 43,000 people - and
flight operations would be little affected, Continental said.
The plan put forward by Continental, which filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in late 1990, has the support of the
Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors.
Some 50m shares of new common stock would be issued to the unsecured
creditors, with the company having the initial authorisation to issue up to
200m shares of common stock and 100m preferred shares.
Continental noted, however, it had not reached agreement with the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation over its possible responsibilities towards
Eastern Airlines, the now-defunct carrier which was once a sister
organisation.
It said that the PBGC was asserting a 'priority claim' which, if successful,
would leave very little for the unsecured creditors.
It added an optimistic note, saying that 'results in January and bookings
for the next several months support our belief that the recent progress will
be continuing'.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Tenneco set back by poor Case
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENNECO, the US conglomerate undergoing a significant restructuring,
yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 26m as its troubled
JI Case farm equipment business continued to operate heavily in the red.
Mr Michael Walsh, the group's new chief executive, said the first quarter
was likely to continue being difficult, due to lingering recession and
because sales of farm and construction equipment were traditionally weak
during the period.
However, for the year as a whole the chief executive expected significantly
stronger results, because of the restructuring programme and new sources of
revenue, which include income generated by newly completed pipeline
projects.
The fourth-quarter loss, which worked through at 24 cents a share, included
Dollars 65m of pre-tax provisions for claims and litigation. The quarterly
deficit compared with income of Dollars 130m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, in
the same period of the previous year.
Revenues dipped from Dollars 3.88bn to Dollars 3.64bn.
For the full year Tenneco reported a net loss of Dollars 732m, or Dollars
6.09 a share, which included Dollars 552m of restructuring charges, compared
with net income of Dollars 561m, or Dollars 4.37, in 1990.
Case, which has been suffering from weak markets for its products and poor
inventory control, had a Dollars 22m operating loss in the fourth quarter,
against income of Dollars 54m in the year-earlier period.
Mr Walsh said the company had held its total debt to capital ratio, on an
industrial basis, to 59 per cent at the year-end, compared with 69 per cent
at the end of September, thanks to the restructuring plan. This was just the
beginning of plans to improve its credit posture, he said.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: A business with its sights set on gaining
new heights - Andrew Baxter charts the growth of Simon Engineering's powered
access division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the superstitious, ladders are best circumnavigated. For John Barker,
head of the world's largest producer of powered access equipment, they mean
competition - along with scaffolding.
Over the past 18 years Mr Barker, managing director of Simon Access, has
built up what is now a division of Stockport-based Simon Engineering from
virtually nothing to a Pounds 150m business. But unlike his products, some
of which can soar 200ft in the air, he is keeping his feet firmly on the
ground.
In its headquarters building on the edge of a rambling Gloucester industrial
estate, Simon Access keeps a database on more than 350 competitors in the
world powered access industry, and on all its markets by geography and
product sector. 'If you asked me for a projection on the utility sector in
Peru in 1994, I could give you one,' he says.
The meticulous research allows Mr Barker to make a prediction which might
look odd to observers of an industry that has been badly hit by the
recession - especially in the US and UK construction markets.
A world market worth just Pounds 1.2bn in 1990 could grow to Pounds 1.7bn by
1995, he says, and Simon plans to raise its share from 15 per cent to
between 20 and 25 per cent.
'It's not pie in the sky,' Mr Barker insists. Instead, he says, it will
require capi-talising fully on a 15-year global acquisition and development
strategy that has turned the Access division into Simon's second largest
be-hind process engineering, and an increasingly important part of the
company as a whole.
The development of Simon Access has coincided with the growth from infancy
of an oddball industry producing hundreds of assorted pro-ducts ranging from
simple powered platforms for industrial use to self-propelled scissor units
and fire units for rescuing people trapped in blazing buildings.
Apart from Simon Access, main groups are US-based or Japanese, but can be
counted on one hand. Behind them comes a second division of strong regional
or national producers, and then hundreds of niche companies. All are serving
markets with very different characteristics and business cycles, and
customers with contrasting preferences and traditions.
In the US, for example, utilities prefer to work on live wires, whereas the
current is normally turned off in Europe, leading to totally different
design priorities.
Mr Barker has therefore had to steer a steady course between recognising the
necessity of staying close to his diverse customer base while deriving
manufacturing, product and engineering synergies from a dozen acquisitions
and internal expansion.
Simon-Dudley, the original Simon powered access company, had suffered badly
in the early 1970s with fixed-price contracts in an era of 20 per cent
inflation, but was also based exclusively on truck-mounted platforms. Mr
Barker determined to develop powered access as a global market, filling in
geographic and product gaps - preferably simultaneously, and by by buying
market leaders.
A key move came in 1978 with the purchase of a Milwaukee-based company now
called Simon Aerials, which had developed a range of self-propelled
platforms. Three years later, Mr Barker bought Gala, a Thetford-based
company with a complementary range of self-propelled machines.
As Simon acquired companies, it tended to move them up-market, so in 1987,
Barker went to Cork in Ireland to buy Eurolift, a manufacturer of smaller
self-propelled machines, to maintain its position at the lower end of the
market.
The biggest acquisition came in 1988 with the purchase of Telelect, a
leading US manufacturer of digger derricks, telescopic aerials and cranes.
Simon paid an initial Dollars 33.6m, plus at least Dollars 7.26m based on
Telelect profits over the next three years.
By this time, however, Mr Barker was thinking of two important markets he
had 'put to one side' because of earlier difficulties establishing a
presence - Germany and Japan.
In Germany, Mr Barker set up a new company in 1987 after previous
acquisition attempts failed. Reunification and the subsequent upturn in
construction activity produced 'a real success story' last year, he says.
But until 1989 the most important gap was Japan, which accounts for 25 per
cent of the world market. Ten years ago Mr Barker tried unsuccessfully to
buy Aichi Sharyo, the market leader, but now has a joint venture with Tomen,
one of the big Japanese trading houses.
While Aichi and Simon pursue a ding-dong battle in Asia, in Japan the UK
company is attacking the newer markets for scissor and self-propelled boom
units rather than Aichi's stranglehold on the truck-mounted sector.
With the Japanese joint venture, Simon Access has all but completed its
global acquisition programme. 'We've dealt ourselves a hand, now we've got
to play it skilfully,' says Mr Barker.
But can it match an internal projection which would imply lifting sales to
about Pounds 340m in 1995 - after a tough year in 1991?
In its favour is its increasing emphasis on product sectors, such as the
utilities business, which are less sensitive to recession. The business just
about broke even in the 1980-81 recession, and, says Mr Barker, 'the whole
plan nearly came unstuck.'
Mr Barker hopes Simon Access will be able to take the next downturn on the
chin, but this time round, profits are down sharply.
Mr Tim Bennett of Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham broker, forecasts profits
of Pounds 7m for 1991, down from Pounds 11.8m in 1990 - a figure which he
has recalculated to reflect property profits made by Simon as a whole.
Mr Bennett forecasts Pounds 8m for this year, which he hopes might prove
conservative. There is real recovery potential, he says, at Simon Aerials in
Milwaukee, and the possibility that some of the smaller-pocketed competitors
in the US might withdraw.
The real test for Mr Barker and Simon Access in the 1990s will be its
ability to move equipment into new markets, and make the most of synergies
that are not available to its competitors. Sourcing from the UK and US to
sell into continental Europe or Japan will keep Simon busy, says Mr Bennett.
Mr Barker believes that some of the cross-fertilisation he has developed
over the past decade is beginning to acquire its own momentum, without
smothering the small-company innovation enshrined in the division's federal
structure.
There is, though, a nagging problem for Simon Access that does not affect
niche players nearly so much - global differences in standards and
specification. Conversely, once common standards are introduced - and
progress has already been achieved - an increased emphasis on safety and
technology makes it harder for the smaller companies to compete.
On Monday, Simon Access announced an order worth more than Pounds 1m to
supply a cross-section of 23 machines built in the UK, Ireland and the US to
Hertz Equipment Rental in Spain. Mr Barker will need plenty more orders like
that to meet his targets.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Conroy steams into lead-zinc minefield -
The upcoming tussle for power on the board of the Irish natural resources
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Conroy, the man in the middle of an unprecedented Irish corporate
saga, has achieved much.
He has proved his worth as an academic, politician and entrepreneur. But the
odds seem very much against him retaining his chairmanship of Conroy
Petroleum &amp; Natural Resources, a company he founded and which is now under
siege by its two biggest shareholders.
Outraged by what they suggest is his autocratic style and an unnecessary
acquisition, Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish mining and industrial group,
and Dundee Bancorp, a company which sprang from the recent reorganisation of
Canada's Corona natural resources concern, want to replace the entire Conroy
board.
A special meeting to vote on their proposals will take place on Saturday in
Dublin and such is the passionate interest roused it seems certain that
there will be no room for latecomers.
All the sound and fury is about something as unsexy as a lead-zinc ore body.
This is located at Galmoy in County Kilkenny. Though modest by world
standards, it is very significant in the context of Ireland's natural
resources. It is also of intense interest to Outokumpu, which already owns
Tara, Ireland's biggest lead-zinc mine, and has been scouring the world for
more raw material to feed its smelters in Finland.
Outokumpu suggests that Conroy is taking far too long to get Galmoy into
production - six years after its discovery planning permission is apparently
still months away. It also insists that the recent Pounds 7.7m takeover by
Conroy of Atlantic Resources, the natural resources vehicle of the
ubiquitous Mr Tony O'Reilly, was not was also a diversion from Conroy's
primary objective: getting metal out of Galmoy.
The irate shareholders say the only apparent reason for the Atlantic deal
was to dilute their stakes in Conroy.
Mr Conroy counters by producing figures to show that Atlantic's assets were
worth every penny paid and he says that a cash injection for Conroy from Mr
O'Reilly personally, which came at the time of the deal, was also useful and
well-timed.
While it might seem extraordinary that Mr Conroy did not discuss the
Atlantic deal beforehand with Outokumpu, then a 27.6 per cent shareholder,
the fact is that he and the Finns have been at loggerheads for some time.
Two Outokumpu representatives on the board quit last year after one of them,
Mr Graham Mascall, made some public comments about the Conroy share price
which upset Mr Conroy.
Mr Conroy, say his detractors, is impossible to work with. However, that is
not immediately apparent from his mild and courteous demeanour. His
background certainly equips him to deal with practically anything the world
can throw at him.
After winning first place in examinations at the Royal College of Surgeons
in Dublin in 1956 he started a successful academic career at Manchester
University where he lectured for a number of years.
While in Manchester he experience the first entrepreneurial stirrings when
he saw the need for a medical emergency deputising (locum) service. With his
brother, Desmond, also a medical doctor, he set up a service and it still
covers nearly 3m people in the Greater Manchester area. In 1970, at the age
of 35, he returned to his alma mater when he was appointed professor of
Physiology at the Royal College, a post he still holds.
He became one of the foremost authorities on circadian rhythms or the 'body
clock' and became an expert on 'jet lag'. His meetings with senior
executives about this gave him a different perspective on business, he says.
So did his more recent work on the physiological aspects of decision-making.
He became a Fianna Fail senator in the Irish Parliament, was government
spokesman on foreign affairs, and is said to be a good friend of Mr Charles
Haughey.
After leading a delegation to the Middle East in 1973 after the first oil
crisis, he decided with his brother to set up a natural resources company,
Trans International Oil, in Ireland to search for oil offshore.
In 1980 the brothers formed Conroy, also to develop Ireland's petroleum and
mineral resources. It was just another junior exploration company until 1986
when the Galmoy deposit was discovered with its potential to produce perhaps
70,000 tonnes of zinc a year.
Outokumpu's arrival on the scene was at first hailed as a coup. As one of
the world's leading mining and metals processing groups, Outokumpu gave the
Galmoy project increased credibility. It was also widely anticipated that
the Finns would eventually take over Conroy.
Now Mr Conroy complains that Outokumpu and Dundee hope, by replacing the
board, to take over the company without paying other shareholders for the
privilege.
Emotions are now running high, particularly as it is possible to put
different interpretations on the same set of facts. For example, Outokumpu
says that since 1987 it has made cumulative profits of about Dollars 50m
from the Tara mine. None of this has been repatriated to Finland but has
been ploughed back into a range of Irish ventures, including Tara, Conroy
and on a 24.5 per cent stake in Ivernia West, another company with a
juicy-looking lead-zinc deposit not far from Galmoy.
Outokumpu says this is evidence of its commitment to Ireland. Its critics
say this is evidence of the nationalisation of Ireland's mining industry,
not by the Irish but by the Finnish government.
Mr Conroy says he is confident about the outcome of the special meeting.
Holding it on a Saturday should ensure that nearly every shareholder who
wants to attend will be there. But his board controls less than 15 per cent
of Conroy whereas, even after the Atlantic deal, his opponents speak for 43
per cent. And the directors can be dismissed by a straight majority vote.

Wellcome, the UK pharmaceutical group, has agreed to sell its diagnostics
business to International Murex Technologies for Pounds 15m.
Wellcome Diagnostics develops, manufactures and markets internationally,
kits for the detection and diagnosis of disease and disease-causing
organisms.
In the year to August 31, the business recorded sales of Pounds 40m.
Under the agreement, the Wellcome diagnostic business worldwide has been
transferred to International Murex, including approximately Pounds 22m of
net assets.
Mr John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, said the divestiture of the
diagnostics business confirmed Wellcome's intention to concentrate on its
main pharmaceutical activity, while ensuring that the diagnostics business
would continue.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bass files lawsuit over Holiday Inn buy

<TEXT>
BASS, the brewery and leisure group, has filed a lawsuit in the US federal
courts, claiming that it was misled about the condition of the Holiday Inn
chain, which it acquired for Dollars 2.23bn two years ago.
The lawsuit, in which Bass seeks unspecified damages, is thought to allege
that Promus, the US-quoted casinos and hotels company which remained once
Holiday Corporation's Holiday Inn business had been sold off to Bass, misled
the group about the condition of many hotels, the nature of their leases and
their compliance with various laws, including zoning compliances.
Further allegations are understood to centre on potential liabilities at
Holiday Inn which Bass claims it did not know about at the time of merger.
It also claims that Promus is not adhering to the terms of a tax sharing
agreement concerning pre-merger taxes on Holiday Inn hotels.
Holiday Inn last night declined to discuss details of the lawsuit, but
confirmed that it had been filed. There was no immediate response from
Promus.
Holiday Inn has been described as the world's largest hotel brand. At
end-1990 it took in about 1,600 hotels and approximately 320,000 rooms in 48
countries.
At Bass's annual meeting last month, Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, told
shareholders that economic conditions in some parts of the US had continued
to depress occupancy rates in some company-managed hotels, but that this had
been partially offset by higher room rates.

<TEXT>
DAWSON International, the UK's fourth biggest textiles company, is
restructuring its businesses to prepare for further launches of its US-made
goods into European and Japanese markets.
In a radical change for the group, primarily known for its Pringle and
Ballantyne knitwear brands, a structure based on geographical division
between the US and elsewhere is being replaced by exploitation of its
brands.
'This will allow us to learn from best practice around the company. Before,
we were like little boxes,' said Mr Ronald Miller, executive chairman.
The moves are accompanied by a board reshuffle that reduces the number of
executive directors from six to three.
Mr Nick Kuenssberg, who joined the company from Coats Viyella in September
1991, moves from chief executive UK to run the Premier Brands unit, covering
yarns, fabrics and the woollen brands.
Mr Philip Kemp, formerly chief executive US, will run consumer products,
mostly sports clothing. Ms Ann Burdus, director, communications and
marketing, Olympia and York Canary Wharf, joins as a non-executive director.
Dawson's products have historically divided neatly by brand.
US-made goods have been sold almost entirely domestically. Many are sports
clothes often using cotton or polyester fabrics and are a far cry from
Dawson's expensive UK-manufactured woollens and cashmeres.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Serco set to acquire BT's Aeradio offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERCO, the fast-growing facilities management group, appears to be close to
acquiring International Aeradio Limited (IAL), British Telecommunications'
airport and hospital maintenance subsidiary.
Mr David Perkins, Serco's finance director, said yesterday the situation
'still is an investigation at this stage and by no means final'. He
described suggestions that Serco would pay between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m
for IAL as a 'market rumour'.
Earlier this week BT said that nothing active was happening with IAL. But
the telecommunications group admitted that the subsidiary, acquired in 1986,
did not fit its corporate strategy of running telecommunications networks.
IAL staff were originally told that a sale would be completed by the end of
January. They now understand that it could be finalised later this month.
Serco raised Pounds 9.7m in a rights issue last November. One of its stated
reasons for the issue was 'to develop through suitable acquisitions',
specifically mentioning aviation services as a possibility.
BT bought IAL from STC, the electronics group, as part of its original
post-privatisation strategy.
It is understood that BT was originally hoping to sell IAL for Pounds 30m,
but had to lower the price because bidders apart from Serco dropped out.
At one stage Thomson CSF, the French defence group, looked like the front
runner.
IAL's turnover is thought to be about Pounds 50m following BT's decision to
integrate some of its activities with its main business.
At its peak, IAL was thought to have had turnover of about Pounds 100m.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: O&amp;Y launches Pounds 215m property trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the Canadian property company, yesterday launched an
enterprise zone property trust aimed at raising Pounds 215m from small
investors to finance a building in London's Canary Wharf development.
O&amp;Y accepts that the deal, the biggest of its kind yet attempted,
effectively offers it a '10-year interest-free mortgage'. However, Mr Robert
John, executive director, denied the deal was a change of course, or that it
indicated O&amp;Y was short of cash.
The company has shelved this project until now because it wanted to wait
until a completed development was in place, making it easier to attract
investors.
New concessions by the Inland Revenue in December last year - particularly a
measure granting enterprise zone relief for buildings up to two years after
they had been occupied - also made the deal easier.
A completed building at 10 Cabot Square, with more than 600,000 sq ft of
office space, will be sold by O&amp;Y to the Cabot Square Trust.
The trust will then be divided into Pounds 1,000 units, which will be sold
to investors, with a minimum investment of Pounds 5,000.
Cabot Square is more than double the size of the previous largest enterprise
zone trust, and will be marketed as a tax shelter.
Investment in enterprise zone property qualifies for full top-rate tax
relief. The trust is open for investment until March 30, when it will be
officially formed.
O&amp;Y will buy any unsold units, although it has the flexibility to continue
selling units in the trust for another two years.
Investors have a put option to sell a long lease in the building back to O&amp;Y
after 10 years, for exactly the same price paid for it.
The company's ability to pay this has been secured by Morgan Guaranty, the
US investment bank.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Wace launches inquiry into Clegg years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, PHILIP GAWITH, JIMMY BURNS and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WACE GROUP said yesterday it had launched a 'wide-ranging inquiry' into all
aspects of the company during the eight years Mr John Clegg built it into
the world's largest pre-press printing specialist.
Mr Clegg resigned as chief executive last Friday after speculation had
linked the company to the Irish Republican Army. Security sources said they
had uncovered no evidence of such links.
Mr Clegg denied the allegations but told the board last week that potential
future speculation would focus on his family, making it embarrassing to the
company for him to continue on its board.
Senior executives within the group, under pressure from shareholders, are
understood to be anxious to prepare a full response to the continuing
uncertainty about the company. They have broadened their investigations to
include members of Mr Clegg's family.
'It is absolutely vital to insure that no misconduct took place,' Mr Brian
Dudley, who succeeded Mr Clegg as managing director last week, has written
in a memo to the group's employees.
One area under scrutiny concerns the source of money Mr Clegg used to buy
into Wace in 1983 when it was a small loss-making shell company. He has
repeatedly said since then that he was backed by his cousin, Miss Jayne
Wright, who had inherited wealth and had emigrated to South Africa.
The company has established little about her so far but most of her
shareholding in Wace was sold in late 1988 for about Pounds 8m.
Mr Clegg offered at last week's board meeting to 'produce Miss Wright within
two weeks', according to a senior Wace executive. He resigned during the
meeting and has not been available for comment since.
Individuals connected with Wace have been the subject of investigations by a
number of authorities over the past year. These culminated in a meeting in
London last June attended by representatives of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary's C13 anti-racketeering squad, the Serious Fraud Office, the
Stock Exchange's Insider Dealing Group and the Bank of England.
These investigations followed earlier police inquiries in Sheffield where Mr
Clegg grew up.
Little about the Clegg family's South African connections have surfaced to
date. Mr Clegg's father, John senior, emerged last November as the purchaser
of 7m shares in Clegg Holdings, a South African paper and packaging company.
Mr Harry Clegg, chairman of Clegg Holdings, said he was no relation to the
Yorkshire Cleggs but he had met the son. He said his relationship with Mr
Clegg Snr dated back to 1987 when Clegg Holdings was listed. Mr Clegg Snr
had written a letter saying he was interested in investing in the company.
The holding stands at 23.3 per cent.

FT  07 FEB 92 / EC may set precedent on Steetley deal with Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission merger control experts may set a legal precedent by
allowing the UK authorities to examine a proposed merger of the brick, clay
tile and concrete businesses of Steetley and Tarmac, two large UK building
materials groups.
If the commission allows London to examine the case, it will be the first
time since the merger rules came into force in September 1990 that Brussels
has given up its right to look at a merger which falls automatically under
its jurisdiction.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, must rule on the case
before the end of next week. Germany has twice asked for the right to
examine mergers, but in both cases it has been overruled.
The decision could have an important bearing on a rival Pounds 600m bid by
Redland for the whole of Steetley.
British regulatory authorities are currently considering whether to refer
the bid by Redland - another UK building materials group - for investigation
by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Because of the large size of Steetley's and Tarmac's combined turnover, it
has fallen to the European Commission to conduct preliminary investigation
into the joint venture plan, rather than the UK authorities.
At the end of last month Mr Peter Lilley, the British trade and industry
secretary, asked for the right to examine the Steetley/Tarmac deal in London
on the grounds that it might affect a 'distinct market' in the UK.
Mr Lilley's request - taking advantage of a special clause in the merger
rules - seems to be receiving serious consideration.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Agnellis may retreat in bid for control of Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Agnelli family may be considering a strategic retreat in its bid to
gain control of Perrier following the increasingly bitter battle that has
erupted.
The fight for Perrier is thought to have pitched previous Agnelli allies in
the French business and banking establishment against each other and brought
to the surface deep personal animosities among some French members of the
Agnelli camp.
'We never expected all this controversy and excitement,' said Ifint, the
Agnelli investment vehicle battling for Perrier, in Paris yesterday. 'This
was meant to be a quiet, friendly association fully supported by the
management. We thought it was going to be a very smooth deal. We did not
anticipate anything like this.'
Meanwhile, the Agnellis are awaiting the outcome of the two court cases in
France which, barring a compromise, will determine the next stage of the
battle. The cases are concerned with a claim by Nestle that Perrier's sale
earlier this year of 14 per cent of its shares to Saint Louis, the French
sugar company linked to the Agnellis, was illegal.
If the courts, which will deliver their judgments in late February, rule
that Saint Louis's purchase was invalid, it will have to give the shares
back to Perrier. This means Exor, whose president, Mr Jacques Vincent, also
chairs Perrier, will be left to try to stave off Nestle with just 35 per
cent of the mineral water company's shares.
This could turn the Perrier affaire into a repetition of the dramatic bid by
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, another ambitious Italian industrialist, for Societe
Generale de Belgique in 1988 when the protagonists ended up fighting over
every last share. Unlike Mr De Benedetti, however, the Agnellis could come
out with a substantial financial gain even if their ambitions for Perrier
fail.
Alternatively, if the court endorses Saint Louis's investment, the French
stock market authorities may force Exor to mount a public offer for Perrier.
The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, one of the regulatory bodies in France,
yesterday repeated an earlier ruling that Exor and its allies - Saint Louis
and Societe Generale, the French bank - should do so.
Exor would then have to decide whether to mount a token bid, or to compete
with Nestle by making a counter offer.
A token bid appears to be the likeliest option given that, with 49 per cent
of Perrier, Exor and Saint Louis could be confident of blocking Nestle.
Legally, the Exor camp, according to Ifint, would be able to comply with the
SBV's ruling simply by bidding for two thirds of Perrier at the last price
paid by Saint Louis, which was FFr1,235. Given that Nestle has already
offered FFr1,475 for each Perrier share, Exor could make its token bid in
the sure knowledge it would fail.
The CBV will resume trading in Perrier and Exor shares on Monday. It has
told the Commission des Operations de Bourse and the Societe des Bourses
Francais to scrutinise dealings in both stocks.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Brokers criticised for breach of code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER Panel yesterday criticised Smith New Court, Henry Cooke and NM
Rothschild for breaching the takeover code ahead of Monday's bid by
Petrocon, the engineering and surveying group, for James Wilkes, the
Sheffield-based specialist engineer.
There was a 26 per cent increase in James Wilkes's share price before the
announcement on January 20 that it had received an approach that could led
to a full offer.
Henry Cooke and Smith New Court, Petrocon's advisers, were criticised for
not consulting with the Panel before approaching 'a significant number' of
Petrocon and Wilkes institutional shareholders to establish attitudes to an
offer. More than 10 people are understood to have been approached - in
breach of the Panel guideline that the 'circle' of those with knowledge of a
possible bid should not exceed six.
The Panel also criticised the two houses for not consulting it on January
15, after Wilkes shares had risen by more than 10 per cent above the price
at which Petrocon bought a 2.8 per cent stake three days earlier.
It also said Rothschild had breached the code by not making a prompt
announcement of the possible offer on behalf of Wilkes after the shares rose
11 per cent by 11am on February 20. Neither Rothschild nor Robert Fleming,
which has since been appointed adviser to Petrocon, believes the Panel's
criticism will have any impact on the bid.
Petrocon's 13-for-3 share-exchange offer valued Wilkes at Pounds 35.8m
yesterday. Fleming said Petrocon had non-binding legally written
confirmation from holders of 29.1 per cent of Wilkes' shares that they plan
to accept the offer.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Domestic electricity users to get refund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT regional electricity companies are to return a total of Pounds 35m to
their domestic customers because of overcharging last year. The money will
be returned in the form of lower tariffs rather than in cash.
The overcharging resulted from the sharp fall in the rate of inflation last
year. Electricity companies have to announce their tariffs in advance using
assumptions about the likely level of inflation. These turned out to be too
high in many cases.
The agreement to refund customers followed action by Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, who regulates the
industry. In October he wrote to several regional suppliers warning them
that they might be overcharging, and subsequently launched an inquiry.
He said yesterday: 'The companies have taken reasonable steps to share with
customers some of the benefits of lower inflation, and this year's tariff
increases can be expected to be below inflation. I believe that customers
can regard this as a satisfactory outcome.'
Four of the eight companies, London Electricity, Manweb, Seeboard and
Yorkshire Electricity, have agreed to return all the excess they earned last
year. But the other four argued that the terms of their operating licences
allowed them to keep part of the excess to cover the sharp rise in their own
costs, mainly the cost of buying electricity. This was accepted by Prof
Littlechild. The four are Eastern Electricity, Northern Electric, Norweb and
Southern Electric.
The excesses earned by the eight companies (and the amounts they have agreed
to return) are: Eastern Electricity Pounds 15m (Pounds 3m), London
Electricity Pounds 4m (Pounds 4m), Manweb Pounds 2m (Pounds 2m), Northern
Electric Pounds 5m (Pounds 4m), Norweb Pounds 9m (Pounds 5m), Seeboard
Pounds 6m (Pounds 6m), Southern Electric Pounds 12m (Pounds 5m) and
Yorkshire Electric Pounds 6m (Pounds 6m).
Mr Jim Hart, Southern's commercial director, one of the companies holding
back part of the excess, said that purchase costs had gone up 'quite
dramatically since we made our assumptions'.
But he said next year's tariff would still rise by less than the rate of
inflation which Southern expects to be in the range of 4-4.5 per cent.
Yorkshire, one company which is refunding all its excess, said the giveback
would have only a small effect on profitability.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YASUSHI MIENO, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday that the
end of Japan's speculative boom, together with the debts the period had left
behind, was 'very, very unlikely to shake the stability of financial
institutions'.
Nevertheless, the central bank had to keep a closer eye on financial
stability than it did before, he said in an interview with the Financial
Times.
Central banks had two goals: price stability and the stability of the
financial system. 'In the past, previous governors put a little more weight
on the maintenance of price stability (than on financial stability). But
under the current circumstances we should attach equal importance to these
two objectives'.
In a speech to Japanese businessmen later, he warned the US and Europe
against seeking rapid solutions to the problems of slow growth and
recession. Group of Seven countries should not resort to short-term policies
to promote growth at the expense of long-term sustainable growth, Mr Mieno
said.
Mr Mieno's remarks were seen as warning other G7 countries, particularly the
US, to avoid hasty cuts in interest rates or increasing public spending to
stimulate the economy.
Long-term economic adjustments were often difficult to carry out for
political reasons and tended to be postponed, Mr Mieno said, referring to
the need for the US to cut its federal deficit. But delay would leave
countries prey 'to the risk of excessively stimulating their economies'.
Mr Mieno also said that even though international policy co-ordination was
important, each country should pursue its own policies and not rely on other
G7 members to make short-term changes in their economic management for the
benefit of others. 'Instead of focusing unduly on short-term growth, we
should look at the growth fundamentals.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / Plea to press after Ashdown revelation: Labour and Liberal
Democrats launch inquiries into recent break-ins at party offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, RAYMOND SNODDY and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPERS were yesterday asked to show restraint by Lord McGregor, chairman
of Press Complaints Commission, following revelations about the private life
of Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats.
His plea came as City police charged a man with burglary and handling stolen
goods in connection with the break-in at the offices of Mr Ashdown's
solicitor.
It was a document taken from these offices last month that led to the
revelations about Mr Ashdown's private life. A woman was also helping police
with inquiries.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Liberal Democrats launched investigations into
break-ins at offices in Westminster and throughout the country to discover
whether they were simple burglaries or had a more sinister motive.
Scotland Yard said it would consider setting up a 'dirty tricks' squad to
investigate whether the spate of break-ins had been politically motivated as
soon as a formal request for such an inquiry had been received.
In a personal statement, Lord McGregor warned newspapers of 'the dangerous
consequences in the pre-election period, of mixing political reporting with
irrelevant commentaries upon the private lives of political figures'.
He reminded newspapers that the Calcutt Committee report on privacy had
given the press 18 months to prove that self-regulation could work and that
the 18-month period would run out in July.
He said: 'A return to the pre-Calcutt performance will certainly result in a
law of privacy and a statutory body with legal powers to enforce the
sanctions against the press.'
Mr Ashdown's staff said he was seriously considering making a formal
complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about the behaviour of some
newspapers.
Lord McGregor's warning came amid concern that, because some newspapers pay
large sums for compromising material, this might in turn have led to a
growth in the theft of personal papers and computer records.
Most politicians have inclined towards the theory that the break-ins were
unrelated incidents rather than a conspiracy by a political party or the
security services.
However, there are a number of puzzling aspects to the burglaries. For
example computer disks with membership and canvassing details, but with
little commercial value, have been taken.
The theft of damaging personal papers last month from Mr Ashdown's firm of
solicitors lent initial credence to the conspiracy theory, but City of
London police said they regarded the discovery of the papers by the thief as
a fluke.
The Liberal Democrats published a list of burglaries at party offices,
including some in marginal seats, and intend to call for a co-ordinated
police inquiry when more details have been collated.
Mr Graham Elson, the party's chief executive, said some stolen material,
such as membership records, would be particularly useful to opponents during
an election campaign.
At least seven Labour MPs have had their Westminster offices burgled in the
past six months, but the number of break-ins at local party offices is not
known.
Ms Joyce Gould, the party's director of organisation, is writing to all
regional offices seeking details of thefts and break-ins over the past two
years.
The party said: 'We do not wish to sound alarmist, but the facts speak for
themselves. Someone has been breaking into our MPs' offices and stealing
things of little value to the ordinary burglar.'
Among the catalogue of crimes at Westminster have been the thefts of
computer disks, party documents and private correspondence from Mr John
Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, and Mr John Prescott, transport
spokesman. Also listed is interference with the computers of Ms Marjorie
Mowlam, City spokeswoman, and Dr John Reid, a member of the shadow defence
team.
Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, whose personal computer password was
bypassed, suspects a political motive and has criticised the lack of
security in the Commons. 'Once you get into the Commons, past the security
barrier, it's open house. Nobody locks their doors,' he said.
Conservative Central Office provided a list of 35 constituency office
burglaries over the past 18 months, including one in Bath, the constituency
of Mr Chris Patten, party chairman.
It said there was no discernible pattern among the break-ins and rejected
the theory that they could have been politically inspired. Its view was that
the latest crime was computer theft, and all offices, including those of
political parties, were obvious targets.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Bush launches Dollars 35bn health package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush sought to win back the political initiative on health
care yesterday with a Dollars 35bn (Pounds 19bn) package to overhaul the US
system.
Mr Bush said he would introduce vouchers and tax deductions, worth up to
Dollars 3,750 a year for a family of four, to help an estimated 95m low and
middle income families buy health insurance for themselves.
The president's package drew immediate criticism from the opposition
Democrats, who have until now made the political running on the issue.
Mr Bush told a business audience in Cleveland, Ohio: 'This is the kind of
market-based reform plan that will give Americans the kind of health care
they want and deserve.'
The plan also proposes to cut the soaring cost of health care, which is
expected to rise by an average 12-13 per cent a year for the next five
years, by encouraging employers to pool their buying power into 'health
insurance networks'.
It also includes measures aimed at reducing waste and paperwork and at
slowing the growth in spending on the government's Medicare and Medicaid
health programmes.
Mr Bush also wants to reform malpractice law to give doctors more protection
from being sued by unhappy patients. 'It is time to put an end to these
astronomical, sky's-the-limit lawsuits,' he said.
Mr Richard Gephardt, leader of the Democratic majority in the House of
Representatives, said Mr Bush's proposals were 'totally deficient' and would
not do enough to contain medical costs.
'The Bush health care plan is a Band-Aid approach that will put more money
in the pockets of insurance companies and doctors but will do nothing to
make health coverage affordable or ensure that all working Americans have
access to quality health care,' Mr Gephardt said.
Mr Bush's advisers began drafting an emergency health care reform plan in
November, after Senator Harris Wofford, campaigning principally on the issue
of universal access to health care, won a surprise victory in a Pennsylvania
by-election over the president's hand-picked candidate.
While the government provides medical support for the elderly through
Medicare, and for the very poor through Medicaid, one American in seven  -
for the most part employed by small businesses which cannot afford corporate
health coverage - lacks any form of medical insurance.
The administration and its Republican backers have hotly opposed both
options proposed by the Democrats - a nationalised health insurance system
similar to Canada's or a 'play or pay' system where businesses would have to
choose between providing health insurance for their workers or paying a
payroll tax into a central state scheme.
'When you nationalise health care you push costs higher, far higher . . .
The fact is, we do not have to create a new government bureaucracy to
deliver quality health care,' Mr Bush said.
However, Republicans in Congress have already fallen out with the
administration on how to meet the estimated Dollars 35bn-a-year cost of the
tax vouchers and deductions Mr Bush is proposing.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Mr Triple Trouble fights his corner: Yasushi Mieno, governor
of the Bank of Japan, tells Stefan Wagstyl he will resist outside pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, does not believe that
his country faces anything like a credit crunch, declining to comment on the
'hypothetical' possibility of even a single Japanese bank needing rescue.
Yet in the subtle style of a well-schooled central banker, he indicated a
certain level of concern about the health of Japanese financial institutions
as they grapple with the collapse of the speculative boom that hit Japan in
the 1980s.
Central banks had two goals, he said in an interview with the Financial
Times this week: maintaining price stability and ensuring a stable financial
system. 'In the past, previous governors put a little more weight on the
maintenance of price stability (rather than financial stability). But under
the current circumstances we should attach equal importance to these two
objectives.'
Mr Mieno, who has spent his working life at the central bank and has been
governor for just over two years, has presided over Japanese monetary policy
during one of the most difficult times since the second world war. First he
raised interest rates to deflate a speculative bubble in stock and land
prices and to dampen inflation. Then as the threats receded, he gently
lowered the cost of borrowing. Now he has to consider whether to cut rates
further to stimulate growth or to keep the brakes on credit for a while
longer.
Mr Mieno has been criticised in some corners of the financial community,
particularly in the stock market where he was dubbed Mr Triple Trouble in a
play on his name, which contains the Japanese word for 'three'. But to the
general public he has become something of a hero for the pain he has
inflicted on land speculators. While stock market and banking scandals last
year tarnished many financial companies and touched even the finance
ministry, the Bank of Japan's reputation for rectitude has rarely been
higher.
Mr Mieno relies on officials for the fine tuning of monetary policy. His
biggest personal contribution is his zeal for sound money and his fierce
resistance to external pressure on the bank. He said that his motto was
never to shirk difficult challenges. 'The current situation at the Bank of
Japan requires a strong will to fight back (against pressures from
outside),' he said.
In preparing for this fight, Mr Mieno, who is 67, has a wider breadth of
experience to draw upon than most Japanese. Before the second world war, he
lived with his family in Manchuria, moving frequently. Returning to Tokyo,
he helped to keep himself and his family by dealing in soap, butter and
suiting material. As a student at Tokyo University he boarded at a sumo
wrestling stable, an experience that led to a lifelong love of the sport.
He has a down-to-earth manner that endears him to his staff. Stories of his
drinking prowess circulate the central bank. When he walks with his wife
around the shops near his Tokyo home, the shopkeepers call it 'Mr Mieno's
price inspection'. But behind the charm a keen mind is at work - his recent
reading includes Andre Gide and Dostoevsky.
During the interview, Mr Mieno gave a characteristically upbeat assessment
of the Japanese economy. It is 'still in quite a robust state', although
'the rate of the slowdown is slightly accelerating'.
Mr Mieno argued that, even though companies were adjusting stock and capital
investment levels, the underlying tone of the economy was firm. Businesses
were pressing ahead with some kinds of investment, such as the purchase of
labour-saving equipment; consumption was strong; and the economy was
benefiting from the accumulated effect of past interest rate cuts.
In contrast to some private-sector economists, Mr Mieno sees little risk of
a sharp economic downturn: 'The adjustment process will continue for the
time being, but it is unlikely that the economy will decline suddenly.
Gradually it will emerge on to a path of sustainable growth.' The central
bank would continue to monitor the effects of past interest rate cuts, said
Mr Mieno, because it is important that the adjustment 'is not more severe
than necessary'.
Mr Mieno set the Japanese economy in a global context, pointing out that
overseas countries, especially the US, also 'face adjustment from the
excesses of the 1980s'. The governor predicted that the US economy would
resume growth in the second half of this year, but he expected Asia to grow
faster than the rest of the world. Japan should suffer less from the global
slowdown than in the past because it relies less on exports and more on
domestic demand.
In a speech yesterday, Mr Mieno warned against quick fixes to deal with
recession or slow growth. He said that long-term and medium-term goals
should not be sacrificed for the sake of short-term gains in growth -
remarks aimed at policymakers in other industrialised countries.
In the interview, Mr Mieno chose his words with care, particularly when it
came to the state of health of Japan's financial institutions. He said that
some financial companies which had lent money to fund speculative
investments were now suffering from non-performing loans on their books and
the non-payment of interest. Moreover, the deregulation and
internationalisation of the Japanese market had made life 'more severe' for
the management of financial companies.
But Japanese financial institutions, he said, had large internal reserves so
the bursting of the bubble was 'unlikely to shake the stability of financial
institutions'. However, it was important for them to strengthen risk control
management and their capital bases. For its part, the central bank 'will do
its utmost to make the financial system as stable as possible'.
Among the more delicate tasks facing a governor of the Bank of Japan is
maintaining good relations with the finance ministry. Even though the
central bank's independence is enshrined in law, the ministry retains
considerable influence, not least because of a tradition that the ministry
and the bank take turns in nominating a governor. Mr Mieno, as a career
central banker, makes no bones about his determination to assert the bank's
independence. He has made headlines defending himself against criticism from
finance ministry officials, some of whom felt that his earlier squeeze on
credit was too severe.
Mr Mieno said that to maintain de facto independence, the central bank had
to pursue the right monetary policy with self-confidence. This earns the
bank the moral authority to resist pressure from the outside. Mr Mieno said
he consulted frequently with business and government circles, but tried to
keep 'a certain distance' from politicians. The Bank of Japan's current
policy was accepted as correct by the ministry and by government, he said.
Turning to the sensitive subject of the recent sharp increase in Japan's
current account surplus with the rest of the world, Mr Mieno said that the
doubling of the current account surplus last year to Dollars 73bn was 85 per
cent owing to 'special factors'. These included changes in gold imports, a
decline in the oil price, a rise in the yen's value (which boosted the US
dollar-denominated surplus) and the collapse of the financial bubble which
hit imports of luxuries.
Furthermore, said Mr Mieno, the ratio of the current account surplus to the
nominal gross national product - a measure of the surplus's economic
significance - had fallen from 4 per cent in 1986 to 2 per cent last year.
The figure for 1992 would be little different, he added, a ratio that he
described as almost in the range of what was acceptable.
Nevertheless further measures were necessary to reduce external imbalances.
Japan, he said, needed to promote domestic, demand-led growth. It should
deregulate its economy further and increase the transparency of economic
transactions to make them more accessible from the outside, said Mr Mieno,
in a reference to US criticism of the opaque aspects of the Japanese
economy, including keiretsu, or industrial groupings.
However, the governor also had some advice for the US and Europe. He said
countries with current account deficits also had to do their part to reduce
the imbalances through economic policy changes of their own. 'Only through
the joint efforts of both surplus and deficit countries does it become
possible for the external imbalances to be adjusted.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / Protection of privacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who read one of Britain's tabloids yesterday would feel the need to
wash his or her hands; if you read them all only a hot bath in mild acid
would suffice. There is no need to repeat what they said. That would be to
fall into the trap of protesting against muck while disseminating it
oneself. Let us just say that the popular press was at its most vile.
Yet at breakfast I still doubted the need for a privacy law. The old
argument seemed paramount. There is too much secrecy in Britain as it is.
Any further obstacle to the free expression of opinion, or the absolute
right to publish, would be the thin end of a dangerous wedge. The treatment
of Mr Paddy Ashdown was outrageous, but it did not quite justify a new legal
constraint.
Then the news came through that the secretary with whom Mr Ashdown had had a
brief relationship five years ago had succumbed to hounding by the tabloids.
She allowed herself to be photographed, in the hope that the persecution
would stop. I believe that there is no legitimate public interest in the
Liberal Democrat leader's long-past private behaviour, but others may
disagree. When it comes to the woman in the case there is no room for
argument or doubt. She is a private person who, in the words of her
statement, has been subjected to 'intolerable pressures and intrusions' by
hirelings of the popular press. This is something against which there ought
to be a law.
Nothing will be done this side of an election, after which everyone may have
cooled down. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, is disposed to give the
present system of self-regulation by the Press Complaints Commission another
year in which to prove itself. He does not believe that it has yet done so.
A Labour government would probably take the same view, although it would
have as much reason to be ill-disposed towards the tabloids (the Mirror
excepted) as a victorious Conservative government would have to be grateful
to them. Either way, the chairman of the complaints commission, Lord
McGregor, has time in which to persuade editors and proprietors that the
penalty for publishing intrusive tripe is likely to be irresistible
back-bench pressure for new legislation. The back benches will count for
something if, as is likely, there is a hung parliament or the next
government rests on a slim majority. Lord McGregor argues that a law of
privacy would enable public personages or governments to conceal important
truths, while the absence of such a law would mean that a small number of
individuals would have to suffer horrors of the sort we saw yesterday.
Reluctantly, he concludes that we have to accept the latter in the interests
of a free press in a democracy.
This has been the majority view since the Calcutt committee on privacy
reported in Nothing will be done this side of an election, after which
everyone may have cooled down
June 1990. The committee sought to balance article 8 of the European
convention on human rights ('everyone has the right to respect for his
private and family life, his home and his correspondence . . . ') against
article 10 ('everyone has the right to freedom of expression . . . '). It
chose to be guided by the principle that while freedom of expression is
pre-eminent, certain exceptions protecting individual privacy may be
necessary.
It recommended that media intrusion into private property without consent,
and for the purpose of obtaining personal information, should become a
criminal offence. The law should provide for injunctions against the
publication of stories or photographs so acquired; alternatively the victim
could sue. The efficacy of injunctions has once again been thrown into doubt
this week but, as to the rest, it must be said that Calcutt had a point.
The committee also rejected a privacy law, partly on principle and partly
because there were 'more appropriate remedies', presumably including the new
Press Complaints Commission. That sounded OK at the time. It sounds less so
today. Our own Louis Blom-Cooper QC, who was chairman of the Press Council
until the commission replaced it, favours a new tort of 'unwarranted
invasion of privacy,' subject to a 'public interest' defence, which would
leave it to the courts to fill in the details. There would be no prior
restraint, but the media could be sued by aggrieved individuals.
Considering what the judges have done with the law of defamation, I am not
too sure about this generalised approach. Our crusty courts would be likely
to build up huge defences against reasonable disclosures. The remaining
option is debated in Calcutt, and preferred by Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, a
media expert. This is to specify what is protected, such as hospital records
or stolen documents containing intimate personal details; as to doorstep
loiterers armed with notebooks and cameras you could sue against 'watching
and besetting' your domain. This is the US approach, which did not help
Governor Bill Clinton - but there is no protection against an unscrupulous
teller of tales.
The case for a privacy law based on specified disclosures of personal
information is now hard to rebut. It may not have stopped publication of all
of this week's tabloid articles, but editors would have had to weigh the
likely cost of a lawsuit, and the strength of a public interest defence. Yet
if the papers are to be discouraged from prying into the personal lives of
anyone they please, they should also be better enabled to gather real news.
A freedom of information bill, promised by Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
should precede a privacy law. We also need to subject the activities of our
spies to proper scrutiny. The present security service and official secrets
acts would cover up illicit break-ins. This is particularly worrisome in a
week in which many people once again suspect the secret services of being up
to dirty tricks.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Maxwell's pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ruthless and systematic looting of pension schemes in the Maxwell
business empire by the late Mr Robert Maxwell was deplorable enough. Yet
many of the 30,000 employees and pensioners whose retirement prospects have
already been jeopardised now face a further threat, arising from the
considerable legal uncertainty that surrounds the status of pension fund
members in a winding up.
Under existing insolvency legislation, it is far from clear where a pension
fund deficit ranks in relation to other creditors once the receivers and
liquidators move in. While the Fourth Schedule of the 1990 Social Security
Act contained a provision for a pension fund deficit to be treated as a debt
due from the employer to the scheme, it has not yet been brought into force.
Small wonder that trustees of the Maxwell pension schemes were yesterday
trooping into Whitehall to bend the ears of social security secretary Mr
Tony Newton, Mr John Maples of the Treasury and corporate affairs minister
Mr John Redwood. They risk finding themselves trampled in the stampede, as
the big banks lay prior claim to those assets that remain. Yet it was the
banks who magnified the damage wreaked by Mr Maxwell when they encouraged
him in his reckless expansion - this, despite powerful anathemas pronounced
on him by department of trade inspectors.
Dismal pittance
The government will, of course, meet its statutory obligation to stump up
the equivalent of the guaranteed minimum pension provided under the state
scheme for the Maxwell pensioners. But that is a dismal pittance; and the
government's dilatory behaviour in implementing the relevant provisions of
the 1990 Act means that the trustees' only obvious recourse, in the absence
of constructive Whitehall intervention, is to embark on a time-consuming
test case. That would create further uncertainty for the pension fund
members as well as running the risk that heavy legal costs might further
reduce the resources of the funds.
This underlines, once again, the way in which the odds in occupational
pension schemes have been unduly tilted against the employees. Even if the
relevant legislation had been in place, the members of the Maxwell pension
funds would merely have ranked as unsecured creditors. Yet most of them
probably regarded their stake in the fund as a form of remuneration for work
that they had already done.
Questionable value
The pensions lobby, in contrast, argues that pensions are not deferred pay
because the employer has to meet the balance of the cost of providing
pensions after employees have made a fixed contribution. Yet in practice
this apparent guarantee of solvency is of questionable value since most
trust deeds permit the employer to discontinue the scheme unilaterally. This
leads to a situation where the employer enjoys disproportionate benefit from
any pension fund surplus, while the employee loses most of the benefit of
the guarantee if the employer chooses not to implement it or the company
goes to the wall.
The government must bear substantial responsibility both for the Maxwell
pensions debacle and the wider shortcomings of the occupational pensions
system. Had ministers heeded the calls for the rapid introduction of tighter
regulations governing pension funds, Mr Maxwell might, at the very least,
have found it harder to plunder and loot. The role of Imro in providing a
seal of approval to Mr Maxwell's in-house fund management group also raises
questions about the effectiveness of the Financial Services Act.
Pension fund members both in and out of the Maxwell group have been
singularly ill-served and their reasonable expectations have been needlessly
frustrated. It is inevitable that they will be frustrated again, unless the
government is prepared to confront the problems of the underlying conflict
of interest. That means that it must recognise that the whole point of a
pension fund is to provide pensions. Membership of occupational pension
schemes should be made part of employees' contracts of employment.

Kuwait looks to have developed its own variant of Russian Roulette in the
shape of the '170 Rule' being bandied around by Kuwait City residents
jittery about renewed Iraqi attack.
Many have bought all-terrain vehicles in readiness for a fast escape across
the desert. The trouble is that the sands hide millions of mines and such
left from the Gulf war.
Hence the rule, based on the idea that if you hit the mines fast enough, you
are safely past them before they explode. 'Anything over 170km a hour and
you can watch them go off in your rear view mirror,' says one expatriate.
He has not yet tried it personally, however. Nor is it clear whether the
rule includes allowance for 10 per cent speedometer error.

Despite all the fine talk about equal opportunity, women still stand a much
better chance of making it to the top in Britain's civil service than in Big
Business. Barbara Mills's switch from heading the Serious Fraud Office to
being the director Of public prosecutions is just the latest example.
By contrast, Anne Ferguson's appointment as a non-executive director of
National Power is less of a breakthrough. Like Yve Newbold, Hanson's company
secretary who has gone on to the BT board, the 49-year-old Ferguson has an
impressive record.
She has been responsible for modernising ICI's public persona. So her
experience should certainly help to add force to what National Power
surrealistically terms its 'invisible image'.
Nevertheless, her appointment once again raises the question of why women
are so rarely given executive directorships, as distinct from the
non-executive variety.
The response of Newbold and Ferguson, as loyal corporate types, is to say
that it won't be long before ICI and Hanson appoint women to fully fledged
directorships. But Observer is fast growing tired of waiting.

English politicians apparently strike a kindly, avuncular chord in the heart
of Graf Otto Lambsdorff, chairman of Germany's liberal free democrats. For
instance, he excused Nicholas Ridley's anti-German tirade by saying the Tory
minister must have been either drunk or unbalanced by England's defeat by
Germany in the World Cup.
Now the Prussian aristocrat has cabled his sympathies to an Englishman
politically more in tune with his own philosophy. 'Dear Paddy, don't worry,
be happy - and go on,' his message says.
Alas, while knowing about soldiering on, Lambsdorff's own career is hardly a
propitious example. Forced out of the economics ministry in 1984 after
embroilment in the Flick affair (alleged party donations for tax
concessions, rather than amatory dalliance), it took him four years to make
his political comeback.

Some unseemly crackle, it would appear, on the hot line twixt the Bank of
England and the Treasury. The latter's feathers have been ruffled by advance
copies of the Bank's latest quarterly bulletin which, although sporting
technicolour graphics for the first time, contained some sombre thoughts
about the imminence of recovery from the recession.
While Treasury officials do not want to be accused of being economical with
the truth, they feel a duty to back Norman Lamont's rosier view of the next
few months. And with the election coming up, there's an even more pressing
reason not to let spirits sag.
This explains why the Treasury has been turning to its blue pencil even more
assiduously than usual to suggest amendments to the part of the bulletin
dealing with economic prospects.
Bank officials always find irksome having to submit their finely honed words
to the scrutiny of their colleagues on the other side of London. On this
occasion, however, Observer understands sparks have flown.
At least the Treasury has not so far objected to the Bank's plan to change
the bulletin's publication day to Tuesday, instead of Thursday, because the
Old Lady thinks this will lead to greater publicity for the contents.

The Germans may be accused of throwing their weight around these days, but
one area where they have patently put up a miserable show is in securing the
top spot at major European or international institutions.
The head of the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank is deutsch - if
anyone noticed - but otherwise it is the French, defying Nicholas Ridley's
canine comparisons, who have long made the running. Not unlike the British,
the Germans seem to regard Brussels as the place to palm off problem
politicians; and no German has ever been nominated for the big IMF job.
The betting is that this reticence will evaporate when the European central
bank hoves into view. But then there is the diplomatic teaser that, if they
are as mustard-keen as they appear to secure the siting of this worthy
institution on home turf, it would be a tall order to expect to be granted a
countryman as the first president into the bargain.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology: A speedy recovery - The London Ambulance Service
is improving the way it cares for accident victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day in London some 2,000 calls are made to the accident and emergency
ambulance service.
Each caller has the same motive - to get the victim of a sudden serious
illness or accident transported to hospital as quickly as possible. For some
patients, however, the prospects of recovery will depend on the quality of
treatment received before they reach the hospital gates.
The speed with which a patient begins getting appropriate medical attention
after a life-threatening incident often influences the chances of survival.
This means beginning treatment at the scene rather than in hospital, and
Britain's ambulance services are upgrading both their technology and
training to make them better equipped for this task.
Stage one of any treatment involves the ambulance service reaching the scene
of an incident. In London this is not always easy.
The London Ambulance Service, the biggest in the world, is currently
investing heavily in new equipment and extending the technical skills of its
crews. But it has some of Britain's poorest response times. This is caused
by the capital's traffic problems and, in a service which serves 7m people,
a huge element of unpredictability in demand. While 2,000 emergency calls is
the daily average, there were 800 during a single hour of a recent icy
morning.
Computerisation of the control room at the service's Waterloo headquarters,
which begins this month, should improve the speed and efficiency with which
ambulances are despatched to incidents.
Under the existing manual system details of emergencies are written down by
telephone operators and then passed across the control room to despatch
clerks. The clerks locate an ambulance from a manually-updated file of
available vehicles and relay details of the incident by radio to the
ambulance or telephone to its local station.
In future the precise location, direction of travel, speed and availability
of each of the capital's accident and emergency ambulances will be
pinpointed on computer screens in the control room which display street maps
of London. The information will be updated every 13 seconds.
This moving picture of available resources will make it much easier for
controllers to identify the ambulance nearest to an incident, and create a
more flexible and mobile service in which the fixed-location ambulance
station will decline in importance. A controller receiving a call will type
the details into the computer. They will then be transmitted to a terminal
in the ambulance.
The computer will prompt controllers to ask telephone callers reporting
incidents a series of simple questions - Is the patient conscious? bleeding?
 -which will help to ensure that the most highly trained crews attend
incidents where their skills are required.
London Ambulance Service managers also plan an experiment in giving
first-aid advice over the telephone while the ambulance is on its way to an
emergency. A few basic steps to prevent choking or stem profuse bleeding may
preserve life until qualified help arrives.
Other measures are also being used to get emergency medical assistance to
serious incidents more rapidly. Paramedics patrolling central London on
motorcycles are proving their worth at overcoming traffic jams, in some
cases beginning stabilisation of patients within a few minutes of a call.
The paramedics are central to the current efforts to develop Britain's
ambulance crews into a highly qualified front-line emergency medicine
service. The government intends that all accident and emergency ambulances
carry a paramedic by the mid-1990s.
Paramedics are trained to perform life-saving functions like the
resuscitation of heart attack victims, the insertion of tubes to maintain
airways and the intravenous replacement of fluid after severe blood loss
which previously had to await a patient's arrival at hospital.
Before attending the initial seven-week paramedic training course ambulance
staff must have at least two years' accident and emergency experience and
then, after qualifying as paramedics, face periodic re-testing.
Medical procedures are usually most successfully carried out by people who
perform them regularly. Some ambulance managers believe it could prove
counter-productive to have too many paramedics, since they would spend much
of their time attending routine incidents which did not require their
expertise.
Equipment is being evaluated which would enable London paramedics to carry
out electro-cardiograph tests, possibly transmitting the images by cellphone
to hospital doctors for advice on what action to take.
Accident and emergency ambulances are being redesigned with fewer windows to
provide more storage space for high-technology equipment such as cardiac
defibrillators, resuscitators and traction splints, and to give paramedics a
better working area. London's new Leyland DAFs, converted by Customline,
carry only one stretcher rather than the traditional two - it is demanding
enough for a single paramedic to care for even one patient while speeding
through traffic, says Barry Home, the London Ambulance Service's special
services manager.
Technological advance will continue to increase the range of life-saving
equipment which it is possible to load into ambulances. 'But ultimately the
decision-making skills of the paramedic are as important as knowing how to
carry out procedures and use equipment,' says Home.
'The person on the spot must decide what action to take in what is always a
unique situation. It means paramedic training and experience must be of the
highest quality.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / Management: Chameleons in their true colours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How times change. To be branded as either a 'chameleon' or a 'collaborator'
always used to be an insult. The first epithet meant you were unreliable,
trying to be all things to all people. The second meant you were consorting
with the enemy.
But both words have suddenly become compliments, in the corporate world, at
least. They indicate not only that your organisation has an above average
chance of surviving the intense competitive battles of coming decades, but
also that it is a rewarding place for people to work.
So says a stimulating new study on strategies and structures for fast-moving
markets, which attempts to synthesize and demystify leading-edge theory and
practice in virtually every walk of management.
Under the straightforward title of 'Building Flexible Companies'*, it
condenses into admirably simple English its discussion of some of the most
jargon-ridden fashions and practices of the day: 'customer focus'; total
quality management (TQM); flat hierarchies and 'value-driven' networks;
teamwork; time-based competition; and strategic alliances.
The competitive environment of the 1990s and beyond requires companies to
become two things above all, argues the report. First, they must be
'change-based and adaptive' - hence the 'chameleon' image. Second, they must
be alliance- rather than fortress-minded, both externally towards other
companies, and internally between different departments and disciplines -
hence the emphasis on collaboration.
Both images are more approachable formulations of management styles
advocated by various academics and gurus. The collaborator notion is close
to the Harvard concept of the 'boundary-less' company, while the chameleon
approximates to 'living with ambiguity and paradox', or just 'reconciling
opposites'.
Thus the chameleon company must shift from being product-driven to
customer-led, but without going too far, as Ford of Europe did with the
design of its latest Escort car which was based over-literally on the
apparent desires of mid-1980s customers, and has proved too bland for
today's.
Likewise, the chameleon company must dismantle much of the corporate
hierarchy in order to be flat and fast, yet it must not abandon all
co-ordination and strategic control. One company that did so, a Swedish
information technolended up confused, undisciplined and directionless. It
has since had to install various central functions, while retaining much of
its decentralisation.
This theme of Yin and Yang runs through most of the report - except, oddly
enough, in the sections on collaboration with other companies. Here, the
authors are so intent on persuading corporations out of their traditional
fortress mentalities, and into the new world of shifting alliances on almost
every front, that they go in for overkill.
They are right that the traditional model of a company is of an autonomous
citadel full of knowledge, capital and skills in a stable world where such
attributes are at a premium.
In today's world, however, knowledge (including technology) and capital are
widely available, as are most skills. In addition, markets are becoming
ephemeral and liable to sudden change. So, as the study says, it is not
merely uneconomic, but dangerous, for a company to try to do everything
itself.
Instead, the report argues that companies must themselves learn to become
ephemeral, and to exploit ad hoc alliances of knowledge, skills and
capacity.
Contrary to what the authors claim, however, this does not mean that
companies must 'abandon fixed emplacements' and 'leave behind their skills
of defence'. If they did so entirely, they would have nothing left to
bargain and collaborate with. They would be empty shells.
Instead of going over the top in this way, the authors should have devoted
more space to discussing how to balance collaboration with the fashionable
and important idea of 'core competencies' - to which they pay scant
attention.
As expounded particularly by C. K. Prahalad of Michigan University and Gary
Hamel of the London Business School, this argues that companies should first
redefine what really makes them tick - Honda's engine technology, for
instance, or 3M's adhesives, coatings and substrates. They should then
build, leverage and defend them for all they are worth.
The core competence concept is having a powerful effect on the corporate
world. In both Europe and the US, companies are redefining and focusing
their cores, investing more heavily in them, and exploiting them more. They
sometimes use temporary alliances to help them do this but such
collaboration is of a different character from that involved in sharing or
contracting-out activities about which the company no longer feels
proprietorial.
The chameleon company is all very well - but it must stand for something
more positive, and more motivating to its managers and other employees, than
merely constant change. Otherwise, like many real chameleons in the natural
world, it risks being squashed underfoot.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM warns of 'danger' in Scots
secession - News in brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister last night expressed confidence that Scots would reject
independence if the option were put to them at a referendum. He warned that
the prospect of an independent Scotland would be 'immensely dangerous'.
Questioned in an interview on BBC radio about a recent surge in support for
secession, Mr John Major reiterated his belief in the union with England and
Wales, saying that some Scots failed to recognise how much independence
would cost them.
When his interviewer argued that some 70 per cent of Scots now favoured some
form of devolution, Mr Major referred back to the surge in nationalism that
led to the plebiscite in 1979 on the creation of a national assembly. 'We
had a referendum once before,' he said. 'But when faced with the reality, it
melted away.'
The prime minister also rejected any comparisons between support for the
aspirations of newly independent states in eastern Europe and opposition to
Scottish nationalists.
The Act of Union had been entered into voluntarily and had been beneficial
for all parts of the UK, he said.

RPI: New methods are being considered for the calculation of the retail
prices index to take account of the council tax when it replaces poll tax,
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in a written Commons reply last
night.
The poll tax is included in the index with food prices, mortgage rates and
prices of leading goods.
Mr Lamont said the RPI advisory committee would also look at modifying the
index to take account of holiday expenditure and changes in new car prices,
and how it might be brought into line with similar indices in other European
countries.
*****
THIRD WORLD: The Conservative manifesto will include a warning that aid will
be cut for developing countries which failed to practice 'good government',
Mrs Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, said yesterday.
She added: 'Where human rights are systematically abused, or where aid is
feeding corruption rather than mouths, we shall have no alternative but to
cut it.'

BRITISH RAIL: Mr John Prescott, Labour transport spokesman, said last night
that if the government did not change BR financing arrangements so it could
buy new rolling stock, ministers would risk killing off Britain's rail
manufacturing industry.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Green' measure of GDP propose -
Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW way of measuring national income which takes better account of
environmental factors - a 'green gross domestic product' - will be endorsed
next week by the Liberal Democrats.
Based on the idea of a 'sustainable net national income', it proposes that
some environmentally undesirable activities should count as minuses in
calculating gross domestic product (GDP), and that weight should be given to
'green' initiatives which are not included under the current measurements.
The party believes that it would take about five years to set up the system,
which could ultimately replace the existing one.
The system derives from a report, to be published next week, by Mr Roefie
Heuting, an environmental economist who advises the Dutch government. It
addresses the point that while cleaning up pollution counts as economic
activity and is thus included in the calculation of GDP, benefits from
initiatives such as investment in energy efficiency and low-energy
technology are not included.
By becoming the first party to commit itself to developing these plans, the
Liberal Democrats believe they can reinforce their high profile on
environmental issues.
Party officials believe there is some frustration among government
environmental advisers that little or no progress has been made on work in
this area, though there was some discussion of it when the white paper on
the environment was published in 1990.
Among the activities that the report proposes should be included in GDP
calculations are afforestation, a shift away from air traffic to greater use
of water and rail and the replacement of paper by electronic publication.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges pre-Budget incentives
 -Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called on the government to introduce investment incentives
for industry before next month's Budget as it sought to pin the blame for
the recession firmly on Conservative policies.
Its concerted attack included attempts to undermine the credibility of Mr
John Major, the prime minister, on economic issues and to cast doubt on the
government's ability to engineer a recovery. In particular, the assault
targeted the government's repeated contention that present economic
difficulties are worldwide.
The government responded by branding Labour gloom-merchants and asserting
that the worst of the domestic recession was over. Current policies would
help to produce low inflation, low interest rates and improved confidence,
which were the preconditions for a sustained recovery.
In another heated clash with the prime minister, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour
leader, recalled that on Tuesday Mr Major wrongly included Japan among
countries whose economies were in recession. Mr Major was 'imagining
recovery at home while inventing recessions abroad'. He added: 'There are
economies that are slowing - ours is in reverse because of your policies.'
Mr Major said growth in Japan 'has slowed or is slowing'. He added that Mr
John Smith, the shadow chancellor, had now acknowledged the 'downturn' in
the world situation. He asserted that Labour's policies would result in
higher taxes and inflation, and lead to 'perpetual recession'.
At an earlier Labour press conference, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and
industry secretary, had questioned the government's ability to steer the
economy out of the doldrums.
'It is because the prime minister cannot admit he is wrong that he cannot
take action to put the economy right,' he said, using a graph to indicate
how the government had repeatedly erred in its economic forecasts.
He challenged Mr Major to 'overrule the chancellor over investment
incentives now demanded' by industry in a series of Budget submissions.
The prime minister's 'claims about a worldwide recession' were simply an
attempt to 'shift the blame from the government's own responsibility for
economic failure'.
Mr Brown returned to this theme in a strongly-worded address in the Commons,
during which he stated 'there is no world recession' and claimed Mr Major
was condemned by his own words as economically illiterate.
Turning to the government's forecasting record, he compared Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, with the weatherman Mr Michael Fish. But whereas Mr
Fish was remembered for his mistake over predicting the 1987 hurricanes, the
chancellor was utterly reliable. 'He will always let you down,' he said.
Mr Brown sought to contrast the positive economic message produced by a
number of Tory-leaning newspapers with the more cautious words delivered to
shareholders by senior executives of the companies which owned the
newspapers. The truth was that the government was conjuring up a recovery
which did not exist with a publicity machine which did not even believe in
it, he said.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, forecast that a Labour
election victory would be followed by a run on the pound, and challenged Mr
Brown to say how he would deal with the situation.
Would Labour put up interest rates to maintain the existing parity or would
it devalue, he asked. When Mr Brown did not respond, Mr Lilley said that
every Labour government had in fact done both.
Mr Kenneth Warren (C Hastings and Rye), chairman of the Commons trade and
industry committee, called on the chancellor to consider how to raise
returns on investment in manufacturing industry and criticised the tough
treatment of small business by banks.
A Labour motion condemning government economic mismanagement was defeated by
187 votes to 292.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tax lesson escapes many Tory
memories - Philip Stephens draws a parallel between this Budget and Sir
Geoffrey Howe's in 1981
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS have short memories. As the Commons debated the recession
yesterday only a handful of Conservative MPs would admit that Mr Norman
Lamont should do anything but cut taxes in his Budget on March 10.
The orthodox wisdom on the government benches is that a pre-election boost
to the economy through lower income taxes would represent a perfect
coincidence of economic good sense and political advantage.
A Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn tax cut - and some Conservative MPs are now
suggesting that would be a modest reduction - would be entirely consistent
with the party's reputation for prudence, because of the depth of the
recession.
A jump in the public sector borrowing requirement to more than Pounds 20bn,
the argument runs, can be brushed off as simply a mirror image of the
economic cycle. It will gradually disappear naturally once the economy
returns to growth, in line with the policy of balancing the budget over the
medium term.
The fact that 1p off the basic rate of income tax or a sharp rise in
thresholds would also define the essential difference between the
Conservatives and Labour just before the election is no more than chance.
No one seems to remember 1981.
That was the year when Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first government was battling
with a similarly deep recession. Sir Geoffrey Howe, then chancellor, faced
intense pressure from the Opposition, from some in the cabinet, and from the
economics establishment to stimulate the economy by cutting taxes.
He did the reverse, putting them up by Pounds 3.6bn. The budget provoked a
storm of criticism culminating in its condemnation by 364 respected
economists. It sparked a debate about the role of fiscal policy which lasted
for most of the 1980s. If Mr Lamont followed Sir Geoffrey's example he would
put taxes up by about Pounds 7bn.
The parallels are striking. In the spring of 1981 it seemed that the economy
was locked in recession, but subsequent evidence showed that a recovery was
already under way. Mr Lamont insists the same will be true of this year. The
pound was then strong, although it was already slipping from its
extraordinary rise of the previous year. Inflation, as now, was falling
fast.
Ministers insist the differences are just as important. The government was
then following a money-supply target which included public borrowing as a
key component. That has been replaced by sterling's membership of the
Exchange Rate Mechanism, in theory a tighter constraint on cuts in interest
rates. (Few remember that the 1981 package was followed by a rise rather
than a cut in borrowing costs).
Sir Geoffrey was faced with a much higher structural budget deficit and a
substantially larger national debt than that confronting Mr Lamont.
The present chancellor can argue that large debt repayments during the 1980s
provide room for higher borrowing during a recession.
The few Conservative MPs whose memories stretch back to 1981 - and they tend
to be unreconstructed monetarists - are not convinced. They recall that once
it was clear that Sir Geoffrey's budget had not stifled the recovery,
ministers argued consistently that the rise in taxes had helped rather than
hindered the economy's emergence from recession.
Mr Nigel Lawson insisted repeatedly that attempts to influence the economic
cycle through fine-tuning of fiscal policy were inevitably misguided. He
stuck firmly to that principle when he cut taxes when the economy was
growing strongly. For most of Mr Lawson's tenure at the Treasury 'fiscal
stabilisers' was a proscribed phrase.
Now the government's supporters expect Mr Lamont to offer a seamless
justification for reducing the tax burden during a recession as well as in a
boom. But, as one survivor of that first administration recalls, there is
one essential difference between then and now.
Sir Geoffrey's package was unveiled two years rather than at most two months
before a general election.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Europe-wide union mergers forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL JORDAN, president of the AEU engineering union, yesterday predicted
that mergers between unions of different European countries were likely
following the creation of the single market, Michael Smith writes.
Mr Jordan said 1992 had set in motion an unstoppable process. He predicted
that mergers of European unions would happen within his lifetime.
Mr Jordan was speaking before holding talks in Dusseldorf with Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, president of IG Metall, the German manufacturing union. They
were discussing the merger of the AEU and the EETPU electricians' union,
likely to take place within three months, and the relationship between the
merged union and IG Metall.
In a recent campaign to win shorter hours, the UK unions drew lessons from a
similar drive by West German unions in the mid 1980s.
Mr Jordan said he saw the merged union of 1m members working even more
closely with IG Metall. He said: 'Together we will forge a partnership that
will meet and match the growing power of multi-national companies.
'But there is a positive message for Europe's employers; that the aims of
this engineering union alliance are simply the best pay, conditions and
products in the world.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Footwear workers accept pay freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS representing 20,000 footwear workers yesterday accepted a
three-month pay freeze, as print employers said that they were also looking
for a pay deferral in negotiations covering their industry.
In a deal covering shoe manufacturing affiliates to the National Union of
Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades, 20,000 employees will receive no pay
rise for three months from the March 9 settlement. Rates will rise by 3.75
per cent from June, and talks on a successor settlement will begin in
January.
The union said last month that an increase from March was a minimum
requirement for any deal. The employers had wanted a six-month freeze with a
3 per cent rise from September and cost-of-living-related rises in March and
September next year.
The British Printing Industries Federation told the GPMU print union that as
well as seeking a pay deferral it wanted wider wage differentials between
different groups of workers.
It also wants an agreement on integrated press rooms 'which would allow for
printing machines to be operated by a skilled and fully flexible workforce .
. . we will also wish to address the question of multi-skilling across craft
occupations'.
Mr Tony Dubbins, GPMU general secretary, said a freeze was totally
unacceptable.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Shoring up the house of Ucatt / A look
at a union hit by defections and corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUILDING union Ucatt is to make what could be a last bid for survival
when it announces a relaunch at the end of this month under its new general
secretary, Mr George Brumwell.
A series of events over the past year - including allegations of ballot
rigging, the suspension of the general secretary and mass defections of
officials to rival unions - have shaken the union to its foundations.
If the relaunch fails, Ucatt may finally find itself unable to resist
pressures to merge with another union.
A conference for full-time officials in three weeks will hear the grim truth
about the state of the union. Mr Brumwell is to spell out the need to halt
the decline in membership figures, eliminate corrupt practices, and
establish a new political direction for the union.
The latest chain of events may well be seen in future years as the start of
Ucatt's renaissance or the begining of its end. The process began in May
with a change of control in the union's executive.
It is misleading to define factions within Ucatt as 'right' or 'left' - what
can be said is that the members of the newly elected executive stood
together in wanting change.
Within a short time they had suspended Mr Albert Williams, who retires
officially next week as general secretary, and announced the setting up of
an independent inquiry under Mr John Hands QC into allegations of misconduct
during Mr Williams' tenure.
There followed the unedifying spectacle of Mr Williams, with financial
assistance from the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members,
battling with his own union in the High Court to retain his position. He was
eventually reinstated when it was proved that the suspension had not been
carried out according to Ucatt's own rule book.
The defections, which at one time threatened to engulf the entire union
movement in a row over poaching of members, boiled over in June during Mr
Williams' suspension. A total of 13 senior officials, many of them
frightened that they would be victimised by the new executive, left the
union.
Their first stop en masse was the GMB general union, where Mr John Edmonds,
GMB general secretary, offered what he said was a 'safe haven' to Ucatt
members and officials. Mr Edmonds argued that Ucatt faced 'virtual
disintegration and financial collapse'. The TUC was saved from having to
intervene publicly - and perhaps discipline its second-largest affiliate -
by the withdrawal of most of the GMB job offers to the ex-Ucatt officials.
All but two of the officials then turned to the non-TUC- affiliated EETPU
electricians' union. Since then, Ucatt's membership base has been under
attack from the rival union. Undoubtedly some damage was done to Ucatt by
the EETPU, although it is impossible to disentangle the propaganda put out
by both sides from the facts.
Ucatt officials feel the worst of the threat from the EETPU is now over.
Amalgamation talks between the EETPU and AEU engineering union have dampened
the electricians' ardour: the AEU strongly opposed the EETPU's poaching
moves and the TUC has indicated that it could not look on the merger
favourably if the EETPU continues such activities.
A stronger threat comes from the continued recession and the union's
dependence on 'check-off' for the collection of subscriptions: if there is
no work, union members are not having their union dues deducted from their
earnings. Membership has now dipped to just over 200,000 from a level of
240,000 in recent years; a Pounds 500,000 deficit last year could be
repeated again this year. Plans for the restructuring of the union and the
sale of property will be presented to the conference at the end of the
month.
The outstanding issue remains corruption and the long-awaited outcome of the
Hands inquiry - Ucatt's equivalent to the National Union of Mineworkers'
Lightman report. It now looks unlikely that ballot-rigging charges will be
substantiated. However, Hands will probably make recommendations about the
future conduct of elections and ways in which Ucatt's constitution should be
altered.
There could, for example, be a recommendation that branch balloting should
be replaced by postal voting and that candidates should be allowed openly to
campaign for election, instead of covertly, as often happens now.
Whatever the findings, officials are hoping the inquiry will be concluded
soon so that a clear line can be drawn under previous events before the
union's relaunch.
Amore difficult change for Mr Brumwell to implement will be a general
cleaning up of the way business is conducted. For the first time at the
conference officials will discuss a strategy for recruitment and be given
clear targets.
A package designed to attract self-employed building workers - who now
account for more than 700,000 of a 1.3m workforce - will be drawn up.
A new accountability will be spelled out: no longer will it be possible for
officials to wander around the country without anyone knowing where they
are. Relations with employers, which have frequently been too cosy, must be
cleaned up, Mr Brumwell will say.
As one insider put it: 'Officials will be told 'if you can eat and drink it
(what's being offered by a contractor), fine; if you can spend it, it's
not.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Subdued party fails to bury Ashdown
rumpus - Liberal Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT'S business as usual,' was the refrain of the Liberal Democrats
yesterday, one day after Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission that he had an affair
with his former secretary five years ago. Inevitably, however, it was not.
Statements from the two women involved - Mr Ashdown's wife Jane and his
former secretary Ms Tricia Howard - together with an arrest in connection
with the theft of the document which led to Mr Ashdown's public admission,
meant the party could not put the matter behind it in a single day.
There was a strange silence as Mr Ashdown rose in his place in the Commons
yesterday afternoon to put a question to the prime minister. Either heckling
or murmurs of support had been variously expected. His call for co-operation
between politicians in Northern Ireland drew warm agreement from Mr John
Major, but Mr Ashdown looked tense and somewhat abstracted.
In a concerted effort to raise party morale Mr Ashdown gave a pep talk to
workers at the Liberal Democrat headquarters in Cowley Street yesterday
morning, while Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign manager, wrote to those
involved in general election work expressing pride in Mr Ashdown's
leadership.
Colleagues said Mr Ashdown was 'in good heart', but the tone of party
managers was almost subdued.
On BBC radio Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, seemed to imply
that lack of time was an element in any lack of change to the party's
campaign strategy.
Mr Wilson said that Mr Ashdown would remain at the head of the campaign. He
added that the plan was for a team of the younger MPs to have a high
profile. He had already approved a series of advertisements in which Mr
Ashdown did not feature, as he would be appearing extensively in news
coverage.
There was clearly some anger among Mr Ashdown's colleagues at the extensive
treatment of the story by some tabloid newspapers, which Mr Wilson accused
of trying to deliver a knock-out blow. 'They have failed,' he said
emphasising the flood of letters and telephone calls of support that the
party had received.
Mr Ashdown travelled to his Yeovil constituency last night, and prepared for
his local party's annual general meeting today. His next party engagement is
the launch on Tuesday of a campaign to get constitutional reform on to the
election agenda. By then, the party hopes, it really will be business as
usual.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Howard faces EC row on maternity
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the employment secretary, looks set for a battle with the
European Commission and other member states over EC plans to improve minimum
standards for maternity benefits.
A delicate compromise, pushed through by the Dutch and the British at the
end of last year, looks likely to unravel when it goes before the European
parliament next month. Under that compromise women would be entitled to a
minimum of 14 weeks' pay at the same level as staff unable to work for
health reasons.
That is considered inadequate by the Commission, the European parliament and
several member states.
The proposal will probably be amended by the parliament, at the prompting of
the Commission, to 75 per cent of average earnings for 14 weeks.
This new deal will have to be unanimously rejected by employment ministers
for the original British and Dutch compromise to prevail.
For the new deal to be accepted, however, it will still need to be approved
by a qualified majority of employment ministers.
'There is a possibility that neither proposal will prevail and the whole
issue will be deadlocked,' said a British official.
This could further isolate the UK in employment matters just before it is
due to take over the EC presidency in July.
A recent House of Lords report on the EC's maternity proposals gives some
support to the UK government by criticising the Commission's 'inadequate'
analysis of the economic implications of its proposals.
Britain may be challenged under EC competition rules for having lower social
standards than other members states, according to an analysis of the
Maastricht treaty, due to be signed today.
In a report for US companies Mr Bill Brock, the former US trade
representative, said that in the short term it would be 'business as usual'
in the social and employment field in spite of the UK's 'opt-out' from
extending EC powers in this area.
Mr Brock warns that if the 11 EC member states, excluding the UK, do
introduce extensive new social legislation 'Europe's attraction as a
location for investment will be substantially damaged'.
A separate report from Incomes Data Services, the research group, on the
effects of the 'opt-out' stresses that the UK will not be able to opt-out
from very much.
It says: 'All the indications are that the Commission will continue to
introduce proposals under the exist-ing machinery as far as possible.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / PowerGen awards big turbine contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, has chosen GEC Alsthom, the
Franco-British engineering group, as main contractor for its 1,360MW
combined-cycle gas turbine power station at Connah's Quay, Clwyd.
The station, which will cost about Pounds 580m if a second optional phase is
built, will provide power for more than 1.25m people and create about 1,000
jobs during construction. It is scheduled to begin operating commercially in
1995.
The deal is the third big combined-cycle contract in three weeks for GEC
Alsthom, which says it has more than 50 per cent of the UK market and at
least 20 per cent of the world market for this type of power equipment.
Mr Kelvin Bray, chairman and chief executive of European Gas Turbines, a GEC
Alsthom subsidiary, said that the company was talking to more than five
other potential UK clients.
Combined-cycle systems use exhaust gases from a gas turbine to power a steam
turbine, thereby reducing emissions and producing overall thermal efficiency
of well over 50 per cent compared with 35 per cent to 40 per cent for
coal-fired stations.
The system is also quicker to build than large coal-fired stations and has
proved particularly attractive to the privatised UK utilities. GEC Alsthom
was an early victim of the trend away from coal-fired plants as potential
contracts from the Central Electricity Generating Board for such plants were
cancelled after privatisation of electricity generation. GEC Alsthom lost
out initially to suppliers such as Siemens of Germany which were better
prepared to exploit the new market in the UK.
GEC Alsthom has since hit back strongly in the UK and overseas
combined-cycle markets, thanks partly to its 212MW to 226MW 9F turbine,
jointly developed by GEC Alsthom and General Electric of the US.
It is the world's largest gas turbine and is also claimed to be the most
efficient. Yesterday's contract brings GEC Alsthom's orders for the 9F to
14.
The first phase at Connah's Quay involves three 340MW Vega 109F modules  -
where the turbine and the steam generator are linked on a single shaft -
with a fourth module on option for the second phase.
The new station, which still awaits planning consents, is to be built on the
site of a coal-fired station which closed in 1982. Mr Ed Wallis, chief
executive of PowerGen, said that the contract represented 'a further step
ahead in our strategy to achieve a balanced range of fuel for generation'.
GEC Alsthom will build the gas turbines at Belfort in France and the steam
turbines and generators at Rugby and Stafford. The UK content of the project
will be more than 55 per cent.
Separately, GEC Alsthom said that it had won an order worth about Pounds 13m
from National Grid for a 400kV indoor gas insulated switchgear substation at
Barking, east London.
NEI Power Projects, part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group,
announced a contract worth almost Pounds 20m to extend La Collette power
station in Jersey to meet increased demand.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Channel rail order for GEC Alsthom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-delayed order for Channel tunnel sleeper trains is to be awarded to
GEC Alsthom, British Rail said yesterday.
The decision on the contract - thought to be worth Pounds 115m - clears the
way for night trains to start running from Britain's regions to Paris and
Brussels from late in 1994.
There will also be two Continental sleeper services from London each night.
One will go to Amsterdam and the other to Cologne, dividing into portions
for Dortmund and Frankfurt.
All 139 Channel tunnel sleeping cars are to be built at GEC Alsthom's
Metro-Cammell plant in Washwood Heath, east Birmingham.
The contract is unlikely to be formally placed for several weeks because the
leasing deal which is expected to finance it has yet to be arranged.
The premature announcement of the contract may give rise to suspicions that
it is intended to mollify the regions in the run-up to the general election.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Sony chief says accountants should not lead industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR AKIO MORITA, chairman of Sony Corporation, the Japanese electronics
group, last night challenged the way senior executives are promoted in
British industry by declaring that accountants should not run manufacturing
companies.
Mr Morita, originator of the Walkman portable stereo and other consumer
electronics products, was giving the first in a series of lectures on
innovation organised by the Department of Trade and Industry. The lectures
are intended to raise the profile of innovation within British industry.
He contrasted Japan, where almost every big manufacturing group is run by an
engineer or technologist, with Britain, where a significant proportion of
manufacturing companies are run by executives with a background in
accountancy.
Mr Morita said senior executives of a company had to be committed to
technology and engineering to promote innovation at lower levels.
'Here in the UK I am told some manufacturers are led by chief executives who
do not understand the engineering that goes into their own products,' he
said. 'Someone mentioned to me that many UK corporations are headed by
chartered accountants. This strikes me as very curious.'
Mr Morita continued: 'Though I have a great deal of respect for accountants
and financial professionals, I do not believe they should be at the helm of
industry.'
Successive studies of senior British management have found that more top
British industrialists have a background in finance and accountancy than
those in competitor countries such as Germany, France and Japan.
Mr Morita called on companies to give technologists higher status to combat
the widespread view that engineers are similar to mechanics.
He said: 'We must advance young technologists through the managerial ranks.
Manufacturing and high-technology corporations must be led by those who
understand not just business but technology as well.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / Preparing the case for the prosecution: Robert Rice opens
the files on Barbara Mills, the new DPP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Mrs Barbara Mills' brief reign at the Serious Fraud Office's Elm
Street headquarters was not the nightmare of the film title it was no bed of
roses either.
She leaves the fledgling SFO facing the prospect of finding its third head
in its 3 1/2 -year history and at a time when observers are increasingly
asking when it is going to live up to early promises of a fast and efficient
system for tackling white-collar crime.
Mrs Mills arrived at the SFO in September 1990 in time to bask in the glory
of the successful first Guinness prosecution in which she appeared as second
Crown prosecutor - the SFO's only significant success to date. She leaves in
time to escape the worst of the criticism which is building up about the
handling of the Blue Arrow case.
She comes to the DPP's job at a time when the criminal justice system is
under the spotlight following a series of celebrated miscarriages of
justice. Much of the attention of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice,
set up after the release of the Birmingham Six, will focus on the role of
the Crown Prosecution Service, and she will have a pivotal part to play in
shaping its future direction.
Having successfully juggled a career at the Bar with bringing up four
children, the job of DPP is one that colleagues say she is more than capable
of. Both the Law Society and the Bar welcomed her appointment yesterday.
The Bar said she had 'the right balance of experience between prosecuting
and defending to make a good successor to Sir Allan Green.
Privately, however, colleagues are less complimentary. One QC said: 'It's
generally felt she didn't distinguish herself in either the Guinness
prosecution or her defence of Winston Silcott in the PC Blakelock murder
trial, and apart from that her career at the Bar consisted mainly of
run-of-the-mill trials at the Old Bailey.'
She has a reputation for hard work and good judgment. Aged 51, she was
called to the Bar in 1963, became a Crown Court Recorder in 1982 and QC in
1986.
Mrs Mills' successor at the SFO will be left to pick up some of the biggest
and most difficult fraud investigations ever undertaken. He will inherit the
unenviable task of trying to carry the Polly Peck, BCCI and Maxwell cases
forward to a successful conclusion under the increasingly hostile gaze of a
public growing sceptical about the SFO's ability to deliver the goods. There
is little doubt that the SFO's task has grown more difficult over the past
18 months. Its conviction rate last year was just 63 per cent, compared with
the 90 per cent rate historically produced by the Metropolitan and City
Fraud Squad.
Its caseload is still the same as when Mrs Mills took over from Mr John
Wood, the SFO's first director, but the amount involved in the frauds under
investigation has soared from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 4.5bn.
It stands accused of taking a cavalier attitude to civil liberties and in
particular of riding roughshod over the suspect's long-established privilege
against self-incrimination as justification for refusing to answer
investigators' questions. The SFO's controversial power to compel people to
answer questions under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act is being
challenged in the Appeal Court.
There have been some high points during her tenure. The handling of the
Barlow Clowes case is generally thought to have been a success. But there
have also been some noticeable failures, among them the collapse of the
trial of four men accused of a Pounds 60m fraud against Hill Samuel, the
merchant bank, and the failure of the DPR Futures and Marconi cases.
The arrest last October of an investigator who was working with the SFO on
the BCCI inquiry was an embarrassment which she could have done without.
Her appointment as DPP is likely to raise again questions about her
husband's business career. He was sacked in 1987 as deputy chairman of the
London Docklands Development Corporation after two companies he had
connnections with collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 600,000 and one
was convicted under trading standards law.
Legitimately, she may argue that this was considered irrelevant to her
appointment as SFO director and so should be irrelevant to her ability to
carry out her new role.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Fear and loathing on streets of Belfast / A report on the
aftermath of recent revenge murders by the paramilitaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE street corner adjoining the Belfast bookmaker's shop, where five
Catholics, including a 15-year-old boy, were murdered by Loyalist gunmen on
Wednesday, a sign says 'Hatfield Street - best kept street 1990.'
Yesterday flowers had been taped to the shuttered front of the shop, facing
the Ormeau Road. More ominously, an IRA symbol had also been painted.
A cousin of 18-year-old Mr Peter McGee, one of the five killed in the
attack, sat in the nearby Rose and Crown and sipped a lager with some
friends. 'We are all just numbed,' he said. 'He was a lad who liked to bet
on the greyhounds and loved football. None of these people were Provos.'
Photographs are passed around showing Mr McGee and Mr Jack Duffan, an
elderly man who was also killed in the attack, holding up a trophy won at
last year's All-Ireland Gaelic Football final.
The streets off the Ormeau Road are home to a Catholic enclave, bordered by
several Loyalist neighbourhoods. It has been the scene of numerous
paramilitary killings over the past 20 years.
On Tuesday an RUC officer, who subsequently committed suicide, killed three
people in the Sinn Fein office on the nearby Falls Road.
Mr McGee's cousin said: 'We are afraid. There has been an RUC roadblock for
five months on the Ormeau Road. On the day of the attack, they were nowhere
to be seen.'
Such comments typify the heightened atmosphere of fear and suspicion in
Belfast. Among people on the street, the killings have created a sense of
shock even in a community which is hardened by two decades of violence.
There is a sense of foreboding about what will happen next, a climate in
which conspiracy theories flourish.
The fear of an uncontrollable escalation in violence is a real one in both
Catholic and Protestant communities, especially in the vacuum created by the
failure of Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, to get the main
political parties in Ulster to return to the negotiating table.
In a Loyalist bar a few hundred yards from Wednesday's massacre, a group of
people grimly watched the lunchtime television news in expectation of Mr
Brooke's Commons statement. One said: 'If he brings in internment, it will
be his biggest mistake. It will be chaos.'
In the past six weeks, 26 people have been killed in Northern Ireland by
paramilitaries of both sides. The Loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters have
claimed responsibility both for the RUC officer's attack on the Sinn Fein
office and for the betting shop slaughter. They said they were in
retaliation for an IRA bomb attack last month which killed eight Protestant
workers.
The UFF warned that its attacks would continue. In Dublin yesterday, the IRA
claimed it 'will not be drawn into sectarian killings which suit only the
British'. Officials of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, said the UFF
was a 'Frankenstein monster' created by the British Army to counteract the
IRA but which had since got out of control.
They point to the case of Mr Brian Nelson, an army intelligence agent who
infiltrated the Ulster Defence Association, regarded as a front for the UFF,
and who was jailed for 10 years this week after admitting conspiracy to
murder five men and other terrorist charges.
The RUC is itself concerned that over the past year, the UFF leadership has
been reorganised and taken over by younger hardliners. In 1990, 18 killings
were attributed to the Loyalists, and 32 last year. In the past week alone,
they have killed nine more.
Mr Sean McKnight, a Sinn Fein councillor for Belfast, claimed that Tuesday's
attack on the Sinn Fein office was not carried out solely by the RUC
officer. He said: 'The people who followed his getaway car say there were
two people in the car.'
The RUC said that 'it has now been established that they followed the wrong
car. At this stage there is absolutely no indication that there was an
accomplice.'
Mr McKnight says there is a sense of insecurity in the Catholic community.
'It may sound paranoid, but a lot of people have begun talking about
conspiracy theories,' he said.
A friend of Mr McGee said: 'This is a Catholic community. Not a lot of
people would support Sinn Fein here, but people here are talking about a
smokescreen, a cover-up. I would feel safer with the IRA protecting us than
the RUC.'
A few hundred yards along the road, RUC officers manning a checkpoint were
keeping a wary watch. It was just one of dozens of checkpoints in the city
yesterday trying to cap the violence.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Sales of new cars fall 6% to 10-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of new cars in the UK fell by 6 per cent last month to 153,682, the
lowest January total since 1982. The figure shows a fall of 30.2 per cent on
the figure for the same month in 1989.
As the recession in the UK market for new vehicles deepened, registrations
of commercial vehicles fell in January by 17.2 per cent to 16,677. January
commercial-vehicle sales have dropped by 50 per cent in the past three
years.
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said: 'A boost for car sales is still desperately needed.'
Commercial-vehicle sales last month represented the lowest January total
since 1981 and reflected 'the continuing serious state' of the industry, he
said.
But there are signs that the precipitous fall in sales of new cars is
finally easing as the monthly year-on-year fall in January was the smallest
since March 1990.
Car sales last month were boosted by a surge in registrations by Ford, the
UK market leader, in the five final days of the month.
For the whole of January Ford increased its market share to 25.1 per cent
from 22.5 per cent a year ago, reflecting a 4.5 per cent increase in sales
to 38,502, according to SMMT figures.
Some 38.9 per cent of its sales were in the last five days of the month.
Ford said this had been caused by dealers boosting retail sales near the end
of the month to qualify for special volume bonuses.
Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, suffered a sharp 27.1 per cent
fall in sales in January, which depressed its market share to only 12 per
cent from 15.4 per cent in January last year.
The carmaker, which was ousted from second place in the UK market for new
cars by Vauxhall a couple of years ago, was pushed down into fourth place in
January behind the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen.
As a single marque, Citroen captured fifth place in the UK market for the
first time, overtaking the Volkswagen, Renault and Nissan makes.
There was no sign of any recovery in the fortunes of Jaguar and Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars, which were both forced to cut their workforces sharply last
year.
Jaguar sales were 30.4 per cent lower than a year before, while combined
Rolls-Royce and Bentley sales fell by 29.9 per cent.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Retailers warned of US discount threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS were warned yesterday of a threat from 'warehouse clubs' which
have have had a 'devastating price impact' on traditional supermarkets in
the US.
Mr Tony MacNeary, an analyst at stockbrokers County NatWest, told a
retailing conference in London that Costco, one of the biggest US clubs,
planned to open two stores in the UK in the next 18 months.
The clubs, dubbed the 'silent enemy' in the US, sell a limited range of
deeply discounted goods from large, rudimentary stores. Shoppers are
required to join a 'club' to benefit from the low retail prices. More than
65 per cent of volume sales go to wholesalers.
Since 1985 the US clubs have increased food sales at an annual rate of 37
per cent, with gross margins of 8 per cent to 10 per cent compared with the
25 per cent enjoyed by traditional supermarkets.
The club sector in the US has expanded from four stores with total sales of
Dollars 275m in 1980 to 500 stores with Dollars 28bn of sales by last year.
'What the club stores in the US are inflicting on the traditional
supermarkets today could prove as momentous as the change bought about in
the industry in the 1950s,' Mr MacNeary said. That was when supermarkets
challenged the then-traditional stores.
International competition in the UK discount food market has recently
intensified with the arrival of the Aldi chain, from Germany, and Netto from
Denmark.
Mr Bob Willett, chief executive of Gateway, told the conference that the UK
supermarket group would open three more Food Giant superstores by April,
making 18 in all.

FT  07 FEB 92 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Judge cuts back scope of prosecution
case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prosecution case in the Blue Arrow fraud trial was cut back drastically
yesterday after the judge directed the jury to strike out most of the
indictment and concentrate on only one aspect of the allegations.
Beginning his summing up, Mr Justice McKinnon told the jury it should
consider only the 'late take-up' - the buying of shares after closure of the
1987 issue by County NatWest and Phillips &amp; Drew Securities, advisers to the
issue, to raise the acceptance level announced to the markets from 38 per
cent to 49 per cent.
The jury was told to disregard more than six of the nine pages of
prosecution allegations. These related to the placing that followed the
issue, the taking of shares by County's marketmakers, the no-loss indemnity
given by County to Union Bank of Switzerland, and the non-reporting of a
disclosable holding of shares owned by National Westminster Bank, County's
parent.
Mr Justice McKinnon said the evidence the jury had heard on these matters
was still relevant, but nothing adverse to the five remaining defendants
could be drawn from it.
Following the acquittals of the three corporate defendants, five individuals
remain charged with conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of the
Pounds 837m issue.
They are Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County chief executive; Mr David Reed,
a former County head of corporate finance; Mr Nicholas Wells, a former
County director; Mr Martin Gibbs, a former head of corporate finance at P&amp;D;
and Mr Christopher Stainforth, a former P&amp;D director.
The late take-up was not illegal in itself, the judge said. But it was a
crime if it was done to mislead the markets.
To convict the defendants, the jury had to be satisfied that accepted market
practices about late acceptances had been dishonestly breached with the
intention of misleading investors.
Prosecution claims that all investor witnesses had said they thought the 49
per cent figure referred to applications accepted by the official deadline
were inaccurate, he said.
He added that prosecution points about the size of City salaries in 1987 and
the compensation paid by County and P&amp;D to pension funds were 'cheap and
prejudicial' and had nothing to do with the issues at stake.
Mr Justice McKinnon said the trial - now just days short of lasting a year -
had proved difficult enough for the highly trained professionals involved.
If the jurors had felt overwhelmed at times, they were not alone.
'I would not be telling the truth if I said that I have not, at times, felt
overwhelmed by this case,' he said. The judge's summing up continues today.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Four jailed over park fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR MEN were jailed and another was fined yesterday over the 1985 collapse
of the Britannia theme park at Shipley, near Heanor in Derbyshire, with
debts of Pounds 9.34m. At 17 months it was the UK's longest criminal trial.
Mr Peter Kellard, who controlled the company that built the theme park, was
jailed for four years and disqualified as a director for five years after
being found guilty earlier this week of 19 fraud charges.
The case covered charges of fraudulent trading, theft, deceit in order to
obtain bank loans and project finance, and the shuffling around of assets to
keep them out of the hands of a receiver and to provide funds for the
directors of KLF (UK), Mr Kellard's company, and its subsidiaries.
The jury at Nottingham Crown Court heard 158 prosecution witnesses and 28
defence witnesses and took seven days to decide its verdicts. Mr Kellard
gave evidence for 29 days.
The offences took place between 1980, shortly after KLF negotiated a lease
with Derbyshire County Council for the theme-park site, and September 1985,
when Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank which provided Pounds 3.7m of project
finance, called in Cork Gully as receiver.
In addition to Samuel Montagu there were 608 creditors, of which 203 were
Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire businesses owed up to Pounds 20,000 each.
Britannia Park was open in a half-finished state for three months before
Cork Gully was called in. Derbyshire police became involved in July 1986. It
was the largest fraud inquiry the force had undertaken and it cost nearly
Pounds 2m. The first arrests were made in 1987.
The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that its costs - fees for
counsel and other legal expenses but excluding staff costs - had come to
Pounds 1m.
The trial started in September 1990 with six defendants, one of whom, Mr
Keith Emmett, was cleared of the three charges he faced.
In addition to Mr Kellard, three other directors of KLF or its subsidiaries
were sentenced. Mr Edward Dwyer was jailed for 2 1/2 years and disqualified
as a director for five years on six charges. Mr John Wright was jailed for
six months and disqualified for three years on five charges. Mr Kenneth
Page, who pleaded guilty at the start of the trial, was jailed for six
months on five charges.
Mr Saied Sobhkhiz, the managing director of Bournemouth-based Euro-per &amp;
Gulf who changed his plea to guilty last year, was fined Pounds 7,500 and
ordered to pay Pounds 25,000 costs on two charges.
Cork Gully eventually sold Britannia Park to Derbyshire County Council for
Pounds 2.5m.
The park had been devised in the first place to honour British invention.
Now it exists as the American Adventure Theme Park.

THE VALUE of London's housing stock is Pounds 27bn down since the end of
1988 according to figures from the Association of London Authorities.
Average house prices fell 15% from Pounds 104,900 in the final quarter of
1988 to Pounds 89,200 at the end of last year. The association's figures are
based on average prices paid by Halifax building society customers.
The biggest fall was in Tower Hamlets, which includes Docklands, where

FT  07 FEB 92 / BAe sheds 450 jobs at defence plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is to shed a further 450 jobs at its guided-weapons plants
by May and has warned of more redundancies if it fails to win a Pounds 700m
competition to make a new missile for the RAF, David White writes.
The cuts continue a cascade of reductions in the defence industry. In the
past week, about 350 job losses have been announced at Vosper Thornycroft,
the Southampton-based shipbuilder, and 600 at the VSEL submarine yard at
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, where further cuts are due.
Unions say that about 40,000 job losses have been announced in the defence
industry since mid 1990 when plans for cuts in the armed services were
announced .
The latest cuts by BAe will reduce the workforce in its Dynamics division,
which makes guided weapons, to 6,000 compared with 16,500 three years ago.
All of its three main remaining sites are affected, with the principal plant
at Stevenage, Herts, losing 300 out of 4,000 jobs. A further 130 will be
lost at Lostock, Lancashire, and 20 at Bristol.
Mr David Laybourn, the division's managing director, warned that delays in
procurement decisions in the UK and abroad were 'increasing the pressures'.
BAe is anxiously awaiting a decision on the future of its Advanced
Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile, which would provide it with its biggest
single source of business in guided weapons. It is competing against weapons
proposed by BGT of Germany and by GEC-Marconi in collaboration with Matra of
France.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Lloyd's chief outlines plans for shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS OF how Lloyd's of London plans to implement a series of far-reaching
reforms of the insurance market's structure were disclosed yesterday by Mr
Alan Lord, chief executive, who also confirmed his intention to resign in
June.
Uncertainty over the future governance of Lloyd's in the wake of the
publication last month of the report outlining the reforms has delayed the
appointment of a successor to Mr Lord, who is 62. His intention to resign
was announced last year.
When Mr Lord leaves, three senior executives, led by Mr John Gaynor, the
finance chief, will take control of day-to-day management of the corporation
with a new chief executive being introduced next year after all the working
groups examining the recommendations of the reform task force have reported.
The Lloyd's solvency committee chaired by Mr Richard Hazell, a leading
underwriter, will work on details of the scheme to limit the potential
losses of Lloyd's Names and will report to Lloyd's Council by the end of
April.
Work on the examination and implementation of the task force's 65 separate
recommendations will be carried out by groups appointed by the council.
Mr Hazell will chair a group examining members' agents pooling arrangements,
a new unit-trust type system for Names, which expects to report in the next
few months.
Five other groups will examine other task force recommendations covering:
the reduction of costs (chaired by Mr Brian Pomeroy); Names' rights (Sir
Maurice Hodgson); corporate capital (Mr John Greig); accessibility of Names'
capital (Mr Michael Cockell); and governance (Sir Jeremy Morse).

FT  07 FEB 92 / Recession unhinges Bush's election game-plan: As the US
primaries get under way the president has a real battle on his hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTLY before Christmas, one of President George Bush's closest advisers
offered a glimpse of the game-plan for halting the president's slide in
popularity and laying the groundwork for winning the 1992 election.
First, Mr John Sununu, the abrasive White House chief of staff, would be
dumped; second, the president would unveil an economic recovery plan in his
State of the Union address in late January; third, Mr Bush would steal the
Democrats' clothing by outlining plans for health care reform. 'We have a
plan,' said the adviser, 'and it is a good one.'
Today, the White House plan looks threadbare. Mr Bush's popularity is more
than 40 points lower than a year ago during the Gulf war. The president
sounds defensive. And the presidential election campaign is about to begin,
in earnest.
On Monday, in the mid-west farm state of Iowa, several thousand registered
voters, Republican and Democrat, will gather in schools, churches and other
public places to select delegates for their parties' conventions which in
turn nominate the presidential candidates. These meetings - called caucuses
 -mark the official opening of the 1992 campaign.
In many senses, 1992 is a landmark election. It is the first of the
post-Cold War era: anti-communism, which has defined the political terrain
in every election since 1948, has seen its enemy vanquished in its own
citadel.
Almost four out of five voters say domestic issues matter more to them than
foreign policy. After the vacuous 1988 campaign - where Mr Bush missed a
chance to win a mandate for change - there may be some hope of a serious
debate about the future of the country.
Certainly, voters worried about the recession and the security of their jobs
are looking for more than empty slogans.
Democratic candidates such as Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former
Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, each of whom can spell out a
five-point plan faster than one can say 'Mike Dukakis', are attracting
attention and support. Mr Bush, singularly unadventurous on the domestic
front, has been forced to respond.
In previous years, Iowa held the attention of the rest of the nation.
Mr Jimmy Carter's surprisingly strong showing in 1976 turned him into a
serious presidential contender overnight; then-Vice President George Bush
suffered a humiliating third-place finish in 1988, tempting some commentors
to write him off until his spectacular come-from-behind win in New
Hampshire.
This year, Mr Bush faces a challenge from Mr Patrick Buchanan, the TV
commentator and former speechwriter to presidents Nixon and Reagan. Mr
Buchanan mixes tax-cutting conservatism with neo-isolationist 'America
First' rhetoric. No one believes he will deprive Mr Bush of the Republican
nomination; but if he could gain 30 per cent of the vote in the February 18
primary election in New Hampshire, he would increase the impression that the
president is vulnerable, if not beatable, in November.
On the Democratic side, the presence of Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa native,
has rendered the Iowa caucus politically irrelevant. All eyes, therefore,
have turned to New Hampshire.
A strong win for Mr Clinton would dispel, at least temporarily, suggestions
that he has been irreparably damaged by accusations of adultery; he would
instantly regain the mantle of front-runner. By some calculations, Mr
Clinton, riding a tide of southern votes mixed with support in the heavy
industrial states of Ilinois and Michigan, could wrap up the presidential
nomination by early April, just after the New York primary.
But the path to the nomination - and the White House - is rarely so smooth.
If Mr Clinton were to finish a poor second in New Hampshire to, say, Mr
Tsongas, it would fundamentally change the dynamics of the Democratic race.
At the very least, it might provoke an even closer look at Mr Tsongas, a
cancer survivor whose big pitch is US competitiveness and the need for a
recovery in manufacturing; but Mr Tsongas' appeal outside his native
north-east looks limited.
A second possibility is that a new candidate could enter the race. The
obstacles are formidable: by the end of January, filing deadlines passed in
18 states, which produce 40 per cent of the pledged delegates to the
convention. After New Hampshire, filing deadlines will have passed in 27
states, covering almost 60 per cent of the pledged delegates. Yet unless Mr
Tsongas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska (Vietnam war hero), Mr Harkin, or
former Governor Jerry Brown of California 'catch fire', a nationally known
figure such as Congressman Dick Gephardt, House majority leader, would be
sorely tempted to run.
The Democrats desperately want to win in 1992. Having lost five out of the
last six presidential campaigns, the party look at the White House as a
coveted, but remote prize.
In the 1980s, the party focused too much energy on maintaining a legislative
majority in the House and Senate - only to discover at the end of the decade
that voters were deeply hostile to Congress, angry about the perks and
privileges of incumbency, and worried about the apparent paralysis of
national government.
The November election, which also includes the wholesale re-election of the
House of Representatives and one-third of the US Senate, will be a testing
ground for a voter reaction against incumbents.
The political process in the US has always been a slow-moving affair; the
Founding Fathers wanted it so. But in recent years, the inertia has become
more serious because Americans have tended to vote increasingly for 'divided
government', where Democratic majorities in Congress counter-balance
Republican presidents. The formula seemed simple: leave Republicans to
handle foreign affairs and national security and let the Democrats dole out
the money for domestic programmes at home.
A year ago, a complacent Mr Bush believed that this formula would hold good
in 1992. The crushing victory in the Gulf war seemed to guarantee him
re-election; certainly, it was enough to scare off heavyweight Democratic
challengers, leaving the field to a handful of candidates who remain little
known on the national stage.
The stubborn US recession has forced Mr Bush to recalculate; like his
advisers, he senses that it will not be enough to simply defend the status
quo.
That is why he offered his national health care plan yesterday, and why
Americans will be hearing a good deal more talk about the 'caring President'
who is interested in domestic - rather than foreign affairs - in the coming
months.
In reality, Mr Bush is banking on an economic recovery by late spring or
early summer. Without an obvious upturn, Mr Bush could be vulnerable to a
Democratic challenger. The problem for the Democrats is that no single
candidate currently in the field, with the possible exception of Mr Clinton,
looks capable of bridging the 'stature gap' with the president.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Battle lines drawn on health care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the publication of President George Bush's 'Comprehensive Health Reform
Program' yesterday, the lines have been drawn for a fierce political battle
over the US medical system.
Mr Bush's proposal is based on providing vouchers of up to Dollars 1,250 per
person to help low income families pay for health insurance, as well as
allowing middle income families expanded tax deductions for their medical
expenses.
'I think the President's plan is one that is comprehensive and
compassionate. It provides for the first time a vehicle to finance health
insurance for the poor as well as to help those with incomes up to Dollars
80,000. That's 90m Americans who will be benefited,' said Mr Louis Sullivan,
secretary of health.
The US can in many ways claim unparalleled medical excellence. It also
spends more money on health care than any other nation - an estimated
Dollars 817bn this year - yet leaves many of its citizens without access to
this care.
Most Americans believe the system needs reforming. A recent Gallup poll
showed 91 per cent agreed there was a health care crisis, but 73 per cent
were satisfied with the treatment they received.
This paradox helps explain why politicians have for so long regarded health
as a no-win issue: any reform proposal was bound to irritate powerful
lobbies such as doctors, medical insurance companies or retired people - an
influential group who vote in far greater numbers than their younger
compatriots.
Nevertheless, two glaring problems have at last driven health to the top of
the political agenda.
The first is that over 35m Americans, most of them employed by businesses
that cannot afford coverage for their workforce, have no health insurance
and are bankrupted or reduced to charity to obtain medical treatment.
The second is runaway inflation in medical costs that has placed an
ever-growing burden both on businesses which provide insurance for their
employees, and on the US government. The government foots an increasing
portion of the US medical bill through Medicare, the federal insurance plan
for over-65s, and Medicaid, under which all states except Arizona provide
basic health services to the poor.
Businesses have long complained about the costs they have to bear. Recently,
however, their employees, too, have begun to complain, as companies have
boosted the amount of any bill patients must pay themselves and excluded
more and more medical services.
Three main types of solution have been proposed:
A national health insurance system similar to that in Canada. This is
proposed notably by Senator Bob Kerrey, one of the Democratic presidential
candidates. Its drawback is that it would create a new bureaucracy that
would have to be funded by taxes, and would put the private health insurance
industry, with an estimated 174,000 employees, out of business.
It is viciously attacked by the Republicans as 'socialised medicine,' a
charge which ignores the fact that 44 per cent of all health spending
already comes from government, through Medicare, Medicaid, veterans'
hospitals and other programmes.
'Play or pay,' where employers would choose between providing insurance for
employees or paying into a state pool, which would provide basic coverage.
This is favoured by many Democrats, including Senator George Mitchell,
Senate majority leader, but is criticised by the administration for imposing
new costs on business.
The voucher system proposed by President Bush to allow low income families
to buy their own insurance, coupled with increased tax deductibility for
medical expenses to help middle income families. The Bush plan also includes
arrangements to help small businesses pool their insurance buying in health
insurance networks (HINs.)
All of these approaches would address the problem of those with no medical
coverage. The administration says its plan would cover 24.1m Americans who
are currently uninsured, through vouchers or tax deductions, and 5m more
through the reforms it proposes to the insurance market. It acknowledges,
however, that 4.9m people will remain uncovered.
Some of the sources of soaring costs are easy to pinpoint - unnecessary
medical tests, wasted paperwork, and higher malpractice insurance costs as
doctors seek to protect themselves against lawsuits.
President Bush's proposal to provide vouchers for the poor would, the
administration argues, end the problem of cost-shifting, by ensuring that
everyone can pay their hospital bills.
The administration also hopes to reduce unnecessary medical procedures by
encouraging 'co-ordinated care' such as health maintenance organisations
(HMOs). In their simplest form, HMOs involve a clinic or group of doctors
undertaking to provide all of their members' medical care for a flat annual
fee, thus reducing the incentive to order expensive and redundant tests.
The administration's white paper claims to offer savings on total US health
expenditure of between 6 and 14 per cent - a cumulative total of Dollars
394bn by 1997 and Dollars 954bn by the end of the century.
However, President Bush has ducked the question of how to pay the immediate
costs to the government of reform.
The decision to backpedal on funding is viewed by many as a signal that Mr
Bush has no intention of pressing hard for health care reform before the
election. He would not be alone among politicians in contiunuing to view
health care as a no-win issue.

EGYPT'S banned, but tolerated, Moslem Brotherhood has been denied legal
status by an Egyptian court, in a decision which comes at time when the
government is edgy about an apparent upswing in Islamic militancy across the
Arab world.
The Brotherhood, which was outlawed in 1954 after President Gamal Abdel
Nasser accused it of plotting his overthrow, has been pressing
unsuccessfully for registration as a charitable organisation.
Egypt's constitution bans political organisations based on race or religion.
The Moslem Brotherhood, the country's mainstream Islamic force, is allowed a
fair degree of latitude to organise, canvass politically and operate schools
and clinics. It has gained seats in parliament in partnership with the tiny
Liberal and Socialist Labour parties.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Amex may face action on Olympics advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN EXPRESS, the US financial services group, may face legal action
from this year's Winter Olympics organisers for allegedly 'ambush marketing'
the event. The games open tomorrow at Albertville in France.
Mr Dick Pound, chairman of the International Olympic Committee's marketing
commission, yesterday accused American Express of conducting an advertising
campaign implying it was an official sponsor of the games, which is not the
case.
One of the Olympics' main sponsors is credit card agency Visa, which with 12
other sponsors is paying about Pounds 170m towards the cost of staging the
games.
'The long-standing war between Visa and Amex continues, just like a Russian
novel - no beginning and no end in sight,' Mr Pound said.
American Express has taken magazine space and billboard posters in
Albertville for slogans such as 'Amex at the Games.'
Mr Pound said the Amex campaign was 'trying to undercut' Visa.
He declined to comment on how much Visa was paying to sponsor the games but
it is believed to be in the region of about Dollars 20m.
Mr Frank Vaccaro, American Express's director of public affairs
(international), said yesterday his company was 'aware of reports of legal
action being taken by the IOC but as yet we have not seen anything and have
not been officially informed of any pending legal action.'
Mr Vaccaro accused Visa of conducting a 'months-long' comparative US
advertising campaign, attacking American Express by suggesting visitors to
the Games should leave their Amex cards at home.

FT  07 FEB 92 / US court rejects Westinghouse appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US FEDERAL court has rejected an appeal by Westinghouse Electric to drop
bribery and corruption charges against it over a nuclear power project in
the Philippines.
Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Rose, consultants to the deal, will as a result
have to face a jury trial in Newark, New Jersey, to start on March 2.
The decision is a blow to Westinghouse, which last month made a final
attempt to quash the allegations brought more than four years ago by the
Philippine government and the National Power Corporation (NPC), the state
power company which signed the initial contract in 1976.
The original deal, negotiated under the former regime of President Ferdinand
Marcos, called for construction of a 620 megawatt nuclear power station on
the Bataan peninsula. The plant was completed in 1986, but was mothballed
before start-up by the government of Mrs Corazon Aquino following Mr Marcos'
exile.
The NPC and government filed suit in the US in December 1988, claiming the
contract was won as a result of Dollars 17m in bribes paid to Mr Marcos. The
alleged bribes took the form of a Dollars 17m special sales representative
consultancy payment to Mr Herminio Disini, a Marcos associate, who now lives
outside the Philippines.
Many of the technical counts connected with the deal were referred by the US
court to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Geneva, while the US
court, presided over by Judge Dickinson Debevoise, committed the companies
to a jury trial on the bribery and corruption allegations.
In late December, the ICC issued a preliminary finding that there was no
evidence that bribes were paid to win the contract. It is still deliberating
the technical issues.
On the basis of the ICC ruling, Westinghouse lawyers sought to invoke the
doctrine of collateral estoppel, a legal term meaning that the ICC ruling
should apply to the US case. On this basis, they called for the US case to
be dropped.
After reviewing arguments by both sides, Judge Debevoise refused to bow to
the ICC ruling. While 'having no quarrel with the ICC,' he nevertheless
found numerous faults with the judgment.
Chief among these was that the ICC was operating on extremely narrow
parameters in which only the most overt evidence of bribes to Mr Marcos
would have persuaded the tribunal of the defendants' guilt.

FT  07 FEB 92 / World Bank builds bridges to S Africa / A look at Pretoria's
bid for international financial respectability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A quarter of a century's estrangement, South Africa and the World Bank
are well on the way to reconciliation. Mr Lewis Preston, the Bank president,
is to visit South Africa next week, his first trip to Africa since he took
up the job last September.
For months, World Bank officials have pursued informal contacts with the
various political parties and groups in South Africa. Several teams have
been to research an economy which has been virtually unknown to the Bank
since lending was suspended for political reasons in 1967. Now, relations
seem set to assume a higher profile.
Immediate access to Bank funding is not in prospect, however. The Bank is
expected to resume lending only when a multi-party interim government is in
place. Even then, there will be room for disputes within the Bank's board
over what constitutes an interim government. Would a multi-racial executive
with only limited powers (one option) qualify for renewed access, or will
the board demand more fundamental change? In practice, it seems likely that
the board will follow the advice of the African National Congress on the
issue.
Once formal relations are restored, debate will begin in earnest over
whether South Africa should qualify for heavily subsidised loans from the
International Development Association (the Bank's soft loan agency which
lends to the world's poorest countries), or only for the mildly concessional
loans available to middle-income countries.
Income per capita in South Africa, at Dollars 2,520 a year in 1990, far
exceeds the limit of Dollars 740 normally imposed on IDA recipients. However
the grossly unequal distribution of income between whites and blacks might
mean that South Africa could be treated as a special case for soft loans.
But with the IDA's funding already under serious pressure from claimants
worldwide, officials in Pretoria seem resigned to doing without heavily
subsidised finance. The size of any World Bank programme for South Africa
would thus be determined by demand from Pretoria: how much would a new
government wish to borrow, given that the terms are only mildly
concessional?
South Africa could benefit indirectly from IDA finance by participating in
regional projects aimed at low income countries such as neighbouring
Mozambique. South Africa's electricity utility, Eskom, is keen to develop a
regional electricity grid and various energy projects involving South
African companies are under discussion. But the recipient government in such
cases would be Mozambique, not South Africa.
Government officials say no project plans have yet been drawn up for South
Africa itself, nor have amounts been discussed. But World Bank lending is
likely to focus on education and urban development, the two areas already
researched by Bank officials. With 7m people living in informal settlements
countrywide - including millions in squatter shacks - urban development will
be a high priority for the new government.
Education, too, is in crisis, with black schools desperately overcrowded,
facilities poor and teachers poorly qualified.
Already, the Bank is ready to provide informal technical assistance to black
South Africans, with plans afoot to train those who might be officials of a
future government through the Bank's Economic Development Institute.
The ANC, for its part, remains deeply suspicious of international financial
institutions such as the Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with some
officials adopting the rhetoric of the 1960s to condemn them as
neo-imperialist organisations. But ANC officials have met previous World
Bank teams, and two of the movement's senior leaders are to see Mr Preston
during his visit.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), another World Bank finance
affiliate, is likely to be active in the South African private sector. Once
lending resumes, the IFC is expected to focus its efforts on helping
non-white entrepreneurs, selling management consultancy services and setting
up an 'enterprise fund' aimed at small businesses, as it has done elsewhere
in Africa. Eventually, the IFC could become involved in project finance in
areas such as mining and chemicals.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Noriega gains ground: Henry Hamman focuses on the former
Panamanian leader's attempts to fend off US drugs charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY HAMMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega's defence against
drug trafficking charges in Miami gained ground this week. A Drug
Enforcement Administration agent acknowledged that a man identified by the
prosecution as a Medelln cocaine cartel money launderer had been arrested on
the basis of information from forces commanded by Gen Noriega.
The testimony by Mr James L. Bramble, in charge of the DEA's Panama
operations from August 1982 until June 1984, raised questions about earlier
prosecution claims that Gen Noriega had protected the cartel's operations in
Panama in return for pay-offs.
Prosecutors had cited the money launderer, Mr Ramon Milian Rodriguez, as a
conduit for drug money from the US to bank accounts controlled by the cartel
in Panama. According to the DEA, Mr Milian was responsible for transferring
Dollars 200m in drug profits from the US to Panama.
Mr Bramble acknowledged that the information that led to Mr Milian's arrest
had been independently developed by Panamanian narcotics officers and passed
on to the DEA.
When Mr Milian was arrested in Florida, government agents seized Dollars
5.5m in cash, more than 61 pounds of cocaine, and a Lear jet aircraft.
In other testimony, former DEA agent Mr Arthur Sedillo, stationed in Panama
from August 1977 until August 1979, read a cable from the then-chief
administrator of the DEA, Mr Peter Bensinger, in which Mr Bensinger asked
that Gen Noriega be congratulated for his role in an 'impressive seizure' of
cocaine being smuggled to the US via Panama.
The defence, by calling current and former government officials and
requiring them to read documents they wrote on Gen Noriega's efforts in drug
law enforcement, is attempting to counter the prosecution claim that Gen
Noriega turned Panama into a haven for Colombian drug dealers.
Mr Bensinger and another former DEA chief administrator, Mr John Lawn,
argued that the kind words they may have written about Gen Noriega were
diplomatic niceties rather than statements of fact. But letters and
memoranda by Mr Sedillo and Mr Bramble also referred to co-operation between
the DEA and Panamanian forces under Gen Noriega's command.
Mr Frank Rubino, lead defence counsel, said in an interview that showing the
extent of this co-operation was a central part of the defence strategy. When
Mr Bramble has testified he is expected to be followed by another DEA agent
who worked in Panama.
Mr May and Mr Rubino expect to finish presenting their case in 4-6 weeks,
when the prosecution is expected to offer a rebuttal.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Fujimori seeks UK help on terrorism and trafficking
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERU'S President Alberto Fujimori yesterday called on Britain to assist his
country with its economic reconstruction and in the fight against terrorism
and drug trafficking.
'The support of the United Kingdom is very important to us - perhaps they
could participate even in a symbolic way at the moment to show solidarity
for our situation,' Mr Fujimori said in an interview with the Financial
Times.
Mr Fujimori, on his first visit to London, met Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, for talks at which he described Peru's economic reconstruction and
stabilisation programme. He suggested Britain might give training to assist
the fight against terrorism.
Britain did not take part in the support group of nations, led by the US and
Japan, which eased Peru's re-entry into the world financial system after the
election of Mr Fujimori in 1990. Peru's economic programme won IMF approval
in September last year.
Mr Fujimori, who is also using his visit to highlight the environmental
damage caused by the drugs trade, vigorously defended his anti-drug and
anti-terrorism campaigns.
'When I took over the government the anti-drug policy was very repressive
and militaristic,' he said. 'In our new strategy we do not have to fight
against the farmworkers. We have to distinguish between the farmworker who
is growing the coca leaf and those who process and commercialise cocaine.
'We have to gain the confidence of the farmworkers, who are actually
exploited by the drug traffickers. We have to campaign to help them change,'
he said.
Peru produces at least 60 per cent of the world's coca leaf, the raw
material for cocaine.
Mr Fujimori admitted that corruption continued to be a problem. 'Without
corruption you could not explain how drugs continued to arrive in the US.
But the level of corruption has been reduced.'
He also claimed progress against the Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)
guerrillas and the MRTA (the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement), which have
waged a long and bloody struggle against the Peruvian state.
'I am completely sure that I will leave Peru completely pacified,' he said,
switching briefly into English 'to make matters absolutely clear.'
Suspected Shining Path guerrillas rampaged through Comas, a shantytown north
of Lima early yesterday, killing four people and wounding three others whom
they had accused of trafficking in drugs, witnesses said, Reuter reports
from Lima.
The deaths brought to 39 the number of people killed in political violence
around the country since Monday. More than 24,000 people have died in
political violence since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lawrence Summers, the World Bank's chief economist, last night found
himself embroiled in controversy after the leaking of an internal memorandum
part of which advocates the transfer of 'dirty industries' to the third
world.
'Just between you and me, shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging more
migration of the dirty industries to the LDCs?' Mr Summers wrote in a
confidential memo to senior staff dated December 12.
In the memo, Mr Summers says the cost of pollution depends on the loss of
earnings from increased morbidity and mortality. He says the costs are
lowest in the countries with the lowest wages. 'I think the economic logic
behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is
impeccable and we should face up to that.'
'I've always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly
under-polluted, their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low
compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City.' He suggests that only high unit
transport costs prevent 'welfare enhancing' transfers of solid waste to poor
countries.
In a further passage he says the 'concern over an agent that causes a one in
a million change in the odds of prostrate cancer is obviously going to be
much higher in a country where people survive to get postrate cancer than in
a country where under-5 mortality is 200 per thousand'.
The World Bank last night issued a statement saying Mr Summers' memo does
not represent the bank's views:
'Mr Summers intended his memo to provoke debate and sharpen the analysis in
a forthcoming World Bank report on the prospects of the global economy. Mr
Summers deeply regrets the .. misunderstandings his memo has caused and
apologises for any misconceptions it may have generated ..'

Texaco is hoping to resume oil output in Kuwait's Wafra field later this
month, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The company is aiming to produce
around 50,000 barrels a day from Wafra, a level that would be well below the
140,000 bpd before the Iraqi invasion. Oil output from Wafra is shared
equally by Texaco and the state-owned Kuwait Oil Company. The onshore field
lies in a zone along the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Before the Gulf war Texaco refined its output from Wafra at the Mina Saudi
refinery. The US company will now be exporting crude directly from Wafra and
analysts suggest that it may seek to sell the high-sulphur oil to Japan.

CROATIA'S President Franjo Tudjman has dropped objections to the United
Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, the Security Council was told last night.
Croatia had been insisting that UN troops be deployed in such a way that it
would leave open the prospect of recovering the third of its territory now
under the control of the federal army and Serb irregulars.
Mr Thomas Pickering, the council's US president, said Mr Milan Babic, leader
of the Serb-populated region of Krajina in Croatia, now was the only
objector to the UN plan.
He said Mr Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, felt the time was not
ripe to deploy a large UN peace-keeping force, as proposed by Mr Cyrus
Vance, the UN special envoy.
Mr Vance said he had received the Croatian leader's assurances after seeking
clarification of a communication from Zagreb on Monday.
He praised the 'most helpful' intervention of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the
German foreign minister, in bringing this about.
The UN envoy repeated his belief that Germany had been premature in
recognising independent Yugoslav republics.
'Given the extremely delicate situation which exists at this time, . . . I
would think it very unwise for any further outside parties to disturb the
present situation by recognising any of the republics.'
Mr Vance said the federal government and army and other leaders were
pressing Mr Babic hard to accept the UN plan.
Asked about the possibility of sending in an interim UN peacekeeping force
smaller than the 10,000 men envisaged, Mr Vance said it was too early to go
ahead with other than a modest addition of 25 liaison officers to the 50
already there.
Laura Silber in Belgrade adds: Lord Carrington, the European Community
envoy, yesterday said the leaders of Bosnia-Hercegovina had agreed to hold
an EC-brokered conference in an attempt to dilute rising nationalist
tensions. After talks in Sarajevo, he said Slavic Moslem, Serb and Croat
leaders had agreed to his proposal for a conference of the republic's main
national groups before an independence referendum set for February 29 and
March 1.

RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin yesterday warned of a new dictatorship if
his government's reform programme should fail, and appealed for the support
of the international community.
Mr Yeltsin, who is on a three-day state visit to France, has been lavished
with ceremonial honours by the French government, which will grant Russia a
FFr2bn (Pounds 200m) loan to buy cereals, as well as a FFr1.5bn line of
credit to import industrial goods.
However, he warned: 'If Russia fails in its reforms, notably its economic
reforms, a dictator will appear. Now neither Russia nor the international
community can permit the appearance of a dictator. That is why the
international community must contribute to the solution of the problem.
'I have confidence in our reforms, which are irreversible,' said Mr Yeltsin.
'But, if they fail, I can feel already on the back of our necks the hot
breath of those who wear red shirts and brown shirts.'
The prospects for new injections of western aid are not good, however.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday that Germany had reached the limit of
its capacity in providing finance for the recovery of eastern Europe and the
former Soviet republics.
However, he is convinced that it is essential to provide more large-scale
assistance to the ex-Soviet republics, while linking it directly to control
of nuclear and chemical weapons, and the observance of all existing
disarmament treaties.
In an interview with Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, and the
Wall Street Journal Europe, the German leader argued more forcefully than
ever that it was up to other countries in Europe, but also in particular
Japan, to share the burden of helping the ailing east European and former
Soviet economies.
An Ecu500m (Pounds 356m) loan to the former Soviet Union to pay for food
imports, held up since last November, is expected to be finalised within a
week, EC officials said yesterday, Richard Waters writes from Luxembourg.
The loan had been delayed by confusion caused by the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Mr Karel van Miert, EC commissioner responsible for investments, said
yesterday.
The position has been resolved by the issuing of a guarantee by the Russian
republic to back the loan. As a result, the entire Ecu500m would be lent to
Russia. Relations between Russia and Ukraine deteriorated yesterday over
Russian claims to the Crimean peninsula and a counter-attack by Ukraine over
nuclear weapons located on its territory, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.
The Crimea always a source of tension between Moscow and Kiev, was yesterday
the subject of a resolution passed by Ukraine's parliament which criticised
Russian legislation questioning the 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine.
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk later asserted that there was no reason
to hold a referendum in the Crimea on independence. Local activists began
collecting signatures for a referendum this week.
He also countered a statement by Mr Yeltsin this week about nuclear weapons
located in Ukraine. Contrary to Mr Yeltsin's statement in the Russian press,
Mr Kravchuk said only half the tactical nuclear weapons had been removed
from Ukraine and that not all strategic nuclear weapons had been taken off
alert.

<TEXT>
THE German government's tax reform package looks set to collapse after the
failure of long negotiations with the parliamentary opposition. The package
includes cuts in corporate tax, higher family allowances, and a one point
increase in value added tax from 1993.
Hopes of persuading at least two Social Democrat-ruled states to break ranks
and support the package next week in the SPD-dominated Bundesrat, the German
upper house, faded yesterday after the failure of a conciliation committee
to find a compromise.
The deadlock between the Christian Democrat-led governing coalition and the
SPD means that the tax amendment package is almost certain to be rejected in
the Bundesrat next week, and therefore to be abandoned.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, accused the SPD yesterday of
'frivolous and completely irresponsible' tactics in opposing the package,
and promised that he would bring the same proposals back to parliament by
April. That will coincide with state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and
Baden-Wurttemberg, two key polls whose proximity almost certainly reinforced
the deadlock.
Even if he does then succeed in dividing the SPD, the amendments would be
unlikely to become law before the autumn.
The key issue is the VAT increase, from 14 to 15 per cent, which the SPD
rejects as anti-social and inflationary. Mr Waigel insists that Germany is
committed to the increase by the European Community, which has set 15 per
cent as the floor.
The stand-off on VAT has blocked the other proposals in the package,
including an increase in child allowances from DM50 to DM70 a month and a
series of enterprise tax cuts, such as a large increase in the tax threshold
for company property tax, and a similar increase in the threshold for the
tax on trading profits.
The other key area hit by the deadlock is the transfer of resources from the
wealthy western states to the east. The entire yearly proceeds of the VAT
increase, DM10.4bn in 1993, were to be devoted to the German Unity Fund. In
addition, structural funds for infrastructure projects in poorer western
regions were to be transferred entirely to the east.
The Confederation of German Industry accused the SPD-ruled states of 'fiscal
egoism,' in blocking a tax package designed to make Germany more attractive
to foreign investors.
Mr Karlheinz Blessing, secretary general of the SPD, accused the government
of failing to observe social equality and fair burden-sharing in the tax
package, favouring business at the expense of the lower-paid.

FINLAND'S President Mauno Koivisto is expected today to add his support to
the growing momentum for an early application to join the European
Community, writes Robert Taylor in Helsinki
This month Prime Minister Esko Aho and his cabinet will decide on an EC
application, and parliament will vote on the issue.
The formal application will be made by mid-March, ensuring that Finland can
join Sweden and Austria in parallel entry negotiations. These could begin
late this year.
The only remaining doubts lie in the attitude of Mr Aho's ruling Centre
Party, which is divided. Many rural supporters fear EC membership will
devastate Finland's highly-protected agriculture. Negotiations on entry
terms on farming may prove difficult.
The swing towards EC entry follows the realisation that a 19-nation European
Economic Area would only be a transitional arrangement, particularly after
Sweden opted in 1990 to seek EC entry.

<TEXT>
THE IRISH former cabinet minister Mr Albert Reynolds yesterday easily won a
leadership contest to replace Mr Charles Haughey as head of Ireland's
governing Fianna Fail party, Reuter reports from Dublin. He will formally be
elected as prime minister next week.
Mr Reynolds, who is 59, won 61 votes to just 10 for Mr Michael Woods,
agriculture minister, and six for Ms Mary O'Rourke, health minister, who was
bidding to become Ireland's first woman prime minister.
Speaking after his victory, Mr Reynolds referred to the upsurge of sectarian
violence in Northern Ireland. 'I wanted today to be a day of exhilaration
and hope,' he said. 'Instead it is day when we are trying to come to terms
yet again with death on this island, so many deaths.'
'I look forward to working with the British prime minister to try to end the
cruelty of this continuing conflict. That cruelty comes from a dwarfed and
twisted patriotism which sees inflicted deaths as instruments of change,' he
said.
Mr Reynolds was sacked by Mr Haughey last November for leading a failed
party mutiny against his leader. Mr Haughey, who dominated Irish politics
through a tumultuous decade of scandals and leadership challenges, was
forced to step down after allegations he knew about the tapping of
journalists' telephones back in 1982.
Mr Reynolds comes to power at a time of deepening economic gloom in Ireland:
unemployment has reached record levels with one in five jobless, and the
safety valve of emigration to North America and Britain is closed by the
international recession. Creating jobs was a top priority, he said.
In mid-term, he also faces an uphill climb restoring morale in Fianna Fail.
Their popularity has sunk to an all-time low in opinion polls because of the
stagnant economy and a string of financial scandals in state firms.
He promised 'a government of openness, not defensiveness, a government of
consultation and consensus, not diktat'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Finance Ministry has named Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the state
telecommunications monopoly, as a prime candidate for privatisation.
The project, if ultimately approved by the cabinet, would be the
government's most ambitious and contentious sale of state assets in the
seven years since the sell-off began.
'Telekom as the people's share of the nineties is a desirable and realistic
prospect,' said Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. The problems facing
Telekom could not be solved by leaving it as a state-owned concern, he said.
Mr Waigel told journalists that he would undertake to remove the remaining
obstacles to the sale as quickly as possible.
These include persuading parliament, particularly the Bundesrat (upper
house), to change the country's constitution. This lays down that operation
of the railways and postal service, including Telekom, 'shall be conducted
as matters of direct federal administration'.
Dominated by the SPD opposition, the upper house has exercised its power by
resolutely blocking tax reforms. including an increase in value added tax
and cuts in corporate levies.
Mr Waigel, who said he had found wide support for privatisation in other
ministries and state authorities, claimed to have detected signs from the
SPD that parliamentary agreement might be possible. However, suggestions of
less radical changes have in the past been met by strong resistance.
A proposed partial privatisation in 1990, to raise funds for rebuilding the
east German telephone network, disappeared without trace.
Now, however, with demands for government funding rising on all fronts -
Telekom itself has just started a seven-year, DM200bn (Pounds 69.6bn)
investment programme - and the Bundesbank squeezing state borrowing, there
is fresh urgency in the search for new resources.
Mr Waigel's scheme emerged a day after Mr Gunther Krause, transport
minister, proposed merging east and west German railways into a public
limited company, to reduce demands on state subsidies.
Although Telekom's telephone business makes profits of around DM8bn a year,
this is swallowed up by loss-makers such as telex, telegram and directory
inquiries.
The government's main privatisation moves so far have been limited to small
disposals and the sale of holdings in groups like Volkswagen, Veba and Viag.
Mr Waigel flatly rejected SPD and trade union suggestions that the state
should take over the 6,000 east German companies still under the control of
the Treuhand privatisation agency at the turn of the year. About 5,000 had
fewer than 250 employees.
The others, including shipyards on the Baltic coast, brown coal mines in
Saxony, and chemicals complexes in Halle, have attracted little interest.
West German groups, urged by Bonn to join forces, take them over,
restructure and ultimately float them on the stock exchange, have been
noticeably reticent.

ANOTHER rift has opened between the European Commission's competition
authorities and the French government, which has complained to the European
Court of Justice about Brussels' attempts to glean more information on the
financing of state-owned manufacturing companies.
The Commission wants to receive annual reports on financing state-owned
manufacturing companies to help it identify illegal government subsidies.
The French complaint has surprised Sir Leon Brittan, the competition
commissioner, who said last summer when the new reporting system was
announced that he had already won round the more sceptical member states
such as France and Italy.
A French official said yesterday that Paris objected both to 'the form and
the substance' of Sir Leon's initiative. He added that as far as he knew the
government had not yet responded to Brussels' initial request for
back-copies of the relevant companies' balance sheets and profit and loss
accounts for 1989 and 1990.
The system was introduced in the form of a Commission communication last
October, which France believes should have been presented to member states
for approval. The French government is also concerned that the change might
discriminate against publicly-owned companies, which have to provide more
information than private companies.
The EC treaty says the Commission should leave the question of the best form
of company ownership to member states. But Sir Leon argues that state and
private companies can only be treated equally if a more systematic approach
to the reporting of aid to state companies is introduced.
Brussels competition officials are now concerned that the transparency of
French government support for state-owned industry might be further muddied
by plans to merge some of the country's most important state-controlled
technology companies.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has written to Mr
Giulio Andreotti, the Italian prime minister, to urge him to accelerate the
process of transforming EC single market legislation into Italian law.
The Commission said it was not the first time Mr Delors had felt it
necessary to chide Italy, which has been a notable laggard in enacting EC
directives.

FT  07 FEB 92 / French try to recapture lost trade in securities
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French stock market is taking action to try to stimulate block trading -
the buying and selling of large numbers of shares in the same company -
which may eventually lead to the introduction of market makers.
One of the main problems for the French market is the drift of block trades
 -large deals worth between FFr20m (Pounds 2.04m) and FFr50m - away from
Paris to London.
Most traders attribute this to disclosure rules in Paris, where regulations
were designed to protect private investors. This makes the market less
flexible than the London stock market.
Last year the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the regulatory body,
commissioned a study into block trading from a committee led by Mr Francois
Bacot, the managing director of Bacot Allain, the Paris broker owned by SG
Warburg, the London-based securities group.
The Bacot report was studied by the CBV which said that it intends to take
immediate steps to make the French market more flexible.
These measures include allowing brokers to take positions on shares by using
confidential codes, rather than by giving their own names, and greater
flexibility in the disclosure of prices.
Until now one of the main deterrents for block traders in Paris has been
that they had to identify themselves and the price of the deal.
By contrast in London, traders are allowed some discretion in the handling
of large share deals.
The CBV has also commissioned a study into the feasibility of introducing
market makers to fix prices for shares in France.
These changes should, or so the CBV hopes, help to stem the flow of block
trades from Paris to London and recapture at least part of the business lost
over the years.
However, it warned yesterday that its initiative would be futile unless the
French government agrees to abolish the tax on securities dealings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S recently formed centre-right coalition government is becoming
increasingly frustrated at its inability to honour pre-election promises and
ease the burdens of a transition to a market system.
After fiercely criticising Poland's first two post-communist governments for
ignoring the social costs of the IMF-backed stabilisation programme, the
incoming government was obliged to spend its first weeks shepherding an
inherited cost-cutting interim budget through parliament.
The need to trim a first quarter budget deficit that was heading for a
Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn deficit on an annualised basis forced the government
to lower unemployment pay and energy subsidies. The cuts sparked strikes and
anger from voters who earlier supported calls for greater state intervention
to prop up loss-making state companies.
The parlous state of public finances reflects the depth of the structural
decline and the difficulty of reforming the state administration quickly
enough to levy new taxes on the fast-growing, and sometimes high-spending
private sector.
More than 85 per cent of government revenue came from so-called 'profits
taxes' levied on state enterprises under the primitive tax and
administrative structures inherited from four decades of communist rule. But
a 35 per cent fall in state sector industrial output in the past two years
has pushed nearly half the 8,400 enterprises into the red. Unable or
unwilling to pay taxes, they have sold assets, sacked workers and built up
debt with other state enterprises and state banks.
Unemployment nearly doubled last year to 2.1m, 11.4 per cent of the
workforce. The budget also had to fund a 800,000 increase to 8.3m in the
number of pensioners. The government's problem is that higher social
spending has further reduced its ability to fund a more interventionist
industrial policy, as advocated by Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, minister in charge of
economic policy.

THE Portuguese government yesterday awarded franchises for two private
television channels, ending months of delays and controversy including a
damaging row with Portugal's powerful and conservative Roman Catholic church
which emerged as one of the victors in the contest.
The two channels, which come on air this year, will end the duopoly of two
state channels - Canal 1 and RTP2 - which have spent the past year revamping
their programmes in preparation for tougher competition.
The strongest competition is likely to come from Sociedade Independente de
Comunicacao (SIC), headed by Mr Francisco Pinto Balsemao, a former prime
minister and founding member of the ruling Social Democratic party, which
won the 15-year franchise for the new third channel. Mr Pinto Balsemao heads
Sojornal, the company that owns Expresso, Portugal's largest and respected
weekly newspaper, and 50 per cent of Exame, the leading business magazine,
among other publications.
SIC includes several other Portuguese newspaper and magazine publishers, and
it has established links with TV Globo of Brazil which supplies the bulk of
popular Brazilian soap operas screened on Portuguese state television.
The franchise for the fourth channel has gone to Televisao Independente
(TVI), a group whose main shareholders are Radio Renascenca - the
Church-sponsored national radio station - various religious organisations
and publishers Editorial Verbo.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIERCEST period of pre-election campaigning in recent memory has still
failed to give either of the two main political parties their much-sought
breakthrough, according to a batch of opinion polls released last night.
As the conviction grows at Westminster that Mr John Major will not duck an
April 9 election, there was nothing in the findings to convince either party
that they can be confident of an overall majority.
The first soundings on voters' reaction to Mr Paddy Ashdown's revelation of
an affair with his former secretary five years ago also suggested that the
scandal may have little effect in the polling booths.
While the Tories are taking comfort in figures showing them ahead, Labour
will argue that the government's month-long assault on its tax and spending
plans have used up its best shots without winning a decisive advantage.
Today, the focus switches to local government with Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, attacking the records of Labour councils and Mr Neil
Kinnock, the Labour leader, highlighting the poll tax as the key 'symbol' of
Tory waste in a keynote speech to a Labour's conference in Blackpool.
On Saturday, the prime minister will deliver his riposte at the annual Young
Conservatives' rally in Eastbourne. But in spite of the frenzied atmosphere
in Westminster, public opinion remains equivocal.
A Gallup 'snapshot' poll for The Daily Telegraph, conducted between January
29 and February 3, gives the Tories 42.5 per cent or five points ahead of
Labour - a sharp turnabout on last week's 1.5 point Labour lead but a close
reflection of the same poll's findings in mid-January.
However, in the much larger Gallup 9000 poll, carried out throughout January
from a sample of nearly 11,000, Labour has pulled ahead by a statistically
insignificant 0.2 points to 39.2 points - its first lead in this survey for
four months.
That second verdict appeared to be reflected in the findings of a Harris
poll of 1,097 voters for The Daily Express. Conducted over the past two
days, it has Labour in a one-point lead on 40 per cent (unchanged on last
month) with the Tories dropping back to 39 (41).
The three polls put Liberal Democrat support varying from 14 (Gallup
snapshot) to 17 (Harris).
In a separate telephone poll on voters' reaction to Mr Ashdown's revelation,
Gallup found that 82.6 per cent supported his continuing as Liberal Democrat
leader, with only 4.6 per cent arguing that he should resign.
The polls came as Labour launched a series of onslaughts on the government's
economic record.
At question time, Mr Kinnock attacked Mr Major's claims this week that the
Japanese economy faced recession, saying that a slowdown was not the same as
the state of the UK's economy, now 'in reverse'. He added: 'The prime
minister, because of his policies, is reduced to imagining recovery at home,
while inventing recession abroad.'
Mr Major replied that Labour's policies would replace low taxation and low
inflation with high tax rates and high inflation and would reverse the best
industrial relations record Britain had enjoyed for half a century.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL VOLCKER, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, is
considering an offer to serve as an adviser to the Russian government on
economic and banking reform.
The 64-year-old Mr Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve between
1979 and 1987, left Moscow on Wednesday after extensive talks with Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, and other
members of the reform group.
Speaking from Princeton, New Jersey, where he teaches part-time, Mr Volcker
confirmed yesterday that he had discussed the possibility of advising the
Russian government, but had not concluded an agreement.
He said he spent 36 hours in Moscow and called the issue of whether he
becomes an adviser 'very much open'.
'We discussed whether and to what extent it would make sense for me to go
back and give them some advice. I am considering to what degree it seems
useful,' Mr Volcker said. He added that if he were to become an adviser to
the Russian government it would be on a part-time basis.
In his Moscow meetings with Mr Gaidar and with Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman
of the Russian Central Bank, Mr Volcker discussed several topics on which he
might provide advice. These included the banking system, currency
arrangements between the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States
and Moscow's relations with the International Monetary Fund.
A team from the IMF is due to arrive in Moscow at the weekend to conduct
detailed negotiations over the next three weeks with the Russian government
on the terms of Russia's entry into the IMF.
These negotiations are of critical importance to the government, which is
looking for a seal of approval for its programme and policies. This is
necessary to attract international support.
The recommendations of the IMF team will go to the IMF board in March or
early April. Approval from the board could lead to the granting of
substantial western aid to stabilise the rouble and to support imports - aid
which the Russian government has set at around Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9bn).
Both Mr Gaidar and Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime ministers with
responsibility for the economy and social affairs, have in the past week
indicated that the budget would be under intense strain because of
parliament's decision to cut the rate of value added tax on some commodities
and to increase spending on social services.
The IMF team will need to be reassured that the government has control of
the budget and of monetary policy before approval is forthcoming.
However, the government has gained a better understanding with the Russian
Central Bank and believes it has sharply reduced credit and money emission.
The acquisition of Mr Volcker would lend support and prestige to the Russian
economic team.
As an adviser Mr Volcker would be able to speak as banker to banker with Mr
Matiukhin of the Russian Central Bank, and thus to smooth over present and
potential conflicts.
His advice on what he called Moscow's 'interfacing' with the IMF would be
useful, given his experience in co-ordinating the handling of international
sovereign debt issues such as the 1982 Mexican debt crisis by the US Federal
Reserve and the IMF.
He would work alongside other advisers to the Russian government - Professor
Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, Professor Richard Layard of the London School of
Economics and Professor Anders Aslund of the Stockholm Centre for Research
into East European and Soviet Economies.
Since leaving the Federal Reserve Board, Mr Volcker has divided his time
between teaching at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs and serving as chairman of James D. Wolfensohn, a New
York investment bank.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is to hold a meeting with Northern Ireland's political leaders
following the escalation in sectarian killings in the province.
The meeting will be the first of its kind in Downing Street. It marks a
recognition by the government that it cannot allow Northern Ireland policy
to stagnate before the general election, even if local politicians fail to
agree on starting round-table talks.
Mr Major wants local politicians to take more of a leadership role in
Northern Ireland following the government's failure to restart the talks on
the province's political future. But he looks set to rebuff Unionist demands
for the internment of terrorist suspects.
Mr Major's initiative was reinforced by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
Republic's premier-elect, who set Ulster as a priority issue.
Speaking of the recent spate of killings, he said: 'We must not spare any
effort and take every possible initiative to put a stop to it (the
violence).' He said he looked forward to talks with Mr Major and broader
cross-border relations when all options would be open for discussion.
The Downing Street meeting, expected early next week, will be specifically
on security issues. But Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary,
portrayed it as part of a wider process of building a dialogue.
Last month, when shelving his attempts to start formal political
negotiations until after the election, Mr Brooke said local politicians
would continue to meet to discuss matters of common concern.
In a Commons statement yesterday, Mr Brooke was forced to defend the
government's handling of security in the province following the outbreak of
terrorist violence in which 26 people have been killed so far this year.
In Belfast the recent killings have created a sense of shock and foreboding,
even in a community which has become hardened to violence.
The security situation 'is not and will not be allowed to get out of
control', Mr Brooke said. But he met protests from Unionist MPs, anxious for
the government to take tougher measures, who argued that 20 years of 'direct
rule' meant responsibility for security lay with ministers. When one Tory MP
warned that the province was 'quite close to sliding into civil war', Mr
Brooke replied that it was essential for the government, like the local
community, 'to keep its nerve'.
He described the recent incidents - the latest of which saw five Catholics
killed in a Belfast bookmakers - as 'part of a wider tragedy in which the
whole community shares'.
Internment remains on the statute book but Mr Brooke gave no indication that
it was being considered. Northern Ireland Office officials said the
circumstances of strife and a breakdown in law and order justifying such a
drastic measure were 'a long, long way off'.
During Commons questions, Mr Paisley told the prime minister that talking
would not solve the security problem.
Mr Major replied: 'I believe it would greatly assist the search for peace if
the clearest possible lead was given by all politicians in this country and
in Northern Ireland.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / SFO chief Barbara Mills to become new DPP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS BARBARA MILLS QC, director of the Serious Fraud Office, is to be the new
director of public prosecutions.
Mrs Mills, 51, the first woman to hold the office, replaces Sir Allan Green
QC, who resigned in October after he was stopped by police for alleged kerb
crawling in the red-light district of King's Cross, London.
Announcing the appointment three months after Sir Patrick Mayhew QC, the
attorney general, decided to advertise the Pounds 77,000-a-year post for the
first time, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that Mrs Mills
would take up her job after her successor at the SFO had been appointed.
In a brief statement issued by her office, Mrs Mills said: 'I am honoured to
have been appointed as DPP. I have a very high regard for the work of the
CPS and am proud to have been chosen to head it.'
Mrs Mills said that she was sorry to be leaving the SFO, which had proved
itself to be a valuable part of England's prosecution structure.
She leaves the SFO after only 18 months, at a time when it is facing
mounting criticism for its handling of the alleged conspiracy arising out of
the 1987 failed Pounds 837m Blue Arrow rights issue.
Her successor, who will be the SFO's third head in its 3 1/2 -year history,
will inherit three of the biggest fraud investigations undertaken: the
collapse of the Polly Peck fruit and electronics empire; the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International; and the Maxwell empire.
Her move also comes at a difficult time for the CPS, which is under scrutiny
by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice which was set up after the
release of the Birmingham Six last year.
The commission is expected to recommend an enhanced role for the CPS in
overseeing police investigations.
Her appointment was welcomed by solicitors and barristers. The Bar Council
said that she was the right person to carry on the task begun by Sir Allan
of enhancing the morale and standing of the CPS.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Appointments: Wellington Names Haynes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gamekeeper turned poacher might be one view of yesterday's decision by
Wellington Underwriting Holdings, the Lloyd's agency, to appoint Antony
Haynes - a former leader of Lloyd's Names - to be its new chairman. But it's
an impression that both parties are anxious to dispel.
Haynes has come to prominence at Lloyd's for his forceful leadership of the
Association of Lloyd's Members, the organisation which acts as a kind of
trades union for nearly markets underwriting.
A Name himself since 1964, Haynes has been a bitter critic of the market's
establishment. But he believes attitudes have changed at Lloyd's, where a
proposed far-reaching reform of the market's business structure was accepted
by the Council last month.
Haynes played a prominent part in the task force which conducted the review.
He recommended the appointment of McKinsey as management consultants, and,
as a member of the 14-man team, pressed personally for many of the new
rights for Names - such as their freedom to call annual general meetings of
syndicates.
Certainly, Wellington, which manages nine syndicates with potential premium
income of around Pounds 500m, will benefit from Haynes' business experience.
Now 61, Haynes has spent most of his working life at Booker, where he is
currently chairman of the group's agricultural division.
*****
Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, the recently rescued parent company of the Dan Air
airline, has appointed John Olsen as its new chief executive.
Olsen, 49, is the London-based general manager for Europe and parts of the
middle east for Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline. He has worked for
Cathay for 25 years, about 20 of them in the Far East. His experience lies
largely in scheduled services. Dan Air, Europe's 12th largest airline with a
strong position at Gatwick, has switched its emphasis from charter to
scheduled flights.
Olsen replaces Charles Whyte, who was brought in as managing director by
David James, a company doctor, himself brought in as chairman and chief
executive in the autumn of 1990.
James will stay on as non-executive chairman, with his salary falling to a
fraction of the Pounds 500,000 fee he has received for 18 months' work. He
says there is now a strong possibility that he will become involved in
another rescue project.

FT  07 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback on higher turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS on both the political and economic fronts continued to bear down
on the London stock market yesterday, and the fourth negative session this
week set the stage for the close today of the equity trading account.
A sharp increase in trading volume was largely confined to a switching
operation affecting several leading stocks in the FT-SE list, and traders
maintained that the institutions were still backing away across the wider
range of UK equities.
Once again, the New York market played an ambivalent role in the London
equity sector. Traders remained cautious over the near-term outlook for the
Dow, but UK stocks closed above the day's lows as Wall Street edged higher
in early trading, after losing 15.21 in the previous session.
The London market closed with a fall of 12.8 on the FT-SE Index for a final
reading of 2,534.3, with the investment mood subdued at the close of
trading.
A temporary scare at the beginning of the session appeared to reflect a
mistaken reading of a report on the potential implications for several
Footsie stocks of the proposed changes in accounting standards. The report
has been prepared, but not yet published, by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK
investment bank, which rejected the initial market comments as 'totally
incorrect' and stressed that it had not changed investment recommendations
on the stocks concerned.
With trends in the London money markets now no longer indicating an early
reduction in domestic base rates, equities opened the session without
support, and were soon down by more than 11 points on the Footsie scale.
Rumours of further pending political scandals were largely discounted,
however, and in the absence of significant selling, share prices rallied and
moved briefly into positive territory.
But gains were rapidly and sharply reversed when clients of County NatWest
acted on the investment bank's recommendation of a switch out of the leading
oil stocks and into telecommunications issues. At least one very large
institutional client was believed to be prominent in the switch.
The market sagged by 17.4 points to touch FT-SE 2,529.7. Traders identified
a large mixed trading programme from a UK investment bank which took the
heart out of a stock market already lacking in genuine investment support.
Share prices rallied towards the close when Wall Street, which is still an
uncertain factor ahead of the payroll and employment statistics to be
published today, opened steadily.
Trading volume through the Seaq network rose to 539.1m shares from the
491.8m of the previous session. Yesterday's total took in heavy
contributions from British Petroleum, Shell, BT and Racal Electronics.
Retail business totalled Pounds 954.8m on Wednesday, an improvement from
daily levels at the beginning of the week, but still disappointing by
standards of market profitability.
Strategists commented that political factors have played an increased role
this week in the wake of the disclosures by Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the
UK Liberal Democrats. This has focused attention on the latest public
opinion polls, which are expected to appear in the UK newspapers this
morning.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Appointments: Fauroux joins C Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union confirmed its reputation as the most European-minded of the
UK composite insurance groups by this week appointing a senior French
industrialist and politician to its board.
Roger Fauroux, currently president d'honneur of the Compagnie de St Gobain,
is a former industry minister in France and was well known to the executives
managing CU's sizeable Paris-based French subsidiary. According to executive
director, John Carter, Fauroux's mix of private sector and civil service
experience made him an attractive addition to a board that has become both
smaller and more 'business-focused' in recent years.
Nicholas Baring, CU's chairman, says the appointment, coupled with that last
year of Professor Henk Melj, a Unilever director, would be of 'particular
value to the group in the development of its operations within the EC'. Melj
has been involved in mergers and acquisitions.
Ian Strachan, the deputy chief executive of RTZ Corporation, was also
appointed to the board. Fauroux replaces Robert Brooks, who retires after
serving 15 years as a non-executive director.

<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED BANK AND ANOTHER v WALKER AND ANOTHER
Chancery Division: Mr Justice Vinelott: December 18 1992
THE COURT has power in an extreme case to restrain a defendant shareholder
from wilfully dissipating a company's assets or destroying security given by
the company to creditors, by exercising his voting rights in such a way as
to lead inevitably to its collapse.
Mr Justice Vinelott so held when granting an interlocutory application by
Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and TSB Bank plc, plaintiffs in separate
actions against both defendants, Mr George Walker and Birdcage Walk Ltd,
shareholders in Brent Walker Ltd, for injunctions restraining them from
exercising their voting rights other than in favour of proposals for the
reconstruction of Brent Walker.
HIS LORDSHIP said that an extraordinary general meeting of Brent Walker was
due to take place at 10am the following day.
Mr Walker and Birdcage Walk, a Hong Kong company, were beneficial owners of
substantial blocks of ordinary and preference shares in Brent Walker.
The preference shares carried votes on certain resolutions at the
extraordinary general meeting equal to four-fifteenths of the votes on the
ordinary shares.
The votes capable of being exercised at the extraordinary general meeting in
respect of those shares amounted to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of
the votes capable of being cast at the extraordinary general meeting.
That percentage might be critical.
On the present application, SCB and TSB sought injunctions requiring the
defendants to vote in favour of, or restraining them from voting against,
resolutions to be proposed at that meeting.
The effect of the resolution if passed would be first, to confirm a proposal
for reconstructing Brent Walker and its indebtedness; and second, to remove
Mr Walker and a colleague, Mr Hemingway, from their offices as non-executive
directors.
The banks proposed the reconstruction. Brent Walker's liabilities to the
banks exceeded its likely realisable assets. They were not willing to go
ahead with the reconstruction arrangements unless Mr Walker and Mr Hemingway
were removed.
In the summer of 1990, 47 banks were owed about Pounds 850m. Brent Walker
was not in a position to service the interest without an injection of money
or a sale of assets.
In September 1990, Pounds 100m worth of bonds were offered to shareholders
to provide the necessary funds to enable the company to survive.
It became apparent that Brent Walker's problems would not be solved by the
bond issue alone and that bank facilities would have to be renegotiated.
Mr Walker entered into negotiations. The banks appointed SCB as their agent,
and appointed a steering committee of eight banks.
In November 1990, a global facilities agreement provided for continuation of
current banking facilities, which had increased to more than Pounds 1bn,
until midnight December 31 1991.
The purpose of that agreement was to enable restructuring arrangements to be
negotiated.
In the course of the negotiations, in May 1991, the steering committee
removed Mr Walker from office as chief executive. He remained a director.
The banks were increasingly unwilling that he should remain a director and
convened an extraordinary general meeting for July 1991 to consider
resolutions for his removal, together with his wife and Mr Hemingway. The
articles of association required a 75 per cent majority.
Mr Walker issued a writ to restrain SCB, the steering committee and TSB from
giving instructions that any shareholding be voted in favour of his removal.
An application for an interlocutory injunction in those terms was dismissed
by Mr Justice Morritt on July 1. Nonetheless, the resolution failed because
the votes fell just short of the 75 per cent majority.
An appeal by Mr Walker was dismissed. It was apparently accepted by Mr
Justice Morritt and by the Court of Appeal that if Mr Walker remained a
director the restructuring proposals would almost certainly founder and the
company would come to an end.
In the present application the court had further evidence supporting that
view.
Lord Kindersely, the present chairman of Brent Walker, said in affidavit
evidence that it took more than nine months for the restructuring proposals
to be put together and approved by the banks.
The banks were not prepared to go ahead with the proposals unless 90 per
cent of the bondholders agreed to support them. Undertakings by 90 per cent
of the bondholders had now been obtained.
Lord Kindersley emphasised that the terms of the restructuring proposals
must either be approved in their entirety or fail in their entirety at the
extraordinary general meeting on December 19.
He referred to a letter to shareholders and bondholders of December 3, in
which he stated that if the restructuring plan did not become effective
Brent Walker would run out of funds and collapse would be inevitable; and
that if it collapsed there would be no prospect of any payment to
bondholders, convertible preference shareholders or ordinary shareholders.
That was supported by SCB's affidavit, where it was also said that if the
restructuring proposals were not approved, Brent Walker would run out of
money before any other proposals could be prepared, because the enlarged
facility was repayable on January 9 1992.
The banks believed that if the restructuring arrangements were not approved,
Brent Walker's collapse would be inevitable and the shares would be
worthless.
Mr Burton for the banks submitted that the court had jurisdiction on the
principles which underlay its power to grant Mareva relief, to grant an
injunction restraining a defendant from doing something which would destroy
his assets or greatly injure them to the detriment of a creditor, either
because he had some ulterior motive for putting pressure on the creditor to
agree a claim or because he was simply not rational in his conduct.
The jurisdiction was not limited to the case where a defendant sought to
remove his assets to a place of safety or embarked on an
uncharacteristically extravagant way of living.
Mr Oliver accepted that the jurisdiction existed though he submitted rightly
that the court should hesitate long before interfering with a defendant's
freedom to deal with his own property, unless satisfied that he was acting
from some ulterior purpose.
It was only in an extreme case that the court would interfere by injunction
with the exercise by a shareholder/debtor of the voting right attached to
his own shares.
However, in the present case the banks had shown that a vote against the
restructuring proposals would cross that boundary.
There was no reason to doubt Lord Kindersley's judgment that if the vote
were not in favour of restructuring, it would be the end of the company and
that the shareholders and bondholders would then have no prospect of
receiving anything.
Opposing or in any way obstructing the reconstruction proposals would be so
pointlessly harmful that, whatever motive inspired it, it would amount to
the wilful dissipation of assets which the court had jurisdiction,
consistently with Mareva principles, to prevent.
There was an added feature to the case. Each of the plaintiff banks had a
charge on other shares which they were in a position to vote. The security
they had over their shares would be destroyed along with any prospect of
executing a judgment against shares beneficially-owned by the defendants.
Mr Oliver said that the proposition that a creditor with a security over
shares should be entitled to prevent a defendant from voting shares over
which he had no security, in order to preserve the value of the shares over
which he had security, was extravagant.
It was not an extravagant proposition. The situation was that the shares
over which the security existed could not be preserved except in a way which
also preserved the other shares. The aim was to ensure that the debtor did
not act in a way which was destructive of the security he had given to the
creditor.
However that jurisdiction was described, whether it was waste or brought
under some other head, courts of Equity did have power to restrain conduct
which would destroy property over which a debtor had given a charge, in
appropriate and rare circumstances.
Judgment for the banks.
For the banks: Michael Burton QC and Robin Dicker (Theodore Goddard).
For the defendants: David Oliver QC and Steven Gee (DJ Freeman).

FT  07 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in stock index futures was characterised by two-way business with
little in the way of features, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,561, at a premium of 26 to the cash market, the March
FT-SE contract ran into sellers early on and soon fell to 2,550, the low of
the day, as the underlying cash market attempted a rally.
Strong two-way business prevented further falls in the contracts, though
County NatWest was reported to have been the big seller before Wall Street's
opening.
A modest recovery in March was curtailed by the poor Wall Street opening.
Dealers reported an increase in spread trading.
March eventually closed at 2,567 unchanged on Wednesday's close and 17
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Turnover
reached 7,224 lots.
In traded options, volume rose to 25,380 contracts, up from Wednesday's
meagre 18,099. The FT-SE 100 Index traded 7,322 contracts while the Euro
FT-SE traded 1,988. BT was the busiest stock option trading 1,365 lots with
the February 330 calls the busiest series. This was followed by Cable and
Wireless. It traded 1,261 contracts with the April 600 calls active.

FT  07 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Oils to telecoms switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER
PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BT and BP, the UK's second and third biggest companies as measured
by market capitalisation, moved in opposite directions as dealers reported a
switch out of the UK oil group and into the telecoms giant.
The Seaq ticker confirmed extraordinarily heavy turnover in the two
companies and provided evidence of two exceptionally large individual trades
in the stocks. The first was a line of 6.7m BP at 270 1/2 p, and the second
a block of 9m BT at 337p.
Speculation in the market suggested that County NatWest had executed the
deals on behalf of a big institutional client; County would not comment on
the switch story. The big switch, it was said, was part of a general
re-shaping of the investment portfolio of one of the UK's most powerful
institutions.
By the close of trading BT 'old' shares were 3 1/2 ahead at 334 1/2 p, after
337p, on heavy turnover of 8m shares, while the 'new' edged up 1 1/2 to
124p, after 125 1/2 p, with 14m traded. Also driving BT stock higher was the
recent Warburg Securities 'buy' recommendation and hints that one of the
analysts most bearish of BT in recent months, had lifted his 'sell' stance
on the stock.
BP shares, weakened over recent weeks by worries about the dividend cover,
weak oil prices and hints of a boardroom rift, slipped to 273p, before
stabilising and closing a net 2 1/2 off at 276p; turnover in BP totalled 18m
shares.
C &amp; W weaker
Telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) delivered one of the poorest
individual performances among the Footsie stocks after Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, the investment bank, chopped its profits forecast for the company. C &amp;
W shares closed 13 lower at 580p, with 4.8m traded.
C &amp; W was also included by BZW in a list of leading UK companies which may
be affected by proposals put forward by the Accounting Standards Board,
although BZW was at pains to point out that this had nothing to do with its
profits downgrades.
BZW reduced its forecast of profits for the year ended March 1992 from
Pounds 720m to Pounds 695m and its estimate for the year ended March 1993
from Pounds 790m to Pounds 765m. The broker cited disappointing trading at C
&amp; W's Mercury division which it said was suffering from the impact of price
reductions last year and slowing volume gains. However, the investment bank
emphasised it was retaining its 'hold' stance on the stock.
Vickers sold
Vickers tumbled after Smith New Court reduced its dividend forecast. The
mid-morning reduction caused a 'backwardation' - a situation in which the
bid and offer price are temporarily reversed, leaving the shares 16 off at
160p. The broker said it expects the full-year dividend to total 5p, down
from its previous estimate of 6p and against the previous year's total of
9.9p.
Mr Chris Avery, at Smiths believes the company is running out of time for
the partial disposal of its Rolls-Royce Motors subsidiary before the
company's full-year figures are reported on February 24, a move he believes
would have assisted the dividend pay-out.
But sources close to the company later indicated to the market that the
dividend was likely to be nearer 5.9p. This helped Vickers rally off the
bottom to end 10 down at 166p on a hefty turnover of 3.8m.
Stores were generally firm, but Great Universal 'A' (GUS) gave up most
gains, closing 2 up at 1430p. At one time the shares were 50 higher at
1478p, amid suggestions that Cazenove, the company broker, was trying to buy
shares in an already illiquid market, and had recommended the stock after a
visit to one of the company's divisions on Wednesday. The rise also
reflected optimism ahead of a presentation given for GUS by Warburg
Securities, but this disappointed and was described as something of a
non-event.
Sears were particularly active, rising 2 to 102p. Smith New Court recently
recommended the shares as a good recovery stock, but regarded yesterday's
movement as simply a reflection of the sectors general strength. Marks &amp;
Spencer put on 5 to 304p, following a Kleinwort Benson recommendation.
Discount supermarket group Kwik Save fell 32 to 594p after James Capel cut
its profit forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 110m for the year to August 31
and by Pounds 12m to Pounds 122m for the following year. Kwik Save made a
trading profit of Pounds 101.7m last year. Increased price competition from
new operators in the discount food sector was behind the profit downgrade.
Vodafone sped up 9 to 353p on good turnover of 2.7m, mirroring strong gains
in cellular stocks on Wall Street. Smith Barney, the Wall Street brokerage,
was said to have shifted from a hold to a buy on Vodafone.
Standard Chartered raced up 9 to 420p in response to vague takeover stories
while talk of a UBS Phillips &amp; Drew recommendation was said to have lifted
Midland 3 1/2 to 230p. Lloyds Abbey Life was a notable weak spot in life
assurances, the shares losing 14 to 380p after a bearish recommendation from
Nomura, the Japanese-owned brokerage.
Commercial Union retreated 8 to 455p after reports that BZW had cut its 1992
dividend forecast and increased its estimate of 1992 losses.
Dollar weakness put pressure on internationally traded pharmaceuticals
stocks and a negative press report yesterday gave the excuse to take
profits. The newspaper article quoted a consumers' association study which
was critical of over-the-counter cold and influenza medicines.
SmithKline Beecham, which makes Beecham's Powders, fell 7 to 961p, Reckitt &amp;
Colman which manufactures Lemsip dropped 4 to 674p and Wellcome, which
produces a number of cough and cold remedies, slipped 12 to 1114p.
Glaxo responded to US selling and lost 18 to 829p and Fisons shed 6p to
379p.
Medeva gained 9 to 292p on the back of a presentation at US brokerage house
Merrill Lynch, by the chairman, Mr Bernard Taylor, to investors in New York.
Trading in Reuters Holdings was volatile following a significant share
placing which prompted a sharp slide on Wednesday. The company was, early
yesterday, rumoured to be suggesting that analysts' estimates of profits to
be announced next week were too high and the fall continued until the shares
were 20 off. Then, they proved oversold and bounced back to close only a
penny off at 1097p with 1.1m traded.
BTR was active in early dealing on concern that its Australian unit, BTR
Nylex, may write down the value of assets.
The shares closed only a penny off at 408p, after 403, with 3.6m traded.
BOC rose 10 to 648p against the trend as Kleinwort Benson published an
internal note restating its buy stance on the stock. The securities house
believes the company is on 'an undemanding rating'.
Babcock was active, the day's turnover reaching 12m and the shares remained
unchanged at 56 1/2 p. Tomkins fell 4 to 435p. The word in the market is
that the company is taking another look at Racal Electronics subsidiary,
Chubb.
Profit taking hit Inchcape, leaving the shares 9 down at 423p.
British Airways fell 4 to 230p, with Goldman Sachs reported to have been
offering stock at 231p. Smith New Court advised investors to take profits
and the shares were also said to have suffered from worries about the
company's accountancy methods included in a report from BZW.
Senior Engineering retreated 2 1/2 to 69 1/2 p after announcing a Pounds
26.6m rights issue.
Shares in Euro Disney firmed on reports in the French press that bookings
were well ahead of expectations. After rising to 1530p, the shares eased to
close 5 ahead at 1525p.
USM-quoted ice cream manufacturer Clarke Foods jumped 15 to 88p in the old
shares and 15 in the nil-paid to 27p after positive comment in a specialist
tip-sheet.

FT  07 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Reforms help Bombay climb to new peak -
The market has welcomed the repeal of a ban on foreign companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By R. C. MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a brief pause earlier this week, the Bombay bourse has continued the
extraordinary bull run which started in January, and yesterday achieved its
second record high in less than a week.
Speculative buying had pushed share prices to a 1992 peak last Friday,
prompting the stock exchange authorities to intervene on Monday, with a
package of measures to cool the overheated equity market.
The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India's largest with three-quarters of
national trading, banned forward deals in the 86 most actively traded
shares, except in the case of squaring outstanding positions. Quantitative
restrictions were imposed on brokers on purchases in the remaining 600
stocks.
But the effect of these restrictions appeared to be short-lived. After
reaching a record high of 2,302.54 last Friday, a rise of 17.6 per cent from
the start of the year, the 30-share BSE index fell 29.73 on Monday in
response to the trading restrictions. The index has since recovered,
reachingits new record yesterday and closing 20.93 up at 2,309.36 on renewed
speculative buying.
The impetus for Bombay's bull run has come mainly from the continuing
industrial and trade reforms started last July by the minority government
headed by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, who is governing by consensus, and the more
recent decision to open up the economy to foreign investment.
Its most recent surge, last week, was fuelled by two important events. The
Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, lifted a 10-year ban on foreign
companies opening branches in India, which will allow them to compete with
domestic companies. This will enable, for instance, Coca-Cola, which had
been ordered out, to return to India and sell its branded soft drinks.
Analysts say that the lifting of the ban is expected to allow foreign
companies already listed on the BSE to increase their earnings and could
encourage more foreign companies to seek a listing.
This optimism was reflected in a rise in share values of foreign companies.
Nestle has risen to Rs275 from Rs220 in a fortnight, Ponds India, a Unilever
affiliate, to Rs460 from Rs330 and Mico, a Bosch affiliate, to Rs2,250 from
Rs1,900.
Also, New Delhi ended the uncertainty of the past three years by giving
statutory backing to the Securities and Exchange Board of India to regulate
the capital markets.
The optimism of traders has also been supported by buying in ACC, India's
largest cement group, and Apollo Tyres by a fast-growing portfolio manager,
Growmore Finances Services. The BSE recently asked the youthful Mr Harshad
Mehta, who heads Growmore, to explain why he was buying shares in these two
companies.
He replied that all of the purchases, which began a year ago when ACC was
quoted at Rs600 and Apollo Tyres at Rs70, have been for investment purposes
only, and that Growmore has no takeover ambitions. Yesterday, Apollo Tyres
and ACC closed at Rs252.50 and Rs4,525 respectively.
Growmore's Apollo share purchases raised eyebrows in the market, since the
Indian automobile industry is in recession. But Mr Mehta has his own logic:
Apollo also caters to the replacement tyre market.
The present boom is not based on fundamentals, analysts say. It hangs
precariously on hopes of rich rewards five years hence when the restructured
Indian economy should be set on an export-led growth path.
The traders are bullish and many new capital issues are expected to flood
the market this month, ignoring pre-budget blues. But the finance minister
Mr Manmohan Singh has warned that he is likely to unveil a harsh budget on
February 29.
The government is committed to the International Monetary Fund to cut the
fiscal deficit to 5 per cent of GDP next year from 6.5 per cent this year as
part of the stabilisation programme. If Mr Singh prefers a heavy dose of
taxes to a cut in capital expenditure, traders' hopes for a soft budget will
be disappointed.

FT  07 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rebounds on
improved sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS were encouraged by the announcement late on Wednesday by the Osaka
Stock Exchange (OSE) of measures to enhance transparency in the derivatives
market, and the Nikkei average rebounded after declining for two consecutive
days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 168.55 to 22,104.92, helped by
arbitraged-related buying after a rise in futures prices. The index opened
at the day's low of 21,975.05 and rose to the day's high of 22,284.80 in the
morning session, but later eased back towards the close.
Volume was steady at 200m shares. Advances led declines by 626 to 347, with
156 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 5.20 to 1,631.25 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.96 to
1,250.97.
Traders said that the OSE's announcement improved sentiment. The OSE said
that trading by brokers of futures and options contracts would be disclosed,
and trading hours for futures would be shortened by 10 minutes. Option
contracts, currently exercised once a week, will be exercised once a month,
starting with the June contract.
'Changing the rules may affect liquidity and increase the volatility in the
market, but some investors were relieved that the authorities showed that
they cared,' said Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities.
The recent overt expressions by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for
support of the sluggish stock market have soothed investors' worries that
authorities were unsympathetic. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y35,000
to Y750,000 on rumours that the government may include measures to support
the NTT share price in its effort to support the overall market.
Investors sought cyclical stocks. Electric furnace steelmakers advanced with
Tokyo Steel Mfg up Y50 to Y2,640 and Tokyo Tekko rising Y20 to Y1,590.
Machineries were also favoured with Rheon Automatic Machinery up Y110 to
Y1,540.
Heavy electricals fell sharply on downward revisions of earnings
expectations by leading Japanese brokerages. Projections that the recovery
of the semiconductor market may be delayed also prompted selling. Hitachi,
the most active issue of the day, fell Y25 to Y903 and Kyocera lost Y90 to
Y4,350.
Short-term trading lifted bio-technology related stocks. Meiji Milk Products
rose Y22 to Y909 and Okamoto Industries, the prophylactic maker, advanced
Y14 to Y933.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 139.10 to 23,728.57 in volume of 101.8m
shares. Bargain-hunting by individuals supported the index. Turnover once
again topped 100m shares due to heavy cross-trading by financial
institutions looking to lock in profits ahead of the March book-closing.
Roundup
The Pacific Rim was mixed as many bourses re-opened after the Chinese New
Year. Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand were closed.
AUSTRALIA saw two large portfolios of programme trading coming out of Japan,
which accounted for 30 per cent of turnover. The All Ordinaries index fell
8.3 to 1,594.6 in turnover of ADollars 228m (ADollars 302m).
Coles Myer, the retailer, continued its decline, shedding 18 cents to
ADollars 11.38, while CSR, the building and sugar group, fell 4 cents to
ADollars 4.72 after announcing an asset writedown on Wednesday.
The banking sector was mixed, with Westpac putting on 4 cents to ADollars
4.22. It announced that it was issuing 73m new shares to the Australian
Mutual Provident Society, raising the latter's stake to 15 per cent from 10
per cent. National Australia rose 2 cents to ADollars 7.50 and Commonwealth
shed 7 cents to ADollars 7.05.
News Corp gained 42 cents to ADollars 15.00 on the back of good trading in
New York. Its half-year results are due next Wednesday.
MANILA firmed in narrow trading: the composite index up 5.50 to 1,252.37.
Political uncertainty ahead of the May elections is keeping some investors
out of the market. Turnover fell to 165m pesos (255m). Philippine Long
Distance Telephone rose 25 pesos to 915.00 on a strong showing in the US.
SEOUL fell on profit-taking. The composite index slipped 0.53 to 690.84 in
turnover of Won509bn. The manufacturing sector was broadly down: Lucky fell
Won400 to Won18,500.
KUALA LUMPUR rose on bargain hunting and index-linked buying. The composite
index put on 5.17 to 575.81 in volume of 28.6m shares. Kedah Cement was
actively traded, rising 10 cents to MDollars 2.77. Motor stocks also firmed
after the government said it would reconsider a ruling which would raise the
tax on four-wheel drive vehicles.
SINGAPORE was quiet as late profit-taking pulled prices down: the Straits
Times Industrial Index rose 4.88 to 1,530.85 in volume of 36.08m.
BANGKOK was active in property after Wednesday's new issue of Bangkok Land
shares: it rose Bt15 to Bt169.00 in turnover of Bt1.75bn. The SET index
gained 7.68 to 771.09 in turnover of Bt7.64bn.
JAKARTA fell in active trading, the official index down 1.40 to 287.06 in
volume of 16.6m shares. Inco, the nickel company, put on Rp50 to Rp3,950

FT  07 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Michelin extends advance as
Paris bourse recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND THOUGHTS came to the rescue of the Paris bourse yesterday, but they
had the reverse effect in Frankfurt, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS recovered from a midday slump which was blamed on the dollar's
weakness and the impact of a sell programme on a thin market. The CAC 40
index fell as low as 1,853.95 before closing 5.18 down at 1,860.61 in
turnover of FFr2bn.
The tyre maker Michelin continued to advance, putting on FFr7 or 4.5 per
cent to FFr164 with 164,890 shares traded. One analyst said that Goodyear's
recent forecast that it would return to the black this year was encouraging
investors to buy, but he added that the stock was looking overbought.
Paribas added FFr11.30 or 3.1 per cent to FFr371.50 with 188,290 shares
traded, on heavy buying by two domestic brokers. There were also unconfirmed
reports that Goldman Sachs had downgraded its earnings for Bancaire, pushing
it down by FFr10 to FFr495.
FRANKFURT broke up through 1,700 on the DAX index for an intraday peak of
1,702.69, but then dropped more than 20 points to close 5.49 lower at
1,681.13, after a 1.99 rise to 689.15 in the FAZ at midsession.
The early rise was a traders' initiative, and prices soon lost ground after
orders failed to follow. In the aftermath of the steel pay settlement, the
emphasis switched to its inflationary consequences, and the prospect of a
more extended period of high interest rates; and car shares, which had risen
on the absence of a strike threat, fell on reports that Daimler's Mercedes
unit was reviewing methods of cutting production this year, due to a slump
in the US market.
Volume rose from DM7bn to DM8bn. Daimler and Volkswagen both fell DM5.50, to
DM744.50 and DM337 respectively. However, the market extended its
appreciation of construction stocks, where Hochtief's good orders took the
shares up another DM14 to DM1,199, and Philipp Holzmann by DM15 to DM1,165.
Retailers, similarly, extended Wednesday's gains on hopes of higher 1992
consumer spending, with Karstadt DM5.50 higher at DM631.50 and Kaufhof DM6
higher at DM478.
MILAN saw interest in banks and insurers. The Comit index rose 0.88 to
551.59 in turnover estimated at close to Wednesday's L149bn.
Generali rose L290 to L31,190 while its subsidiary Alleanza added L120 to
L12,770. Ambroveneto also continued in strength, adding L15 to L4,400 on
speculation that Credit Agricole of France or Alleanza were interested in
taking a stake in the bank.
Dealers reported foreign buying in the utility Italgas, which rose L58 to
L3,534 with a heavy 1.6m shares traded.
Fiat rose L2 to L5,135 but slipped to L5,050 after hours, depressed by
industry data showing that its share of the domestic car market fell to 43.5
per cent last month, compared to 46.9 per cent a year earlier.
AMSTERDAM was broadly mixed with the CBS Tendency Index barely changed: it
gained 0.1 to 122.2. KLM's third quarter results, which showed a
smaller-than-expected loss of Fl 8.6m, supported its shares. Having recorded
a day's high of Fl 40.90 after opening at Fl 39.80 it closed just 90 cents
lower Fl 39.60. One analyst did not expect the price to rise much above Fl
40 until there sible merger with British Airways.
Philips put on Fl 0.40 to Fl 31.00, although there was mixed feeling over
its announcement on Wednesday that it was taking a 25 per cent stake in a US
media group. Elsevier gained Fl 1 to Fl 107.20.
ZURICH rose on marginally lower than expected domestic inflation figures for
1991, the all-share SPI index ending 3.0 higher at 1,119.1. The inflation
news helped bonds and bank shares in early trade.
CS Holding bearers, up SFr40 at SFr1,965, topped the active list. However,
Gotthard Bank certificates lost SFr15 to SFr525 on better 1991 profits, an
unchanged dividend and a 1-for-15 rights issue.
MADRID was flat, the general index ending down 0.81 at 256.61. The banking
sector was weak on profit-taking while, in utilities, Endesa shed another
Pta40 at Pta3,170.
STOCKHOLM's rally ended with the Affarsvarlden General index 9.5 lower at
968.8, on interest rate worries and Ericsson's announcement of 800 job cuts
in the Stockholm area.
Volume eased from SKr587m to SKr502m. Ericsson was the most active stock,
its B shares slipping SKr4 to SKr118.
OSLO fell in dull trading, the all-share index dropping 4.38 to 438.09.
Hafslund, the healthcare group, saw its A shares lose NKr2 to NKr266 in
spite of record profits, an increased dividend and plans to spin-off its
shipping operations into an independent company.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Paper chase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a tight day in the money markets yesterday with assistance running
slower than in recent sessions.
Overnight rates hit a high of 13 per cent although expectations that there
would be enough paper around tomorrow to satisfy even the hungriest traders
helped them fall back to more normal levels of 10 1/2-1/4 per cent by the
close.
The key three-month interbank rate eased from Wednesday's close of 10
11/16-9/16 to 10 9/16-1/2 per cent. The March short sterling contract
implied that there would be no change in UK base rate policy in the next few
months, as it firmed a touch to 89.67 (89.66).
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.75bn, due to seasonal
government revenues. However, as expected, the Bank took a measured approach
to injecting liquidity, giving the bulk of assistance late in the day. 'It
was like the 7th cavalry riding over the hill, coming in to rescue
everyone,' said one senior dealer.
The shortage was comprised of treasury bills and maturing assistance, which
took Pounds 621m, and exchequer transactions, which drained Pounds 535m.
Repurchase agreements called for Pounds 337m, while the rise in note
circulation accounted for Pounds 105m. Bankers' balances were expected to be
Pounds 55m below target.
In the morning, the Bank bought band one treasury and band three bank bills,
and paper for resale on February 25 and 26 totalling Pounds 186m. The rates
were between 10 3/16 and 10 7/16 per cent.
The Bank said it expected to continue trading in band three paper during the
government revenue period, which runs through March. Band three bills last
longer than the bank's more traditional band one and two business.
The Bank eliminated all but Pounds 271m of the shortage in the afternoon
with band one, two and three bill purchases totalling Pounds 1.29bn, at
rates of between 10 3/16 per cent and 10 7/16 per cent, and unspecified late
assistance. Some Pounds 21m of the afternoon injection was marked for resale
on February 25 and 26.
In Germany, call rates were quoted at 9.60/65 per cent, compared with
Wednesday's 9.60/70 per cent. Traders expected call rates to firm in
February.
In the US, the Federal Reserve did not act as funds were trading around the
presumed target of 4 per cent. However, many expected a drain on funds
today.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar climbs in quiet trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar recovered some of the ground it lost overnight, as traders moved
to cover their short positions in advance of today's employment figures.
After opening weaker in London at DM1.5748, compared with a close of
DM1.5880, the dollar recovered to close at DM1.5795. That trend was repeated
in New York, where the dollar opened at DM1.5768/73, compared with a close
of DM1.5803/10. By mid-day, it had firmed to DM1.5791/98.
The weaker opening levels were attributed to bearish statements made by Bank
of Japan governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, on the US economy.
He warned that recovery in the US might be further away than many
anticipated and might not even begin in the second half.
To compound his statements, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president,
reiterated the need for tight monetary policy in Germany in a newspaper
interview.
Mr Schlesinger's comments only highlighted the interest rate differential
between the US and Germany, which until this week had appeared to be
narrowing.
The exceptionally wide range of forecasts for the US employment figures
continued to confuse the market, and created a sense of uncertainty as to
the immediate prospect for the dollar. Forecasts for the numbers were as
diverse as a 100,000 drop in non-farm payrolls and a rise of 140,000.
The market median was focused on a rise of about 40,000, said Dr Mark
Austin, an economist at HongKong Bank. However, the figures would be
distorted by the seasonal adjustments of retail workers laid off after the
Christmas period. Since retailers are believed to have taken on fewer
workers than normal, the adjustments could seriously distort the figures,
economists warned.
'The numbers will need careful dissection before you interpret them,' said
Dr Austin.
The factory orders figures published yesterday, which showed greater than
expected declines for the month of December and the whole of 1991, had a
largely neutral effect on the dollar, said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank.
Within the exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark continued to hold the lead.
Trading was fairly quiet, however, with most attention focused on tomorrow's
events in the US.
Sterling hovered just above its ERM floor, although few in the market seemed
to be as alarmed at the prospect as in the weeks around Christmas. The pound
closed in London unchanged on the previous day's DM2.87.
Sterling is not expected to draw much attention until next week's round of
statistics, covering producer and retail price figures, money supply, bank
lending unemployment and average earnings.
The Spanish peseta weakened slightly against the German currency, from 62.95
per D-Mark to 62.99.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Keeping a weather-eye on a
troublesome 'child' / A look at the crop problems posed by the unpredictable
El Nino climate phenomenon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO CALM anxious grain traders the Chicago Board of Trade will offer a
seminar later this month on El Nino, the weather phenomenon that develops in
the equatorial Pacific every three to five years and can cause global
climate upsets. Grain traders are keen to know if they can expect this
year's El Nino to disturb the US weather pattern sufficiently to make a dent
in crop output.
Although signs of El Nino had been accumulating during 1991, only last month
did the the US National Weather Service finally conclude publicly that the
phenomenon was a fact.
The symptoms had been showing themselves overseas since last spring - rising
surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific, drought in the
western Pacific rim from Australia through Indonesia, a weaker Indian
monsoon, dryness in north-eastern Brazil, drought in South Africa and
wetness last summer in the Great Basin of the US, which runs from Arizona
north to Idaho.
While many of these conditions indicate that El Nino is occurring, they do
not reveal its severity. The phenomenon generally peaks in the northern
hemisphere's winter. This helps explain why Peruvian fishermen dubbed the
phenomenon El Nino, which means Christ child in Spanish. It arrived about
Christmas time.
Mr Vernon Kousky, a research meteorologist with the US weather service, now
assesses the current El Nino as 'moderate to strong'. While individual
weather events cannot always be directly attributed to El Nino, some signals
are indicative of its strength. Warm water in the Pacific is pushing
moisture into the south-western US, causing, for example, this winter's
floods in Texas, according to Mr Art Douglas, chairman of the Creighton
University's Atmospheric Sciences Department. Along the Gulf of Mexico, from
Texas to Florida, some areas have already had 200 per cent to 1,000 per cent
of their normal rainfall. Temperatures in that region are also beginning to
dip below normal. At the same time the phenomenon is upsetting the Jet
Stream, keeping extremely cold air far to the north and moderating
temperatures in the Midwest.
The Midwest, America's most important grain area, is seeing temperatures
four or five degrees Fahrenheit above normal, said Mr Jon Davis, the
in-house meteorologist for Shearson Lehman's commodities trading arm. The
weather service predicts that more of the same will occur in those regions
until spring and that the usually wet north-west is likely to be dryer, as
is the Ohio valley.
But what concerns the grain trade more is what, if anything, will happen
during the critical planting and growing season for American crops from June
to August.
Unfortunately, weather forecasting is not a precise science. Mr Kousky says
that El Nino, usually a 12 to 18 month event, has another six to 12 months
to run. But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between
El Nino and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months.
'Anything can happen,' he admits.
Crop Cast, a Maryland-based weather forecasting service that is used by many
US commodity trading houses, says that while El Nino has already affected
South American soyabeans, South African maize and Australian wheat, it is
hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effects in the US by
looking at the coincidence of the El Nino with two other climatological
events, last year's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippines and the
combination of lunar and solar cycles.
These additional factors along with El Nino probably mean that a more
extreme weather pattern bleeds over into summer, according to Mr Kevin
Marcus, director of Crop Cast services. He says the likelihood of extreme,
hot and dry weather is 100 per cent, but gives only a one in three chance
that this will have a significant impact on crops.
The hot, dry weather would have to occur in July or early August to reduce
the maize and soyabean crops significantly, that is by more than 10 per
cent. But Mr Marcus is uncertain about how the three phenomena will interact
since there no established pattern. He is still waiting for more data on the
severity of this year's El Nino.
The phenomenon has prompted commodities markets to gyrate in the past. In
1972-73 the El Nino destroyed the Peruvian fishmeal catch, which then
accounted for some 45 per cent of the world trade in protein feed. In
1982-83 it caused a drought in Africa, which helped to send cocoa prices up
by nearly 70 per cent over a period of about a year.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian softwood output down
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RUSSIAN PRODUCTION of sawn softwoods (conifers)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
in normal years more than half total European production - may have fallen
by 30 to 35 per cent in 1991, according to estimates published this week by
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Conditions are so
uncertain that no reliable forecast can be made for 1992, the commission
says.
Elsewhere in Europe, and in North America, the UN agency expects a modest
recovery in sawn softwood production and consumption in 1992 after declines
last year. These largely reflected the recession and in particular the
dampening effect of high interest rates on housing construction.
For Europe (excluding Russia), consumption is forecast to rise by 1.3 per
cent to 73.8m cubic metres, and production by 0.9 per cent to 68.2m cu m,
following drops of 8 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively in 1991.
In North America, much of last year's fall in sawn softwood production and
consumption is likely to be recovered in 1992, the ECE says. It predicts
production this year of 136.4m cum, just 1 per cent below 1990 levels, and
consumption of 120.8m cu m or 2 per cent less than in 1990.
Conditions in the softwood log market in Europe are returning to normal
after the massive clearance of storm-damaged timber in 1990, the ECE notes.
In the longer term, the agency expects that, with international help,
eastern Europe's forest products industries and markets could recover within
a few years.
The European and North American markets for hardwoods are predicted to
follow a similar trend to that of softwoods. In Europe (excluding Russia),
the ECE forecasts increases this year in sawn hardwood consumption and
production of 2.1 per cent (to 21m cu m) and 3.1 per cent (to 17.1m cu m)
after falls of 5.0 and 3.8 per cent respectively in 1991.
It notes that sawn hardwood of temperate species now has over 50 per cent of
the market in Europe. European imports of tropical sawnwood, a target of
environmentalists concerned about unsustainable logging in developing
countries, are estimated to fall by over 17.6 per cent to 2.6m cu m between
1990 and 1992. For logs the drop in tropical hardwood imports in 1990-92 is
expected to be 10.9 per cent to 3.2m cu m.
Looking at wood products, the commission expects a slight upturn in the
market for wood-based panels but notes that recycled paper is competing
successfully with virgin pulp in paper production. Against that, new markets
might be found for wood as a fuel source.

New York platinum futures were strongly ahead at midday after news that
South Africa's Impala Platinum appears to have recently bought metal on
world markets to help meet supply needs. In London, platinum prices
advanced, but met stiff resistance around Dollars 365 a troy ounce. On the
LME the zinc market lost its recent backwardation, cash metal closing
Dollars 2.50 a tonne below three-month metal. Dealers said the firmer tone
might be due to the apparent easing of tightness on February and the
possible return of consumer interest to the market. London cocoa prices
again touched fresh five-month lows. 'We have seen persistent selling from a
number of trade quarters,' said one dealer. The threat of Ivory Coast sales
still hangs over the market, which was under further pressure from a weaker
dollar against sterling. New York March arabica moved above 70 cents a lb on
short covering by midday after hitting a low of 68.70 in late trade on
Wednesday, the cheapest level for a nearby contract since October 1989.
Chartists said 68.30 remains a critical support level; a move below there
would put the market at 17-year lows. London's freight futures were again in
retreat following a 21 point fall in the Baltic Freight Index to 1,372.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US company in Uzbek gold deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMONT MINING, North America's biggest gold producer, has signed a protocol
of agreement to process ore stockpiled at Muruntau in newly-independent
Uzbekistan, reputed to be the world's biggest open pit gold mine.
Muruntau produces about 1.8m troy ounces of gold a year from reserves which
will last until about 2,040. However, it has stockpiled low-grade material
from which milling cannot extract enough gold.
Under the terms of the proposed joint venture with the Uzbekistan
government, Newmont will build huge plastic pads on which this low-grade ore
will be piled and the gold leached out with a cyanide-water mixture.
Heap-leach technology revolutionised gold mining in North America and
Australia in the past 20 years and Newmont claims to be the world's largest
user at its mines on the Carlin Trend in Nevada. They produced 1.58m ounces
of gold last year.
Analysts estimate it will cost between USDollars 70m and Dollars 75m for
crushing equipment and to build the leach pads and associated plant at
Muruntau, which is about 250 miles north west of Tashkent.
The contract, which Mr James Hill, Newmont's vice-president, corporate
relations, said could be signed as early as March, calls for Newmont to
process 150m tonnes of stockpiled material over the next 20 years. This
should extract between 180,000 and 360,000 ounces of gold a year, which
would be sold for the equal benefit of the government and Newmont.
Mr Hill hoped this would lead to more contracts between Newmont (which has
Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier as its biggest shareholder)
and Uzbekistan, the second-largest gold producer among the former Soviet
republics. He hoped the Muruntau arrangement would attract the interest and
support of western banks.

FT  07 FEB 92 / The Property Market: Disgruntled masters of all they survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surveying may have escaped Bernard Shaw's famous tirade against the iniquity
of the professions, but, at its worst, it is as much a conspiracy against
the laity as medicine, accountancy or law.
All too often, surveyors attempt to create a mystique around property.
Agents frequently portray their profession in a light that baffles the
outsider. They often make much of 'knowing the market'. Yet 'knowing the
market' - potentially the key to success - is an all-encompassing
catch-phrase that can be a poor substitute for analysis.
A client's ignorance of the surveying business is often matched by the
surveyor's ignorance of its client's business. The poor use of property
assets in many businesses does little credit to the breadth and relevance of
surveyors' advice. For example, investment surveyors - a specialist branch
of the profession dealing with the purchase and disposal of buildings -
deplore the way that property has been sidelined in many institutional
portfolios, but their lack of understanding of other financial instruments,
such as futures, frequently undermines their argument.
Surveyors are also criticised for the quality of their advice and the depth
of their research. Some disgruntled clients - largely those who bought at
the peak of the market - are turning to the law for redress. Though many of
these legal suits will come to nothing, the fact that dissatisfied customers
are turning to the law does reflect an increasing readiness to challenge the
profession's advice.
For all that, much of the profession does a good job for which it has
rightly earned the approval of the general public Surveyors certainly rank
nowhere near as high in British demonology as their cousins, the estate
agents and property developers.
Indeed, the profession's problem is less obloquy than oblivion. Surveyors
feel misunderstood and underrated.
'We are struggling for an identity . . . We should be seen as the equivalent
of the solicitor, the accountant, the doctor or the architect, but we are
not,' wrote Professor Malcolm Hollis, a building surveyor, in the magazine
Chartered Surveyor Weekly.
'It is clear that the general public does not know what a chartered surveyor
is, or does . . . ' said another contributor. 'Joe Public thinks of a
chartered surveyor as one who works through a theodolite and prepares maps,'
grumbled another.
The problem is partly a matter of presentation. The name 'chartered
surveyor' says little about the profession. And attempts to describe or
promote it lead into the dense thicket of specialisations: general practice,
quantity surveyors, building surveyors, rural practice, planning and
development, land surveyors and minerals.
Perhaps, some speculate, the name should be changed. To describe chartered
surveying as 'the property profession', for example, would be more
informative to the general public, particularly in the continental Europe.
Many surveyors critical of their profession would go further. They would
like to simplify the structure of the profession, probably along the lines
of the three main sectors: land, commercial and residential property and
construction.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the industry's
professional body, has acknowledged the pressure for change. Last year, it
set up a committee, headed by Mr Richard Lay, chairman of Debenham Tewson &amp;
Chinnocks, property advisers, to consider how the profession should meet the
needs of the market.
The result was a provocative report, suggesting that the RICS should
consider changing its name, streamlining its divisions, improving the
promotion of the profession, broadening the education of surveyors, and
merging with a rival professional organisation, the Incorporated Society of
Valuers and Auctioners (ISVA).
RICS welcomed the report in principle. In practice, however, RICS seems
unlikely to do anything about it. In all probability the report seems
destined to join a similar report on the structure of the profession
published four years ago, which was left on the shelf gathering dust.
But RICS is in a delicate position. The politics of a professional
institution are formidable. Many of those who devote time and effort to sit
on its council and committees are natural conservatives, who are keen to
preserve their own positions and the status quo. Radical change is far from
their thoughts.
Moreover, RICS's leader cannot count on the support of the members, as was
demonstrated in 1989 when they voted against a merger between RICS and ISVA,
against the recommendation of the leadership. There are also fierce
rivalries between the various sectors which are all too frequently
preoccupied with promoting their own identity. Many members outside London
also resent some of the Lay report's proposed changes on the grounds that
they would merely benefit large London firms.
The risk of internecine strife within the profession is probably enough to
stymie any decisive action by the RICS. This was indicated this week when
RICS issued a masterfully vague statement about a council meeting on Monday
to discuss the Lay report.
The statement paid lip service to a need to 'change emphasis from a
supply-driven approach to a demand-led stance.' But it side-stepped the real
issues. For instance, it shrugged off the possibility of streamlining the
divisions by stressing 'that the report had not recommended replacing seven
divisions by three . . . ' In fact, the Lay report had drawn exactly that
conclusion, in barely coded language.
The RICS reluctance to take any bold steps will disappoint those who believe
it should give a clear leadership. Such critics suspect that the
organisation's plan to set up committees to examine some of the more
prominent issues may simply be a way to take the heat out of the clamour for
reform. Instead of overhauling its constitution, RICS will probably try and
gradually change its priorities. It would like to devote less time and money
towards supporting an unwieldy, inefficient branch structure. Instead, RISC
wants to direct more resources to addressing those issues gathering a head
of steam within the industry, such as the impact of EC legislation
environmental questions and the proposed changes to lease structures in the
UK.
By putting aside issues such as constitutional reform, RICS may indeed be in
a better position to carve out a more attractive profile for the profession
and property issues in general. (RICS has long been plugging away behind the
scenes at the government's neglect of property matters in general.)
In the meantime, while internal and European issues concentrate the
collective mind of RICS, the onus is very much on individual member firms to
make what headway they can in recessionary times. For many the burden is
heavy. Firms are working at a time of unprecedented cuts in investment and
rent review work.
In any event, surveyors are well aware of the need to broaden their
business, address European markets and sharpen their competitive stance in
the face of increasing rivalry from independent consultants, investment
banks and accountants, which are moving into property work. The enthusiastic
flurry of recent mergers, office openings and associations in continental
Europe at least show that surveying firms are not idle.
It might be an exaggeration to claim surveyors are facing a crisis. But
undoubtedly two characteristics of a crisis - danger and opportunity -
confront the profession today.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Dealers grit their teeth at
lack of progress / A report on the difficulties dogging Italy's new bond
trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Teething troubles with the new government bond dealing system introduced
last month in Italy have left traders fuming. Combined with uncertainties
about the impact of legal changes under the country's new securities law,
hard-won progress could be at risk.
Sluggish price reporting and slow response times are just two of the
complaints levelled at the new system, run by Societa Interbancaria per
l'Automazione (SIA), the bank-owned company which already operates Italy's
computerised money markets.
The new network replaced a Reuters system which underpinned Italy's
screen-based primary dealers system. The new system, heralded as more
flexible and faster than its predecessor, was seen as a further important
step in the continuing modernisation of the bond market.
SIA promised many additional features, especially the extra capacity to
include more primary dealers and far more bonds. Capacity limitations for
the booming bond market had been one of the biggest complaints.
However, the new network, linking the 24 primary dealers which make markets
in a select number of government bonds, has been dogged by technical
problems. Although the number of breakdowns has fallen, price updating
remains slow, especially when volume surges.
Dealers in Milan are now cautiously optimistic that the bugs are being
overcome. 'When it works, it's far superior to what we had before,' says
one. But even after all the problems are resolved, the changeover has
fuelled growing complaints among dealers outside Italy about unfair
competition in securities trading.
The problems with the new network mean traders in London, who should receive
up-to-the minute prices via a data link from SIA to other international data
sources, have found themselves confronted with prices which have been up to
three hours out of date.
'We keep open lines with brokers in Milan, but it's proved a terrible
handicap,' says one dealer. The result has been that foreign demand for
Italian bonds has cooled, while arbitrage based on price differentials
between the cash and futures market, listed on Liffe in London, has dried up
altogether. Innovative instruments and improved trading practices have been
the foundations to the growth of the Italian bond market in the past two
years. Increased demand, particularly from abroad, has in turn allowed the
government to extend the maturity of its debt, and, indirectly, lower
borrowing costs.
So the latest setbacks have rekindled fears that turnover may now decline as
outsiders lose confidence in Italian paper. 'Italy can't afford a situation
in which international investors return to the old pre-conceptions,' says
one London-based trader.
Some non-Italian dealers even see the new dealing system as part of an
ill-concealed campaign to handicap non-Italian banks compared with their
domestic rivals. 'Why couldn't they have run the two systems in parallel to
sort out any problems?' asks one. 'It's clearly one of a number of political
decisions aimed at bringing the market back to Italy.'
Such accusations have struck a chord among foreign investment banks
currently fighting Italy's new securities trading laws, which threaten to
put them at a severe disadvantage compared with domestic counterparts.
The problem has been the law inaugurating the Societa di Intermediazione
Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new breed of securities broking and fund management
institution. As matters stand, it obliges companies trading in Italian
securities with certain types of Italian counterparties to establish a local
Sim.
The new rules, which took effect last month, remain unclear in many
respects, and the requirement to set up a Sim is not being rigorously
enforced. But many foreign houses, especially those which have been
concentrating their trading activities in London, have complained bitterly.
Together, the technical bugs and doubts about the Sims law have dampened
turnover on the bond market this year. Although volume on the primary
dealers system exceeded L8,000bn (Dollars 6.67bn) on Monday - high by local
standards - some dealers say trading would have been much greater but for
foreigners' caution. 'The official turnover figures don't include
international investors outside the dealers' system. They are the ones
staying away,' one trader said.
The clouds over the market have obscured continuing progress on other
fronts. Last month, the government announced the abolition of withholding
tax on interbank deposits. Although the step has little direct effect on
bonds, the move should create greater liquidity in the banking system in
general and consequently increase domestic demand for government paper.
The government has also stuck to its commitment, made last April, to repay
billions of lire in withholding tax due to eligible foreign investors in
Italian bonds. Repayments have been moving smoothly since starting last
September. 'The finance ministry has shown that funds are available,' says
Mr Hendrik van Riel, general manager of J. P. Morgan in Milan.
However, dealers still complain that the system, which provides repayments
within 60-90 days of applications being filed, is too cumbersome. Complex
forms, which can only be compiled manually, make the procedure
time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, important double taxation treaties
with countries like France and Germany, which would simplify repayment
procedures, have not been approved by the Italian parliament.
Doubts also surround the plan, announced last year, to set up a futures and
options market on government bonds. Under the scheme, the new market, which
will not be a physical exchange but a computerised addition to the existing
primary dealers' system, should be operating by the middle of this year.
Some progress has been made. At a meeting last month in Rome, draft
proposals were presented for a clearing and guarantee house - a pillar for
the new market - and much of the legal framework has been defined. Clearing
software is to be provided by ICCH, the London-based clearing organisation,
while a Canadian group, STM, is to provide trading software.
But even domestic dealers are sceptical that a system can be ready by
mid-year. 'There are essential pieces still missing,' says one banker
involved in the talks. 'With Italy's reputation, they can't afford to make
mistakes,' notes another. 'It will have to be super-good from the start.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: EC to raise Ecu490m to fund E
European loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is planning to raise Ecu490m in the international
bond market, probably next week, to fund a series of loans to eastern
European countries.
Mr Antoine Bloch, director of the Commission's funding arm, said in
Luxembourg yesterday that the money will be on-lent to cover balance of
payments deficits in several countries.
The bond issues will be fully fungible (interchangeable) with an outstanding
Ecu250m six-year issue made in December. This fits in with the EC's policy
of adding to existing deals wherever possible to create large, liquid
issues.
The Ecu490m is needed to fund loans agreed in recent weeks, Mr Bloch said.
These include a Ecu150m credit for Romania, agreed in mid-January, and
second tranches of loans already made to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other
EC states. The EC's credits and investments division is forbidden under EC
treaties from raising money until loan agreements are actually signed.
However, the EC is not ready to advance the second tranche of a Ecu400m loan
agreed with Algeria last year, Mr Bloch said. The first tranche was funded
by a Ecu250m bond issue in December.
The balance of the loan will only be disbursed to Algeria if a refinancing
agreement is reached between the country and its commercial bank creditors.
The deadline for the Dollars 1.5bn refinancing package, lead managed by
Credit Lyonnais, has been extended and now expires on February 14.
The EC expects to increase its Ecu borrowing substantially this year. Last
year it raised around Ecu2bn to fund balance of payments loans, rising to
Ecu3.25bn this year.
Around Ecu2bn of this will be raised in public bond markets, Mr Bloch said.
The remaining Ecu1.25bn, to fund food purchases by former Soviet republics,
will be met by bank borrowings, he said.
In addition, the EC expects to increase its lending under the European Coal
and Steel Community to Ecu1.9bn, up from Ecu1.4bn last year and Ecu1bn in
1990. Much of this will be financed in the international bond market.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Bonds: BankAmerica awakens sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 200m issue of floating-rate notes for BankAmerica marked the
reopening of a dormant sector yesterday. The floating-rate note market led
activity in the Eurobond market during the early 1980s. But in 1986, the
perpetual FRN market crashed, burying the perpetual market, and reducing the
flow of other bank floating-rate notes to a mere trickle.
The last FRN for a US bank holding company, once a leading sector of the
market, was a Mellon Bank deal in 1989.
The reopening of the market yesterday reflects the improving credit
performance of some areas of the US banking industry. US banks have been
returning to their domestic fixed-rate bond market, which BankAmerica itself
tapped last week.
Dealers said there is some room in the FRN market for US bank issues, but
demand, mainly from banks, will be very selective.
BankAmerica, which is set to merge with Security Pacific, has been perceived
as an improving credit since its rationalisation, according to traders. A
number of other US banks, still regarded as declining credits, would find it
much harder to access the market.
The notes were considered fairly priced at a discounted margin of 50 basis
points above the London interbank offered rate, according to lead manager
Kidder Peabody.
The deal will also provide a fillip for the secondary market, where bank
FRNs are still traded, though spreads between bid and offer prices have
widened, and the number of market makers has shrunk.
In the Ecu sector, Osterreichische Kontrollbank added Ecu50m to an
outstanding Ecu150m of three-year bonds, via Paribas.
Salomon Brothers was joint lead and Bear Stearns was co-lead manager of
Swiss Bank Corporation's Italy strip transaction earlier this week.

<TEXT>
BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of Portugal's top three commercial
banks, is planning to raise around Es50bn (Dollars 370m) on the
international markets and domestically to build up its international
position and shareholding base, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon.
The plan, which will be presented for approval at the bank's annual
shareholders' meeting in March, envisages the launch of an international
bond issue on the Euromarkets for up to Es30bn, part of which will be in
convertible Ecus, and the launch of a separate issue of 7.5m American
depositary receipts representing BCP shares, and specifically aimed at US
investors.
The third component of the plan involves a capital increase with
incorporation of reserves and a rights issue. The bank's capital is to be
increased by Es11bn through the incorporation of reserves, and by
attributing one free bonus share for every six currently held by
shareholders and through a 6.6m shares rights issue on the basis of one new
share for every 10 held.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in retail stocks moved broadly higher yesterday after a number of
leading US companies reported relatively healthy same-store sales growth
during January.
At K mart, for example, January's same-store sales growth reached 6.2 per
cent, compared with 2.9 per cent for the past three-month period.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman of the general merchandise stores group, said
that sales had been 'quite strong in January', and that low pricing had
bolstered sales of fashion lines.
J. C. Penney, the Dallas-based department stores group, saw sales on the
comparable store basis rise by 7.3 per cent.
Mr William Howell, chairman, commented that performance had been good across
the board, but with the men's and women's divisions leading the way.
Wal-Mart Stores, the fast-expanding discount retailer, saw same-store sales
rose by 13 per cent, while its Sams Wholesale Clubs division saw 8 per cent
growth.
The Gap, the highly successful fashion retailer, reported a 14 per cent
advance in same-store sales for the month, compared with a 6 per cent gain
in the same month a year ago.
At Woolworth, domestic same-store sales growth reached 6 per cent.
However, Mr Harold Sells, Woolworth's chairman, sounded a note of caution:
'January sales increases reflected higher-than-anticipated promotional
activity and clearance mark downs in North American general merchandise
operations, which were necessary to bring inventories into line.
'We remain cautious in our appraisal of world economic conditions going
forward,' he said.
Nevertheless, the New York stock market marked up the share prices in most
of the US retail companies in yesterday's early trading.
Woolworth rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 30, Wal-Mart gained Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 55 5/8 and J. C. Penney rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/2 . The
Gap gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 55 1/8 and K mart was Dollars 1 higher at
Dollars 52.

BANK of Melbourne said it will make a one-for-four rights issue instead of
the convertible preference share issue it announced on January 20, Reuter
reports from Melbourne.
The bank said it believed a rights issue would be in the better interests of
shareholders after the Australian Tax Office cast doubts on the franking of
preference share dividends.
The bank said a prospectus was expected to be released in early March.
Bank of Melbourne shares closed 4 cents firmer at ADollars 4.35. The bank

<TEXT>
IMASCO, the financial services, fast-food, tobacco and retailing group,
posted a sharp increase in profits in the final quarter of 1991.
It lifted net profits to CDollars 94.4m (USDollars 81.3m), or 74 cents a
share, an advance of 60 per cent on the CDollars 59m, or 44 cents, recorded
a year earlier. Revenues rose 2 per cent to CDollars 1.38bn.
The company is 40 per cent controlled by BAT Industries, the UK-based
tobacco group.
For the year, Imasco earned CDollars 331.6m, or Dollars 2.56, up 12 per cent
from CDollars 295.1m, or Dollars 2.25, in 1990. Revenues were CDollars
5.4bn, a rise of 4 per cent.
On a consolidated basis, tobacco products provided 45 per cent of operating
earnings, financial services 37 per cent, retailing 13 per cent and fast
food 5 per cent.
Imasco said the tobacco business had been strong in spite of a sharp
increase in taxes. Share of the domestic cigarette market was up 2 per cent
to 62 per cent.
In spite of bigger loan loss provisions, earnings at Imasco's Canada Trust
arm, where a recent US acquisition made a contribution, were up 4 per cent
to CDollars 209.5m.
The recession hit the US fast-food business, but Imasco hopes new leadership
will reverse the downward trend in earnings.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: FAI Insurances shows signs of
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FAI Insurances, the Sydney-based general insurance group, remained in the
red in the first half to December, but showed signs of recovery from its
ill-fated 1980's investment binge.
The company reduced its net loss in the half to ADollars 17.2m (USDollars
13.2m) from ADollars 31.7m on an 8 per cent revenue slide to ADollars 453.6m
from ADollars 494.4m. The dividend has again been passed, and Mr Rodney
Adler, chief executive, said yesterday there would be no payout until the
group returned to profits.
FAI emerged last year as one of the main sufferers from Australia's
corporate and property collapses with losses of ADollars 219.2m. The company
was particularly exposed to the commercial demise of Perth businessman, Mr
Alan Bond.
But Mr Adler said there had been a significant reduction in the company's
insurance underwriting loss and a marked improvement in operating efficiency
in the latest half.
'The underwriting loss for the half year was ADollars 50m as compared with
ADollars 66m for the previous corresponding half year and ADollars 124m for
the period 1 January to 30 June, 1991,' he said. 'More importantly, we
believe the trend will continue and our budgets indicate that the
underwriting loss for the second half of the year. . . should be lower
again.'
Mr Adler said the group held cash and liquid securities of more than
ADollars 230m at December 31 and had raised more than ADollars 30m from
property sales in the half.
'Unfortunately, the financial environment is still very tough and there
continue to be significant bankruptcies throughout Australia,' he said.
'This has caused us to review all our outstanding loans at the half year end
which has resulted in an increase of ADollars 7.1m in general provision
against these loans.'
Mr Adler said reinsurance rates charged to FAI had risen about 25 per cent
in the past year and insurance premiums would have to rise further.
The result followed a tax credit of ADollars 6.7m against ADollars 15.7m
previously. Interest payments fell to ADollars 14.9m from ADollars 20.6m and
depreciation provision rose to ADollars 12.5m from ADollars 9.3m.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Trans-Natal up 3% at halfway
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS-NATAL, the coal producer in the Gencor group of South Africa, raised
operating income by 3 per cent to R108.4m (Dollars 38.5m) in the first half
to December following increased export volumes and reduced costs.
This represents a stabilisation of the group's performance following the
closure in January 1991 by Escom, the national power utility, of the Camden
and Komati power stations, which were two of Trans-Natal's main customers.
This lead to operating profits dropping to R75m in June 1991 from R105.4m in
December 1990, and sales tonnage dropping to 13.4m tonnes from 14.1m tonnes.
Although coal sold in the first half remained at 13.3m tonnes, the product
mix changed substantially.
Thus sales to Escom dropped by nearly 20 per cent to 4.9m tonnes but sales
to other local users rose 7 per cent to 2.9m tonnes.
Exports, which account for 67 per cent of revenues, rose to 5.5m tonnes from
5.3m tonnes.

<TEXT>
ANGLO-ALPHA, one of South Africa's three leading cement producers, did
better than forecast to record a 3.6 per cent fall in earnings in the year
to December.
Turnover was 4.4 per cent up at R728.2m (Dollars 258.6m), reflecting a fall
in sales volumes of 10 per cent on average across the group. Net operating
income was 19.1 per cent lower at R135.6m. The operating margin dropped to
an all-time low for the group of 18.6 per cent from 24.1 per cent in 1990.
The performance was better than the 5 per cent decline in earnings forecast
at the halfway mark.
The fall in operating income resulted from maintenance costs at the cement
division's Dudfield operation and a substantial one-off rise in depreciation
costs at the stone division.
Net income attributable to shareholders dropped to R58m from R60.2m. The
overall dividend was lifted by 15.2 per cent to 152 cents per share, in line
with group policy of declaring dividends at least in line with inflation.

MACMILLAN Bloedel (Macblo), the Canadian west coast forestry group, has
warned that further belt-tightening measures will be needed following a
record loss last year.
The Vancouver-based company suffered a loss of CDollars 93.4m (USDollars
79.8m), or 98 cents a share, in 1991 compared with 1990 earnings of CDollars
50.8m, or 37 cents. Sales dropped to CDollars 2.73bn from CDollars 3bn.
Prices for all key products, except lumber, fell last year. Earnings were
also hit by the strong Canadian dollar.
The group's pulp mills operated at 76 per cent of capacity and newsprint
mills at 72 per cent.
The loss from the group's North American operations was substantially higher
than the bottom-line figure. Koninklijke Nederlandse Papierfabrieken, the
Dutch fine paper and paperboard maker in which MacMillan Bloedel has a 30
per cent stake, contributed CDollars 47.5m to net equity earnings. Net
equity earnings from all of the group's affiliates totalled CDollars 37.7m.
Mr Bob Findlay, the group's chief executive, said that 'the Canadian
industry and Macblo have never had a tougher year'.
He warned that the company 'still faces complex problems in the next few
years, the most serious of which is that the Canadian industry is no longer
competitive with the US. We must face that fact and deal with it quickly.'
Macblo has already announced the closure of one newsprint machine on
Vancouver Island.

foreign equity issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A HEATED row with strong political overtones is brewing over the future of
Canada's two main airlines.
While Canadian Airlines International is seeking a foreign equity partner as
a possible solution to its financial problems, its arch-rival Air Canada has
launched a public campaign against increased foreign involvement in the
airline industry.
Air Canada, also deep in the red, would prefer a merger of the two airlines.
It has hired one of Canada's most highly regarded lobbyists to press its
case in Ottawa. The carrier this week released a public opinion poll showing
that the vast majority of Canadians would prefer a domestic merger to
greater involvement by a US carrier in the industry.
Canadian Airlines is believed to be negotiating the sale of a 49 per cent
interest to Dallas-based American Airlines. Such a deal would require a
relaxation of foreign ownership rules, which restrict foreigners to a 25 per
cent equity stake in any domestic airline.
The one point of agreement is that the two airlines will not survive in
their present form. Mr Ted Larkin, analyst at Bunting Warburg in Toronto,
estimates Air Canada will suffer a CDollars 30m (USDollars 25m) loss this
year, while Canadian will lose about CDollars 60m. Their combined 1991 loss
is estimated at CDollars 350m.
Critics of a deal between the Canadian carrier and a US airline are
concerned that even a minority stake would give the much larger foreign
carrier effective operational control over Canadian Airlines.
Air Canada would have little choice but to follow a similar route, thus
marking the end of an independent Canadian airline industry. On the other
hand, a merger would create a cumbersome domestic monopoly which might be
forced to lay off thousands of workers.

TEXTRON, the US aerospace and insurance conglomerate, which last month
acquired Cessna Aircraft for Dollars 600m, yesterday announced a 5.8 per
cent increase in 1991 after-tax profits to Dollars 299.5m.
Higher earnings from the group's financial services side offset a reduction
from the commercial products division.
Earnings per share rose to Dollars 3.42 from Dollars 3.18 a year earlier.
The modest income improvement is scored on slightly lower total sales of
Dollars 7.84bn against Dollars 7.92bn in 1990.
In the fourth quarter alone, net profits improved from Dollars 78.1m to
Dollars 83.3m.
Textron acknowledged that its commercial products operations had suffered a
'recessionary decline', principally in the first six months of the year.
These businesses range from automotive parts to industrial fasteners.
Overall, operating profits from this division fell from Dollars 166.5m to
Dollars 137.9m during the year, while sales slipped from Dollars 1.83bn to
Dollars 1.77bn.
Profits from aerospace operations were flat for the year at Dollars 335.5m,
compared with Dollars 331m, but within this division Bell Helicopter
advanced to Dollars 112.7m from Dollars 89.5m.
The best performance came from the financial services operations, which
turned in Dollars 323.7m at the operating level, against Dollars 291.9m.
Total operating income reached Dollars 797.1m, compared with Dollars 789.4m.
Interest charges eased from Dollars 255.9m to Dollars 226.4m.

MITEL, the Canadian telecommunications switching equipment maker 51 per cent

CDollars 107m for the same period in 1990.
Sales are expected to improve in the final quarter.
The nine months' loss was CDollars 13.7m or 17 cents on sales of CDollars
321m, against CDollars 16.1m, or 20 cents, on sales of CDollars 284m last

<TEXT>
WASTE Management, the larg-est US waste disposal company, yesterday reported
a fall in 1991 profits to Dollars 606.3m from Dollars 684.8m a year earlier.
However, the reduction comes after a special after-tax charge of Dollars
181m - which represents the company's estimate of its share of future
liabilities relating to the clean-up of old disposal sites under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Liability and Compensation Act.
The company warned last month that the clean-up charge would be taken in the
fourth quarter, and yesterday its shares gained  1/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 .
It said profits before this extraordinary item increased from Dollars 709.3m
to Dollars 787.3m, on revenues up from Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7.55bn.
In the fourth quarter, Waste Management recorded a profits improvement from
Dollars 195.6m to Dollars 207.5m, again before the special charge.
Earnings per share for the year - which saw Waste Management acquire Wimpey
Waste Management in the UK via a joint venture partnership with Wessex Water
 -fell from Dollars 1.44 to Dollars 1.23, with the special charge accounting
for approximately 37 cents.
The company noted that Chemical Waste Management, its 76 per cent-owned
subsidiary, had already reported lower fourth-quarter earnings and also saw
remedial work slow down as clean-up projects were deferred until this year.
However, it added that Waste Management of North America, Wheelabrator
Technologies, Waste Management International and The Brand Companies - all
owned directly or indirectly by Waste Management - had improved results in
the fourth quarter.

refinancing
</HEADLINE>

   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the UK leisure group, may have to find Pounds 85m to refinance a
maturing Eurobond issue with warrants exercise-able into Forte shares.
Mr Donald Main, Forte's finance director, said the group would finance the
redemption from existing facilities, but plans to return to the bond markets
after the general election, to top up liquidity.
The need to refinance has arisen as a result of the company's weak share
price. Forte's share price is currently languishing 3p below the warrants'
exercise price of 226p.
Unless the share price rallies quickly, the warrants will expire worthless.
If exercised, the warrants would provide Forte with ample funds - Pounds 93m
 -to redeem the bonds.
The Pounds 85m issue of 10 3/4 per cent bonds launched in February 1987,
matures next month. The warrants expire on March 10, but investors normally
have to advise the relevant clearing houses, Euroclear and Cedel, about a
week in advance if they intend to exercise the warrants into shares.
Forte is considering raising around Pounds 150m through an issue of
seven-year bonds, according to Mr Main. The company has not yet decided on a
currency sector, which will depend on market conditions at the time of the
issue.
Forte is also looking at hotel acquisitions in Europe and would consider a
rights issue to fund such acquisi-tions.
The company's current gearing is 44 per cent, with the company forecasting a
slight increase to Pounds 1.3bn by the year-end.

TENNECO, the US conglom-erate undergoing a significant restructuring,
yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 26m as its troubled
JI Case farm equipment business continued to operate heavily in the red.
Mr Michael Walsh, the group's new chief executive, said the first quarter
was likely to continue being difficult, due to lingering recession and
because sales of farm and construction equipment were traditionally weak
during the period.
However, for the year as a whole the chief executive expected significantly
stronger results, because of the restructuring programme and new sources of
revenue, which include income generated by newly completed pipeline
projects.
The fourth-quarter loss, which worked through at 24 cents a share, included
Dollars 65m of pre-tax provisions for claims and litigation. The quarterly
deficit compared with income of Dollars 130m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, in
the same period of 1990.
Revenues dipped from Dollars 3.88bn to Dollars 3.64bn.
For the full year Tenneco reported a net loss of Dollars 732m, or Dollars
6.09 a share, which included Dollars 552m of restructuring charges, compared
with net income of Dollars 561m, or Dollars 4.37, in 1990.
Case, which has been suffering from weak markets for its products and poor
inventory control, had a Dollars 22m operating loss in the fourth quarter,
against income of Dollars 54m in the year-earlier period.
The division said that it expected its restructuring moves to improve
results significantly in 1992.
Tenneco's pipeline operation had stable operating income of Dollars 99m,
compared with Dollars 98m a year ago, but several of its other divisions
also reported lower profits.
Mr Walsh said the company had held its total debt to capital ratio, on an
industrial basis, to 59 per cent at the year-end, compared with 69 per cent
at the end of September, thanks to the restructuring plan. This was just the
beginning of plans to improve its credit posture, he said.

READER'S Digest, the New York based magazine publisher, said the two
non-profit foundations that together control 96.6 per cent of the company's
voting stock are planning to make a public offer of 4.5m of these shares,
reducing their equity stake to 74.8 per cent.
A share listing is being sought on the New York Stock Exchange for the
voting shares, known as class B. The pricing of the share offer, according
to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, will be in relation to the
already traded class A non-voting stock. That would imply the share offer
could raise more than Dollars 200m for the two foundations.
The reason for the offer is that the foundations are required by US tax law
to reduce their ownership of voting stock to a total of no more than 50 per
cent by the year 2000.
Reader's Digest said that after the class B share offer it planned to
repurchase up to 3m shares of class A non-voting stock that is traded on
Wall Street. These shares rose by Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 yesterday.
It also unveiled a 13 per cent increase in net profits for the second
quarter to December 31, to Dollars 62.8m. Revenues were 10 per cent higher
at Dollars 712.4m.

The company attributed the move to the competitive pressures of the 1990s.
It said the cuts would be made over the next few months and expected them to

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT Veicules Industriels (RVI), the truck and van maker run by Renault,
France's state-owned car group and Volvo of Sweden, managed to muster a
modest profit last year despite the depressed state of the US and European
markets.
This represents a return to the black for RVI after making a loss of FFr102m
(Dollars 18.8m) in 1990. The company achieved this despite seeing sales fall
by nearly 7 per cent to FFr27.5m in 1991 from FFr29.65m in the previous
year.
The links between Renault and Volvo, which owns 45 per cent of RVI, recently
came under scrutiny during the controversy over Volvo's plans for a merger
with Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group.
Mr Pierre Colmant, director, said RVI had managed to maintain its European
market share at 11.8 per cent. The number of RVI registrations for trucks
over 5 tonnes fell by 10.9 per cent, slightly more than the European market
as a whole, which slipped by 10.5 per cent to 259,000 units.
In France RVI managed to perform better - or less badly - in sales terms
than the rest of the market. In the US, where the market was more depressed
than in Europe, RVI sold 11,300 models, against 17,000 in the previous year.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: KLM narrows losses to Fl 8.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has substantially narrowed third-quarter losses,
thanks to the combined influence of a higher load factor, lower fuel costs
and improved productivity by its workforce.
The Dutch national carrier said net losses in the quarter, ended December,
1991, fell to just Fl 8.6m (Dollars 4.8m) from Fl 213.9m a year earlier.
Nine-month results showed a net profit of Fl 319.8m against a loss of Fl
129.8m in the same period of 1990/91.
'Taking the highly loss-making winter season in the air transport industry
into account, we maintain our expectation to end-1991-92 with a modestly
positive result,' the airline said.
KLM, which is 38 per cent state-owned, gave no indication of whether it
would restore dividend payments on this year's results, nor did it comment
on the progress of partnership talks with British Airways.
KLM was forced to omit its 1990-91 dividend after falling into heavy losses
caused partly by provisions to cover a cost-cutting and reorganisation
programme.
In the most recent quarter, KLM's revenues rose by 21 per cent to Fl 1.99bn,
outstripping an 8 per cent increase in costs to Fl 1.88bn. Both revenues and
costs were boosted by 6 percentage points by the first-time consolidation of
the charter airline Transavia.
KLM's load factor, excluding the group's charter airline subsidiaries, rose
to 71.7 per cent from 70.9 per cent a year earlier. At the same time, fuel
costs fell by more than 20 per cent and productivity improved by 9 per cent.
At the operating level, results swung into a profit of Fl 114.5m from a loss
of Fl 99.3m a year earlier. However, overall results slipped into the red
because of higher financing costs and because of KLM's share in losses
generated by airlines such as Northwest of the US, in which it holds a
minority stake.
The quarterly figures also include extraordinary gains of Fl 30.6m.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Olivetti registers smaller than
expected loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the troubled Italian computers and office equipment group,
yesterday clarified uncertainties over its 1991 results by reporting a
preliminary loss of around L290bn (Dollars 242.2m).
That is appreciably smaller than the L380bn suggested by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, the company's chairman and controlling shareholder, earlier this
week.
Mr De Benedetti said losses for 1991 would be equivalent to around 4.4 per
cent of last year's group sales of L8,600bn.
Discrepancies arise in the allocation of extraordinary costs stemming from
the company's restructuring plan, announced in late 1991, but only being put
into effect this year.
Olivetti said the L290bn loss included the cost of 7,000 job cuts in 1991,
but excluded any provision for the restructuring announced last November.
The company also revealed that earnings at the operating level had been
around break-even last year.
A final earnings figure for 1991 will depend on how extraordinary expenses
linked to the restructuring plan are allocated between the 1991 and 1992
financial years, a decision that will be taken by Olivetti's board in April.
Olivetti gave no indication of the size of allocation necessary for the
current restructuring programme, which envisages 2,500 job cuts and two
plant closures in Italy, as well as unspecified redundancies and factory
closures abroad.
However, even in the extreme event of all the restructuring costs being
attributed to the 1992 accounts, the L290bn loss is still considerably
higher than analysts had expected before Mr De Benedetti's statement.
Meanwhile, talks were continuing between the company and union leaders on
the restructuring programme and the possibility of closer collaboration
between Olivetti and the public sector.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Swiss bankers hurry to prop up
their image - The way squeezed margins are forcing a radical shake-out in
the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of Swiss banks being as solid as the Matterhorn has taken a bit of
a beating lately, but the country's hyper-sensitive bankers are already
taking steps to prevent any further erosion.
Last October, a sizeable Swiss bank was closed without warning by the Swiss
Federal Banking Commission. Last week, Credit Suisse, the country's third
largest bank, was stripped of its triple A rating by Moody's, the US credit
rating agency. And this week, two regional banks have been rescued by other
banks.
In comparison with the havoc being wrought on the banking sector in some
other countries - notably Japan and the US - this is minor stuff. And no one
familiar with the structure and supervision of Swiss banks would suggest
there is cause for major concern.
But Switzerland is a tiny country with few natural assets. The country's
image as a secure haven for capital has been a major source of economic
growth, so the country's bankers are understandably eager to preserve that
image.
The problems in the Swiss banking sector today are not dissimilar from those
in other industrialised countries. Some banks expanded their loans too
rapidly in the booming 1980s, others spent too much on automating their
processes.
And in the tougher climate of today, these excesses cannot easily be
corrected.
In addition, protectionism and cartels in the Swiss banking sector supported
an excessive number of banks for a long time. There are still over 600 banks
in the country and a shake-out has long been expected.
In the late 1970s, the last time there was a squeeze in the Swiss banking
sector, the big banks eagerly snapped up small banks to expand their retail
networks.
That is not an option today, partly because the big banks are trimming
branches and partly because there was a lot of resentment about their
barging in to local markets. 'We would prefer that local solutions be found
for local problems,' an official of Credit Suisse, the third largest bank,
said.
However, until the forced closure of Spar und Leihkasse Thun last October,
no one noticed the big banks' implicit safety net had developed some big
holes. Since then, bankers have been working overtime to put a new safety
net in place and this week they unveiled a two-layer system designed to
prevent any more forced closures.
First, the Union of Swiss Regional Banks, which represents the smaller local
banks that are in the greatest difficulties, has formed an examining board
to discover problem cases and try to solve them. Union officials say about a
dozen of their 185 member banks are now being examined.
Ideally, another bank will be found to take on the problem bank or its
assets, as in the cases this week of Union Bank of Switzerland rescuing Bank
EvK in the Bern region and Banque de l'Etat de Fribourg taking over Banque
de la Glane et de la Gruyere.
If a problem bank refuses to co-operate, the Federal Banking Commission will
apply pressure. If no bank can be found that is willing to take over the
troubled bank, a working group within the Swiss Bankers Association will
move in to make sure that creditors are protected as far as possible.

<TEXT>
AMEV, the Dutch insurer, has sold a 5 per cent stake in Grolsch, the
Netherlands' second-largest brewer, to an unidentified buyer through a
transaction carried out on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
It sold the shares on Monday for Fl 179.00 (Dollars 100) each, one guilder
below the price prevailing on the bourse that day. According to the bourse's
official price gazette, the shares were then sold on to an undisclosed buyer
for Fl 179.50. Yesterday, Grolsch closed Fl 1.50 higher at Fl 182.50. Amev
said the sale was not connected to Grolsch's agreement on buying Ruddles,
the UK brewery, from Courage, a subsidiary of Australia's Fosters Brewing.
Whenever they invest in domestic companies, big Dutch institutional
investors tend to hold at least 5 per cent of the capital in order to
qualify for tax breaks. Under new Dutch legislation which took effect this
month, investors must inform publicly quoted Dutch companies whenever their
shareholdings rise or fall below the 5, 10, 25, 50 and 66 2/3 per cent
barriers. Among Grolsch's biggest shareholders are members of the founding
Groen family, who own around 40 per cent of the capital. The company has
said around 25 per cent of its shares are held by UK institutional
investors.

HAFSLUND Nycomed, Norway's second largest stock market listed company after
Norsk Hydro, yesterday announced record profits and an increased dividend,
plus plans to spin off its shipping operations into an independent company.
The dividend is being lifted from NKr1.75 to NKr2.50 a share. Hafslund also
plans to boost share capital by an estimated Dollars 100m, by issuing new
class-B shares.
The group, best known for its radiology products, improved pre-tax profits
by 26 per cent to NKr1.31bn (Dollars 211m) for 1991.
Hafslund Transport, the shipping division, is to be de-merged through an
offer to existing shareholders. The shipping operation, to be renamed
Actinor Shipping, comprises 13 ships and a 50 per cent shareholding in an
offshore accommodation rig. It has a combined book value of NKr2.6bn.
Hafslund said that, for the time being, it would retain a 25 per cent share
in Actinor Shipping and underwrite a limited portion of its debt, to ensure
satisfactory loan terms.
Shareholders in Hafslund Nycomed will receive one share in Actinor for every
200 shares in Hafslund Nycomed, resulting in a split of the new shares.
Also, the company will seek to increase share capital by up to 4.5m class-B
shares (corresponding to 2.9m old shares), to be used for a possible share
offering in connection with aNew York share listing.

<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, yesterday bought its domestic TV set
competitor Finlux in a complicated FM205m (Dollars 47.6m) deal that also
affects Nokia's ownership structure.
Nokia will finance the Finlux deal by buying out the 8.5 per cent stake held
in Nokia by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the troubled Finnish bank, for FM542m
and use some of those shares as payment for Finlux, which is now owned by
Metra, an engineering group.
Metra will consequently gain a 3 per cent stake in Nokia, whose dominant
shareholders are the Union Bank of Finland and the insurer Pohjola, with
shareholdings of 12.8 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively.
The purchase of Finlux, which has annual sales of FM600m, will consolidate
Nokia's position as a producer of televisions in its home Nordic market.
Nokia, which is Europe's third largest maker of televisions, also announced
yesterday a reorganisation of its ailing consumer electronics division by
concentrating television manufacturing at factories in Finland and Bochum,
Germany.
A TV plant in Chartres, France will be closed.

trading results'

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON, the US securities house reeling from a bond trading scandal,
yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 29m, due to
disappointing securities trading results and a one-time charge at its oil
subsidiary, Phibro Energy.
The figures contrasted with the strong profits increasingly reported by many
Wall Street businesses, but were in line with a warning the firm gave in
January, when it said it expected to report a Dollars 30m loss.
The final sum produced a loss of 41 cents a share and compared with a loss
of Dollars 15m, or 28 cents, a year ago. Salomon Brothers, the firm's
securities house, made pre-tax profits of only Dollars 27m in the quarter,
against a Dollars 90m loss a year ago.
The company said the 'disappointing results' in each quarter were
attributable 'primarily to lower revenues from trading activities'.
Wall Street analysts said the figures appeared to reflect in part the
continuing impact of last year's Treasury market scandal, which forced
Salomon to shed Dollars 50bn in assets and led to the temporary loss of some
leading clients.
The firm is also going through a restructuring which has led to significant
redundancies and the poaching of leading analysts and traders by rivals.
Salomon declined to elaborate on the securities trading figures, although it
has often stressed the volatile nature of its quarterly figures. For the
full year Salomon Brothers reported pre-tax income of Dollars 1bn, up from
Dollars 416m, with profitable trading results across all leading products.
The increase was due mainly to strong revenues from arbitrage and
derivatives and fixed income securities trading.
Salomon reported net income of Dollars 507m, or Dollars 3.90, up from
Dollars 303m, or Dollars 2.08, in 1990, after taking a Dollars 200m
third-quarter charge to cover potential costs from the Treasury scandal. In
1990 it reported Dollars 323m of special charges.
Its Phibro Energy unit recorded a fourth-quarter pre-tax loss of Dollars
60m, against profits of Dollars 62m. For the full year it lost Dollars 34m,
compared with 1990 earnings of Dollars 492m.

RECEIVERS HAVE been appointed to Forwell Group, the USM-quoted design and
technical services company.
Lloyds Bank has appointed Mr Timothy Harris and Mr Christopher Hughes of
Cork Gully as administrative receivers to Forwell Design and Contracts and
Ferndale Contracts.
Forwell had a short career on the USM. It came to that market via a placing
at 62p per share in July 1989 which valued the company at Pounds 9.15m. The
shares were suspended at 3p on January 31.
In 1989 the group made a pre-tax profit of more than Pounds 1m but the
following year was forced to pass its final dividend after losses of Pounds
1.03m.
In the six months to June 30 1991 the group returned to the black and bank
borrowings were reduced by more than Pounds 1.5m; at the 1991 year-end bank
indebtedness was about Pounds 1.4m.
Mr Michael Wheller, chairman and chief executive, said he hoped to put out a
statement shortly. He said that the group needed just Pounds 600,000 of
working capital and that a company doctor, who would have been appointed
executive chairman, had joined the group.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Asil Nadir fails to get civil action
suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International, the fresh fruit
and electronics conglomerate which went into administration in October 1991,
yesterday failed in the High Court to get a Pounds 378m civil action
suspended while he faces criminal charges.
The action was launched in October against Mr Nadir and six other defendants
by Mr Christopher Morris, of Touche Ross, one of Polly Peck's three
administrators.
Mr Justice Knox rejected the claim that Mr Nadir might risk prejudicing his
defence in the criminal action by giving evidence in the civil case, but he
ordered that future hearings in which Mr Nadir is involved should be heard
in camera until the criminal case comes to trial. He also asked for the
plaintiff of the civil action to given undertakings for Mr Nadir's
protection.
The civil case is unlikely to come to trial before the criminal action is
heard in the Crown Court, at a date expected to be after January of next
year, Mr Justice Knox said.
The plaintiff may not divulge information received in evidence from Mr Nadir
to third parties, though it can be passed to the other Polly Peck
administrators, Mr Michael Jordan, of Cork Gulley, and Mr Richard Stone, of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte - provided they respect its confidentiality.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mr Nadir recently lost his home at Alford
Street in the West End of London because of the bankruptcy action against
him and has moved to a relative's home.
He is due to appear at Bow Street Magistrates' court on Tuesday on 72 theft
charges and four of false accounting, involving Pounds 155m of company
funds, when it is expected that arrangements to transfer his case to the
crown court will be announced.
Mr Nadir also faces proceedings in the High Court on February 24 from his
personal creditors.
They are seeking to have him committed to prison for contempt of court by
breaking his undertakings to them.

SelecTV, the USM-quoted independent producer of television programmes,
doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 178,000 in the six
months to September 30.
Mr Michael Buckley, chairman, said the most significant factor was the award

However, SelecTV limited its investment to 15 per cent in order to retain
indepen-dent producer status for the BBC.
The company will be the sole supplier of comedy and comedy/drama programmes
for the Meridian franchise which will lead to more programmes being produced
for the ITV network, Mr Buckley said.
Turnover rose to Pounds 5.43m (Pounds 4.26m), with operating profit working
through at Pounds 173,000 (Pounds 87,000).
Earnings per share came to 0.16p (0.13p).

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Benson financing for acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENSON GROUP, the engineering company, plans to strengthen its components
and heating businesses with two acquisitions worth a total of Pounds 6.68m.
The group will finance the purchases by raising Pounds 6.65m after expenses
through a placing of 53.8m new shares and an open offer.
Noble Grossart, the merchant bank, will place the new shares at 13p.
Existing shareholders will be offered three new shares for every four held.
Mr Richard Phillips, who took over as executive chairman in 1990 and has
since returned the company to profitability through disposals and reduced
borrowings, said the purchases fitted with the group's existing businesses
and its plans for Europe.
Benson will pay Pounds 4.26m for three West Midlands-based engineering
businesses owned by Thama Holdings. It will also pay Pounds 2.42m for
Pakaway Perrymatics, a manufacturer of heaters and boilers based near
Brighton.
The group also announced sharply increased pre-tax profits of Pounds 225,000
for the six months to end-November, compared to Pounds 35,000 in the same
period a year earlier. Earnings per share emerged at 0.39p (0.07p). The
company intends to pay a final dividend of not less than 0.1p for the
current year to end-May, the first distribution since January 1990.
The improved results reflected better margins and a lower interest charge.
Following a Pounds 2.2m rights issue last July, it has paid off all bank
borrowings.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Senior pays Dollars 40m for US group - Tube
and hose acquisition funded by Pounds 26.6m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Engineering Group is to pay Dollars 40m (Pounds 22.1m) for Flexonics,
a leading US manufacturer of flexible tube and metal hose, expansion joints
and bellows.
Mr Don McFarlane, managing director, said the purchase would make Senior a
leading international force in one of its business areas.
Senior, which specialises in ductwork, heat treatment and tubes, is funding
the acquisition by a 1-for-4 rights issue at 58p per share, which will raise
Pounds 26.6m. Senior's shares closed 2 1/2 p down at 69 1/2 p.
The group, which has been sheltered from the downturn in the engineering
sector by supplying ducting to big construction projects such as Sizewell
power station, is also maintaining its record of resisting recession.
It yesterday forecast that pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 would
increase by 13 per cent to Pounds 18.1m, with earnings per share up by 6.6
per cent to 6.5p (6.1p).
The group said it did not have a significant presence in the US flexible
hose and expansion joint business, so Flexonics would be a good fit with its
existing plants in Europe and the Far East.
Flexonics, a private company with headquarters at Bartlett, near Chicago,
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m on turnover of Pounds 28.5m in the nine
months to end-November.
Despite the recession in the US, it continued to operate at a satisfactory
level, and was not expected to dilute the enlarged group's earnings.
Senior intends to keep all the key operating management within Flexonics, In
particular, Mr Stephen Perkins had signed a new contract as president of
Flexonics, which employs 650 people, all of them in North America. Mr
Perkins will now oversee of all of Senior's flexible hose businesses
worldwide.
Mr McFarlane will take over as chairman from Professor Sir Roland Smith, who
said last year that he would step down in May.
Mr McFarlane will be succeeded as group managing director by Mr John Bell,
who has been chief executive of engineering products for several years.
Senior forecast that it would recommend a final dividend of 1.95p (1.78p),
giving a total for the year of 3.15p (2.86p), an increase of 10 per cent.
The rights issue is underwritten by Schroders, with Hoare Govett and Albert
E Sharp as brokers.
COMMENT
The need to forecast profits for yesterday's cash call meant that Senior is
one of the first engineering companies to report on calendar 1991, but it is
already a safe bet that few other will do as well in the forthcoming results
season. Senior still gets lumbered with labels such as solid and
respectable, which seems unfair to a company which has doubled its share
price in the last year. Although the market now feels gloom about
engineering was overdone, the very elements about Senior which kept earnings
up during recession may now prevent it being seen as recovery stock.
Construction services, which provides ducting to big infrastructure
projects, seems to have had a record year. The US acquisition looks
shrewdly-judged, and positions the engineered products division to benefit
from any upturn. Forecast profits of Pounds 22.5m next year put the shares
on a multiple of about 10, which still seems undemanding for a company with
no gearing and a solid track record.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Depressed demand and lower margins behind
tumble at P&amp;P
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;P, one of the largest distributors of personal computers in the UK, saw
profits nosedive last year as the recession depressed customer demand and
intense price-cutting in the industry affected margins.
Despite an increase in turnover to Pounds 228.3m (Pounds 223.8m) pre-tax
profits in the year to November 30 1991 fell from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds
711,000.
Mr David Southworth, managing director, said the group had been caught by a
larger than expected fall in revenue from product sales at a time while it
was still investing to build up higher margin computer services business.
The decline was signposted by a profits warning last October. The shares
yesterday rose 5p to 44p.
An unchanged final dividend of 3p is declared; after the increased interim
this raises the total to 4.33p (4.25p). Earnings fell to 0.9p (18.5p).
UK corporate sales dropped substantially during the year.
Customers cut back investment in computers because of the recession and
intense price competition between manufacturers, which led to the average
price of PCs falling 40 to 50 per cent. Cuts of that magnitude led customers
to put off investment decisions in expectation of further reductions.
Against this backdrop, P&amp;P found itself with continuing high overheads as it
built up its services side.
Net operating expenses surged to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 27.9m), of which
personnel costs, including redundancies, accounted for Pounds 6.8m and bad
debt and stock provisions Pounds 3.1m.
The group was comfortable with its decision to invest in the computer
services business from a strategic point of view.
Faced with a wide variety of choices in complicated and costly information
technology systems, consumers were increasingly dependent on advice from
third parties such as P&amp;P. Its ability to provide that service had won it
loyal customers.
But from a profits point of view, customers seeking advice were still
unwilling to pay for that advice.
Mr Southworth expected the trend to increase and while P&amp;P had to offer many
services free in the past, 'we're now in a scenario where nothing is free.'
COMMENT
The PC market will continue to be difficult and product margins are not
likely to return to their former levels. The question is how long P&amp;P will
have to wait before generating the kind of returns it is looking for and
whether it can keep from falling seriously into loss before that happens.
The timing of a UK recovery is anyone's guess. That said, however, a
recovery will come, if not this year then the next, and P&amp;P is probably
better placed than others to withstand prolonged turbulence thanks to the
proceeds of its rights issue. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m give a
prospective multiple of 10, which is perhaps undemanding given the comfort
of nearly Pounds 10m net cash and the group's reputation in the sector which
strengthens its recovery potential.

brewer
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURAGE will begin distributing beer in the UK for Asahi, the Japanese
brewer, in April.
Asahi has a 20 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing of Australia, Courage's
parent company.
The Japanese brewer at present exports only a few thousand bottles of beer a
year to the UK, mainly to Japanese restaurants in the London area.
Asahi will ship its Super Dry brand and expects to sell some 3m bottles
during the next 12 months through Courage's national distribution net-work.
If it achieves its sales targets, Asahi said it hoped to switch to local
production under licence by Courage.
Courage already distributes Molson Dry for the Canadian brewer, part-owned
by Foster's. Its lager portfolio also includes Budweiser, Miller,
Kronenbourg, Holsten, and Carlsberg in some trade sectors.

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Merrett falls 54% but holds dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERRETT Holdings, the Lloyd's underwriting agent and insurance services
group, yesterday reported a 54 per cent fall to Pounds 3.21m in pre-tax
profits for the year to September 30.
Earnings per share were 10.25p (20.28p) but the dividend is unchanged at
6.25p.
The result largely reflected the recent depression in the London insurance
market, where Merrett manages insurance syndicates at Lloyd's of London, and
increased costs, especially in the development of its loss adjusting
activities.
Total revenues rose to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 22.3m), with income from
insurance services increasing to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 11.5m). UK loss
adjusting activities expanded strongly despite better weather conditions
which contributed to an increase in the volume of claims handled in 1990.
Profit commissions paid by Names - the individuals whose capital backs the
market's underwriting - fell to Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 6.34m), reflecting the
downturn at Lloyd's in 1988, when the market as whole recorded a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 510m.
Income from agency salaries rose to Pounds 5.01m (Pounds 4.78m).

FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Dawson Intl restructures for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAWSON International, the UK's fourth biggest textiles company, is
restructuring its businesses to prepare for further launches of its US-made
goods into European and Japanese markets.
In a radical change for the group, primarily known for its Pringle and
Ballantyne knitwear brands, a structure based on geographical division
between the US and elsewhere is being replaced by exploitation of its
brands.
'This will allow us to learn from best practice around the company. Before,
we were like little boxes,' said Mr Ronald Miller, executive chairman.
No job losses will be involved in the changes, he said. Earnings per share
should be improved through greater motivation of staff.
'Some brands were small and we were spreading our resources too thinly',
said Mr Miller.
The moves are accompanied by a board reshuffle that reduces the number of
executive directors from six to three.
Mr Nick Kuenssberg, who joined the company from Coats Viyella in September
1991, moves from chief executive UK to run the Premier Brands unit, covering
yarns, fabrics and the woollen brands.
Mr Philip Kemp, formerly chief executive US, will run consumer products,
mostly sports clothing. Ms Ann Burdus, director, communications and
marketing, Olympia and York Canary Wharf, joins as a non-executive director.
Dawson's products have historically divided by brand. US-made goods have
been sold almost entirely domestically. Many are sports clothes often using
cotton or polyester fabrics and are a far cry from Dawson's UK-manufactured
woollens and cashmeres.
The US has become increasingly profitable for the company: some 60 per cent
of Dawson's Pounds 28m annual profit last year came from the US.
'The US is now well established in organisational structure and people.
Philip Kemp is now able to spend more time in Europe and Japan,' said Mr
Miller.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Chairman beset by doubts and dividends: The decisions facing
BP's Robert Horton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Horton, chairman of British Petroleum, is not the sort of man to bow
easily to City pressure. But a combination of a weak oil market, a falling
share price and a deterioration in the company's financial situation is
forcing him into a corner.
He will have to take stringent cost-cutting measures and defer strategic
investment if he is to convince investors the company can make a profit at
current oil prices.
He is not being helped by persistent City rumours of disagreements in the BP
boardroom - a rumour strongly denied this week by two of the company's
non-executive directors. 'I am not aware of any dissension on the board
whatsoever,' said one.
BP's share price has suffered in recent weeks from speculation over its poor
financial performance, which is likely to be reinforced next Thursday when
the company reports 1991 earnings well down on the previous year. The share
price closed yesterday down 2 1/2 p to 276p.
Mr Horton must also cope with personal unpopularity - among institutional
investors who dislike his abrasive manner, and among BP employees fearful
for their jobs.
The disaffection has even spread to BP's exploration department,
traditionally the core of the organisation.
Mr Horton's internal unpopularity stems in part from the way he is seen as
personally associated with recent redundancies. He instituted the Project 90
reorganisation, aimed at changing BP's corporate culture - and like all
reorganisations, it has left some people very unhappy.
Another factor is outside his control: his two years at the top of the
company have been ones of extremely unstable oil prices. Mr Horton's tenure
from March 1990 has seen oil prices as high as Dollars 40 a barrel during
the Gulf crisis and as low as Dollars 18 a barrel today.
Some at the company blame the current mood on the reorganisation, which was
designed to remove layers of bureaucracy from the decision-making process.
This makes the company more responsive to market conditions and quicker to
react with job cuts and cost-cutting than its competitors.
On the other hand, it is felt in BP's operating divisions that they have had
to bear the brunt of the cost cuts, while fat remains at the centre. Critics
say that the new structure has isolated top management from other employees
and that the company lacks firm direction.
The company's decision earlier this week to classify its nutrition division
as a non-core asset underlines the lack of direction, they say. Mr Horton
had declared his commitment to the agricultural interests when he took over
two years' ago.
In the short term, the City's fears are concentrated on BP's policy of
raising its dividend in line with the rate of inflation. When it announces
its results next week, BP would have to announce a 0.2p increase in the
fourth quarter dividend to keep to the policy, say institutional investors.
Anything short of that would be seen in the City as backtracking, they say.
And because the fourth quarter's dividend sets the pattern for the coming
year at BP, a decision simply to maintain the current rate - though enough,
on some calculations of inflation, to allow BP to say it had met its policy
 -would be badly received.
In fact, as Mr Nick Antill at Hoare Govett, the London-based broker, points
out, it would not cost much for BP to raise the dividend. To increase it to
4.3p would cost Pounds 5.5m, a small cost for a company with total cashflow
of Pounds 3bn. Cash is not the only point at issue, however: profits are
expected barely to cover the 1991 dividend, at best, and may well not cover
the 1992 payout. It is this point that lies behind the rumours of
disagreements on the board.
The company said yesterday, however: 'There is absolutely no substance
whatsoever in all these rumours we've heard about rifts on the board over
policy or dividends.
'The dividend policy remains to keep up with inflation. That policy has not
changed and cutting the dividend is not part of the policy,' the company
said.
Beyond the dividend, shareholders are questioning the company's longer term
strategy. 'They've never been able to demonstrate that they can do anything
but find oil,' said one. BP's emphasis on exploration and drilling, he said,
made it too vulnerable to swings in commodities prices and unable to
withstand downturns in oil prices.
Mr Antill said: 'Everyone is looking at the earnings cover of the dividend,
but they ought to be looking at the investment policy of the last few years
which has been based on an over-optimistic estimate of the oil price and
those investments are not making a profit.'
Faced with an expected decline in its oil production in the mid-1980s, BP
began to buy assets to boost output as well as financing an ambitious
exploration programme. But several City analysts argue that these schemes
were based on an oil price closer to Dollars 21 a barrel than where it is
now - at Dollars 18 a barrel.
BP is more broadly exposed to swings in the oil price than many of its
competitors and it has based its strategy around a much higher oil price
later this decade.
This week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Horton urged
countries from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to
cut production by at least 1m barrels a day at their meeting next week. He
said this could boost oil prices closer to the Opec target price of Dollars
21 a barrel.
Such a price rise is unlikely, however; that Mr Horton should advocate it in
such a public way underlines the pressure the company is feeling from low
oil prices.
For all the rumours, Mr Horton's position within the company seems secure.
There are no signs that shareholders want a management change.
Institutional investors say Mr Horton is an effective manager who deserves
the credit for reorganising decision-making to create a more effective
company, at the risk of undermining his own authority in the process.
And, as one senior employee said yesterday: 'Horton has to make some harsh
decisions. Whoever applies the pain is not going to be popular.'

FT  07 FEB 92 / Letter: American Airlines' argument for free market on
transatlantic route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ARNOLD GROSSMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Readers should be astonished at the article 'A Call to Protect British
Airways from US Competitors' (January 17) in which Charles Leadbeater
reports that the Commons Transport Committee has concluded that 'British
Airways should be protected from increasing competition from US airlines in
Europe until the US aviation market is opened up to foreign carriers.'
US airlines only have a 46 per cent share of transatlantic passengers, and
47.5 per cent of the US-UK passengers. UK carriers have far better access to
the US that US carriers have to the UK. The air service agreement between
the US and the UK allows UK carriers to serve 88 city-pair markets compared
with 47 for US airlines. And frequency controls prevent added service on
existing routes like Chicago-Manchester.
British Airways effectively serves the US from 67 non-stop destinations
behind London Heathrow Airport with a total population of 97.4m - all
potential passengers to the US. By contrast, Delta's Atlanta 'mega-hub'
serves only 50.7m, America's Chicago hub 37.1m and United's Washington hub
23.0m. And the hubs all compete for traffic from many of the same cities.
On average, US carriers provide connections to London from 77 destinations,
including many small cities served by commuter airline partners with little
transatlantic traffic potential.
In 'A Manifesto for Civil Aviation in the 1990s', British Airways observed
that liberal aviation agreements 'increase the number of airlines, frequency
of flights and the seat capacity available on routes within Europe. To say
nothing of the value of money enjoyed by passengers'.
If liberal aviation agreements are so beneficial in Europe, why are they a
liability in the transatlantic marketplace? It is demonstrable that traffic
growth between the US and liberal European countries - France, Germany and
Switzerland - significantly exceeded passenger growth to the UK. Had
transatlantic traffic to the UK increased like that to France, Germany and
Switzerland, 700,000 additional US visitors would have spent approximately
Pounds 965m in the UK
If there is a competitive advantage in the US-UK market, it rests with UK
airlines. When the UK embraces free market practices in its aviation
relationship with the US, the resulting competition will discipline the air
travel market and produce economic prosperity and real value for consumers.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Letter: Presidential election no inhibitor of Uruguay Round
progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HARRY L FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You quote (World Trade News, February 5) EC vice-president Franz
Andriessen as saying that if the Uruguay Round of the Gatt is not concluded
by around Easter, nothing more can happen in 1992 because of the US
presidential election and 'its heavy stress on isolationism and economic
nationalism will thereafter close that window for the remainder of 1992'.
Mr Andriessen, being the gentleman that he is, conveniently uses the US
elections as an inhibitor. Perhaps he should look at election uncertainties
closer to home as a cause of the lack of real progress in the Uruguay Round.
Last week, the French Socialists lost six important by-elections; this might
inhibit President Mitterrand from relaxing his position on agricultural
subsidy reform. The Italian election is set for April 5, and your report is
that the parties in power are pretty shaky. Of course, there is the
approaching election in Britain where the polls see-saw virtually daily.
Ireland's prime minister just fell. Chancellor Kohl's party seems to be
having some problems. And so forth in the EC.
Beyond the EC, Canada's prime minister's standing is low in the polls.
Australia's prime minister has changed, and there are rumours circulating
concerning a possible shortened term for the Japanese prime minister. And so
forth around the world.
Hence, laying a possible delay wholly on US elections (and, incidentally,
the congressional elections should be more of a concern than the
presidential election) may be convenient for EC commissioners, but such
inaccurate finger pointing is not all that helpful in dealing with the real
problems of the Uruguay Round. From an American viewpoint, more leadership
from the EC and Japan would be welcome.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Letter: Union leader reasserts view of UK traditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEN GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report ('Union leaders admit upsetting Japanese', February 3) on
the recent visit of a small group of TUC leaders to Japan shows that at
least one TUC resolution is helping to influence the world - would that
there were more] The fact that Japanese business leaders want to talk more
about the British TUC's policy is cheering to those who experience the cold
shoulder from their British counterparts.
Your report is wrong to indicate that the suggested talks between the
Japanese CBI and the British TUC were on the initiative of the TUC. The
initiative came from the Japanese who are worried about their international
image and concerned to protect their profitable investments in Britain. I
hope that something comes out of these discussions to protect the interests
of British employees from alien practices such as no-strike deals and
employer imposed choice of union.
Much has been written about alleged insults during that TUC debate. As the
resolution's instigator, my union was anxious to show that the practices
described above are contrary to British traditions. They also offend the
principles laid down by the International Labour Office for the
international community on the rights of association and the right to
strike. We have been accused of being racist in the use of the word 'alien';
reference to any decent dictionary will show the word, when used as an
adjective, perfectly sums up this complex set of ideas. Only those weaned on
comics and 'B'-feature science fiction films make the mistake of accusing us
of insulting the Japanese people.
Mind you, the statement made by the Japanese prime minister, a man with
little experience of manual labour, about the lack of the work ethic in the
US makes you wonder.
Must we look forward to a working life of long hours, company controlled
unions, unquestioning loyalty to the boss, and unrestrained discrimination
against women workers? Or is there an alternative based on the dignity of
labour, which flows from democratic rights and strong independent trade
unions at work? This is what the debate is really about.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Back into the public arena: A potential new role for Paul
Volcker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surest signs that Mr Paul Volcker wants to accept an advisory job with
President Boris Yeltsin as soon as his role can be defined are both positive
and negative. The positive sign is simply that he is who he is. He has spent
most of his life in public service - US Treasury, New York Fed and finally
Federal Reserve chairman - always a workaholic, always miserably paid
compared with those with whom he did business. In a word, committed.
The first thing he did after accepting his investment banking chairmanship,
at enough pay to make up for many of the lost years, was to take on an
unpaid job heading a commission arguing for better terms for US public
servants. The report was hardly a best-seller, though, and after five years
of high pay but low profile, the offer of a post of real international
importance must be irresistible.
The negative sign: he did not mention the invitation to his New York
partner, Mr James Wolfensohn, when he landed in New York from his flying
visit to Moscow. The two spent the evening discussing Russian problems -
'You name it, and they've got it,' as Mr Volcker summarises the mess - but
still no mention of any personal involvement. The discretion learned as a
public servant is still an almost Pavlovian response to anything important.
If Mr Volcker did not take the offer seriously, he would have talked about
it, at least to his partner.
However, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, a leading Yeltsin adviser, has the more
gossipy habits common on university campuses. So yesterday Mr Volcker was
prepared to admit that he had been approached, to be warmly non-committal
about it - and somewhat amused. 'You know I was only there as an extension
to a European trip - just 36 hours to see for myself, and look up some old
friends. And now this. The first thing I mean to do is to go back there -
and for at least two days.'
These could be quite a difficult two days. It is clear that Moscow badly
wants Mr Volcker's name on the masthead - he is the nearest human symbol,
thanks to his financial austerity, to an actual IMF endorsement - as soon as
possible; but Mr Volcker himself is not interested in being a symbol. He is
determined to get a job description where he can be sure to be useful (which
is a case of embarras de richesse), and which he can manage in the time left
between Wall Street and Princeton university (where he is a professor for
half his time), which is harder. He will certainly have to find time for
some residence in Moscow, though the Russians might be almost as happy if he
spent most of his time on the telephone in New York to his contacts in
government.
The useful paradox is that his five years in the private sector have made Mr
Volcker much more clubbable, without in any way smudging his Caesar's-wife
intellectual reputation - quite a feat in the Wall Street of recent years.
He has lost the habit of talking in Sphinx-like riddles, which he thought
appropriate as Fed chairman, and is a frequent and surprisingly witty
conference performer.
In one respect his reputation is as forbidding as ever - he likes his own
way, and is not an easy man to work with, unlike his very collegiate
successor at the Fed, Mr Alan Greenspan. He left some bruised egos in the C
street block where the Fed's policymakers also hope to make some sort of a
public splash. In Moscow, where most of those he is likely to work with have
everything to learn about the outside world and its markets, this is not
likely to matter in the least. Mohammed will not only come to the mountain,
but happily camp out on its lower slopes.
Mr Volcker may even get something of a feeling of deja vu as he considers
the problems of a government with a seemingly bottomless deficit, only
partly restrained by a much more businesslike and independent minded central
bank, and those of negotiating debt rescheduling. He did all this as Fed
chairman. But his experience in the US Treasury (which manages US government
funding and foreign exchange) and in the New York Fed (which monitors the
markets and imposes prudential rules) is likely to be at least as relevant
to a Russia striving to invent, as it were, a capitalist past.
Mr Volcker has become such a lofty figure of monetary rectitude that it is
easy to forget that like everyone who has ever done the New York job
effectively, he is an operator and a negotiator. He may yet be able in the
right circumstances to do for Russia what his New York predecessor Mr
Charlie Coombs once did for Britain - buy vital time at wholesale prices.
Time, among other things, to try to implement any advice he offers.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Leading Article: How to grab the EC money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S attempt to place itself 'at the heart of Europe' is falling foul
of a severe case of clogged arteries. The European Commission is threatening
to withhold funds for hard-hit industrial areas unless the Treasury comes up
with more transparent accounting procedures for regional spending. The
long-running row has already held up Pounds 100m earmarked for depressed
coal-mining areas, with a further Pounds 900m potentially blocked.
The sums form a sizeable component of the money the UK is entitled to
receive from Brussels to reduce its considerable net contribution to the
Community. Since the dispute has already intruded into the general election
campaign, the government has every incentive to get itself off this
particular EC spending hook as quickly as possible.
At one level, the wrangling is about whether the UK Treasury needs any
advice from Brussels on where to direct British public spending. This is
not, however, an argument about the Commission intervening in every 'nook
and cranny' of British life. The Treasury is being asked, after all, to
adapt its public spending regime to conform with EC regulations on good
budgetary housekeeping, to which Britain gave its assent in 1988.
Greater control
More fundamentally, the disagreement raises the question of whether the
highly-centralised British system for distributing public-sector funds
really serves the country's best interests. There are good arguments in
favour of Britain's giving local councils greater control over raising the
resources which they are responsible for distributing. This would allow them
to forge constructive links with Brussels, under guidelines worked out with
Whitehall, to gain maximum advantage from the single market. Excessive
British centralisation runs counter to developments in other more successful
EC countries, above all Germany.
In the short term, the issue is whether the Treasury can prove to the
satisfaction of the Commission that EC regional funding adds to money which
would have been spent anyway. The Commission says that this 'additionality'
principle is necessary to ensure that aid is channelled towards genuinely
eligible regions, rather than simply used to reimburse spending which would
otherwise be financed domestically. Britain has always agreed with the
argument in theory. But it claims that identifying the supplementary nature
of funding on a project-by-project basis raises intractable difficulties for
control of public spending.
Pedantic rules
Britain may have a case in pointing out that the Commission's pedantic
spending rules are more applicable to countries such as Italy or Greece with
less developed internal financial procedures. But this argument misses the
main point: Britain is failing to avail itself of resources available under
a scheme originally set up, at least in part, to defray the costs of
Britain's EC membership.
The Department of the Environment has put forward several possible
solutions. The simplest - redefining public spending planning totals to
exclude Regional Development Fund grants - may prove too radical for the
Treasury. The government should still be able to provide a spending
breakdown which would satisfy most of the Commission's requirements - even
though this might require reallocation of funds among other British regional
programmes.
Yesterday's news that the EC has cleared Pounds 18m in aid to Northern
Ireland appears encouraging. The Commission says that the particular system
for allocating funds in the province provides the necessary 'transparency' -
raising the question of why the Treasury cannot adopt such a system for the
rest of the UK. Failure to end the impasse would cause hardship and
disillusionment in the local authorities involved. More widely, it would be
a setback for Britain's overall commitment to get value for money from the
EC. A country which has laboured for years to achieve greater financial
equity in its dealings with the Community should not now stumble over
self-imposed hurdles.

FT  07 FEB 92 / L'etat - c'est lui: The mounting political crises of
President Mitterrand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French president Francois Mitterrand has said the Habash affair is over. Yet
the political crisis in France caused by the brief hospitalisation in Paris
last week of the Palestinian leader Mr George Habash will not quickly be
forgotten. Today, the government faces an opposition censure motion in a
one-day session of parliament called by the president to try to put the
crisis to rest.
Mr Mitterrand has dismissed the Habash incident as a minor failure of
political judgment by a few civil servants. The harsh truth is that the
episode has exposed serious weaknesses in the 'Mitterrandian' state, and has
inflicted more damage on an already seriously discredited administration.
The summary dismissal last week of four top-ranking officials at the foreign
and interior ministries failed to silence the controversy. All the political
parties were incredulous that the decision to admit Mr Habash could have
been taken without ministerial authority, and are scandalised that civil
servants should be made the scapegoats for their political masters.
Some leading politicians, and not just in the conservative opposition,
demanded that ministerial heads should roll. The most spectacular such
demand came from Mr Michel Rocard, the former Socialist prime minister, long
an open challenger of Mr Mitterrand's position and the Socialist party's
most likely candidate in the 1995 presidential elections.
In a television interview, he dismissed as 'highly implausible' the claim
that ministers had not been kept informed, and went on: 'We are not at the
end of this affair, and I am not satisfied. There is an eminent political
responsibility behind this error.'
Mr Rocard's open repudiation of the government's handling of the Habash
affair is obviously intended to strengthen his presidential credentials. He
was clearly voicing the moral dismay of many other leading party members,
and distancing himself from a president whose administration looks
alarmingly accident-prone.
His open disloyalty to the president could yet harm him in the long run. But
in the short run, President Mitterrand had already decided not to sacrifice
any of his ministers.
Some French commentators have protested that Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign
minister, and Mr Philippe Marchand, the interior minister, ought not to have
been able to shirk their personal responsibilities and allow their civil
servants to carry the can. The fact is, however, that the France of the
fifth republic does not appear to recognise the principle of personal
ministerial responsibility.
Very occasionally, a political rebel may resign from office on grounds of
personal principle. But in general, loyal ministers are expected to place
their portfolios absolutely at the disposal of the president; if they
resign, it is only because they have been dismissed.
In the notorious Greenpeace scandal of 1985, it quickly became obvious, in
spite of denials, evasions and an elaborate whitewash report, that the
sinking of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior was the work of French secret
service agents. When the facts could no longer be denied, there was a
struggle behind the scenes between Mr Laurent Fabius, the then prime
minister, and Mr Charles Hernu, the then defence minister, to decide which
of them would take the blame. This struggle lasted more than two months
before Mr Hernu was forced to resign.
In the Habash affair, no such political sacrifice has been demanded. Indeed,
even the exemplary sanctions meted out to the civil servants may be largely
illusory, and have more to do with the theatre of politics than with real
punishments. Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, declared on Tuesday that
his great esteem for these 'exemplary' public servants was undiminished, and
that he would not rest until they were restored to positions of equivalent
rank.
According to Mr Serge July, editor of the newspaper Liberation, the Habash
scandal epitomises a crisis of political irresponsibility which is
inextricable from the pronounced personal idiosyncrasy of the Mitterrand
regime. In an editorial this week, he traced this crisis to Mr Mitterrand's
'freemasonry of friendship', his habit of filling key political positions
with personal friends and loyal associates, such as Mr Dumas and Mr
Marchand.
The corollary is that none of President Mitterrand's ministers has any
personal authority except through him. Mr Dumas and Mr Marchand have no
political power of their own, because they owe their positions solely to the
grace of the president. Therefore they have no personal responsibility.
The principle of political impotence may also apply to prime ministers. When
Mr Rocard was prime minister, he submitted to President Mitterrand's will;
but he remained a figure of political weight and authority, since he
controlled a large faction of the Socialist party. By contrast, Mrs Edith
Cresson, his successor, has no independent power base, and is thus little
more than the creature of the president.
The first result of the 'presidentialisation' of political power is that
ministers cannot, or at least should not, make any significant policy
innovation without the endorsement of the president. The second is that
their ministries are far more sensitive to the policy indications which
emerge from the Elysee Palace than to the views of their own titular
ministers.
This practice of obsessive 'Elysee-ology' offers the most plausible
explanation for the Habash affair. The foreign and interior ministries knew
that the request to hospitalise Mr Habash came through the French Red Cross;
they knew that Mrs Georgina Dufoix, president of the French Red Cross, was
also an adviser and long-time associate of Mr Mitterrand; so they may have
assumed the endorsement of the president.
After today's debate, President Mitterrand no doubt hopes that he can resume
his previous medium-term plan of campaign. This was to keep the present
government in office at least until after next month's regional elections.
If the results turned out to be really bad for the Socialist party, he could
appoint a new prime minister, who might still have enough time, and above
all sufficient popular appeal, to regain ground for the Socialists before
the general elections in the spring of 1993.
The one man who is regularly canvassed as such a potential white knight for
the Socialists is Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
He has strong European and French political credentials, and he is right at
the top of the popularity charts. But even were he prepared to throw up
everything at a call from President Mitterrand, he could not reasonably
abandon his responsibilities in Brussels at a moment's notice.
The earliest plausible moment for a measured change of government,
therefore, would be in the late spring. This means that Mrs Cresson can
almost certainly expect to have to soldier on for six weeks or more, until
after the March 22 elections; indeed, it is not impossible that she may have
to stay on as prime minister until the general elections next year, if Mr
Mitterrand concludes that a better candidate is not available.
This mid-term scenario helps to explain why Mr Rocard and his allies in the
Socialist party were suddenly so keen for an immediate government reshuffle,
or even for a new government, in response to the Habash affair. If Mr Delors
were able, in suitably measured circumstances, to become prime minister some
time in the spring, he might also be able to use the office to challenge Mr
Rocard's position as the presidential candidate of the Socialist party. If,
on the other hand, President Mitterrand could be bounced by the Habash
affair into making a sudden government reshuffle now, he could not
realistically make a second reshuffle six weeks after the regional
elections. Mr Rocard had ethical and political reasons for demanding a
reshuffle; but he also saw it as a way of blocking a potential challenge
from Mr Delors.
For the time being, however, Mr Rocard and Mr Delors are figures on the
sidelines. The central lesson of the Habash affair is that, ultimately, only
one person in the whole of the constellation of government has any power,
and only one person is really responsible for anything; and that is the
president himself. He created the conditions for the Habash debacle through
the presidentialisation of power; and he turned the affair into a crisis,
first by treating it as a scandal, and then by attempting to stifle the
scandal.
Of course, he cannot himself be punished when things go wrong; but in the
end he cannot escape responsibility, and one day there will be a reckoning.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: Rare prints to thrill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to ask which is the more remarkable: print dealer Nicholas
Stogdon's latest exhibition or the highly idiosyncratic catalogue that
accompanies it. Stogdon lays before us an unusual feast. On offer is a group
of some 60 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish woodcuts of
striking quality, from unique early devotional images of exceptional
freshness to fine impressions of well known woodcuts by Durer, Burgkmair,
Wechtlin, Baldung Grien and Goltzius.
The show opened at the Salander-O'Reilly Galleries in Berlin in December,
and continues at Michael Simpson Ltd, 11 Savile Row, London W1, until
February 21. It is probably no exaggeration to say that nothing quite like
it has been seen in a commercial gallery before.
Stogdon addresses the problems of attribution and dating, as well as
technique, in a catalogue in which his enthusiasm continually bubbles to the
surface, despite the the scholarship. The prints, however, have a vigour and
physical presence that speak for themselves.
That presence is felt in both 'high' and 'low' art. Arguably more compelling
than the sophisticated cuts that rival illumination are the bold and crudely
coloured devotional images probably made for sale at a shrine as souvenirs,
humble blockbooks made for the poor clergy, religious and secular
broadsides, and odd survivals of printed ephemera.
In pride of place is a monumental Pieta believed to come from mid-15th
century Swabia and derived from sculptural prototypes. Perhaps 20 northern
single-image sheets of the period survive. Among the broadsides is a
coloured cut from Nurnburg in near mint condition warning against the usury
of the Jews and which predates the expulsion of the Jewish community from
the city in 1499 by 15 years. Here, too, is an indulgence, an almanac, and
three extraordinarily rare sheets with woodcuts and verses composed by
Durer.
Durer was the first artist to fully realise the potential of prints.
Woodcuts and engravings, cheap in relation to painting, proved ideal media
for an artist brimming with invention and who wanted to make a name in the
world. He revolutionised the graphic arts by developing a new graphic
vocabularly, and a system of hatching very fine lines that could yield large
numbers of woodcut impressions. Grien lacked Durer's innate sympathy with
the woodcut, and set his blockcutters near impossible tasks. That explains
why the highly eccentric Madonna and Child here is one of only five
impressions.
Technical innovations and anomalies crop up throughout. From the 1470s comes
an unique dotted print of a type that only seems to have been produced by
goldsmiths for 50 years. The image of the Madonna is at once ugly and
moving, made with a metal plate punched and engraved. A more satisfactory
development of that technique is illustrated by an early white-line woodcut
of a monk reading at his desk in a wattle-fenced meadow. Here the image is
produced by cutting finely hatched lines rather than the area between them,
allowing the white paper ground to provide the design. From there, argues
Stogdon, it was a natural progression to the chiaroscuro woodcut, where a
traditional black-line woodblock is used with a white-line woodblock to
provide tone.
Of great interest too is the trial layout for a page of Der Weisskunig. With
another proof in the Fitzwilliam, it reveals the publisher's preoccupation
with the look of the page and the type of the text and its layout.
Burgkmair's woodcut of around 1515 is set on the page with type below
borrowed from something else.
If this is a precursor of the modern publisher's dummy, the three
outstanding and rare proofs of his chilling 'Lovers Surprised by Death' of
1510 are the ancestors of modern four-colour printing. This is the first
dated colour print to be made using separate but interdependent blocks. Each
of the proofs is printed by three blocks to different effect: three shades
of chocolate brown; black and two shades of red; black, eggshell blue and
silvery grey. The white ground is exploited as highlight. This new tonal
subtlety significantly enhanced the illusion of three dimensions.
Burgkmair's ink and wash drawing of five drummers on horseback and
engravings by Durer, Schongauer and Goltzius, are among the highlights of a
small show at the Strang Print Room. University College, London's holding of
some 4,000 prints and drawings is one of the country's least known
university collections. As a means of introducing it to a wider public, this
first of a series of displays focuses on its major benefactions.
The Print Room, located to the right of Wilkins' dome, is open weekdays
1-2.15pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1-5pm. This show, which ranges from
Mantegna to John Singer Sargent, continues until March 27.

The most exciting moment of Martin Sadofski's first play is the realisation,
at the start of the second act, that his characters are sharing the stage
with a real, dead Dobermann. The sleek carcass is used symbolically by
Sadofski to underscore his vision of wasted life. It also provides a comic
disposal problem, while adding its bit to the pickle in which his characters
find themselves: their futile attempts to sink its body lands them with a
Pounds 300 fine.
Like so much in this play, it is a good idea which is scuppered by a lack of
consistency. It is hardly likely that a couple of squatters would have put
an identity tag on a dog they had picked up a couple of months previously -
and such a literal reading is invited by a staging which constantly moors
metaphor to concrete images. It is almost as if the writer and the director,
Penny Ciniewicz, are speaking different languages: he talks of fishing and
dead dogs, and she provides a rod and a stuffed Dobermann.
Their combined efforts give us two childhood friends from Southport and two
triangular relationships. In the first act, John - white, neurasthenic and
beautifully played by James Kerr - falls in love with a girl who drowns
herself after a fling with his best friend, Paul, cocky and black. In the
second act, five years later, the tables are turned. Paul (Lennie James),
now a tough London nut, loses his girlfriend to a platonic relationship with
the smart, sensitive and respectable John.
Sadofski offers situations but declines to provide explanations. We are
never told why the truculent Lori (Connie Hyde) drowned herself, nor why the
lively Paul of the first act should have become an violent emotional cripple
of the second. What could be a stylish obliqueness becomes a frustrating
failure to follow a line of thought through.
The result, theatrically, is that the characters fail to grip or engage:
there is no sense that they have something to communicate, about life, or
friendship or anything else. The abstraction of the script demands a more
abstract staging if it is to become anything more than a tatty footnote to
the urban disinheritance drama of so much fringe theatre in the 1980s.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: La Bete - Lyric, Hammersmith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first half of this thoroughly unusual piece, which has the financial
backing of Andrew Lloyd Webber, absolutely glitters with promise and
performance; the second half is considerably less good, so one cannot yet
feel certain that it will achieve the transfer from Hammersmith to the West
End.
La Bete is a first play by a young American, David Herson. It had a short
run on Broadway last year, but failed to catch on. Lloyd Webber backed it
then and is sticking to it now. One can see why. The piece is full of pretty
rhymes and pretty devices. It is allusive to this, that and the other, just
like Lloyd Webber's music.
The title is misleading, for there is nothing stupid about it. La Bete is
set in the 17th century France of Louis XIV: the playwrights and actors are
quarrelling about who should provide the court entertainment, and thus
receive the royal subsidy. Chief among them is Elomire (an anagram of
Moliere), who is challenged by the remarkably fluent performer and
versifier, Valere. The play is really a challenge about who can produce and
speak the best rhyming couplets.
That is why the first act is so good. Valere, superbly played by Alan
Cumming, wins hands down. He can not only produce the couplets; he can also
act. This is a very camp performance. Note a piece of mime where he imitates
a star, presumably in Naples, receiving the applause and the bouquets at the
end of the show. See, too, his response to Elomire's very fierce 'Don't call
me darling, ever:' 'Oh sorry, dear.'
Valere is so fluent with his words that he has to invent new ones of his
own. 'My word for 'words' is 'verbobos',' he says. His word for table is
'carabumba' and for chair 'Francesca'. The delight at this virtuoso
performance is abounding.
The trouble is that the rest of the play can't quite keep up. Valere is
challenging for Elomire's place at court. Prince Conti, the patron of the
arts, arrives to judge. What happens is a contest that does not come off. It
is never really clear that Valere's style is substantially different from
Elomire's. What we do get, however, is a stunning display of how flexible
and effective English rhyming couplets can be.
Those who saw Ranjit Bolt's translations from Corneille at the Old Vic a
year or so ago will know exactly what I mean. The verse positively flows
and, within the discipline, is remarkably varied. As Valere comments,
'daunting is the ease with which you weave linguistic tapestries', whereas
'pentameters, though pleasing on the page, are so monotonous upon the
stage.'
There are other delights. The Prince, played by Timothy Walker, has the most
magnificently long train. Sarah Crowden as Dorine speaks her part in teasing
rhyming monosyllables. It is just that Elomire, certainly as played by
Jeremy Northam, never quite develops as a character and the second act needs
more work on it. The production comes from the Really Useful Theatre Company
directed by Richard Jones.

Two of BBC2's current Top 3 are Friday night repeats: the mid-sixties puppet
series Thunderbirds (6.00) and Victoria Wood - As Seen On TV (9.00).
Both are getting more than five million viewers whereas series such as '40
Minutes' and 'The Money Programme' are now languishing below the two million
mark. BBC2's social affairs series, Public Eye (8.00) has also failed to set
the Thames on fire, though its subjects are often significant. Today it
investigates the police disciplinary system, asking whether it deals
effectively with officers who break the law, or protects them from the
consequences of their actions; last year barely one in 20 complaints against
the police was upheld.
As usual on Fridays there are several movies. Slither (11.20 BBC1) is a bit
like much modern art: you need to know a lot about other pictures before you
can really appreciate all its jokes, influences and references. Mainly it is
a pastiche road movie. Astonishingly, A Strange Place To Meet (12.05 BBC2)
is also a parody of a road movie, this time French ('Slither' is American)
and much slower. Abba The Movie (12.05 C4) is like a 90-minute video for the
group, made in 1977.

A stark, ever-changing skyscape dominates this Stygian-black Seville. The
inhabitants seem dwarfed and penned by the severity of the town enclosures;
but one man walks free of all confining late-18th-century rigidities and
proprieties.
Greying at the temples, snake-like in sinuous control of movement, eyes
flashing atop immaculate white ruff and black doublet, he stalks the streets
with relaxed purpose when not poised motionless in corners, watching his
victims (actual and potential) with insouciant gaze. He has a troop of
heavies out of Goya at his command, money to burn, and a Sade-like
determination to explore the farthest extremes of sensual pleasure: 'La
liberta' for him means, among other things, freedom to imprison Zerlina for
a bout of bondage sex (from which she is rescued only just in time) and eat
dinner off a naked woman's body. When he dies, the sky glows blood-red - and
then the town relaxes back into bourgeois security: the final homily is
smugly offered over a cup of coffee.
This, crudely summarised, is the dramatic rationale of the new Royal Opera
Don Giovanni (sponsored by the Fondation Elf and the Jean Sainsbury Royal
Opera House Fund). It is conducted by Bernard Haitink and produced by
Johannes Schaaf in the effective and practical designs of Peter Pabst; and
as one might reasonably guess after Schaaf's previous Mozart stagings in the
house, it is contentious, at times fussily over-detailed - this producer has
a mania for decking soliloquies with extraneous activity - and open to
general reproach in its need to find plausible formulas in which to 'fix' a
mighty and untameable masterpiece.
But this time, it seems to me, the plusses definitely outweigh the minuses:
the unfolding is swift and free of hitches, a notable Mozart cast and
conductor have been engaged to vitalise its premisses into music-drama, and
the title role is taken with thrilling magnetism. If this Don Giovanni grips
the attention in spite of every objection against it, that is above all
because of the tremendously powerful focal point at its centre.
Thomas Allen, already a nonpareil Don Giovanni at Glyndebourne ten years ago
(when Carol Vaness was also his Anna and Haitink his conductor), has waited
a long time for a London production in which he might freely concentrate all
his Mozartian gifts. The previous Covent Garden show (in which he twice
appeared, in 1984 and 1988) was a poor vehicle; this new one marks his 20th
anniversary on this stage, and does so fittingly and well, since it unfolds
at least a cogent line of thought for this most remarkable of modern
singer-actors to follow through.
The pleasures of the performance start with the fact that Mr Allen, after a
recent patch of unevenness, has rediscovered his best vocal form; the
ability to make words and tone-colour part of a single dramatic impetus can
again exert its mastery unimpeded. He is always wonderful to watch (and, as
Schaaf introduces him as a prying eye on scenes from which Da Ponte intended
him removed, this gift is a special blessing); he is witty, agile in his
responses, unfailingly elegant in bearing, unfazed by passing crisis, and
utterly repellent. No other Giovanni of my experience exposes the cruelty,
violence and egotism at the character's core with such freedom and economy
of means. At Glyndebourne Mr Allen formed part of Peter Hall's much more
finely controlled production; here, his achievement in the role stands out
the more strikingly.
Of the cast only young Bryn Terfel, making a brilliant house debut as a
lovably chunky, tough-tender Masetto, comes near to matching him in
completeness of vocal and dramatic command; elsewhere, the hampering effect
of production details has yet to be fully counteracted. But the quality of
singing is extremely high; the performance can boast a feeling of voices
carefully matched, that gives it a distinct patina, particularly in
ensembles. The three sopranos all share a vibrancy of delivery, a sultry
warmth of vocal texture: Miss Vaness's Anna magnificently majestic in full
sail; the delightful Puerto-Rican soprano Marta Marquez (Zerlina) as full of
zestful, sensual colour as a latter-day Conchita Supervia; and an unusually
touching, distinctively passionate Elvira from Patricia Schumann. (Miss
Schumann's vocal suitability is a stroke of fortune rather than of planning;
she comes as a late replacement for the indisposed Karita Mattila.)
Hans Peter Blochwitz's Ottavio, blander in timbre, is expertly delivered; a
lovely 'Dalla sua pace' competes for our attention with a band of
furniture-ing as the Commendatore. Only Leporello disappoints: for all
Claudio Desderi's Italianate verbal relish and comic keenness, the voice
simply fails to carry sufficient weight at Covent Garden.
At Glyndebourne, Haitink proved himself a Don Giovanni conductor of
shattering intensity and muscular force. On Wednesday's evidence the
re-thinking process for the larger house is still a little way from
completion. His tight (but never suffocating) grasp on Act 1 loosened after
the interval; Act 2 felt like a succession of beautifully shaped discrete
parts rather than a continuously flowing whole. In sum, then, this is
neither a 'classic' account of the opera, nor an unarguably convincing
re-thinking: but, with Mr Allen at its apex, it is full of interest and
excitement all the same.

<TEXT>
There are two of them, both called John. One plays the piano accordion
(rather well) and the bass clarinet; the other brandishes a home-made guitar
and occasionally launches brutal attacks upon an unsuspecting drum kit. They
take turns to deliver their short, sharp songs, favouring an adenoidal New
York whine which despite itself is sometimes blended into Everly Brothers
sugarsweet harmony.
Like all genuine eccentrics They Might Be Giants defy sensible
categorisation; they seem at the same time determinedly anarchic and
perfectly unself-conscious. Contemporary rock is not short on artists who
take themselves too seriously, so it is sheer delight to find an act so
determined to send up everything in sight, themselves included.
It is all made to seem so utterly guileless; hard to believe that the duo
learnt their trade busking on Brooklyn's East River and yet still managed to
keep their wide-eyed freshness intact. The meanings of their songs come
shrouded beneath coatings of nursery-rhyme lyrics and hand-me down pop
riffs; only rarely are their teeth bared. A number like 'Your racist
friend', seems shocking for the directness of its message, especially when
surrounded by 'Birdhouse in Your Soul' ('I'm not your only friend, but I'm a
little glowing friend') or 'Particle Man' ('Is he a dot or is he a speck?
When he's underwater does he get wet?').
It seems appropriately illogical that They Might Be Giants are touring
Britain almost two months before their new album (the fourth) is due to be
released here. There was a sprinkling of those latest songs at the
Bloomsbury, but most of their set was devoted to singalong favourites. The
audience bounced happily through the best of Flood (which appeared in 1990),
confident in the knowledge that nothing was going to last longer than a
couple of minutes and that a high percentage of the songs have the kind of
naggingly memorable melody lines and surreal lyrics which will run through
the brain for hours afterwards.
Try hard enough and almost any influence you care to mention is stirred into
the mix somewhere - a dash of Buddy Holly and the Beatles here, some Tom
Waits and Elvis Costello there - but the worst thing that could happen would
be for They Might Be Giants to make it too big and find themselves absorbed
into the rock mainstream. Playing Wembley Arena with an army of roadies and
real session musicians to replace the marvellously tacky backing tapes just
wouldn't be the same, and nothing like so exhilarating.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Management: Making political capital of running London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN

<TEXT>
Labour council leaders gather today in Blackpool for their annual local
government conference, fervently hoping that a more sympathetic Labour
government is on the way.
But a change of government is unlikely to reverse the revolution in the
management of local authorities imposed from above over the past 13 years.
Labour's plans for a new strategic London authority, published last week,
reveal that the party has now moved towards accepting many of the
Conservatives' management reforms such as contracting out and
performance-related incentives for top managers.
According to 'An elected voice for London', the new elected Greater London
Authority would determine the policy guidelines for strategic services such
as public transport, planning, the police, fire brigades and environmental
protection. But responsibility for the delivery of these services would be
assigned to a small team of 'top calibre' directors who would be expected to
contract out most of the work.
'Direct employment will be the least common option,' the paper says.
'Resources will be hired when they are needed for particular purposes and
will not grow into a permanent bureaucracy.' While the directors would be
supported by a small team of professional staff, staffing requirements would
be minimised in two ways:
by seconding staff for particular tasks - from business and industry as well
as from London boroughs and transport operators.
by contracting out even professional services such as research and policy
development to research organisations, universities and polytechnics.
Labour's advisers believe that enough Labour councillors now feel
comfortable with the experience of contracting-out of local services for
this radical approach to be acceptable.
The directors would be appointed on five-year renewable contracts with
remuneration packages designed to attract top managers from business and
commerce as well as the public and voluntary services. Their brief would be
to restore the services for which they were responsible to levels which
could compete with other leading European cities such as Paris and Berlin.
The blueprint for a new Greater London Authority reflects a determination
among Labour leaders to find a new style of public sector management which
builds on the managerial revolution launched by the Conservatives but gives
an element of democratic accountability through the ballot box.
Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, says that the new model is
meant to mark a break from the sort of bureaucratic superstructure which
characterised the now-defunct Greater London Council.
'If it works well,' says Gould, 'it will offer a managerial model for the
regional authorities we hope to set up in the future.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Two new approaches to the genetic treatment of cystic fibrosis, Britain's
most common inherited disease, will be developed at St Mary's Hospital
Medical School in London.
Bob Williamson, professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics, yesterday
announced details of a Pounds 1m research programme, funded by a gift to the
Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust from the late Leopold Muller, a London
hotelier.
US scientists are planning to use genetically engineered human viruses
(either adenoviruses or retroviruses) to carry correct copies of the CFTR
gene, which is defective in cystic fibrosis, into the lungs of CF patients.
The St Mary's group will develop a different type of virus - bacteriophages
which normally infect bacteria rather than human cells - to carry the CFTR
gene into the lungs. A potential advantage of the bacteriophage approach is
that it removes some safety concerns associated with genetically altered
human viruses.
For the long term, the St Mary's scientists are working on a second, more
radical approach. They will construct artificial 'mini-chromosomes' to add
to the complement of 46 chromosomes which contain the natural genetic
material in human cells.
The mini-chromosome would be large enough to carry the CFTR gene and all its
associated control sequences, to ensure that the cells produce the missing
protein in the right quantities. Some of these control sequences have to be
removed when viruses are used, because there would otherwise be too much DNA
for the virus to carry.
If mini-chromosomes can be made to replicate alongside all the normal human
chromosomes when cells divide, gene therapy would treat the disease once and
for all; viral techniques, on the other hand, will almost certainly require
repeated treatments. And mini-chromosomes could in theory to expanded to
carry more than one human gene, to treat multiple genetic disorders
including heart disease.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Management: Hostage to fortunes - Kidnapping / A look at the
role played by insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The abduction of estate agent Stephanie Slater has aroused fears that
kidnapping and extortion could become one of the biggest commercial crimes
in Britain.
As companies tighten security, protecting premises with closed-circuit
television and installing safes that are impossible to crack or blow open,
criminals may be turning to abduction and blackmail as more effective routes
to a company's assets.
Insurance brokers which arrange cover against such incidents - so-called
kidnap and ransom insurance - are predicting growth in what remains one of
the least-publicised and most sensitive sectors of the market.
Slater's case has provoked widespread publicity because a Pounds 175,000
ransom was paid and the kidnapper - so far - has not been caught. But it was
not an isolated incident. Control Risks, a company specialising in corporate
security, has reported that recorded kidnaps increased 42 per cent in 1989
and 66 per cent in 1990.
Of the 4,890 kidnaps that have been recorded by Control Risks since 1975,
however, only 109 were insured. Kidnap and ransom insurance has yet to catch
on, possibly because of its low profile. Annual premium income is only
Dollars 70m worldwide, Dollars 40m of that underwritten at Lloyd's of
London.
But Gus van Lanschot, deputy managing director of Willis Faber and Dumas,
the largest broker in the field, warns that the latest incident could spawn
copycat cases and could prompt more companies to investigate cover.
Most K and R packages, he says, go far beyond simple indemnity against loss
incurred in paying ransoms. They include advice and training from security
specialists on lessening risks, and, in the event of an incident, a full
'crisis management' programme.
This means an experienced consultant being assigned to the company to
discuss what action to take, to manage relations with the press, the
authorities and members of the victim's family, and to conduct negotiations
with the kidnappers. This, insurers say, can lessen the amount of any ransom
paid and often give the authorities more time to find the abductor.
Advisers can be particularly useful when the incident occurs overseas, where
attitudes of the authorities towards kidnappings can be different from the
softly-softly approach employed in Britain and the US.
Cassidy Davis, the largest Lloyd's underwriter of K and R policies, stresses
that specific conditions are always attached. Policies provide only for
reimbursement after a ransom has been paid. No insurer would pay or fund a
ransom payment.
Confidentiality is paramount, and the existence of an insurance policy is
never disclosed. Insured parties must always co-operate with law enforcement
agencies.
Tony Colla, managing director of the risk benefits division at Sedgwick,
another broker offering K and R policies, says clients range from
multinational companies to wealthy individuals and small family businesses.
He advises companies to cover all employees: it is a popular misconception
that the most likely targets for kidnapping are company directors.
The subject of kidnap insurance remains a sensitive one. Italy, where
commercial kidnapping has been a serious problem for many years, has moved
to outlaw such cover. In the 1980s the EC considered doing the same,
following a call for a Europe-wide ban by Garret Fitzgerald, the former
Irish prime minister. The charge is that the very availability of such cover
may act as an incentive to kidnappers.
Colla counters that kidnapping has been happening for hundreds of years,
while insurance policies have been available only since the early 1970s.

ALGAE is proving the answer to finding an infant milk formula which is as
close as possible to breast milk.
Powdered baby milk lacks a long-chain fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) which is the primary structural lipid in human brain tissue. So far
there has been no satisfactory source of DHA available to the manufacturers
of infant formula - one of the few sources is fish oil, but this contains
other fatty acids which can retard infant growth.
Martek Corporation, of Columbia, Maryland, has found a way of extracting the
compounds from an algae which has a biomass comprised of 35 per cent DHA.
The resulting orange oil is extremely stable and, say the producers, has
generated enormous interest among companies producing infant formula.

A PROFESSOR at the University of Ohio is using voice recognition technology
to cut production times for small- and medium-sized manufacturers, writes
Larry Donovan.
To make a mechanical gear, for example, the software developed by Dinesh
Dhamija is loaded on to the computer and a user vocabulary is built up. Then
the gear is sketched on a screen by voice commands.
The monologue is straightforward. 'I want a gear which works on a reduction
ration 2 as to 1 and to transmit 150 horsepower.'
After prompting questions about size, stress factors and materials, the
computer analyses the request and comes back with some options. The model
that is chosen is then open for further modifications.
When the sketch is done, the data is sent to a computer numerical control
unit to make the part on site. Alternatively the data can be sent almost
across a data network to a plant nearly anywhere in the world. The system
costs between Dollars 30,000-Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 17,000-Pounds 22,000).

SPECTACLES with coatings to minimise glare from the sun are relatively

Applied Vision, of Leicestershire, was set up to tackle this problem. The
result is a coating machine which costs Pounds 80,000 to buy, less than a
fifth of most existing models. It is also less expensive to operate.
The machines uses a technique called ion sputtering, in which the surface to
be coated is excited electro-magnetically, attracting the ions in the
coating. The ions bombard the lens and stick to it.
Each lens takes about one hour to coat, making the technique suitable for
high street opticians who promote themselves on the speed of their service.

A BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of severe asthma could open up the way for a
new range of anti-asthma drugs.
Doctors at the Royal Brompton National Heart &amp; Lung Hospital and the London
Chest Hospital have found that cyclosporin A, a drug used to suppress organ
rejection after transplant surgery, produced a marked improvement in chronic
asthma sufferers.
At the moment most patients need high doses or oral steroids, which can
produce side effects.
The cyclosporin A drug works by suppressing the T lymphocyte immune cells in
the body. Researchers at the Royal Brompton hospital have suspected for some
time that these white blood cells play an important role in causing
asthmatic symptoms.
The results of their research, published in this week's The Lancet, mean
drugs could be developed in the future which treat asthma effectively but
are less toxic and more selective than today's treatments.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-delayed order for Channel tunnel sleeper trains is to be awarded to
GEC Alsthom, British Rail said yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes.
The decision about the contract - thought to be worth Pounds 115m - clears
the way for night trains to start running from Britain's regions to Paris
and Brussels from late in 1994.
There will also be two Continental sleeper services from London each night.
One will go to Amsterdam and the other to Cologne, dividing into portions
for Dortmund and Frankfurt.
GEC Alsthom, which is also building all the daytime Channel tunnel
expresses, is believed to have won the contract against bids from Brel, the
troubled British trainmaker, and Keller Meccanica of Italy.
All 139 Channel tunnel sleeping cars are to be built at GEC Alsthom's
Metro-Cammell plant in Washwood Heath, east Birmingham.
The night trains were intended to be ready for the tunnel's planned opening
in June next year, but the order was delayed by the complexity of reaching
agreement between the national railways of Britain, France, Belgium, Germany
and the Netherlands.
Several more weeks are likely to pass before the contract is placed as the
leasing deal expected to finance it has yet to be arranged.
The premature announcement of the contract may give rise to suspicions that
it is intended to mollify the regions in the run-up to the general election.
Three daily sleeper trains will run from the regions. One will set off from
Glasgow, Carlisle, Preston and Crewe, with portions for Paris and Brussels;
a second will go from Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and Bristol to Paris; and a
third will go from Plymouth, Newton Abbott, Exeter, Taunton and Bristol to
Brussels.

BRITISH AEROSPACE is to shed a further 450 jobs at its guided-weapons plants
by May and has warned of more redundancies if it fails to win a Pounds 700m
competition to make a new missile for the RAF, David White writes.
The cuts continue a cascade of reductions in the defence industry. In the
past week, about 350 job losses have been announced at Vosper Thornycroft,
the Southampton-based shipbuilder, and 600 at the VSEL submarine yard at
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, where further cuts are due.
Unions say that about 40,000 job losses have been announced in the defence
industry since mid 1990, when the government announced plans for cuts in the
armed services.
The latest cuts by BAe will reduce the workforce in its Dynamics division,
which makes guided weapons, to 6,000 compared with 16,500 three years ago.
All of its three main remaining sites are affected, with the principal plant
at Stevenage, Herts, losing 300 out of 4,000 jobs. A further 130 will be
lost at Lostock, Lancashire, and 20 at Bristol.
The company yesterday asked for volunteers for an 'early-release' plan.
Mr David Laybourn, the division's managing director, warned that delays in
procurement decisions in the UK and abroad were 'increasing the pressures'.
BAe is anxiously awaiting a decision on the future of its Advanced
Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (Asraam), which would provide it with its
biggest single source of business in guided weapons.
It is competing for the RAF contract against rival weapons proposed by BGT
of Germany and by GEC-Marconi in collaboration with Matra of France.
Mr Laybourn said: 'If an early positive decision is not forthcoming on
Asraam, our ability to bid for - or undertake - major guided-weapons
projects for the Ministry of Defence will be damaged.'

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN ONE of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective stories, Sherlock Holmes draws
attention to the dog that failed to bark in the night. Readers of this
year's Economic Report of the President may find themselves perplexed by an
equally singular omission: the absence of detailed discussion of budgetary
trends.
The 423-page report is the annual showpiece of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, headed by Mr Michael Boskin, an economist from Stanford
University. The administration distributes about 45,000 copies, many to
colleges. Economists regard it as one of the most authoritative sources of
information about US economic trends.
Most economists regard the shortage of national savings as a key problem
facing the economy. This is exacerbated by huge budget deficits, which count
as negative saving by the public sector. Mr Boskin ignores the deficit,
presumably because trends have deteriorated badly during his three-year
tenure. This year's deficit is expected to hit Dollars 400bn (Pounds
220.9bn) or 6.7 per cent of gross domestic product - bigger than the largest
deficits during the Reagan years.
For the first time in memory, the White House is not forecasting a return to
budget balance in the medium term. After allowing for the cyclical state of
the economy and exceptional items (such as the cost of bailing out bankrupt
savings and loan institutions), the 'structural' budget deficit is forecast
to fall from Dollars 268bn this fiscal year to a trough of Dollars 190bn in
1996. It then begins rising again, driven by rapid growth of spending on
'entitlement' programmes such as health care for the elderly.
This outlook - similar to predictions by independent groups such as the
Congressional Budget Office - is probably too optimistic. The administration
has repeatedly underestimated growth of spending and exaggerated its ability
to raise tax revenue.
Many economists may feel shortchanged by Mr Boskin's failure to address the
principal problems facing the economy. By glossing over adverse fiscal
trends, he is encouraging complacency in Congress, which may well pass
bigger tax cuts than proposed by Mr Bush in last week's budget. Given
spending trends, the figures suggest the US needs a tax increase of 2-3
percentage points of GDP if it is to eliminate its deficit and rebuild
national savings.
The report fleshes out the budget prediction that a sustained economic
recovery will begin in the spring and gather pace through the year. If
Congress passes Mr Bush's 'growth package' Mr Boskin expects the economy to
grow by 2.2 per cent between the final quarters of 1991 and 1992. If the
package is rejected, he predicts growth of only 1.6 per cent. In future
years, the measures will ensure growth of about 3 per cent compared with 2.6
per cent if the package is not passed.
This time last year Mr Boskin (and many private sector economists) wrongly
forecast economic recovery last spring. Recovery is more likely this year
because interest rates are lower and companies and individuals have begun to
pay off debts accumulated in the 1980s. However, predictions of an early
upturn are not yet supported by data.
Mr Boskin fails to explain how the president's economic package will raise
growth by as much as 0.4 percentage points a year over the medium term. Most
of the proposed tax changes - such as incentives for corporate investment
and home ownership - are temporary and will cost little in lost revenue.
It is thus hard to see why growth should be boosted, not just this year but
as far off as 1996 and 1997. Some will say Mr Boskin has bowed to political
pressure and exaggerated the economic potency of the president's package.
Critics of the administration have argued that much of the prosperity of the
1980s was illusory. Statistics are often quoted which appear to show that
the incomes of middle-class families have stagnated since the early 1970s.
Mr Boskin's report attempts to debunk such claims.
But he concedes the central point that a rapid slowdown in productivity
growth in the past two decades has caused incomes to rise much less fast
than immediately after the Second World War.
Most economists say the root cause of low investment is a low rate of
domestic saving. Net savings by the private and public sectors combined is
estimated to have fallen to about 2 per cent of net national product by the
end of the 1980s - a decline of about 75 per cent relative to previous
decades. The growth of federal budget deficits accounts for a large portion
of this decline in savings. This is a dog that many analysts believe should
have barked loudly in Mr Boskin's report.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, whose presidential campaign was thrust on
to the defensive by allegations of adultery, yesterday faced charges that he
dodged the draft during the Vietnam War.
Although Mr Clinton dismissed the charges as 'old news', similar charges
dogged Vice President Dan Quayle during the 1988 election campaign and may
not be so easily brushed aside.
The Arkansas governor is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, and the latest controversy comes less than two weeks before the
February 18 New Hampshire primary election, the crucial first test of the
1992 campaign.
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Mr Clinton promised in 1969
to enter a reserve officers' training programme (ROTC) at the University of
Arkansas, enabling him to secure a deferment from the draft.
However, Mr Clinton, then a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and one of the
outstanding students in his state, backtracked on his promise, failing to
enter either the University of Arkansas or the ROTC. On his return from
England, he entered Yale University.
By that time, the draft laws had changed and a draft lottery existed. Mr
Clinton's number, based on his birthday, was 311; since no-one with a higher
number than 195 was called to service in Vietnam, Mr Clinton, like many
privileged young men of his generation, escaped combat duty.
In 1988, Mr Quayle was accused of using political influence to secure a
place in the Indiana National Guard. Unlike Mr Quayle, however, Mr Clinton
came from a poor family in the south and prospered because of his academic
ability.
Mr Clinton, campaigning in New Hampshire, said: 'This is an old story that
was widely reported in 1978 and has been regularly recycled by the
Republicans.'
Until yesterday he appeared to have weathered a storm over accusations by a
former cabaret singer that he engaged in a 12-year-affair while Arkansas
governor.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Mandela to reconsider nationalisation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, said
yesterday the organisation would reconsider its policy of nationalisation
because of opposition from potential investors.
'Nationalisation is our policy,' Mr Mandela told businessmen during a visit
to Denmark, 'but there is a shift in our thinking. We have observed the
hostility and concern of businessmen towards nationalisation, and we can't
ignore their perceptions,' he said.
'If we want to create a climate where investors will not fear losing their
investments, their dividends, we have to take a decision on the question of
nationalisation.'
Mr Mandela for months has insisted that the ANC is not 'wedded' to the idea
of nationalisation, but has threatened that the movement would resort to
nationalisation unless businessmen came up with an alternative which would
improve distribution of income and wealth in South Africa.
He repeated this demand only four days ago and is likely to revert to
threats of nationalisation if it is not met.
The ANC leader's latest moderate line contradicts views of hardline members
within the organisation, some of whom are very influential. His speech last
weekend to the World Economic Forum in Davos had originally included a
section obviously prepared by hardliners, in which he promised
nationalisation of key enterprises as 'a major step towards overcoming the
huge inequality in the ownership of our country's wealth' and accused South
African business of illegally transferring huge sums abroad. Mr Mandela
dropped these sections.
A further sign of dissent came on Wednesday when the ANC repeated its threat
to renege on foreign loans made to the current government, contradicting
assurances made by Mr Mandela at Davos.
Yesterday he said he had been struck by the concern over the ANC's
nationalisation stand expressed by the 2,000 businessmen present at Davos.
He had also been told that whereas countries emerging from war had
previously been able to nationalise to provide jobs and stimulate economic
growth, this was no longer feasible in a world of inter-linked economies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORTNIGHT'S election campaigning in Punjab began quietly yesterday in the
shadow of guns wielded by both militants and the troops that have been
deployed in the state to keep them at bay.
Candidates were under heavy military escort and there was little of the
enthusiasm associated with the start of an election process. Polling will be
held on February 19 to elect 13 members of parliament and 117 members of the
Punjab legislature.
For the last nine years, the state has been torn by violence by Sikh
militants seeking independence. Initial election rallies were held not to
propagate the contestants' policies but to urge the voters either to boycott
the election or to get them to vote at all.
The election is being boycotted by the main factions of the Akali Dal, the
Sikhs' main political party, under instructions from the militants. The
Akalis held rallies throughout the state asking the people not to vote.
Anti-boycott rallies were held by the authorities.
The Indian government claims it has made sufficient arrangements for a fair
and free election and is urging voters to turn out in large numbers.
One small faction of the Akali Dal is, however, contesting the election, a
faction of led by Mr Amrinder Singh, a former prince of the Patiala royal
family. Mr Singh was declared elected to the Punjab legislature on Wednesday
when all his opponents withdrew from the contest.
This is seen as part of moves being made by the contesting political parties
to ensure an Akali presence in the new legislature to give it
respectability.
The other main parties contesting the election are Congress, which also
forms the federal government, the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party,
which is the official opposition in parliament, and the Marxists.
The period of campaigning has been cut to a fortnight because of security
problems in Punjab. The state has been under president's rule (direct
administration from New Delhi) for 56 months after the last Akali government
was dismissed for failing to check violence by the militants. The situation
has got worse under president's rule.
The Indian government has called elections in Punjab to see whether
restoration of democracy and an elected government can do better.

MRS Lynda Chalker, the UK's minister for overseas development, refused
yesterday to give a timetable for increasing Britain's overseas aid to
levels in line with other European Community countries.
British overseas aid in 1990 was 0.27 per cent of gross domestic product,
against an average of 0.5 per cent of EC countries, and a United Nations
target of 0.7 per cent agreed by the UK in 1974.
Mrs Chalker told a press conference that any increase in aid 'depends upon
growth in this country (the UK)', but added that current British aid was of
a higher quality than that of many donor nations.
Mrs Chalker urged the EC to work the criteria of good government - sound
economic policies, competent and accountable management, and respect for
human rights - into its dialogue with developing countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S banned but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood has again been denied legal
status by an Egyptian court, in a decision which comes at time when the
government is edgy about an apparent upswing in Islamic militancy across the
Arab world.
The Brotherhood, which was outlawed in 1954 after President Gamal Abdel
Nasser accused it of plotting his overthrow, has been pressing
unsuccessfully for registration as a charitable organisation.
Egypt's constitution would prevent, in any case, the Brotherhood gaining
acceptance as a political party since it bans political organisations based
on race or religion.
Egypt's Administrative Court gave no reason for rejecting the Brotherhood's
latest application. It intends to appeal. Mr Mohammed Selim, lawyer for the
Moslem Brotherhood, declared after the ruling: 'All we can do is resort to
the Higher Administrative Court.'
The Moslem Brotherhood, the country's mainstream Islamic force, is allowed a
fair degree of latitude to organise, canvass politically and operate schools
and clinics. It has gained seats in parliament in partnership with the tiny
Liberal and Socialist Labour parties, but along with other main opposition
groupings boycotted the last election held in November 1990.
Brotherhood supporters argue that continued denial of legal status makes no
sense since the organisation is allowed to operate openly, although it may
not contest elections in its own right.
Two Israeli Arabs arrested earlier this week in Egypt on suspicion of spying
are being interrogated in a maximum security prison in Cairo, according to
the Cairo official press.
The two are described as a 41-year-old man and his daughter. Egyptian
newspapers reported that illegal communications equipment and official
documents were found in their suburban home in Heliopolis.
This is believed to be the first case of Egypt arresting suspected Israeli
spies since the two countries signed their peace treaty in 1979.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Argentine prices increase by 3% in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S ambitious anti-inflation strategy has received a body blow with
the announcement of a 3 per cent increase in prices in January. The policies
of Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister and architect of Argentina's
economic revival, hinge on lowering inflation to international levels.
Mr Cavallo forecast inflation of 6-7 per cent this year, but January's
surprisingly heavy increase makes that target almost unattainable.
Although January's inflation is low by Argentina's standards, it came as a
bitter disappointment after monthly inflation sank to a 20-year low of 0.4
per cent in November, rising slightly to 0.6 per cent in December.
January's increase brings the 12-month inflation rate to 76 per cent.
Mr Cavallo must hold price increases down to 0.35 per cent a month for the
rest of the year to meet his inflation target and avoid placing insuperable
strains on the fixed exchange rate, the weakest link in his strategy.
Argentina's peso is now pegged to the US dollar after floating at the outset
of free convertibility last April.
Since April inflation has risen by 25 per cent while the peso has lost only
2 per cent of its value, making the currency increasingly overvalued.
Nonetheless, export competitiveness has been maintained by reducing internal
taxes.
Officials emphasised that January's increase was due to seasonal factors.
They stressed that fiscal and monetary policies were fully on target and
warned against a return to indexing wages and prices to the inflation rate,
a move that would be guaranteed to re-ignite steep inflation.
Earlier, Mr Cavallo had warned that heavy, sustained inflation would
automatically lead to a recession.
Last year the economy grew an estimated 5 per cent while the government
projects 6 per cent growth in real terms this year.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Noriega gains ground: Henry Hamman focuses on the former
Panamanian leader's attempts to fend off US drugs charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY HAMMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega's defence against
drug trafficking charges in Miami gained ground this week. A Drug
Enforcement Administration agent acknowledged that a man identified by the
prosecution as a major Medelln cocaine cartel money launderer had been
arrested on the basis of information from forces commanded by Gen Noriega.
The testimony by Mr James L. Bramble, in charge of the DEA's Panama
operations from August 1982 until June 1984, raised questions about earlier
prosecution claims that Gen Noriega had protected the cartel's operations in
Panama in return for pay-offs.
Prosecutors had cited the money launderer, Mr Ramon Milian Rodriguez, as a
major conduit for drug money from the US to bank accounts controlled by the
cartel in Panama. According to DEA information, Mr Milian was responsible
for transferring Dollars 200m in drug profits from the US to Panama.
Mr Bramble - reading from official DEA reports he had written - acknowledged
that the information that led to Mr Milian's arrest had been independently
developed by Panamanian narcotics officers and passed on to the DEA.
When Mr Milian was arrested in Florida, government agents seized Dollars
5.5m in cash, more than 61 pounds of cocaine, and a Lear jet aircraft. The
DEA report called the seizure 'significant.'
In other testimony, former DEA agent Mr Arthur Sedillo, who was stationed in
Panama from August 1977 until August 1979, read a cable he had received from
the then-chief administrator of the DEA, Mr Peter Bensinger, in which Mr
Bensinger asked that Gen Noriega be congratulated for his role in an
'impressive seizure' of cocaine being smuggled to the US via Panama.
The defence, by calling current and former government officials and
requiring them to read documents they wrote concerning Gen Noriega's efforts
in drug law enforcement, is attempting to counter the prosecution's claim
that Gen Noriega essentially turned Panama into a safe haven for Colombian
cocaine dealers.
Both Mr Bensinger and another former DEA chief administrator, Mr John Lawn,
argued that the kind words they may have written about Gen Noriega were
diplomatic niceties rather than statements of fact.
But letters and memoranda by both Mr Sedillo and Mr Bramble also referred to
co-operation between the DEA and Panamanian forces under the command of Gen
Noriega.
Mr Frank Rubino, the lead defence counsel, said in an interview that showing
the extent of this co-operation was a central part of the defence strategy.
When Mr Bramble finishes testifying he is expected to be followed by another
DEA agent who worked in Panama.
Another defence lawyer, Mr Jon May, confirmed that the defence has abandoned
plans to require testimony from Lt Col Oliver North, the White House
official at the centre of the Iran-Contra affair, and other celebrity
witnesses who had been subpoenaed.
Mr May and Mr Rubino expect to finish presenting their case in 4-6 weeks,
when the prosecution is expected to offer a rebuttal. Then the jury will get
its chance to decide who and what to believe.

THE Brazilian economy ministry has frozen all the accounts of Eletrobras,
the state electricity company, for not honouring its foreign debts and has
warned that it will do the same to any other state company which fails to
make payments.
The crackdown comes after repeated failure by Eletrobras to meet payments
due to the World Bank and other international creditors. Eletrosul (the
southern electricity company) and CHESF (the Sao Francisco hydro-electricity
company) have also had their accounts blocked. Over the last year the three
companies ran up Dollars 300m in arrears.
Last month the Treasury paid a Dollars 45m instalment due from Eletrobras to
the World Bank when the company again failed to deposit the money and
economy ministry officials say the accounts will remain frozen until this is
repaid.
The electricity companies' failure to meet payments is an embarrassment to
the Brazilian government, which is in the midst of an offensive to
renegotiate its foreign debt. Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy
minister, is in Europe meeting members of the Paris Club group of official
creditors to whom Brazil owes Dollars 22bn.
He will present an official proposal which will then be discussed at a
meeting on February 24.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS in the Uruguay Round of trade talks are increasingly concerned
that the Easter deadline for completing the Round will not be met.
On January 13, the 108 countries taking part agreed to accept conditionally
a 436-page draft package of accords covering all areas of negotiation. But
the European Community said 'substantial improvements' would have to be made
in the agriculture text calling for cuts in farm support. Nearly four weeks
on, the EC has not yet come up with proposals for altering the draft, still
less begun serious negotiations with the US and other trading partners to
get changes agreed.
This has in turn held up the detailed country-by-country negotiations now
underway on lowering tariffs and other barriers to trade in goods. Other
countries dissatisfied with the agriculture text, notably Japan which does
not want to open its closed rice market, are refusing to bargain over farm
products on the grounds guidelines have not yet been fixed.
Countries are committed to reducing overall tariffs, including those on
agricultural items, by one-third. By March 1, all 58 countries (the EC
counting as one) in the tariff negotiations must submit complete
item-by-item tariff schedules showing how they propose to meet that
objective. After a final balancing of concessions, definitive schedules
would be ready by March 31. Failure by any country or bloc to include farm
products on its proposed tariff schedule would make it almost impossible to
complete the negotiations on time.
Today's informal stocktaking of intensive bargaining over the past week will
also indicate little progress on Washington's 'zero-for-zero' proposals to
scrap completely tariffs on particular products. Negotiators have more or
less agreed zero tariffs for pharmaceuticals and steel, with construction
machinery and medical equipment also under discussion. But the US needs more
sectors covered if it is to meet the one-third target. The EC in particular
is holding out in the hope of securing cuts in high US tariffs for textiles
and footwear.
Disappointing progress in the negotiations on initial commitments to
liberalise trade in services, which must also be completed by March 31, has
led some trade officials to doubt whether substantial market-opening deals
are possible by the deadline.

MR John Macomber, chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, yesterday said
export financing to Poland could reach Dollars 800m (Pounds 442m) this year
or next, but US government support for sales to the Commonwealth of
Independent States must wait until crucial decisions are made about who is
in charge.
'The republics of the former Soviet Union have enormous assets in terms of
people and natural resources, but are in an economic freefall,' said Mr
Macomber. 'We need to know who has the authority to contract? Who controls
the foreign currency? Who decides if foreigners can invest in their oil and
gas business?'
Once the answers are clear, Eximbank will 'most likely' begin disbursements
for short- and medium-term transactions.
'I also hope we can channel support into hard currency-generating projects,'
said Mr Macomber. 'This would include oil and gas development, with
production payments used as collateral for commercial bank guarantees, as
well as other projects having the prospect of earnings in other than
roubles.'
The bank has approved six US sales to Russia, ranging from glass and battery
manufacturing equipment to building construction panels and safety control
systems for nuclear power plants. These will not go forward until Eximbank
has 'clear guarantees' from the Russian government, Mr Macomber said.
In Poland, by contrast, the bank has doubled and plans to redouble its
support since opening its doors two years ago. Its lending to Mexico is the
highest of any country in its history, having reached Dollars 7bn,
one-fourth of the Eximbank's total portfolio.

FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Indo-Russian trade stuck in credit trap /
A report on life after barter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K K SHARMA and R C MURTHY
</BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI, BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE delegation from Moscow that arrives in New Delhi tomorrow to discuss the
future pattern of Indo-Russian trade must attempt to tackle the growing
problem of Russian indebtedness to India as a result of Moscow's failure to
export sufficient goods.
Trade between India and the former Soviet Union, conducted through annual
agreements to provide balanced trade, has been badly disrupted following the
collapse of Soviet communism. This has left Moscow owing Rs32bn (Pounds
690m) in 'technical credits'.
The Russians plan to switch to dollar-denominated trade with India, ending
the 30-year-old rupee trade, a complex system of balancing two-way exports
and imports. Enthusiasm for rupee trade has already waned in eastern Europe,
where some countries have already changed to convertible currencies for
trading with India.
The Soviet Union has long been an important trading partner with India, with
the latter's exports to the former at one stage accounting for a fifth of
India's total exports. This approved-in-advance trade enabled India to
finance machinery exports and to service the credits extended for import of
Soviet armaments and military aircraft. In what were effectively barter
deals, the country which failed to export sufficient goods gave technical
credits.
The increasing decline in Soviet exports left Indian imports from what is
now the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States running at only
Rs15bn, far below the Rs40bn envisaged in last year's Indo-Soviet protocol.
The technical credits India gave to Moscow reached a record Rs21bn, with
another Rs8bn-worth of Russian orders left in the Indian pipeline. The
Indo-Soviet trade protocol provides for annual technical credit of Rs1.5bn,
which is to be adjusted by exports the following year to balance trade.
Moscow wants New Delhi to roll over the credits, to ask its banks to accept
letters of credit already opened, and to resume consumer goods exports. But
the Indians say that they can ill-afford to roll over nearly Rs30bn of
credit because of budgetary problems.
This has created many problems. Last year, for instance, India received only
3m tonnes of crude oil from Russia, just two-thirds of the agreed level.
Steel imports were negligible, and supplies of non-ferrous metals stopped
altogether. These had to be made good by imports from hard currency areas,
adding to India's concern over its balance of payments. Exports from India
were also down by more than 50 per cent on protocol levels, causing
surpluses in the Indian factories that had for years geared for the Soviet
market. Traditional industries such as jute, tea, textiles and shoes were
all badly affected.
The budgetary problems are also serious for India, which has promised the
International Monetary Fund that it will cut its fiscal deficit for 1991-92
to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).
Technical credits are charged to the Indian government for budgetary
purposes and could become an important reason why IMF requirements will not
be met. Moscow is not reneging on the debt but it not liquidating it
immediately as India wants.
For India, technical credits earn only 4.5 per cent interest, and Russia
indicated recently that it will take at least three years to liquidate the
debt.
Meanwhile, the 1992 protocol has not been signed, and Moscow's desire to
switch from barter to convertible-currency trade is being complicated by a
disagreement over the rupee-rouble exchange rate, heavily weighted in favour
of Moscow. India wants this revalued.
In the interim, both countries have agreed to value their goods in dollars
for at least two years. Another thorny issue relates to the fixing in rupees
of the value of outstanding Soviet credits for military equipment supplies,
which is now denominated in roubles.
The Russians estimate these credits at Rs8-9bn, but no official figure is
available.
And, even while this trade was in rupees, the two countries had multiple
rouble-rupee exchange rates: one for tourists, another for merchandise trade
settled annually, a third for military equipment credits.
India also feels that there are contractual obligations from which Moscow,
as the successor to the Soviet Union, cannot back out. India thinks that
Russian commitments in four areas ' defence equipment, aid to power
projects, coal and steel ' must be paid in rupees.
Indo-Russian trade will in all probability switch over from barter to
convertible-currency trade.
Moscow has said that trade, unlike in the past, when a pact could be drawn
up with a central Soviet authority, will have to be through agreement with
individual enterprises. Moscow is also proposing that 40 per cent of the
value of Russian exports to India should be used for purchases from India
and the balance remitted in hard currency within 30 days if the private
enterprises do not want to use it to buy Indian goods.
Whatever the outcome of the talks starting this weekend, there will still be
difficult times ahead.

The plant, expected to cost around Dollars 33m (Pounds 18.2m), will cover
132,000 sq ft and should see production begin in mid-1993. It will initially
produce RJR's 'Camel' cigarette brand, but eventually extend to other
brands. The eventual plant capacity is put at 8bn cigarettes.

Negotiations for the purchase of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGP), one of

said. SNGP, which supplies 800,000 consumers in northern Pakistan, posted a
gross profit of almost Pounds 9m in 1991 on sales of Pounds 147m. Sui
Southern, the other company being targeted, is of a similar size.

FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: UK's cure for Moscow bread queue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG queues for stale bread in the Soviet Union could be a thing of the past
if a plan financed by the British government and UK bakeries is accepted by
Moscow city council, writes Judy Dempsey.
The plan, drawn up by Andersen Consulting, the London-based company,
involves finding out if privatisation, a reorganisation, and an injection of
capital in Moscow's 1,420 bread shops and 24 bakeries, would make bread last
longer and taste nicer.
A Muscovite loaf lasts a mere 12 hours. Why? 'It is not wrapped up,' said Mr
Mark Aston, a partner with Andersen. 'One bakery told us that when they
tried - 10 years ago - to wrap the bread, it went green. We found out the
reasons. They did not bother first to cool the bread,' Mr Aston said.
The other problem is that the capital's old bakeries, which together produce
2,400 tons of bread for 10m people per day, are far away from retail
outlets. Andersen is recommending the setting up of private, small bakeries
near residential areas.
A team of UK bakers is now working in a Muscovite bakery to see how
recommendations can be adapt to reality, instead of coming up with
half-baked ideas.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Higher and mightier yet at Davos World Forum / A report from
a more than usually august annual economic gathering in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW, if any, organisations can rival Switzerland's World Economic Forum at
bringing together a broad cross section of the world's business and
government leaders. But the guest list at the annual conference, which ended
yesterday at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, defied belief.
The leaders of virtually all the eastern European countries - including the
warring Yugoslav states - were there. The heads of almost all the former
Soviet Union's republics came, and the one who did not - Mr Boris Yeltsin -
sent a message. South African leaders, black and white, spoke from the same
platform.
The attraction of the Davos gathering is that it gives a variety of leaders
an opportunity to meet each other, and top businessmen, in a private and
totally secure environment without having to respect the niceties of
protocol. Many such meetings in the past few days may turn out to have been
important, notably those between the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers
and between the Greek and Turkish leaders.
In general, however, the conference was simply overwhelmed by the eastern
European and Commonwealth of Independent States presence. In every corner,
there was a president from one of these countries trying to convince an
audience of his country's commitment to free market principles, of its
overall stability and, hence, of its worthiness for aid and foreign
investment.
This was easier for some than for others. The Russians had the most
difficulty, with a gaggle of bright young officials eager to express
contentious views in remarkably fluent English. According to one of them,
the CIS could break up within a few months leading to brutal border disputes
between the increasingly nationalistic republics. Another maintained that
there was no doubt that inflation and unemployment would soon be brought
under control and the rouble would proceed steadily toward convertibility.
(The rule at Davos is that remarks cannot be attributed publicly to an
individual unless he makes them in a plenary session.)
The eastern Europeans were more calm and convincing, and many acknowledged
that their main development problem was not so much a lack of capital as the
scarcity of skilled people who could design and execute sound projects.
Hence the aggressive appeal to western industrialists to bring their own
projects.
Some countries even brought glossy brochures promoting themselves. 'A new
state on the sunny side of the Alps,' proclaimed one from Slovenia.
A disturbing cultural question crept into the debates on European
integration, with some participants wondering if the EC was deliberately
dragging its feet on opening to eastern countries that did not share the
Judeo-Christian culture. Croatia and Slovenia stressed their 'western-ness'
in their appeals for admission to western European institutions, and trying
to distance themselves from their neighbours.
This was not lost on the others. 'Don't forget the new countries south of
the Sava, proclaimed the leader of one of the southern Yugoslav republics at
one session.
What the 1,000-odd businessmen, who had paid Dollars 10,000 apiece for the
privilege of facing all these begging bowls, made of it is hard to tell.
Many preferred to bury themselves in their own mini-summits for much of the
conference, leaving the preening politicians and their top advisers to their
academic and media hangers-on.
The Forum is supposed to be an occasion for discussion of global economic
issues, but this year at least, these took a back seat to politics, perhaps
because no one was able to think of anything positive to say. 'The tone is
very gloomy,' admitted Mr Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Forum also aims to push forward discussion on other leading issues of
the day, as suggested in the rather pretentious overall theme for this
year's conference: global co-operation and megacompetition.
Perhaps because global politics are evolving so quickly, discussion rarely
seemed to get beyond descriptions of the complexity of the issues involved
in building the much talked about new world order. But, as Mr Henry
Kissinger, one of the conference's ageing chairmen, reminded everyone,
compared to the grim confrontations of the cold war era, these were not bad
problems to have.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Turkish political violence threatens rights reforms
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL violence in Turkey is threatening to derail efforts by the
coalition government to introduce human rights reforms.
Mr Yasar Gunaydin, the Istanbul state prosecutor, yesterday became the fifth
security official killed in less than a week when he was gunned down outside
his home.
For many Turks, the attacks have provided a chilling reminder of the
violence which led to 1980 military coup, and the ousting of then minority
government of Mr Suleyman Demirel. The latter became prime minister again
following last October's election and has promised strong action against the
terrorists, while pushing ahead with human rights reforms.
The latest violence represents a serious setback to the reform process. It
is also expected to bolster opposition to the proposals presented last week
by Mr Mehmet Kahraman, the new human rights minister.
Turkey currently faces two terrorist threats. The first is Dev-Sol, an urban
left-wing group active in the 1970s which claimed responsibility for
yesterday's attack and for the killing of 30 policeman and five generals
last year, as well as several western businessmen and foreign diplomats.
More alarming has been the increased violence of the Kurdish separatist PKK
in the south-east. The army says it is preparing for a spring offensive by
the Syrian-backed PKK, which has exploited the power vacuum in neighbouring
north Iraq to pursue its eight-year struggle for an independent Kurdistan.
Turkey has signalled its determination to improve a human rights record,
which has long blighted its otherwise close relations with US and European
allies. Initial proposals centre on changes to the criminal procedure code,
which covers police conduct during arrest and interrogation.

FT  07 FEB 92 / Finns swing in favour of EC entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND comes closer to joining the European Community today when President
Mauno Koivisto is expected to announce support for entry.
In doing so, he will join most of Finland's political and industrial leaders
who have swung in favour of membership in recent months.
This month Prime Minister Esko Aho and his cabinet will decide on an EC
application, and parliament will vote on the issue.
The formal application will be made by mid-March, ensuring that Finland can
join Sweden and Austria in parallel entry negotiations. These could begin
late this year during the British EC presidency.
The only remaining doubts lie in the attitude of Mr Aho's ruling Centre
Party, which is divided over EC entry. Many rural supporters fear EC
membership will devastate Finland's highly-protected agriculture. Others
worry about the loss of sovereignty for a country that became independent
only 75 years ago.
Mr Aho only came out publicly in support of EC entry last weekend and may
still have trouble with his rank-and-file although most policy-makers
believe the country has little choice.
The swing towards EC entry follows the realisation that a 19-nation European
Economic Area (EEA) would only be a transitional arrangement, particularly
after Sweden opted in 1990 to seek EC entry.
In addition the collapse of the Soviet Union effectively ended 43 years of
being constrained by Moscow and gave Finnish policy-makers freedom to chart
a new course towards western Europe.
Since last summer virtually all Finnish industrialists have backed EC
membership. With nearly half Finland's trade with the EC, exporters realise
their prosperity is bound up with western Europe.
Negotiations with Brussels could prove difficult over agriculture, where the
Finnish government wants special treatment for its farmers.
Once terms are negotiated Finland plans a referendum on entry terms. After
that parliament must vote by a two-thirds majority under the constitution
twice, both before and after the 1995 election, if the country is to join
the EC.
Such a high hurdle is giving the anti-EC campaign some hope, particularly as
a recent opinion poll revealed only 51 per cent in favour of joining and 38
per cent against.

FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Iberia to seek Pta120bn extra
state funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBERIA, the Spanish airline, is likely to make a loss in excess of Pta50bn
(Dollars 498m) for 1991 and is seeking Pta120bn of extra funds from the
government.
The loss estimate compares with an earlier forecast of a Pta43m loss and
losses of close to Pta14bn in 1990.
The airline has been held in check by the Gulf war, escalating labour costs
and a series of acquisitions in Latin America that Iberia views as key
components in future realignments among European airlines.
The request for state funds will be formally made next week by Iberia's
board to the Instituto Nacional de Industria, INI, the public sector holding
company which owns the airline.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission vice-president responsible for
competition policies, is understood to have discussed Iberia's bid for a
cash injection during talks in Madrid last week with members of the Spanish
government.
Iberia discounted press reports that the re-capitalisation plan could come
under EC scrutiny and stressed it formed part of a five-year strategic
programme to put Iberia on a sounder financial footing.
The airline hopes to reduce its losses to Pta17.9bn this year and to return
to some sort of profit in 1993.
Iberia has begun to make its first staff cuts. It will shed 3,000 employees,
10 per cent of its labour force, this year through early retirements and
voluntary redundancies. By 1996 Iberia will have increased its fleet from
132 aircraft in 1991 to 176.
A key element in the strategic plan is the beachhead the company has
established in Latin America where it controls Aerolineas Argentinas, Viasa,
the Venezuelan carrier and Ladeco, a small airline in Chile.
Iberia operates hubs in Buenos Aires and in Santo Domingo and it is
scheduled to open one in Miami next week.
The drive into central and South America will be used by the company as
leverage in possible future negotiations to form alliances with other
European carriers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker, US secretary of state, yesterday urged the US Senate to
support swift ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction treaty with the
former Soviet Union.
In testimony to the Senate foreign relations committee, Mr Baker said the
treaty was vital to build stability between the US and the Commonwealth of
Independent States by 'locking in' agreements to slash each sides' arsenal
of long-range nuclear weapons.
Mr Baker also appealed to senators to support the administration's plans for
acting collectively with other countries to help the former Soviet republics
make the break from seven decades of communism and central planning.
'It is a once in a century opportunity,' said Mr Baker.
These words appeared aimed at staving off criticism at home and abroad that
the administration has been too timid in offering help to the republics.
In his testimony, Mr Baker rejected suggestions that the administration
should incorporate the latest nuclear arms reductions proposed by President
George Bush and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in an amended and
updated version of the Start treaty.
The Start treaty - negotiated over nine years - was signed last summer. It
would cut US offensive nuclear weapons by almost 30 per cent to about 9,000
warheads; Soviet strategic weapons would drop by almost 40 per cent, to
about 8,000 warheads.
Mr Baker also told the committee that China might be about to commit itself
to observing the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international pact to
block the spread of ballistic missiles. He said such a move would be a
'major step forward' on US proliferation concerns.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has approved a Dollars 300m (Pounds 165.7m) loan to Peru to
assist in the refinancing of the country's total foreign debt of about
Dollars 22bn.
The credit, the first of a series totalling Dollars 900m, comes much sooner
than expected.
The loan will not be physically disbursed, since it is part of an internal
accounting mechanism - similar to the 'rights accumulation' scheme employed
by the International Monetary Fund - to cover Peru's Dollars 900m arrears
with the World Bank. Once the total amount has been approved, Peru will be
eligible for fresh credits. The early decision on the loan demonstrates
World Bank approval of the speed of economic reform under President Alberto
Fujimori. Since Mr Fujimori took office 18 months ago, import tariffs have
been dramatically reduced and simplified, export subsidies ended and state
monopolies and trade controls eliminated.
The World Bank credit is repayable over 20 years with five years grace.
It is at a variable interest rate, currently around 7.7 per cent.
In what is being interpreted locally as a further sign of support and
approval on the part of the international financial organisations, Mr Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, will visit Lima next week.
President Fujimori, due to begin a visit to London today, says his economic
programme and anti-guerrilla strategy will defeat a Maoist insurgent
movement, Reuter reports from London.
'Return to the world financial community, the relative success of our
anti-inflation programme, structural reforms to make the state more
efficient and re-estabishment of a sense of authority are achievements which
mark a defeat for terrorists who fanatically seek to create chaos,' Mr
Fujimori said.

Wall Street
SHARE PRICES idled in a slim range yesterday before losing ground in late
trading with erosion in Eastman Kodak and Merck putting pressure on the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow fell 15.21 to 3,257.60 on fairly heavy volume of 262m shares. But
the decline did not represent overall market sentiment. On the big board,
leading issues outpaced declining by 953 to 747, while other market indices
showed gains on the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed 0.05 higher at
413.90 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite gained 0.08 to 228.87. On
Tuesday, the Dow set a new record of 3,272.81, up 38.69 on the day.
Bank and auto stocks, which helped spur Tuesday's rally, added to their
previous day's gains. In the banking sector, Citicorp rose Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 16 in heavy trading and Chemical Bank was Dollars  5/8 higher at
Dollars 29 5/8 .
Chrysler led the auto stocks, gaining Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 16 1/2 . Ford
added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 but General Motors lost Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 34 7/8 after firming in the morning.
Merck lost Dollars 1 1/8 in late trading after rising Dollars 4 1/2 on
Tuesday, bringing the issue to Dollars 157 3/4 . Late Tuesday the company's
Proscar drug received a favourable review from an advisory panel of the Food

WESFARMERS, the Australian agricultural services and coal group, yesterday
said it expects full-year profits for the year to June 30 to be better than
last year's, after reporting a 43.7 per cent rise in net profits for the
first half to December, Reuter reports from Perth.
The company said the half-year net profits of ADollars 19.2m (USDollars
14.7m), or 10.5 cents per share, up from ADollars 13.4m, or 7.3 cents, was
achieved on improved performances in its chemicals and fertilisers, dairy,
gas, transport and retail operations.
These were offset by declines in rural trading, insurance and coal mining
activities.
'While there has been some recovery in coal production during the second
quarter, the performance of the coal division remains below budget for the
first half, largely due to slower than anticipated productivity improvements
in the underground operations,' Wesfarmers said.
'On the positive side, the 50 per cent owned explosives company Dyno
Wesfarmers achieved an encouraging turnaround in profitability compared to
the first half last year,' it said.
Fertiliser sales to December were ahead of last year and ahead of budget and
the company expected to sell about 100,000 tonnes more than last year's
sales of 764,000 tonnes.
'But directors pointed out that as the majority of fertiliser sales take
place in the final quarter of the year, it remains difficult to predict with
confidence the end of year result.'
First-half pre-tax profits advanced to ADollars 30.96m from ADollars 21.26m
on lower sales of ADollars 566.77m compared with ADollars 584.97m.
Wesfarmers is offering ADollars 3.55 cash per share for Bunnings, the
Australian timber group, valuing it at ADollars 163m. The offer expires on
February 17. Bunnings has recommended shareholders reject the offer.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries move higher on refunding
announcement
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURIES wavered yesterday afternoon following the Treasury's refunding
announcement.
The 30-year bond initially lost ground after the Treasury said it would
offer Dollars 15bn in three-year notes, Dollars 11bn in 10-year notes and
Dollars 10bn in long-bonds next week. But the long bond later recovered as
the market reacted favourably to the Treasury's decision to keep the
proportion of long bonds stable to the rest of the issues in the quarterly
refunding sale. The details of the refunding were essentially in line with
market expectations.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted  3/16 higher at 103,
yielding 7.73 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the
open market and Fed funds traded at 4 per cent in the afternoon. The Fed's
perceived target for the rate is 4 per cent.
STRONG demand for medium and long-dated UK government bonds lifted gilt
prices and helped the Bank of England sell all three of its tap issues
yesterday.
The three tap stocks - Pounds 150m of the 9 1/2 per cent Treasury loan due
1999, Pounds 150m of the 12 1/4 per cent Exchequer stock due 1999, and
Pounds 250m of the 9 1/2 per cent Conversion stock due 2005 - sold out on
the first day of issue. Traders said there has been considerable pent-up
demand for these maturities, and there is some speculation the Bank may take
advantage of the current bullishness in the gilts market to announce further
tap issues soon.
Volume in the futures market was relatively high at about 40,000 contracts.
Gains at the short end of the curve were limited, as traders said the recent
wage settlement for German steelworkers had dashed hopes of a cut in German
interest rates and therefore reduced the chances of lower UK interest rates.
However, at the long end, the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt rose from 116
7/32 to 116 3/8 by late afternoon.
FRENCH government bond prices fell as worries about the domestic political
situation and the likelihood of German interest rates remaining high,
prompted some switching out of the market.
The minority Socialist government continues to face criticism following the
admission to hospital of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Mr George
Habash. Traders said some investors used this as an excuse for a sell-off.
On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the March bond futures contract
closed at 108.10, down 0.22 from Tuesday.
Elsewhere, German government bonds ended slightly lower on the day as
worries about wage settlements continued to trouble the market. Some traders
said the sharp jump in unemployment figures for eastern Germany, released
yesterday, could have a moderating effect on the current wage talks. The
Liffe bund futures contract slipped from 88.03 to 87.88 by late afternoon.
JAPANESE government bond prices dropped on concern about the recent rise in
short-term interest rates and worries about possible new supply in the
market.
The JGB market started the day on a strong note, following Tuesday's
firmness in the US Treasury bond market. Concern over the rise in short-term
interest rates in recent days prompted some profit-taking.
Rates on three-month certificates of deposit have crept up to 5.2 per cent,
having fallen as low as 4.95 per cent last month, wiping out hopes of an
imminent cut in the Official Discount Rate.

loss deepens

<TEXT>
LTV, the US steel, aerospace and energy group which has been living for five
years under the protection of the bankruptcy courts, yesterday reported a
deepening of fourth-quarter operating losses, which it blamed on the US
recession.
LTV reported a net loss of Dollars 8.5m, or 12 cents a share, an improvement
on the loss of Dollars 19.5m, or 23 cents, reported in the same period of
1990. Sales dipped from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 1.52bn.
In the full year, it made Dollars 74.1m on sales of Dollars 5.99bn, compared
with income of Dollars 70.9m on sales of Dollars 6.14bn in 1990.
However, the figures were flattered by a third-quarter income tax refund of
Dollars 129.7m and related fourth-quarter interest income of Dollars 53.3m.
At the operating level, it lost Dollars 56.3m in the final quarter, up from
Dollars 25.9m a year ago.
Its steel operations reported a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars
54m, up from Dollars 11.1m, due to lower prices and shipments and higher
wage costs. Its energy products business produced a loss of Dollars 16.3m,
compared with a profit of Dollars 1.4m, mainly because of charges for excess
or slow-moving inventory.
However, its aerospace and defence business, which LTV agreed this week to
sell to a joint venture between Lockheed and Martin Marietta, produced
operating income of Dollars 14m, up from Dollars 8.8m in the final quarter
of 1990.
LTV has been involved in years of difficult negotiation with its creditors
and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation over the terms of a
restructuring which could bring it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
It said yesterday it intended to file a new plan of reorganisation on
February 14, and that it had made 'substantial progress' toward bringing
creditor groups to agreement.

<TEXT>
A TEXAS jury has awarded more than Dollars 550m in damages to former
bondholders of Miniscribe, the now defunct disk drive manufacturer.
The investors had accused Miniscribe's former chairman, as well as its
accounting firm and investment bankers, of fraud.
The defendants were found guilty of fraud and negligence and ordered to pay
punitive damages. The suit was filed by Kemper Management, representing
investors who had bought about Dollars 20m in Miniscribe bonds.
Mr Q. T. Wiles, chairman of Miniscribe during the period of the alleged
fraud, was ordered to pay Dollars 250m.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the international accounting firm, was ordered to pay an
additional Dollars 200m; damages against Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San
Francisco investment banking group of which Mr Wiles is a former vice
chairman, were assessed at Dollars 45m. Mr William Hambrecht, chairman of
Hambrecht &amp; Quist, was ordered to pay Dollars 35m.
All the defendants said they would appeal against the verdict and damages
award. The judge has given them until next week to file arguments before he
approves or revises the jury's award.
The judgment is the first in connection with several pending lawsuits which
followed the bankruptcy of Miniscribe in 1990.

<TEXT>
TIME Warner, the entertain-ment and media group, yesterday announced plans
to commit up to Dollars 1.6bn by 1995 to acquire the 18 per cent of its
publicly quoted American Television and Communications (ATC) cable
television subsidiary that it does not already own.
ATC, which is the second biggest US cable television operator, recorded
Dollars 120m net income in 1990, on revenues of Dollars 1.1bn.
The complicated arrangement would assign to the holders of 19.7m outstanding
ATC shares a series of Time Warner redeemable reset notes in exchange for
their stock.
The notes will not bear any interest until August 1995, at which point Time
Warner will have the right to offer the noteholders either cash or a mixture
of cash and other Time Warner debentures with a value of Dollars 82.50 a
note.
The total value of cash and/or debentures would thus be Dollars 1.6bn, which
compares with the present Dollars 1.15bn market value of the 18 per cent of
ATC equity listed on the over-the-counter market.
On Wall Street, ATC's shares closed Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 58.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Berlitz acts to bolster its
takeover defences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC) that discovered a majority of its shares were pledged improperly to
banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, yesterday adopted a
'poison pill' scheme designed to deter an unwanted change in the control of
the company.
The plan provides that for the next 18 months any acquisition of 20 per cent
or more of Berlitz that is not approved by the board will trigger the
ability of all other shareholders to buy additional stock at Dollars 1 a
share. This would dilute the unwanted newcomer's share purchase. A
subsidiary part of the plan would continue from 1993 to 1996.
Mr Joe Rodgers, chairman of Berlitz, described the plan as meeting the
'special challenges currently facing this company'.
At present, most of the 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake that is nominally owned
by Macmillan is actually in the hands of five banks and companies that
received the stock as collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Macmillan has
brought injunctions to prevent the banks from selling the Berlitz stock.
MCC itself is operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, in a complex
transatlantic arrangement that requires co-ordination between New York and
UK court-appointed administrators.
Mr Rodgers stressed that the poison pill was not directed toward any
particular company that owned Berlitz stock or may wish to own it. 'Given
our experience under Maxwell control, we are wary of the many risks that a
change in control might impose,' he explained.
Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), the renamed Columbia Pictures studio in
Hollywood, last night named Mr Mel Harris as the new president of its
reorganised television division. The new arm will combine the studio's
previously disparate television production and distribution businesses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STONE-Consolidated, the Canadian arm of Chicago's Stone Containers, is
threatening to shut its Bathurst, New Brunswick, pulp and packaging paper
mill unless the Canadian Paperworkers' Union accepts a tough survival plan.
The dispute highlights the crisis in the eastern Canada pulp and paper
industry after two years of depressed markets.
One operation of the modern Bathurst mill normally ships to
Stone-Consolidated's Bridgewater division at Ellesmere Port, in the UK, but
was closed last November because of high inventory and poor prices.
Two other similar mills in Quebec were also shut by other companies.
The corrugated paper machine, however, continued to operate and
Stone-Consolidated said it hoped to re-open the pulp mill this April if
markets improved.
Product prices, however, are still at record lows after accounting for
inflation. The company asked the union to negotiate a survival package,
including a 20 per cent reduction in wage costs. The plan would cut staff by
25 per cent.
Stone Containers bought the former Consolidated-Bathurst from Power Corp of
Canada in 1989 for CDollars 2.6bn (USDollars 2.2bn). The company is also a
big newsprint producer, and its Quebec mills are planning to reduce
operations early this spring.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Re, the largest reinsurance company in the US, yesterday reported an
increase in after-tax profits for the year, to Dollars 656.7m from Dollars
613.6m, although operating income excluding realised gains had been static.
The fourth-quarter advance in net profit was from Dollars 155.5m in 1990 to
Dollars 184.2m.
This figure for the final 1991 quarter was described as 'unsatisfactory' by
General Re, but it added that the figure would have been only 'marginally
so' had the big Oakland, California, fire not occured.
General Re said its underwriting results had fallen 'short of our goals',
but pointed out that they compared favourably with the rest of the
reinsurance industry.
The combined underwriting/expense ratio for the year increased from 99 per
cent to 102 per cent, year-on-year, and in the fourth quarter alone reached
103 per cent.
Operating income for the year, excluding realised gains, amounted to Dollars
561.8m, compared with Dollars 566m, with the fourth quarter showing a small
improvement at Dollars 147.6m, against Dollars 146.8m.
Revenues during the year increased slightly from Dollars 2.95bn to Dollars
3.2bn
Shares in General Re, known to be operating in a weak reinsurance market,
closed Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 95 1/8.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Engineer seeks to build
confidence - The new bank chief has a tough job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pertti Voutilainen must have one of the most unenviable jobs in Finland
at the moment. The 51-year-old engineer who has spent most of his working
life with Outokumpu, the mining company, took over as chief executive of
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's leading commercial bank, only five
weeks ago.
But as he announced the bank's disastrous results for 1991 with a FM1.643bn
(Dollars 378m) loss yesterday, he might be forgiven for wondering whether he
had been sensible in agreeing to try to rescue a once-proud and prudent
bank.
His hapless predecessor, Mr Jaakko Lassila, resigned last October,
suggesting there was a personal vendetta against him in the Finnish media.
'In today's unstable and turbulent conditions, this kind of persecution is
more detrimental to the bank than it can be to me personally,' he wrote in
his resignation letter to the bank's supervisory board chairman.
It is in these troubled circumstances that Mr Voutilainen must try to revive
the bank's profitability. 'It was a difficult decision for me to come to
KOP,' he admits. 'I was given half-an-hour to decide on taking the job.'
But after last year's scandals, which included a breach of stock exchange
rules leading to the KOP board being fined last week, and the bizarre
share-dealing operation of New York-based financier Mr Pertti Kouri, the
bank needed to look outside its own staff to find a saviour.
Mr Voutilainen admits he has no direct banking experience. 'I'm not
sophisticated enough to get involved in the kind of transactions the bank
has carried out recently,' he admits. But he was a long-time member of KOP's
supervisory board and is finding his feet very quickly as he grapples with
the bank's massive problems.
A small working group has been set up under his chairmanship to chart a new
course for the bank. This will be ready with a report by April and after
that KOP can expect to see changes in both its management and priorities.
Mr Voutilainen is already clear about what needs to be done. 'We have to
restore confidence in the bank,' he says. 'Our image has been damaged.' He
emphasises the need to 'improve the quality of the bank's services' to its
customers.
The bank's staff has been demoralised, he admits, by last year's events, and
he has spent much of his time since arriving in the job 'walking round the
organisation' trying to convince his employees to believe in themselves.
His style of leadership already looks different from that of his rather
patriarchal and secretive predecessor, Mr Lassila. 'I want to be more open,'
he says. 'We have been too reluctant to tell the whole truth. People do not
like that.'
He is concerned that many bank customers may have lost confidence in the
Finnish banking system.
Mr Voutilainen is also clear that KOP must concentrate its efforts on what
it knows best and that means sticking to basic banking operations.
'It would be a deception to expect that everything will change overnight,'
he warns. 'The general operating environment holds little promise of drastic
amelioration.'
He explains there is no danger of a KOP collapse. 'We can stand one or two
years without any profits,' he says. 'But banks live on confidence. If you
lose that you can't continue.'
Although only five weeks into the job, he already sees a big difference
between running a bank and an industrial company. 'In industry, you can take
a pause before making a decision. But in the bank that is not possible.
Decisions have to be taken much more quickly,' he explains.
What he needs more than ever, he admits, from KOP's shareholders, is
'patience,' time to ensure the bank can once again 'bring a competitive
yield on their investment'.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial Italian media mogul, yesterday
cleared the first hurdle in his campaign to take charge of La Cinq, the
bankrupt French television channel, when his FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270m) rescue
plan was referred by La Cinq's judicial administrator to the Paris
commercial court.
The Berlusconi rescue package involves injecting FFr1.5bn of new capital
into the station, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, in two
tranches of FFr700m and FFr800m.
Mr Berlusconi, who currently owns 25 per cent of La Cinq, then intends to
cut costs - by reducing the workforce from 910 to 613 - in an attempt to
make the channel profitable.
Mr Hubert Lafont, La Cinq's administrator, has been studying the Berlusconi
bid since Monday. The proposals from two other would-be white knights -
Vogue, the French record company, and an unknown individual - were rejected
as unsuitable.
However, the Berlusconi rescue still faces a number of obstacles. First, the
Tribunal de Commerce, the Paris commercial court, will study it to see
whether it is financially viable. Second, the Conseil Superieur de
l'Audiovisuel, the body that regulates the French broadcasting system, must
decide whether it will enable La Cinq to fulfil its remit.
Meanwhile, the Berlusconi camp must press ahead with the financial
arrangements for the proposed recapitalisation. A general assembly of La
Cinq's shareholders will be held in two weeks to vote on the first capital
increase with the second recapitalisation following two months later.
Mr Berlusconi has said that Fininvest, the company through which he holds
his La Cinq stake, is committed to reinvesting in La Cinq.

troubled Attwoods

   By ANDREW BOLGER and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTWOODS, the waste man-agement company which recently made a Pounds 80m
rights issue to cut debt, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Stuart
Lee as finance director.
His departure had been widely expected following the deeply-discounted
rights issue in October, which had to be revised after objections from
institutional shareholders.
Attwoods admitted then that it had suffered a 'credit crunch' after
borrowing short-term funds to make acquisitions, and then failed to get
borrowings rolled over when one of its US banks went under.
The board has appointed a finance committee chaired by Mr Les Haworth, a
non-executive director of Attwoods who is also chief financial officer of
Laidlaw, the Canadian waste management and school transport group that owns
a 29.9 per cent stake in the British company.
Mr Haworth, a chartered accountant who was born and educated in Britain,
will oversee the financial management of Attwoods until a new finance
director is appointed, which is expected shortly.
Mr Ken Foreman, chairman and chief executive of Attwoods, said the group
might appoint another non-executive director. Three Laidlaw executives
joined the board after the rights issue, including Mr Donald Jackson, chief
executive of the Canadian group.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman of ADT, also stepped down as non-executive
director. Laidlaw acquired its initial stake in Attwoods in 1989 from ADT,
the Bermuda-based car auction and security group. Sir Denis Thatcher is
expected to continue as deputy chairman.
Mr Foreman said trading conditions continued to be tough, although all but
one of the group's divisions were ahead of last year's levels.
Attwoods said Mr Lee, who joined the group in 1990 from Pleasurama, had left
to pursue other business interests.

The money was syphoned off to support the totter-ing private companies of
the late Mr Robert Max-well, Mr Kevin Maxwell's father.
The affidavit arrived at 9pm at Mr Cooper's offices at Robson Rhodes, the
accountancy firm, although the court had ordered its deli-very by 'close of
busi-ness'.
Last week Mr Kevin Maxwell lost his appeal against the December judgment of
Mr Justice Hoffmann that he must answer Robson Rhodes' questions about the
operation of BIM.
Mr Maxwell had been arguing that he had a common law right to remain silent
to avoid self-incrimination, but this was rejected as it was ruled that the
Insolvency Act, under which BIM brought its claim, abrogated this privilege.
BIM was the manager and investment trustee of a common investment fund of
about Pounds 700m established for the pension funds of many of the companies
in the collapsed business em-pire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Intel and Sharp form chip alliance

<TEXT>
INTEL, the US semiconductor maker, and Sharp, the Japanese electronics
company, yesterday announced a long-term partnership to develop flash memory
devices, one of the fastest-growing products in the electronics industry.
The agreement is bound to provoke controversy in the US as Intel has chosen
a Japanese rather than an American partner in an area where Intel has a
clear technological lead and supplies 85 per cent of the world market.
US companies have been heavily criticised for selling leading technology to
Japanese companies, which later come back to dominate the field.
A flash memory device is a tiny semiconductor chip which retains stored
electronic information even when power is switched off and can be erased and
reprogrammed.
It is expected to replace most disk drives in portable computers because it
is smaller and lighter and uses less power. It could be used in consumer
products ranging from tapeless recording devices the size of a pen to
electronic still cameras the size of a credit card.
The world market for flash memory devices is about Dollars 130m a year.
However, the value of the market has quadrupled in each of the past four
years while prices have halved annually. Dataquest projects a market of
Dollars 1.5bn a year by 1995.
Intel said it required a strong partner in order to maintain leadership in
what was expected to be a rapidly-growing, highly competitive market in
which all leading semiconductor makers were investing large amounts of
money.
Mr Robert Reed, Intel senior vice-president, said Sharp brought to the
partnership a research and development capability, the ability to push
forward rapidly with manufacturing and a strong presence in consumer
electronics. Intel's business is geared entirely to the computer industry.
The two companies will collaborate on developing the next generation of more
powerful flash memories, in which lines as small as 0.4 and 0.6 microns are
etched into silicon wafers. A micron is about one-hundredth the width of a
human hair. Production is to begin at a Sharp facility in Fukuyama in 1994.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Lonrho urged to change board: Shareholders want trading
group to appoint non-executive directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, is under pressure from its
shareholders to appoint non-executive directors to its board as a consultant
yesterday criticised the group's corporate governance.
Pensions Investment Research Consultants acts as a consultant to private
pension funds in the UK and the US. Ms Anne Simpson, PIRC's joint managing
director, said: 'Lonrho's corporate governance has deteriorated in the
course of the year from a low base. It is the only company in the FTSE-100
which does not have a single non-executive on its board.
'We recommend that shareholders set Lonrho a timetable for producing a team
of independent directors with first class track records to bring the board
up to strength.'
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, is the only other
FTSE-100 company without non-executives. However, its eight-strong advisory
board is considered to do the work of non-executives.
Lonrho's institutional shareholders, which include the South African Mutual
Life Assurance Society, Phillips and Drew Fund Managers, Legal and General,
Robert Fleming Investment Management and Postel Investment Management, have
expressed similar views to the Lonrho's directors in meetings over the past
10 days.
A number of fund managers yesterday said that they strongly backed PIRC's
comments. One fund manager criticised Lonrho for not taking corporate
governance seriously, while another complained of the conglomerate's
'refusal to accept non-executive directors'.
The issue is likely to come to a head after Lonrho publishes its annual
report on February 26. PIRC is drawing up a detailed study on the group
which it plans to send to shareholders.
Lonrho's banks, led by Standard Chartered, Barclays and National
Westminster, and two Swiss banks, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation,
would also like to see the appointment of non-executive directors.
While they have told the group that they are not calling for sweeping
changes they would also like to see a replacement for Mr Terry Robinson, who
resigned from the group's board last month.
Lonrho said it does not believe the appointment of non-executives is
necessary.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group which is steadily expanding into the
software side of the consumer electronics industry, is paying Dollars 175m
for 25 per cent of Whittle Com-munications, the US media company.
Philips will acquire its shares mainly from Time Warner, the US media group
whose holding will fall from 50 per cent to 37 per cent, and from Associated
Newspapers of the UK, whose stake will fall from 33 per cent to 24.6 per
cent.
The Dutch company plans to increase its holding to 33 per cent by the end of
1994, with the additional price to be determined by Whittle's financial
per-formance.
Mr Chris Whittle, the US company's founder and chairman, will reduce his
holding from 11 per cent to 8.5 per cent, while the combined shareholding of
senior management will decline to 4.9 per cent from 6 per cent.
For Philips, which launched its new 'interactive' compact disc player, CD-I,
in the US in late 1991, the deal marks a further step in its quest to wed
its electronics hardware with software such as music, videos, consumer
information and educational programming.
Over the past year, for example, Philips has steadily been building up a
network of investments in video-rental chains in continental Europe, the US
and the UK.
Whittle, which is based in Tennessee and has annual sales of around Dollars
210m, produces a daily news programme called 'Channel One' that is already
screened in 9,000 US high schools. The 12-minute broadcasts include two
minutes of advertisements.
It also makes and sells magazines and videos for doctors' waiting rooms and
hospitals.
Philips said it would work with Whittle on evaluating the feasibility of
setting up a network of new schools in the US.
'The involvement in Whittle will bring substantial new impetus for the
development and application of consumer-oriented electronic technology,' Mr
Jan Timmer, Philips president, said.
Duracell, the US battery maker, is forming an alliance with Toshiba Battery
of Japan and Varta Battarie of Germany to develop nickel metal hydride
(Ni-MH) rechargeable batteries.
All three have individually invested in researching Ni-MH battery technology
and will now co-ordinate their development activities.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Cash cushion from sale of silverware: American Express's
attempt to raise Dollars 1bn by floating division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Express is not a bank, but the US travel and financial services
giant has been afflicted by some of the same kind of heavy credit losses as
many big US banks. The answer at American Express, as at big banks such as
Citicorp, is to try to bolster capital.
This week's decision by American Express to try to raise up to Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 553m) by floating off a chunk of its credit card processing division
 -one of the group's five main subsidiary operations - does not therefore
suggest a strategic shift at the financial services and travel group.
Rather, the fund-raising plan says more about the group's need for a cash
cushion at a time of great uncertainty in the US financial services sector.
The equity offer, one of the largest American Express fund raising exercises
in years, comes after a difficult 1991 for the core Travel Related Services
(TRS) division, which includes the plastic card and travellers cheque
businesses. TRS reported a Dollars 697m pre-tax increase in its credit loss
provisions last year, and a 59 per cent slump in net income to Dollars 396m.
More than 50 per cent of TRS's 1991 loss provisions resulted from losses at
its troubled Optima credit card division. The Optima losses appeared to
result from poor credit risk judgments, and a management reshuffle was
instituted last autumn to deal with the problem.
Yesterday, American Express unveiled a relaunch of the Optima card which
includes a three-tiered pricing structure that rewards customers with good
credit behaviour.
The credit losses at Optima and elsewhere are also a sign of the US
recession. This is why the comparison of American Express with banks is not
at all far-fetched - American Express is a financial services group that in
1991 had worldwide charge card volume of Dollars 111bn and Dollars 23bn of
travellers cheque sales.
A fundamental difference is that banks are forced by US capital adequacy
rules to maintain certain capital ratios whereas for American Express the
external discipline comes from the market. The judgment of credit rating
agencies such as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's may therefore have a greater
effect on the group's need to maintain capital strength in order to raise
funds on the market.
Both of these credit rating agencies downgraded American Express long-term
debt last year, with S&amp;P nudging its rating down from AA to AA- last July
and Moody's reducing its rating from Aa2 to A1 in November. The latter move
followed the news of credit losses at Optima.
While several Wall Street analysts believe TRS earnings will recover in line
with the US economy, most doubt that TRS will achieve the kind of rapid
growth it experienced in the 1980s.
Mr John Keefe of Lipper Analytical Services says the new equity offer plan
is one way for American Express 'to strengthen their equity to show they
continue to be a strong company and to improve their credit rating so they
can borrow more to fund card operations'.
But Mr Keefe notes that in selling up to 45 per cent of the card processing
division, American Express 'is raising money by selling some of its family
silverware'.
The silverware in question is a division until now called Information
Services Corporation (ISC) but its name is being changed for the public
share offer to First Data Corporation to reflect the largest part of ISC,
the First Data Resources card processing unit.
First Data Resources, which is the largest third-party card processor in the
US and in the UK, accounted for about half of ISC's 1991 net profit of
Dollars 118m and revenues of Dollars 995m. The company was enlarged last
summer with the Pounds 146m purchase of the Basildon-based Signet card
processor in the UK, which helped boost 1991 revenues by 20 per cent. The
card processing business accounts for some 7,000 of ISC's 17,000 employees.
Although calculations of the value of floating up to 45 per cent of ISC on
the stock market - which suggests a total market capitalisation of Dollars
1.8bn to Dollars 2bn - are based on earnings multiples related to the card
processing business, ISC is more than just card processing.
The company also includes a money order and payment systems operation,
information management systems for US hospitals, telephone operator services
and telemarketing, billing services for cable television companies and
inter-active phone systems that are part of a joint venture with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
American Express declines to provide a breakdown of the profitability of
these businesses, but says all were in the black last year.
American Express first bought the company now known as ISC in 1980, when it
paid Dollars 50m to acquire First Data Resources which had Dollars 54m of
revenues that year. The company was then developed by a string of small and
medium-sized acquisitions.
Between 1983 and 1985 some of First Data's shares were shuttled on and off
the stock market by American Express. In 1983, Dollars 60m was raised by the
flotation of 25 per cent of First Data; two years later American Express
bought back the shares for Dollars 250m.
By 1989, the operations of First Data, then a part of the TRS division, were
reshuffled inside the group and it became a free-standing division known as
ISC. Since 1989 the division has lifted earnings steadily.
While analysts say there may be some logic in bringing back outside
shareholders, the consensus is that the upcoming share offer is simply a
cash-raising tool. Mr Jim Robinson, American Express chairman, expressed as
much when he said the funds would come 'at a time when a strong capital base
is especially important for financial services companies'.
An aide to Mr Robinson summed up the fundraising exercise in terms that any
US banker or corporate executive can appreciate: 'Cash is king.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / Bank could not act earlier on BCCI fraud claims, MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England was powerless to intervene in the affairs of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International - before closing it down last year -
because 'widespread pervasive fraud over a long period was not the
impression we had been gathering', Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's director in
charge of banking supervision, said yesterday.
In answer to questions from a House of Commons committee, Mr Quinn said
that, between 1983 and 1991, the Bank of England had been striving to get a
proper international supervisory structure in place. 'As soon as we got
evidence of fraud, we acted,' he said.
When Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour MP on the Treasury and Civil Service
committee, asked what action the Bank authorities had taken after he named
BCCI as a possibly fraudulent operation in speeches in the Commons in 1985
and afterwards, Mr Quinn said allegations against banks were not uncommon.
'We don't simply look at them, smile, and pass on.'
When he remarked there were clear procedures in the Bank of England for
investigating allegations such as those contained in Mr Sedgemore's
speeches, the MP replied: 'You didn't check with me, so there seems to have
been no check at all.'
Mr Sedgemore also pressed Mr Quinn on the role of ICIC, a foundation closely
linked with BCCI, whose accounts were qualified by its auditors in October
1989 because the value of its shareholding in BCCI could not be known.
Mr Roger Barnes, assistant director and head of banking supervision at the
Bank of England, said he had not been aware that ICIC was part of the group.
Mr Sedgemore had raised very complex matters which he would like notice to
answer.
Asked why the Bank, unlike the US authorities, had not blocked BCCI's entry
into the UK in 1972, Mr Quinn said no legal powers had then existed which
would have enabled it to do so. In 1973 it tried to slow down the growth of
BCCI's branch network in the UK because the speed with which the bank was
setting up branches raised questions about how closely it was controlling
its operations.
Mr Quinn said the 'nuclear threat' of putting the bank out of business could
in any case not have been carried out in the mid-1980s because the UK would
not have carried the rest of the international banking community with it.

FT  06 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Car dealers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's verdict on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the
motor trade was that while it could have been a lot worse, there is no great
rush to buy the sector. Car dealers may have escaped a radical shake-up of
the sort inflicted on the brewing industry. But there is no escaping the
recession, hence the modest reaction in the distributors' shares. Inchcape
was an exception, but that is probably accounted for as much by its recent
acquisition of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn as by the proposed relaxation of
import restrictions on Japanese cars. Its Toyota franchise means it should
benefit more than most, if only because it can concentrate on importing the
most lucrative models while Toyota will produce its cheaper cars in the UK.
More generally, the prospect of multiple-franchise dealerships remains
sufficiently distant for there to be little reason to mark up share prices
now. In the medium term, dealers are as vulnerable as ever to manufacturers'
tendency to grab back franchises once they become seriously profitable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At its close yesterday, the FT-SE had fallen 24 points since the start of
the week. In the same period Wall Street had risen 60 points. Such
divergence is unsurprising at a time when the UK market has an eye on the
German economy. It could also be quickly corrected. Nevertheless, it is a
reminder of the increasingly fallible nature of the London-Wall Street
connection. It is commonplace among London brokers to argue that Wall Street
looks expensive and London correspondingly cheap. But the same argument was
being advanced five months ago. Since then, London has underperformed Wall
Street by 12 per cent.
One of the arguments for London's cheapness rests on its dividend yield. But
even before the London market's traditional link with the US was severed by
the UK joining the ERM, such comparisons were suspect. Ten years ago, the UK
market yielded less than Wall Street. Its yield has risen fairly steadily in
relative terms ever since, so that it now stands at 4.9 per cent compared
with Wall Street's 2.9 per cent.
Nor have high yields been a guarantee of performance within the London
market itself. Figures from County NatWest show the London market's two
worst sectors in the year to end-January as construction and property, with
annual returns including dividends of minus 17 per cent and minus 14 per
cent respectively. By this time last month the yield on construction shares
had risen to 9 per cent and on property shares to 7 per cent. Even in terms
of total return, both have underperformed since. Logically, all this
reinforces the argument that if the ERM does its job the UK market is going
to be a screaming buy. It still seems a little early for UK investors to bet
on it.

FT  06 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone has bought itself a larger share of the portable telephone markets
in Sweden and Denmark. But the Pounds 21m price tag on its participation is
at odds with the fact that not so long ago, cellular licences were being
given away. Vodafone's strategy of building a European network is proving
less simple and much more expensive than expected, not least because
management has discovered how easy it is to trip over unpredictable
political barriers. In the medium term, the cash flow from the UK business
is easily robust enough to support competitive bids for overseas franchises.
All the same, the group needs a success or two to reassure its shareholders.
Indeed, the story since the demerger from Racal last year has become one of
frustration for investors. The group was too quick in November to hint at an
end to the recession. When evidence of better trading failed to materialise,
the market took note. Vodafone's shares have underperformed by 8 per cent
over the past three months.
Despite the improvement in January's business figures, the shares now face
an uneven two-way pull. On one side is the prospect of UK economic recovery
later this year. On the other is next year's arrival of competition from the
PCN companies which promise a much cheaper telecoms service. Vodafone will
presumably have to come up with price cuts to persuade its existing
customers not to jump ship. There is also much to be said for launching a
marketing campaign before the rival is actually available. Logic says that
Vodafone cannot hang on to its near-60 per cent return on capital while it
is thus defending its market share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,547.1 (-9.7)
The thesis of a new year revival in the UK housing market is already wearing
thin. Yesterday's news that the Halifax building society's house price index
registered a further 1.2 per cent fall in January - after dropping 1.3 per
cent in December - is alarming enough. What may be of more concern to the
government is the developing trend year on year. Even assuming no further
softening of prices in the next couple of months, the annual rate of decline
could be as much as 5-6 per cent by the time of a spring election.
Any recovery based on the level of inquiries rather than firm orders
deserves to be treated with suspicion. Recent reports of bustle in the
showrooms also belong in the context of last year's Gulf war, the suspension
of stamp duty until August and the surprise half-point cut in the mortgage
rate. If a more lively market cannot be created in these conditions, it is
hard to see how one will be, short of further price cuts by the builders
themselves.
Interestingly enough, the contracting sector - which underperformed the
market in January for the fourth successive month - has largely ignored the
hype. A handful of quality second-liners such as Persimmon and Wilson Bowden
have seen some demand, but investors looking to buy building-related
cyclicals have mostly focused their attention on building materials. For the
moment, there seems little reason to reverse this stance. The over-riding
requirement for the housebuilders is to write down their landbanks to a
level where they can again start making pre-tax profits. As 1991 came to a
close, the sort of provisions being bandied about the market were already
fairly bleak. Another month of weakening house prices and they will be even
bleaker.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Fed should consider interest rate cuts, says White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve should be prepared to ease monetary policy further if
the economic recovery expected this spring fails to materialise, Mr Michael
Boskin, the White House chief economic adviser, indicated yesterday.
Releasing the 1992 Economic Report of the President, he said monetary policy
had to be 'forward-looking'. He said the Fed had been surprised by the very
slow monetary growth despite repeated cuts in interest rates.
The White House, as spelt out in last week's budget, expects the US economy
to remain sluggish early in 1992, with first-quarter growth of 0 per cent to
1.5 per cent at an annual rate, but the picture should improve later in the
year. Mr Boskin predicted a 2.2 per cent growth through 1992 if Congress
adopted Mr Bush's anti-recession proposals, but just 1.6 per cent if they
were not approved.
Mr Boskin defended the administration's claim that budget measures to
stimulate the economy would raise annual growth in gross domestic product by
0.4 percentage points in coming years. This reflected 'confidence effects'
as well as the impact on incentives of measures such as the proposed capital
gains tax cut and temporary investment allowances for companies.
The report insisted that fundamental conditions for growth were falling into
place, with interest rates lower than they have been in decades and
inflation expected to stay down in the near-term.
But the White House's economic forecast for 1992 assumed the Fed board would
ease interest rates again if necessary, Mr Boskin said.
In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
said he would not rule out further interest rate cuts if the economy failed
to improve but he hoped the existing stimulus would be sufficient.
Mr Boskin acknowledged that the administration had not yet gained control of
the budget deficit. There was 'still a huge gaping hole in the budget', he
said, referring to this year's expected shortfall of Dollars 400bn (Pounds
221bn), a record 6.7 per cent of GDP.
The best way to reduce the deficit in the medium-term would be to restrain
growth of spending on entitlement programmes such as health care for the
elderly, he said. This would free resources for private sector investment.
The report also contains a detailed analysis of trends in family incomes. It
seeks to demolish claims that incomes have stagnated in the past two decades
and argues that researchers have not corrected properly for changes in the
cost of living.
The report says mid-range family income has risen 24 per cent in real terms
since 1967. The rise since the 1973 business cycle peak, however, was a
modest 5.9 per cent.

FT  06 FEB 92 / ICI to be salt seller in Pounds 40m mine deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries abandoned another part of its history in
pursuit of modern profit yesterday when it announced the sale of Britain's
only salt mine.
The mine, at Winsford, Cheshire, dates from 1844. It is being sold to an
investor group led by US-based D. George Harris &amp; Associates which is also
buying ICI's salt plant at Weston Point, Cheshire.
The operations are to be named Salt Union but the new owners hope to avoid
the fate of the first Salt Union founded on the site in 1888 with the aim of
creating a salt cartel.
The first Salt Union flopped, despite raising Pounds 3.7m in what was then
the City's largest rights issue. It paid only one ordinary dividend - in
1896 - and after 1898 had an unfortunate habit of passing the preference
dividend. It was acquired by ICI in 1937.
Told about the chequered history of the Salt Union, Mr William Sichko,
vice-president of human resources of the US operations of D. George Harris &amp;
Associates, said: 'We'll certainly be aiming to improve on their results. We
picked the name, not the legacy.'
Although the new company is the largest salt business in the UK, Mr Sichko
said there was no intention to emulate the old cartel. The acquisition,
which the groups hope to complete by the spring, is not subject to
regulatory approval.
The modern businesses, unlike their predecessor, are profitable, according
to ICI, which will receive Pounds 40m from the US buyer. The operations have
an average annual turnover of Pounds 45m.
ICI said the salt businesses, which employ about 200 people, fall outside
the group's long-term strategy of developing operations in which it has
strong global positions.
The rock salt mine at Winsford is about 150 feet deep and covers 1,255 acres
served by 100 miles of underground roadways. It fulfils two-thirds of the
demand for road de-icing salt in the UK.
The Weston Point operations supply some white salt for human consumption but
most of its output is used by the chemical industry.
ICI is acquiring Dow Chemical's brake fluid business in Europe, Africa and
the Middle East for an unspecified sum. Dow is buying ICI's coolant
businesses in the same regions.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK unveils its lively lion logo for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK yesterday put a lion in the European tank when it unveiled the logo
marking British presidency of the European Community, due to start on July
1.
The logo, a lion striding across the EC's flag of a circle of yellow stars
on a blue field, appears to give a somewhat ambiguous picture of the British
government's European policy.
For Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, who conducted the ceremonial
unveiling, it shows 'a lion at the heart of Europe, an energetic, lively and
intelligent lion. It shows our forthright approach to Europe and maintains
British pride and British identity'.
For others, conscious of Britain's deep reservations about a supranational
European monetary and political union, the logo was more evocative of the UK
driving a lion and cart through the EC's most ambitious projects.
That impression may have been the result of an intervention by Mr John
Major, the prime minister. He complained that the original version of the
beast, designed and developed by the Anglo-Italian company Minale
Tattersfield at the modest cost of Pounds 15,000, presented too docile a
picture of Britain and should be made 'more lively and energetic'.
Some surprise was also expressed at the press launch at the timing of the
British initiative, barely a month after Portugal had taken over the EC
presidency for a six-month stint. In the face of Mr Hurd's denials, it was
also suggested there might be a link between this unusually early start of
the European campaign and the desire to make an impact on voters before the
forthcoming UK general election.
Mr Hurd said there were two top priorities for the British presidency during
the second half of the year.
The first was the completion of the single European market, 'in which the
free movement of goods and services promotes jobs and prosperity and brings
benefits to individual consumers and businesses'.
The UK would concentrate in particular on the liberalisation of financial
services and transport and the creation of a real internal market in energy.
The second main priority was the enlargement of the Community, starting with
the European Free Trade Association applicants. The aim was for accession
negotiations to start at the end of this year or the beginning of 1993. The
UK also wanted to ensure that the Community had sound financial foundations
and that both budgetary discipline and the interests of ordinary taxpayers
were respected in the extensive review of the Community's finances to be
started this month. An essential element of this problem was a continuation
of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Other British priorities included the buttressing of democracy and reform in
the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
'We shall press ahead with trade agreements with the newly independent
states and we shall help the east Europeans prepare for EC membership by
implementing the association agreements with Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia,' Mr Hurd said.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Stepping out on to a wider stage: Why traditionally
secretive Swiss companies are opening up to new investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss are not normally associated with radical change. But something of
a revolution is taking place these days in Switzerland's big financial and
industrial companies.
Traditionally withdrawn and secretive about their affairs, they are now
actively courting foreign and small investors and publishing a great deal of
information about their activities.
The changes will allow Swiss companies to raise funds more cheaply and
sharpen their competitiveness against international rivals.
But the changes do not mean that it is now open season for would-be foreign
corporate raiders on undervalued Swiss companies. The authorities still
provide their companies with defence mechanisms, such as allowing them to
limit the number of shares a single person can vote. But this practice too
is beginning to be challenged and the process of liberalisation is unlikely
to be reversed.
The opening up of Swiss companies is illustrated by the case of Nestle, the
largest Swiss industrial company. Since 1988, it has eliminated a ban on
foreigners being registered as owners of shares, and has begun publishing
interim financial statements and information about its budgets and
strategies.
This year, along with several other Swiss companies, Nestle is expected to
reduce the nominal value of its shares to make them more appealing to small
investors. A single Nestle share now costs about SFr9,000 (Pounds 3,500).
This does not present a problem to big institutional investors, but is a
substantial deterrent to individuals.
Two related reasons can be cited for the changes in the stolid Swiss
corporate culture. First, many Swiss companies have become so large that
they can no longer rely solely on local capital markets for their financial
needs. Yet when they go into international capital markets to raise funds,
they come under pressure to improve disclosure standards to international
levels and to eliminate discrimination against foreign investors.
At the same time, the opening to foreigners of the Swiss capital markets in
the late 1980s has put new pressures on local fund managers to perform
better, because of competition from international rivals. Consequently, they
are taking a more discerning view about their investments in Swiss
companies.
In some cases, notably that of the giant Basle-based pharmaceutical groups,
Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, there is also a fear that Switzerland, with
its strong environmental movement, may no longer be a congenial place to
conduct business. In the past couple of years, these companies have been
stepping up their investments outside Switzerland, and appealing to the
international capital markets to help finance these moves.
Indeed, it was Roche that started the trend of actively attracting
investment in 1988. It split its shares - which had previously traded at
about SFr250,000 apiece - by 50 for one, and simplified its Byzantine share
structure. Since then, Roche has steadily improved the quality of its
financial reporting and split the shares again last year.
The pay-off for the group from these moves has been quick to come. Roche
shares have become much easier to buy and sell, now that there are many more
in circulation. This in itself makes them more attractive to more investors.
They have become the most actively traded Swiss shares, with daily turnover
of SFr40m-SFr60m.
Improved liquidity has helped boost the ratio of the share price to the size
and profitability of Roche's business. The price/earnings ratio of Roche
bearer shares today is about 28, almost the same as that on shares of Glaxo
of the UK or Merck of the US. By contrast, shares of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz
languish on p/e ratios in the low teens.
Roche says the higher rating has made it easier to generate funds in
international capital markets at competitive rates. Last April, it raised
Dollars 1bn through an innovative warrant bond issue with an interest rate
of only 3.5 per cent. Then it received a further SFr1.03bn through a share
rights and warrants issue in October.
That, in turn, has made it easier for the group to keep pace with overseas
rivals in making large takeovers. In 1990, it paid Dollars 2.1bn for 60 per
cent of Genentech, the US genetic engineering company and last year it
bought Nicholas Laboratories, the European over-the-counter drugs business
owned by Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp, for Dollars 821m.
All of this has not been lost on other big Swiss companies. Most now publish
consolidated financial statements, follow recognised European or
international accounting standards, and delegate an executive to deal full
time with investors' needs.
The big three Swiss banks - Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank
Corporation and Credit Suisse - have even revealed details of their hidden
reserves. 'We have to come up to the expectations of well-informed
international investors,' says Mr Hans Geiger, a member of the executive
board of Credit Suisse, the country's third largest bank.
There has also been rapid progress on the issue of removing discrimination
against foreign investors.
The most common policy among Swiss companies is to have two classes of
shares, registered and bearer, the former being restricted to Swiss
nationals and the latter being mainly for foreigners who want to conceal
their identity. While both types of shares have voting rights, the
registered shares usually have a much lower nominal - or face - value and
thus much greater voting power.
Several companies have followed Nestle's lead in opening their share
registers to foreigners. These include Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz and Brown-Boveri,
the engineering group. This has left many Swiss companies vulnerable to
takeover bids, at least in principle, partly because their share prices are
still relatively low by international standards and partly because
Switzerland has no effective takeover code.
Many companies have insulated themselves from takeover threats by taking
advantage of a Swiss law which enables them to limit the proportion of a
company's shares that a single investor may own.
But even this protection is no longer secure. Last May, an alliance of
foreign and Swiss pension funds forced the board of Holzstoff Holding, a
paper making group, to withdraw a motion that would have limited the voting
rights of any individual shareholder.
The opening up of Swiss banks to foreign investors is complicated by a law
saying that in order to qualify as Swiss, a bank must be able to show that a
majority of its shares are held by Swiss nationals. Thus, the big banks are
unlikely to liberalise their capital structures completely for the
foreseeable future.
Swiss companies also face constraints in splitting their shares. While
companies that have shares with a nominal value of more than SFr100 have
been able to split their shares, most companies have shares with a par value
of SFr100, the minimum allowed by law. As of July 1, however, a revision in
the companies act will enable all companies to lower the par value of their
shares to SFr10.
In spite of the difficulties, most analysts are convinced that there will be
no turning back to the secretive and parochial old ways. 'In two or three
years, Swiss companies will be in the first division among European
companies in terms of transparency,' predicts Mr Thierry Lacraz of Geneva
bankers Pictet &amp; Co.
That does not mean that Swiss executives are all enthusiastic about the
changes they are making. Many are tormented by the question of whether or
not such moves will contribute to a gradual undermining of the basic culture
that has driven the large Swiss industrial companies and banks up to now.
But they also know that to compete successfully in world markets it is no
longer enough to be Swiss.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Suspended sentence: The UK motor industry can breathe a sigh
of relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK motor trade and industry could be compared yesterday with a man in
the dock who, fearing a jail sentence, receives instead a slap on the wrist
to hisses from his self-proclaimed victims in the public gallery.
After 18 months of deliberation and sifting through a mountain of evidence,
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has taken 1,000 pages to conclude
that:
British consumers, particularly private motorists, pay more for their cars
than they should;
A complex monopoly exists in the case of 24 car suppliers;
Some of the restrictions applied by manufacturers to their exclusively
franchised dealers reduce competition and act against the public interest.
Yet the report effectively finds the industry guilty of only minor
misdemeanours on two fundamental questions: whether consumers were justified
in complaining that UK car prices are excessively high compared with other
EC countries; and whether the system of exclusively franchised dealers is a
contributing factor.
It concludes that neither carmakers nor dealers have been engaged in
systematic profiteering and recommends no significant structural changes in
the way the industry operates. It also appears to have accepted in their
entirety the industry's arguments that Britain's franchised dealer system,
with its dedicated service and repair facilities and after-sales support, is
necessary because of the complexity of the products sold and their safety
implications.
The report provides little guidance for the EC Commission, which is studying
whether the car franchised dealer system can continue to be exempted from EC
competition rules after the current exemption period expires in mid-1995.
This system restricts sales of new cars exclusively to dealers chosen by the
manufacturers.
Consumer groups, already critical of dealers and their service and repair
performance, have called for the system to be replaced by a market
'free-for-all', with manufacturers being obliged to supply cars to virtually
any outlet which wishes to sell them.
Dr John Beishon, director of the Consumers' Association, said: 'It is simply
astonishing that the MMC recognises there is a monopoly and yet accepts that
it should stay. It backs all our arguments and yet sits on its hands.'
Even Professor Garel Rhys, who holds the chair of motor industry economics
at Cardiff Business School, sponsored by the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders, described the report yesterday as 'equivalent to rearranging
the furniture on the Titanic'. The society itself said it was vindicated in
its protestations that there is no systematic price-gouging by the UK
industry.
Nevertheless, the commission's own calculations show (see chart) that some
categories of car, particularly those bought by private buyers, can be more
expensive in the UK than elsewhere. It identifies several causes, but they
do not amount to a blanket condemnation of the industry:
Some conditions imposed by manufacturers on their dealers restrict
competition;
The voluntary export restraints which have limited Japanese imports to an 11
per cent share of the market;
Distortions associated with company cars, not least the deep discounts
frequently given to large fleets;
Difficulties experienced by consumers in importing cars from the EC;
The UK's habit of driving on the left instead of the right.
One of the report's main remedies is to give more freedom to dealers
through:
Removal of restrictions on dealers advertising outside their
manufacturer-designated sales territories;
Ending manufacturer-imposed restrictions on the number of dealer outlets any
one group may own - Ford has a limit of eight;
Ending manufacturer restrictions on dealer groups owning rival franchises
within their designated sales territories, although the commission does not
go so far as to say that multi-franchising should be allowed under one roof
or on a single site;
Lifting curbs on dealers setting up car-part sales or fast-fit operations
within the franchised territories;
Removal of unit sales ceilings that some manufacturers impose on individual
dealers.
Even if the manufacturers are obliged to implement all these
recommendations, they can be considered to have got off lightly. The report
puts them under little pressure to make their pan-European pricing policies
more open, or to make it easier for consumers to compare prices for
similar-specification cars in different national markets.
Indeed, within minutes of the report becoming public, Sir Hal Miller, Tory
MP and the society's new chief executive, went on the offensive, saying that
the main reason for any price differentials between Britain and the EC was
the 27.3 per cent combined Value-Added Tax and special car tax imposed on
new car purchases in the UK. This compared with, for example, the 14 per
cent levied in Germany.
The point is a potentially important one in terms of the Budget that the
chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, is to present on March 10, and on which the
motor trade and industry is pinning strong hopes for a roll back in
taxation.
Until the publication of the report, it had been fairly easy for successive
chancellors to ignore the industry's persistent complaints that the 10 per
cent special car tax is an anomaly that depresses car sales. Now the matter
has been brought into focus.
As consumer group complaints of excessive prices - which usually rise each
year by more than the rate of inflation - rumbled along for more than a
decade, Treasury officials were able to argue that if car prices were
excessively high, it was up to the industry to cut them. The exchequer
should not subsidise lower prices by cutting the special car tax with a
potential loss of Pounds 1.5bn to the Treasury.
Now, because the industry has been virtually cleared of price-gouging, Mr
Lamont could look more favourably at the increasingly desperate pleas for
tax relief from carmakers. The pleas arise against the background of the
steepest car and truck market collapse in the UK since the Second World War.
Sales have fallen from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 1.59m last year.
With industry statistics showing at least 70,000 jobs being lost in the past
two years, and with 10 per cent of the franchised dealers closing or being
sold off last year, it is possible that the chancellor will decide partially
to dismantle the special car tax.
The other main issue of contention is a proposal in the report to dismantle
the Anglo-Japanese 'gentlemen's agreement' which has effectively confined
Japanese-produced cars and light commercial vehicles to 11 per cent of the
UK market since the mid-1970s, and to allow them unfettered market access.
This would have greater immediate significance were it not for the fact that
the voluntary restraint agreement is scheduled to be terminated at the end
of this year, as the single EC market comes into effect.
The UK will then become subject to an 'understanding' reached between the EC
Commission and Japan last July. Under this, existing national import
restraints will be lifted, to be replaced by a progressive EC-wide
dismantling of Japanese import curbs, leading to an open market by 1999.
Even so, Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, appears ready to
give consideration to the commission's proposal, to the consternation of
British producers. They could have a point. France, Italy and some other
large markets will retain ceilings on Japanese imports almost throughout the
transition period. If the UK were voluntarily and unilaterally to end
restraints, it could well find itself a bigger target than it bargained for.
However, the commission believes that opening the doors should be
accompanied by a quid pro quo in which the Japanese undertake to ship in a
reasonable proportion of cars competing head-on with the main volume car
makers, and not, as has happened in the past, concentrate on exploiting the
more profitable market niches where competition is less intense.
That is still enough to send a frisson of unease through a UK industry
increasingly anxious for sales in a market where most observers expect only
a marginal market recovery this year, and then only in the second half.
All this is little consolation to British consumers who at best can hope for
a slow fall in prices as the measures the monopolies commission has
recommended gradually take effect.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: Lindsay Quartet - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To a packed house on Tuesday the Lindsay played Beethoven and Ravel, and
Schumann's piano quintet with the 1990 Leeds winner Artur Pizarro. As we
expect from them, every performance was both exciting and seriously
interesting. In their impassioned Beethoven - the C minor Quartet from opus
18 - there was a newly emphatic twist in the Finale. Their leader Peter
Cropper gave the rising phrase that ends the main tune a sharp
whipcrack-sting, and later Bernard Gregor-Smith's cello marked the switch
into C major with the same explosive flash.
Once heard, not only not forgotten but instantly persuasive: that must have
been what Beethoven meant, for it magnetised the whole movement.
For these players, Ravel's early quartet is some way off the paths they have
been cultivating. The Lindsay made their name with the Viennese classics,
Bartok, Tippett; they have expanded eastwards - notably to Janacek - and
also backwards, but not much in other directions. (A dozen or so years ago I
tried to persuade them to look at Elliott Carter's Quartet no. 1, which they
could play magnificently, but either they didn't take the bait or they
didn't like it.) France has been unexplored territory. In this Ravel, they
took heroic care to curb their customary thrust for the sake of a properly
soignee Gallic surface.
The opening Allegro moderato sounded frail and lovely, but almost enervated.
Hugh Wood's lively programme-notes declared that by comparison with
Debussy's mature Quartet, Ravel's is 'frankly feminine: like a very
beautiful cat': true as far as it goes - but there are rippling muscles
beneath the velvet, and the balance of the whole piece requires that they be
felt from the start.
In the crackling pizzicato Scherzo the Lindsay of course got the bit between
their teeth, and they made a much better fist of the Finale (too frantic and
too thin, in a Conservatoire vein that Ravel never tapped again) than most
quartets do. Between those movements, their Tres lent was deceptively simple
and poignant.
Though they are no more than middle-aged, the Lindsay were probably trying
out Schumann's quintet before Artur Pizarro was born. It showed. With eyes
glued to the piano-score, young Pizarro was a model of good taste, alertness
and controlled energy - a faultless team-member, in fact; but in his hands,
scarcely one phrase had the sculpted expressive force that his Lindsay
partners gave it.
No doubt he was too polite, or too honest, to force anything upon the music
which might be naively tendentious. It was odd, nonetheless, to hear the
instrument that usually bids to dominate Schumann's proceedings, by reason
of its rich musical role, reduced to the level of faithful athletic support.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: Caesar and Cleopatra - Greenwich Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Bernard Shaw wrote Caesar and Cleopatra for the actor Johnston
Forbes-Robertson in 1898, aiming to illustrate through the character of
Caesar his views about the common humanity of even the most exalted heroes,
while chronicling a corner of Roman history that languishes in the shadow of
Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra.
His Caesar, finely realised by Alec McCowen, is a wry, kindly philistine, by
his own admission 'part brute, part woman and part god', whose laurels
conceal a balding head, and whose good nature hides a cunning - and finally
ruthless - political brain. We see him first apostrophising beside the
monumental claw of a black marble sphinx, enchanted by the frightened young
queen who finds him there. Having convinced her that Romans do not in fact
eat Egyptians, he proceeds to amuse himself by making an empress of her.
With feet dangling six inches off the ground, Amanda Root's minxish
Cleopatra settles into her throne, tearing into her domineering governess (a
sinister Sheila Ballantine), squabbling with her brother, while creating
merry mayhem with the protocol of both Roman and Egyptian courts.
Matthew Francis's production gleefully captures the mischief of these early
scenes. The design (Julian McGowan), of ornate statuary dotted around marble
halls, is subverted by the frock-coats and laurels of the Romans. Britannus,
Shaw's send-up of the British character, is played by Michael Cronin with
bowler hat and poker face, making the maximum comic mileage out of the
undignified dive into the waters of the Nile of the entire Roman court,
carrying a protesting Egyptian queen who, minutes earlier, had smuggled
herself over to Alexandria in a carpet.
The fun and games of the first three acts are abruptly halted in a second
half which changes gear into an essay on political methods. Cleopatra,
cleverly transformed by Root into a rather charmless sophisticate, is now
dangerously confident; Caesar, still making a show of being the genial Dutch
uncle, is put on his mettle by the murder of the scheming Egyptian Pothinus,
and the resulting uprising by his followers.
In a superbly engineered scene of confrontation between morals and
expediency, the ruthlessness is revealed of a colonialist whose 'hands-off'
liberalism is merely a strategy for allowing his minions to sort themselves
out.
Having failed to prevent Cleopatra's henchwoman Ftatateeta from killing
Pothinus, Caesar lets Rufius - the new governor of Egypt - murder her,
before turning his back on the lot of them in a devastating display of
political indifference.
Feigning the forgetfulness of an old man, he slights Cleopatra by neglecting
to take proper leave of her; the unspoken insult is left frozen in the air
between them. Judicious cutting and exemplary central performances have
excavated a chilling political parable from a rambling Shavian chronicle
about a king and a kitten.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Lloyd's reporting seeks computer age
rationale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN MEDIAEVAL times, a merchant's ship might not return to its home port
after a long voyage for three years. That, it is said, explains the unusual
practice at Lloyd's of London today of using three-year accounts. Some
critics suggest it is about time the procedure was changed to reflect
standard twentieth-century corporate reporting.
While the great majority of British companies - and their counterparts
overseas - have to produce accounts every year, Lloyd's publishes its
results after a time lag of three years. In June, for example, Lloyd's will
present the results of the 400 or so insurance syndicates which were trading
on the market in 1989.
'It's quite an unusual way of accounting,' concedes Mr Mervyn Ellis, a
partner with Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, who specialises in work
with Lloyd's. 'There is nothing magical about three years. But it's a
typical British compromise.'
Three-year accounting creates a number of difficulties for Lloyd's,
especially when - as at present - it is reporting losses.
Last year the market reported a deficit of Pounds 510m for its 1988 year but
the market's leaders were not aware of the scale of the problems until early
in 1991 and Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting
syndicates - were ill-prepared for the shock when Lloyd's reported the loss
last summer. At a meeting of Names in June, Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp;
Lyle and a Name since 1980, said that the failure to anticipate the size of
its losses early enough would have been a 'recipe for disaster for an
industrial company'.
To outsiders, the episode illustrates the quirkiness of Lloyd's and
reinforces the case for reform. Certainly opinion among the insurance
market's business leaders appears to be tilting decisively in favour of
change.
The Lloyd's task force, a group of 14 underwriters, brokers and academics,
advised by McKinsey, the management consultants, conducted an examination of
the market's business structure last year on behalf of the Lloyd's Council.
It found widespread support for a move to a one-year system.
About 69 per cent of the businesses consulted by the task force favoured a
move to one-year accounting. Nevertheless, in its 240-page report Lloyd's: a
route forward, published last month, the task force report recommended
retention of the existing system.
The conclusion was particularly surprising in view of the task force's
rejection of an argument frequently put forward by advocates of three-year
accounting at Lloyd's: that it is difficult to account for some classes of
liability insurances, including potential legal actions and awards on a
one-year basis.
The task force argued that these accounts - representing so-called
'long-tail' business in which claims often emerge many years after the
inception of the policy - develop over such a long period that only a
substantial extension of the accounting period beyond the existing three
years would greatly improve matters.
Mr David Rowland, the chairman of brokers Sedgwick, who also chaired the
task force, says: 'We started off with an extremely open mind. But we found
the simplistic statement that insurance companies use one-year accounting
and Lloyd's does not is untrue. When we looked at insurance companies, we
found that many of the specialist accounts have three-year reporting.'
Mr Michael Wade, from Holman Wade, another broker who served on the task
force, says the group was surprised to find how many insurance companies
also account for their results on periods longer than one year. One-, two-
and three-year accounting are all accepted under a statement of practice
issued by the Association of British Insurers.
Although companies specialising in common or garden insurance such as motor
and householders account for their results annually, companies on the London
insurance market do operate on a two- or three-year basis. That includes
nine out of ten companies specialising in marine, aviation and transport
insurance, and all companies specialising in reinsurance.
It might be argued that the difficulties on long-tail business should extend
the accounting period in the other direction, towards perhaps five- or
ten-year periods. Mr Matthew Patient, an accountant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte who served on the task force, concedes that there is still
potential uncertainty. He stresses: 'It must come to a point where you are
unreasonably holding back from Names information that you can establish.'
The task force report cites other reasons for retaining the existing system,
which reflect Lloyd's unusual business structure. Syndicates - which
actually conduct underwriting - are a form of annual joint-venture between
Names. They are formally wound up at the end of the accounting period,
closing their accounts and paying a reinsurance premium into a successive
year of account to cover any outstanding liabilities.
When underwriters set the size of this premium for the so-called
reinsurance-to-close, they need to ensure that Names on successive years of
account are fairly treated. This calculation means that Lloyd's underwriters
require more accurate details of how their insurance results are reported
than their counterparts working for insurance companies.
'The unique thing about Lloyd's is that there is a full payout after the
accounting period,' says Mr Patient. 'If you get it wrong, you get it
totally wrong.'
In comparison, he says, there is an equalisation of any such longer term
changes to the accounts in a conventional insurance company, which can
spread any losses more evenly among its shareholders, most of whom remain
relatively unchanged year by year.
The task force also says that a three-year accounting system will tend to
encourage Names to take a long-term view about their investments in Lloyd's,
which will improve the long-term stability of the market's capital base.
On the other hand, it recognises that given the time lag inherent in
three-year reporting, it needs to improve the quality of its forecasting and
provisional results.
As a result, it does call for two changes to current accounting practice.
Syndicates should publish their solvency position and an indicative profit
forecast after 24 months; and the corporation should publish a global profit
forecast for the market as a whole after 24 months. Both proposals may need
the scrutiny of auditors.
A recent row between Lloyd's and Chatset, the independent company which
monitors the performance of Lloyd's syndicates, has underlined the
deficiencies of existing reporting practices only too well.
Although Lloyd's accepts that its losses in 1989 will be more than Pounds
1bn and the worst in its 300-year history, there is considerable uncertainty
still about the outcome for 1990 and 1991.
Chatset, which made its forecasts on the basis of quarterly claims
settlement figures, reckons that Lloyd's will make heavy losses in both
years, but its figures have been widely condemned on the market and labelled
'alarmist' by the Lloyd's chairman Mr David Coleridge.
If the recommendations are implemented, the official information provided
may at least offer a rationale for three-year accounting more in line with
the age of computers than the age of sail.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Technology: Voice input frees concealed talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For 11 years of his life, Christopher Nolan, who was severely brain-damaged
at birth, sat imprisoned in his wheelchair unable to communicate in any way.
It was not until he was given the muscle-relaxant drug Lioresal that he was
able, with the aid of a wooden stick attached to his head, to type out on a
word processor the thoughts and emotions that had long crowded his brain. It
emerged that he had been composing and memorising poetry since the age of
three.
Nolan serves as an example of how scientific and technological advancements
can unleash the potential of disabled people. Voice recognition in computers
could be a highly significant development.
Brian Payne, who is congenitally blind, has been using voice input systems
since 1985. Payne, who runs his own consultancy - Electronic Services for
the Blind - began with the Kurzweil Voice System (KVS), a pioneer model on
which he managed to write the first two chapters of his autobiography.
However, the KVS was slow and thrown off by background noises such as
clicks, which it interpreted as words or commands. Changes of voice, caused
by a head cold or even tiredness, would throw the system off. Payne gave up.
Two years ago, he began to use the DragonDictate system, developed by Dragon
Systems of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He dictates to the machine through a
noise-cancelling headset microphone, pausing briefly between each word.
Voice recognition can be extremely useful for non-keyboard users (such as
tetraplegics or those with spinal injuries) who also have severely impaired
speech; so long as utterances are consistent the computer will pick up the
intended word or phrase once it has adapted to the user's idiosyncrasies.
Payne points out that, by employing the user-defined functions one utterance
could generate a procedure which could, for example, type a standard
paragraph of a business letter or access a database.
Because voice commands do not vary, users can move between software packages
without having to learn a new set of instructions. That may be useful for
disabled people, especially the blind for whom wading through computer
manuals can be a real chore.
Payne has DragonDictate hooked up to a voice synthesiser which converts text
on the screen to simulated speech free of Dalek-like warblings. He also has
a braille pad connected to the terminal which enables him to finger-read
text on the screen line by line.
'If you can use voice, you free up your hands to do other things. In that
lies the power of the system,' he says. Payne consults braille notes jotted
down during meetings and dictates a more polished version into the computer.
The manufacturer claims 30-40 words per minute can be achieved.
Payne is excited by the prospect of 'searching' by voice, accessing, for
example, a CD-Rom database of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, company profiles
or a phone directory. In the latter case, if the system were hooked up to
the telephone, a disabled user could 'dial' a number simply by reading out
the name.
Bill Fine, information specialist at the IBM Support Centre for People with
Disabilities, cautions against regarding voice recognition as a 'magic
wand', since it is still in the early stages of development and beyond the
price range of most disabled people.
He also feels that, for office use, constant dictation into a microphone
might disturb fellow workers and further isolate the disabled user socially.
'I don't want to be negative about voice, rather positive about the other
solutions, some of which can change someone's life for as little as Pounds
30.'
For example, IBM's AccesDos package tailors the keyboard for a range of
disabilities. Keys can be slowed down so they do not repeat characters when
pressed clumsily.
Fine says that technology must be selected according to its practical
ability to improve the lives of disabled users. 'There are no technological
solutions,' he says. 'Technology simply makes possible human solutions.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / Technology: Fast-talker gets the job - Computers which
recognise human speech are making their voices heard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some people talk to themselves, others talk to their television sets. These
days some people even talk to their computers. And the biggest culprits of
all are lawyers and doctors.
In Edmonton, Canada, for example, lawyers at Duncan &amp; Craig are producing
everything from pleadings and debentures to general correspondence on a
voice-activated computer - also referred to as a voice-operated typewriter
or a talkwriter.
The firm is using a system developed by Dragon Systems of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, which can recognise up to 30,000 spoken words. Some 25,000
words are stored in the computer, the other 5,000 determined by the user.
The latter would include terms specific to one profession.
Duncan &amp; Craig bought its first system in April last year and now has 10.
The system is ideal for lawyers who have no background in computing, says
litigation partner David Cook. 'It's less work than learning to touch type.'
Its huge vocabulary makes the DragonDictate system one of the most
sophisticated voice recognition computers available. It can recognise such a
large number of words because it is 'speaker dependent' - trained to
recognise the accent, stammers and verbal idiosyncrasies of each user.
'To begin with it will often get it wrong,' concedes Les Kingham, systems
development manager of Aptech, which sells DragonDictate in the UK. The
computer, trained on a diet of US speakers, will get only about 50 per cent
of the utterances of a typical British user correct the first time. But
within a couple of hours the machines will guess up to 70 per cent of the
words correctly and 90 per cent given several days of training.
At Duncan &amp; Craig, Cook says a user can be 'quite functional after 10 hours'
training, and really starts humming along after 20'.
In commercial applications the training is swiftest if the keyboard is used
in conjunction with the voice activation system. When the machine fails to
recognise a word, the user can quickly type it in.
Every user trains the system to their own voice, and the model for each is
stored on the hard disc. Each file takes between 2.5 and 4 Megabytes: thus
the size of the disc determines the number of users.
The system can be slow to use - each word has to be enunciated clearly to
avoid confusion. But it can be taught to introduce repeated phrases -
invaluable in the standard documentation of the lawyer.
'The way to use the system at its best is to teach it to cut corners,' says
Kingham. 'The speed will never be as good as a 100 word-per-minute typist,
but that is not what it's designed for. It's intended for executives and
professionals who want to write their own reports but don't want to have to
rely on their secretaries.'
Cook reports that one lawyer at his firm has set up a routine so that when
he finishes the body text of a letter he simply has to utter 'complete
letter' and the machine will finish the formalities and even print the
envelope.
Although such systems are attractive, they only account for a very small
proportion of the voice recognition market, says Rob Walters, of Satin
Information Services, the voice systems consultancy. The vast bulk of
systems have only a relatively small vocabulary and are 'speaker
independent' - they treat every speaker in exactly the same way.
Many speaker independent systems are used in conjunction with telephone
services, such as telephone banking. The Royal Bank of Scotland, for
example, has been conducting trials on a system which enables its customers
to order cheque books or pay bills over the telephone. Users of the system
need to speak digits, words such as 'yes' and 'no' and a number of commands
 -'mini-statement', for example.
The bank reports that customers have been enthusiastic. The problem now is
to extend the system nationwide by putting the recognition technology on to
the company mainframe.
Other applications for these small vocabulary systems include cellular
telephones. These enable drivers to speak the number - or even tell the
phone to 'call the office' - thereby eliminating the need to release the
steering wheel. Potential uses include hands-free maintenance or
manufacture, so that the grubby-handed mechanic could 'speak' a report to a
computer.
Developers of such systems include Scott Instruments, the Voice Processing
Corporation and Voice Control Systems of the US and BT, Logica and Marconi
of the UK.
The day when these two types of system can be combined - to produce a
speaker independent system that could recognise some 20,000 words - is still
a long way off. The problem is the time needed to train the system, says
Denis Johnston, senior engineering adviser in speech technology at BT
Laboratories. 'You would need thousands of voices to train the system and
then thousands more to test it.'
But if these problems could be overcome, such a system would work better
than user dependent models. 'The integrity of the training would be so much
better,' says Johnston.
The systems, large or small, use pattern recognition to match the utterance.
The sound wave is broken down into small units, usually relating to the
frequency of the sound - a fricative (such as the sound 'f'), is usually
high frequency, whereas vowels are low frequency. Each unit, of 10 to 30
milliseconds is looked up in a sound library and mathematical algorithms are
used to arrive at the best match.
Some of the more sophisticated systems match the phonemes, or smallest sound
elements, in each word. And artificial intelligence techniques are used to
'teach' the computer to recognise individual speakers' voices.
Advances in digital signal processing chips and disc technology have helped
to bring voice recognition into the mainstream computer market.
So much so, that IBM recently launched a voice-activated computer system for
hospital radiologists. Following trials in 10 Italian hospitals, IBM will be
delivering its first commercial systems early this year, says Alessandro
Fusi, manager of the language technology department in IBM's Rome Scientific
Centre.
One aim in selecting radiology reports was to shorten the time a patient
spends in hospital, says Robert Alexander, of IBM's health marketing
division. 'It could easily take two to three days, or sometimes longer, to
get the report.'
On inspecting the X-ray, the radiologist would dictate the report to a
secretary or dictation machine. That would be typed up, and then returned to
the radiologist for checking. 'The hospitals have found that more time is
spent by the radiologist, but overall the time is reduced,' says Alexander.
Although IBM believed the problem would be with the voice technology, it
actually arose in developing a system with which the radiologists felt
comfortable. 'Every radiologist wanted to add some bells and whistles,' says
Alexander.
The radiological application uses a PS/2 machine with two additional
computer cards and software which can recognise 12,600 words. Each
radiologist can add their own words, although no radiologist has added more
than 100, says Fusi. The system can, however, recognise up to 26,000 words
in more general use. IBM is now looking at applying the system to other
medical applications - pathology, for example - and in offices. And
researchers in IBM centres outside Italy are working on systems to deal with
different languages.
The Belgium company Lernout and Hauspie has developed systems that can
recognise six languages, including Korean. The company has also devised the
technology to recognise continuous speech for specific applications, says
joint founder Pol Hauspie. One example is a telephone reservation service
for airlines. If the caller reserves a seat on the Boston-to-San Francisco
flight at two o'clock the system can pick out the appropriate words.
However it will be years before a machine which can recognise contiguous
speech - complete, uninterrupted sentences - is developed. According to
Johnston: 'Speech is more than words nailed together end to end.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Blowing hot and cold
over Europe - Guy de Jonquieres welcomes the launch of the EC refrigerator
and microwave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Young, when Britain's trade and industry secretary, said that the
European Community would have a true single market when it had a common lamp
bulb fitting. Perversely, the EC continues to duck that particular
challenge. However, the day of the Euro-fridge and Euro-microwave is at
hand.
They are to be launched shortly by Whirlpool, the US domestic appliance
manufacturer which last summer took control of the white goods businesses of
the Dutch Philips group and is seeking to weld them into a pan-European
marketing strategy.
Philips' failure to treat Europe as a single market has bequeathed Whirlpool
an immensely complex range, with so many national variants that only a fifth
are sold in more than two countries.
Fridges and freezers come in no fewer than 2,300 model specifications and
microwaves in 560. Though many of the variations are minor, they all add
expense. Whirlpool reckons harmonised designs could cut production costs by
as much as 10 per cent.
In the next few weeks, the company will start shipping three identical
models of refrigerators and microwaves to 5,000 dealers in seven EC
countries. The dealers are affiliated to Euronics, an 18-month-old
federation of independent electrical retailers which put the idea to
Whirlpool soon after it was formed.
The plan also calls for standardised packaging and instruction manuals,
co-ordinated advertising and promotion and reciprocal guarantee and
servicing arrangements between Euronics dealers in different countries.
Marcel Vloemans, Euronics' managing director, expects the scheme to yield
substantial efficiencies by encouraging bulk purchasing, simplifying
administration and after-sales support, and enabling dealers in different
countries to trade stocks of product.
Indeed, his members are so confident that they have committed themselves to
a 40 per cent year-on-year increase in sales of Whirlpool fridges and
microwaves. Whirlpool, which claims the agreement is the first in its
industry, aims to conclude similar 'partnership' deals with other retailers.
The agreement reflects a wider change in the marketing of European
electrical and consumer electronics products, as manufacturers and retailers
close ranks in an effort to capture bigger scale economies and expand market
share.
Much of the running is being made by the retail trade, even though it
remains far more fragmented and nationally-based than manufacturing. Still
more surprising, the pace is being set by small independent dealers. The
growth of multiple chains has prompted the independents to band together
across frontiers in groupings such as Euronics, in an effort to buy in bulk,
cut costs and improve customer service.
As a result, individual outlets are becoming more selective about the range
of brands they stock. The keener competition for shelf and floor space is an
important reason spurring Whirlpool and other manufacturers to tie retailers
into long-term 'partnerships'.
Expert International, a Swiss-based federation of 2,800 dealers in 14
countries, says almost half the consumer electronics products they sell are
supplied by only four manufacturers, down from nine in 1989. It expects the
trend to continue and to spread to white goods.
However, Wim van den Tooren, managing director of Expert, says few
manufacturers are yet organised to negotiate with dealers on a pan-European
basis. Because many still leave sales and marketing to loosely co-ordinated
national subsidiaries, they are also sometimes slower than retailers to spot
cross-frontier trends.
Van den Tooren says that until two years ago, some manufacturers' trade
prices for the same products diverged by as much as 35 per cent between
countries. Only after Expert pointed out the discrepancies did suppliers
start harmonising European prices.
Another obstacle to pan-European marketing is the difficulty of offering
uniform guarantees. Though a few manufacturers, such as Sony, have recently
made their guarantees transferable across borders, they remain bound by
widely varying local regulations.
In Italy, three-year guarantees are common for white goods. But in Germany,
where the law entitles consumers to insist that defective products be
replaced, guarantees are often limited to six months. Sony is trying to find
a way round the problem, but admits it may be hard to please all its
dealers.
Expert's members found another solution by agreeing to offer free one-year
insurance. 'If you buy a video camera from an Expert store in Norway and
damage it in Spain, you can exchange it at one of Expert's Spanish outlets,'
says van den Tooren.
The development of pan-European customer support and service is closely
linked to progress on product standardisation. This has already gone a long
way in consumer electronics: about 95 per cent of components in a Sony
television chassis are common throughout Europe, even though transmission
standards differ between countries.
Progress is slower in white goods. In France, Finland, Norway and the
Netherlands, the best-selling washing machines are top-loading designs, but
elsewhere front-loaders pre-dominate. Furthermore, spin speeds are higher in
the north of Europe than in the south. Cookers and stoves are even more
diverse.
Many appliance manufacturers are reluctant to force the pace of
standardisation for fear of antagonising housewives who have grown used to a
particular type of design. Vloemans of Euronics believes it is much easier
to standardise new types of product.
But others think product variations reflect the habits of suppliers, rather
than of consumers. 'There is no basic reason why products should differ,'
says van den Tooren.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour accuses SNP of 'toytown
economics' - Scottish Separatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday launched a strong counter-attack on the Scottish National
party, with Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary, accusing it of
'toytown economics' and 'blatant fraud' in putting the case for Scotland's
becoming independent.
Mr Dewar's attack, which was dismissed by the SNP as 'blind panic', is part
of Labour's attempt to head off what it fears will be a surge in support for
the nationalists, prompted by last week's opinion poll showing that 50 per
cent of Scots wanted some form of independence.
Last weekend a separate poll showed a drop of 9 points to 38 per cent in
support for Labour in Scotland compared with a month before, with the SNP up
5 points at 26 per cent.
Mr Dewar said the SNP was being dishonest in claiming that living standards
in Scotland would immediately improve with independence. 'There is no
certainty that we would be able to maintain the level of public services and
infrastructure that Scotland needs' with independence, he said.
Revenue from North Sea oil, on which many of the SNP's economic calculations
were based, was in relative decline and now yielded less than 1 per cent of
the total tax take in Britain.
'It is madness to float a major constitutional change on the basis of wildly
optimistic assumptions about an inevitably time-limited asset,' he said.
If there were a differential in interest rates between Scotland and England,
what would stop capital flowing south, Mr Dewar asked. 'Investors from what
was Britain will indeed come to Scotland but for cheap loans and nothing
else.'
In the short term, people working for Scottish defence contractors such as
Yarrow shipbuilders and GEC Ferranti would risk losing their jobs. UK Civil
Service departments that have been relocated to Scotland would be withdrawn,
he said.
'Scotland is not a country incapable of sustaining independence,' he said.
'Labour argues it would not be the best way forward.'
The government refused to be committed to a firm date for establishing a
Scottish further education funding council in the Commons last night.
Mr Michael Forsyth, Scottish Office minister of state, said it would be
wrong to to go beyond introducing a new clause to the Further and Higher
Education (Scotland) Bill giving the government freedom to decide when such
a body should be set up.
Although he described the new provision as a 'concession' to views expressed
by Labour MPs at an earlier stage of the bill, the opposition front benches
questioned its value.
Mr Anthony Worthington, a Labour frontbench spokesman, asked: 'Is this a sop
or an indication that the minister has accepted the case for a funding
council?'
Mr Forsyth told him: 'If we through a funding council would be entirely
inappropriate we would never have put this provision in the bill.'
He denied that the government planned to merge the further education funding
council with the higher education funding council.
A Labour amendment seeking to ensure that the Scottish further education
funding council would be established on April 1 1994 was defeated by 254
votes to 178, a government majority of 76.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on National Insurance
burden - Social Security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF A MILLION people would have to pay more in national insurance
contributions even if their annual salary was below the Pounds 21,000
ceiling, Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Newton warned that Labour's suggestion that contributions could be
annualised to avoid that arising could not be introduced immediately and
would cause widespread disruption. Every computer payroll system would have
to be reprogrammed, he said. Labour disputed both claims.
Defending the use of bonuses, commissions and overtime as important
incentives, Mr Newton said the proposal would hurt those Labour said it
wished to encourage, such as skilled workers, engineers and managers.
In any event, he added, even if calculated on an annual basis, Labour's
scheme would amount to a steep rise in the marginal tax rate of people
earning between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000.
'Since they'd receive no extra benefits in return, Labour would effectively
add 9p to their marginal tax rate - creating a new overtime tax pitched at a
staggering 34p in the pound.'
He conceded, however, that there had been an increase over the past five
years in the number of those facing marginal deduction rates of more than 70
per cent, as a result of the interaction between the tax and benefit
systems.
The rise, from 290,000 in 1985 to 395,000 in 1990-91, reflected the
introduction of more income-related benefits, he said. He also pointed out
no one now faced a marginal rate of more than 100 per cent.
Mr Newton also resisted the idea that contributions should simply be treated
as part of the tax system.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Figurehead at the mercy of the
press - The uncertain implications of Paddy Ashdown's public confession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tabloid press claimed a triumph; Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock
offered public sympathy; backbench MPs sniggered behind their hands; and the
electoral implications remained uncertain.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission yesterday of a relationship with his former
secretary in 1987 was a severe personal blow. The Liberal Democrat leader is
preparing to fight the first general election since 1979 in which the third
party can justly claim a real prospect of winning the balance of power. He
cannot afford bad publicity.
Colleagues rallied round. But the day was a painful reminder of the risk
that the Liberal Democrats have taken in building its new political identity
around a single individual.
It is no accident that newspapers so often refer to 'Mr Paddy Ashdown's
Liberal Democrats'. So if his colleagues had judged that Mr Ashdown should
consider resignation - and there was no indication of any such feeling - the
party would have been left without a credible successor.
The circumstances in which news broke - involving the theft of documents
from the office of his solicitors and an attempt to sell them to a Sunday
newspaper - will fuel the speculation that the approaching election will be
the among 'dirtiest' Britain has seen.
The Liberal Democrats carefully avoided any claim of a conspiracy by Mr
Ashdown's political opponents. His solicitor called it a million-to-one
possibility. But, in the wake of the spate of break-ins at the Westminster
and constituency offices of all parties and a war of words over smear
tactics, the House of Commons was again buzzing with talk of 'dirty tricks'
and similar revelations to come.
It was harder to get a coherent judgment of the extent to which the affair
will influence the outcome of the election. The general assumption among MPs
was that it would cost Mr Ashdown some votes - in particular from women and
from the religious non-conformists who have long represented an important
strand in Liberal support. Beyond that, there was no clear consensus.
One senior minister predicted that the damage might be more extensive. The
image of decent, honest politics that the Liberal Democrats had so carefully
projected before the election had been tarnished. That, he said, might cost
them 3 percentage points on election day.
Another minister was far less certain. 'It depends on how you boys (the
press) play it . . . It could be a one-day wonder.'
Then there was always the possibility, he added, that the 'prurience' of the
tabloids would generate a backlash in favour of Mr Ashdown.
Psephologists agreed that if support for Mr Ashdown were to fall sharply,
Labour would benefit in the key Conservative-held marginals on which the
election outcome will depend.
Mr Ashdown's hope is that now he has admitted to the relationship, the
newspapers that have been pursuing the story with such determination this
week will tire of it equally quickly.
The judgment at Westminster was that he had made the right decision.
The contents of the document stolen two weeks ago from his solicitor have
been common knowledge among journalists and MPs since the weekend. An
injunction against publication of details of the relationship - which lasted
five months, ending before Mr Ashdown became party leader - offered little
prospect of killing the story.
The tabloid newspapers scented a non-existent parallel with the scandal that
has engulfed Mr Bill Clinton, a Democrat contender for the US presidency.
The combination of sex and politics was irresistible. So they determined to
test Mr Ashdown's nerve.
The Scotsman, unaffected by the legal constraints operating in England,
disclosed the existance of the injunctions. The Daily Mirror told its
readers in an opaque front-page editorial that it was possessed of important
information that it could not publish. Mr Ashdown realised that the dam was
about to burst.
Behind the media zeal lay a curious circular logic. A five-year old
extramarital relationship was important because it might affect the
election. But, of course, it could only become an issue in the election if
the newspapers covered it.
The unanswered question is whether yesterday's story will be the first or
the last before the election. Anyone who has spent more than hour in the
bars of Westminster has heard of at least half a dozen other potential
scandals. As one MP put it last night: 'Who next'?
Mr Ashdown's statement said:
'The document reported to have been stolen from the safe of my solicitors,
Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite, and subsequently offered by the thief for sale
to newspapers, refers to me.
'It contains information supplied in confidence to my solicitors about a
brief relationship which I had five years ago, before the 1987 general
election, and well before I became leader of my party.
'When the theft was discovered I was advised and believed that I had every
right to defend my privacy.
'I was further advised that because its circulation arose from a criminal
act, the document would be protected by the full force of the law. In those
circumstances, my solicitors obtained an injunction preventing its
publication.
'However, it is now clear to me that in this pre-election atmosphere, I, my
family, my friends and party colleagues, will not be left alone. I have
therefore decided to make this personal statement.'

AN INCREASE in investment in higher education, a doubling of student numbers
by the end of the decade and immediate abolition of the government's student
loans scheme were proposed by the Liberal Democrats yesterday.
In a new policy statement, the party calls for an independent pay review
body to give lecturers pay comparability with other professionals. It also
advocates the introduction of more flexible degree courses.
The Liberal Democrats also propose to abolish parental contributions to
students' living costs and to restore their rights to social security
benefits - both with heavy cost implications.
'The doors to higher education need opening far wider, giving access to all
sections of British society,' said Mr Matthew Taylor, the party's education
spokesman.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cook alleges cash fears in trust
hospitals - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN COOK, shadow health secretary, yesterday accused the government of
'cynically manipulating' information on the hospitals' financial status.
His attack came as Labour rounded on the government's health service
policies, using a leaked document it said showed 'worrying' financial crises
at a number of trust-status hospitals.
He said the document, from the National Health Service's management
executive, indicated that 86 NHS trusts and directly managed hospitals were
running up deficits of more than Pounds 100,000. Some were reaching millions
of pounds.
'Most of them are being forced to clear this deficit within two months by
slamming the brakes on patient care,' Mr Cook said.
Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, reacted angrily at the use of
'stolen' documents for party political advantage. He said it was 'nonsense'
to use figures showing deficits equivalent to 0.01 per cent of the NHS
budget as a horror story.
The document did not include other trust hospitals which are in surplus, Mr
Waldegrave said. The service was in balance over the whole of last year.
Later on BBC radio, however, Mr Waldegrave acknowledged 'particular problems
in particular hospitals'.
Mr Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS management executive, said:
'The document is straightforward monthly management reporting.'
However, Mr Cook said the document highlighted the continued underfunding of
the health service which Labour would seek to restore if it won the general
election.
Mr Cook said, however, that NHS managers had divided hospitals with
financial deficits into 'hot spots' and 'tepid spots', while the document
euphemistically referred to bad publicity as 'noise'.
The first priority of civil servants was to 'keep the truth out of the
news,' Mr Cook said.

Hogg - Foreign Office Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT appeared yesterday to countenance the eventual involvement of
Palestinians from Arab East Jerusalem in the Middle East peace talks, as it
called on the Israeli government to desist from commencing to build further
settlements in the occupied territories.
Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, suggested that there was greater
scope for changes to the Palestinian delegation in the context of a
multilateral forum than in bilateral sessions.
The views of Palestinians in East Jerusalem must be represented somewhere,
he said.
Mr Hogg also expressed the view that the Jerusalem government's settlement
policies were 'a serious obstacle' to progress at the talks.
Any announcement by Israel that it intended to desist from those policies
would be 'an important confidence-building measure,' he said.
Invited by Labour to respond to a statement by the Israeli Labour party that
it would put a freeze on resettlement if it won a general election in June,
Mr Hogg said that he welcomed any such statement by an Israeli politician.
He hoped that would also be the policy of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime
minister, were he re-elected.
Mr Hogg's remarks come in the wake of the exclusion of Palestinian delegates
from formal deliberations at last month's multinational forum on Middle East
issues in Moscow.
The exclusions were because of a dispute over the identity of the
delegation's nominees.
It followed a decision by the Palestine Liberation Organisation to insist on
the inclusion of diaspora Palestinians in their delegation.
The government said yesterday that it was pressing for the former Soviet
republics to be admitted to the IMF as soon as possible.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Tory MPs attack Labour's plans to re-define PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY frontbenchers yesterday sought to exploit uncertainty about Labour's
plans for re-defining the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the
wake of the apparent climbdown over capital receipts by Mr Clive Soley, the
party's housing spokesman.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour was claiming
to have 'discovered the political philosopher's stone'.
The capital receipts had already been counted as negative public
expenditure, he said. 'If the spending has to be made, the money has to be
raised, and no amount of creative accounting will obscure that fact.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, turned his guns on Mr John
Prescott, his opposite number in the shadow cabinet, who he said had
'recently dismissed the prevailing Treasury rules on public borrowing as
'stupid''.
Labour's transport spokesman claimed to have the backing of Mr John Smith,
the shadow chancellor, to change those rules, Mr Rifkind continued. 'The
travelling public are entitled to an explanation. They need to know whether
this really is agreed Labour policy, or just another example of a promise
made 'on the hoof'.'
Mr Prescott's office confirmed that he had secured clearance from the party
leadership for two specific Treasury rule changes, in connection with a
proposal to allow British Rail to lease badly needed commuter trains for
Network SouthEast.
The changes would ease restrictions on the sources of British Rail's
borrowings.

<TEXT>
MANY investments suggested by financial advisers would generate a high
commission for advisers but were not suitable for investors, according to a
Consumers Association study published in Which? magazine today.
The survey follows a recent study by the Securities and Investments Board,
the investments watchdog body, which found that many policies sold by tied
agents of insurance companies were cancelled within two years, with a
consequent loss to investors.
Two Which? investigators each visited 20 financial institutions. A panel of
experts then commented on the advice.
The survey found a mixed standard. A third of companies regulated by the
Financial Services Act did not provide a buyers' guide for the
investigators, as the act requires.
Banks were the most criticised institutions, with the experts finding that
they 'generally failed to get enough personal information'. Independent
financial advisers were praised for suggestions given to one investigator.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Mortgage loans down 19% to Pounds 26bn last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE LENDING fell sharply last year, the Council for Mortgage Lenders,
the industry's trade association, reported yesterday.
Total net mortgage lending dropped to Pounds 26.12bn, down by 19 per cent on
the Pounds 32.12bn total for the industry in 1990.
The mortgage market is now only about two thirds of the size it reached at
the height of the mortgage boom in 1988, when net lending was Pounds 40bn.
One group of lenders, the insurance companies, has practically withdrawn
from the market since 1988. For the past three years, there has been a net
drop in their lending each year. Last year their lending fell by Pounds
860m, compared with a fall of Pounds 307m in 1990.
Centralised lenders - the specialist mortgage companies that entered the
market in the late 1980s - are still in the market, but their lending last
year of Pounds 1.5bn was far below the peak of Pounds 5bn reached in 1988.
There was a fall of more than 20 per cent from 1990.
The decline in the mortgage market since 1988 has helped building societies
to regain the market dominance they came close to losing in late 1987. Last
year their total net lending was Pounds 20.56bn, 78 per cent of the market.
Building society lending, which defied the market trend in 1989 and 1990 by
growing steadily, last year declined for the first time because of the
recession and bad debts.
Building society net lending of Pounds 20.56bn last year was 15 per cent
down on 1990, when it reached a peak of Pounds 24.2bn.
The societies approved 661,000 loan applications last year, a decline of 8
per cent from 1990 and far below the 1.2m applications approved in 1988.
In spite of the general gloom in the market, the total volume of mortgage
lending has continued to increase. Mortgage loans outstanding at the end of
last year were Pounds 320.1bn, 9 per cent up from Pounds 293.4bn a year
earlier.
Outstanding mortgage balances in the UK grew by 1.8 per cent during the
fourth quarter of the year.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Opposition seeks a balance-sheet crock of gold: David Owen
and John Willman explain how deft handling of borrowing could produce some
spending magic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS LABOUR thinking of using magicians' tricks to mask the cost of the
transport, housing and other infrastructural policies many of its spokesmen
and women would like to implement?
The party has lately shown much ingenuity in devising 'cost-free' schemes
for achieving specific policy goals - for example, it proposes to trade part
of the government's stake in the two non-nuclear electricity generating
companies for control of the National Grid.
Critics might say this week's suggestion that the party would like to
redefine the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) smacks of an even
greater desire for Labour to have its cake and eat it.
For all its newly found rigour in economic management, Labour still harbours
deep desires to increase public expenditure - and is attracted by
'off-balance-sheet' financing as a way of paying for it.
The specific proposal alluded to on Tuesday by Mr Clive Soley, the party's
housing spokesman, is for Labour to exclude from the definition of
public-sector borrowing the recycling into housing investment of
local-authority capital receipts from the sale of council houses. That would
provide a crock of gold to fund an expansion in house building and repairs
which Labour councils are itching to launch to help kick-start the economy.
Any intention to change the definition of the PSBR was later denied by the
party, which attempted to portray it as a gaffe by a junior spokesman. But
it has the support of several frontbench spokesmen.
Many policy advisers see the present rules as unnecessarily restricted,
particularly in relation to borrowing for public-expenditure projects that
would yield a stream of revenue to service the debt.
Other changes - including separating current spending from capital
investment for PSBR purposes - are also being assessed. A range of options
for improving the access of public bodies such as British Rail and local
authorities to private funding outside the PSBR is being explored.
Labour is quick to insist that its intentions for the public accounts are
not linked in any way to its spending proposals.
Yet the party's argument would be more convincing if it had been able on
Tuesday to agree its reasons for thinking some changes are necessary. Is it
to make the figures more accurately reflect what is happening in the
underlying economy or to make UK practice conform with Europe and North
America?
The latter may be a necessary step for any government in the aftermath of
the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union. Among the
terms for monetary union is a condition that 'general government borrowing'
should not exceed 3 per cent of GDP. That definition of public borrowing is
more restrictive than that of the PSBR - it excludes borrowing for
commercial operations, for example.
If the UK is not to be more severely constrained than other EC countries by
the terms for monetary union, a redefinition of the PSBR may be necessary,
regardless of the party in power.
There are other good reasons for bringing British public accounting
practices into closer harmony with international standards.
A recent report by Arthur Andersen, the audit and accountancy group, argues
that UK investment is low in comparison with its continental counterparts
and that UK government debt is among the lowest in Europe.
The report suggests that an audit based on commercial accounting principles
would show that the case for lifting government borrowing to finance
investment appeared stronger in Britain than elsewhere. That view would
certainly be music to the ears of politicians seeking to increase public
expenditure.
In short, a sound case for public-accounts reform could be constructed by
who ever resolved to grasp the nettle.
Financing the future. Arthur Andersen, 1 Surrey Street, London WC2R 2PS.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Further fall in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES in the UK fell further last month although inquiries from
purchasers wanting to buy homes rose sharply, Halifax, Britain's biggest
building society, said yesterday.
The society, which publishes a monthly house-price index, said that prices
on average fell by 1.2 per cent last month after a 1.3 per cent fall in
December.
It said: 'Although there were encouraging signs of an upturn in activity in
the housing market in January, this will have little impact on prices over
the next few months.'
The society is forecasting little increase in prices this year. It expects
prices to rise more strongly next year.
The average price of a house last month, at Pounds 64,470, was 3.6 per cent
less than in January last year. The annual fall in the average price of a
new house was even greater, at 4.6 per cent.
The society said yesterday: 'It is too early to talk of recovery, but the
signs are promising. Halifax's estate agency arm reports more customers
visiting their offices than for some time. Applications for mortgages last
month were significantly higher than in December or January last year,
although it should be remembered that mortgage applications last January
were abnormally low during the run-up to the Gulf war.'
The society said that prices would take time to recover, even when sales
started to pick up, because so many unsold properties were still on the
market.
The sharp fall in the number of new homes being started by builders has
stabilised since the summer of last year, according to figures published
yesterday by the Department of the Environment.
They show that 134,800 new private homes were started last year, compared
with 134,900 in 1990. In the final three months of last year, builders
started work on 29,000 new private homes compared with 28,700 in the last
three months of 1990.
Construction companies last year started work on 160,300 houses and flats,
including homes for housing associations and councils - 1,000 fewer than in
the previous year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN one in five of poll tax payers in Labour-controlled boroughs have
received summonses for non-payment, three in four of which have led to court
liability orders, according to a survey of 21 district councils.
The survey, published yesterday by the Local Government Information Unit,
was confined to Labour councils in England. It confirms a report last year
by the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, which found that 21
per cent of poll tax payers required a summons before paying.
According to the survey, conducted between April 1990 and September 1991,
summonses were issued against 442,000 of the nearly 2m poll tax payers
covered by the councils and 77 per cent resulted in liability orders.
Fewer than one in 10 of those summoned had paid their tax in full before
their cases came to court, while 86 per cent of liability orders were being
pursued by bailiffs at the time of the survey.

A PROPOSAL that the G7 group of industrialised countries should combine to
put an Earth satellite into orbit to keep a watch on the state of the global
environment has been put forward by Mr John Major, the prime minister, John
Hunt writes.
He spoke of the plan when he met members of environmental organisations and

Earth Summit, which he will attend in Rio de Janeiro in June.
The satellite would monitor the effectiveness of an international convention
on global warming which is expected to be agreed at the Rio de Janeiro
meeting, being organised by the United Nations.
Mr Major gave full backing to the process and the proposed 'Earth charter'
which will be drawn up there. He emphasised that it had to include practical
actions that could be implemented by governments and international
organisations. Members of 'green' organisations at the two-hour meeting
criticised the government for not doing more to protect the environment.
They were impressed by the prime minister's handling of the meeting,
however, and the seriousness of his approach to the issues.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Hazards cleared from City's flight path: Paul Betts visits
the loss-making airport and finds its prospects much improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON CITY airport yesterday organised its own air show in the Docklands.
In comparison with the Farnborough or Paris air shows it was a tiny affair,
but it marked a significant turning point in the fortunes of the airport,
built by its owner, the Mowlem construction group, 4 1/2 years ago.
The Pounds 35m project, which pioneered the concept of a business airport
dedicated to serving the City and the newly redeveloped London Docklands,
has been struggling to make ends meet.
Sir Philip Beck, the chairman of Mowlem, conceded yesterday that the airport
was still losing about Pounds 3m a year.
With the completion of a Pounds 7m extension of its runway, the airport can
now be used by a range of new turboprop aircraft, including the British
Aerospace ATP, the Swedish Saab 340B, the Franco-Italian ATR42, the Dutch
Fokker 50, the German Dornier 228, the Canadian de Havilland Dash 8 and Dash
7 and - more significantly - the BAe 146 regional jet.
Until it won government approval last September to extend its runway, the
airport was largely restricted to de Havilland Dash 7 short take-off and
landing aircraft.
The snag was that de Havilland decided to stop production of the aircraft -
and its range restricted services from London City to a limited number of
nearby Continental business centres such as Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
With the introduction of BAe 146 jet services and other new turboprops, the
airport has expanded its range to a radius including European cities such as
Stockholm, Rome and Madrid.
Already Air France has decided to operate daily flights using the ATR42 from
the airport to Paris. Crossair, the regional carrier which is 51 per cent
owned by Swissair, is introducing the first BAe 146 jet services into the
airport with a daily service from Zurich.
Mr Bill Charnock, the airport's managing director, says he hopes a number of
new operators will soon announce the opening of services into the Docklands
airport. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is being courted by the airport to start
an Amsterdam service.
The airport still faces a difficult challenge to become viaused it last
year, and Mr Charnock says the airport needs 450,000 to 500,000 passengers a
year to break even. He still hopes to achieve that target by the end of next
year or in 1994, especially now that the airport can be used by a wider
range of turboprop aircraft as well as the short take-off and landing BAe
146.
The airport last year lost one of its main carriers when British Midland
Airways decided to suspend flights after losing between Pounds 12m and
Pounds 15m over four years on its London City operations.
The recession and the decline in air travel caused by the Gulf war also set
the airport back - as it did Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, its three much
bigger London rivals, all owned by BAA, formerly the British Airports
Authority.
Perhaps the biggest handicap of all has been the continued obstacle of
access to the airport from the City.
The airport was promoted on the idea that an executive could reach the
terminal building much more quickly than if he or she had to travel to
Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted on the outskirts of the capital, and check in
only 10 minutes before flight departure.
The journey to the airport is supposed to take only 15 to 20 minutes from
the City. But takes much longer than that because roads in Docklands have
yet to be completed.
The Docklands light railway has been plagued by teething troubles. The
airport has been forced to warn passengers boarding its free shuttle bus to
the light railway that, while the rail journey into the City is supposed to
take eight minutes, 'new trains are currently being introduced into service
and serious delays sometimes occur'. In other words, we advise you not to
use the light railway.
The airport is also connected to the City, the West End and Chelsea by a
Riverbus service along the Thames. This is a picturesque and pleasant way to
travel into the heart of London but takes much longer than 20 minutes,
including waiting time for the shuttle bus and the boat.
The frequency of Riverbus services has been increased and road access should
be significantly improved next year when roads linking Docklands to the City
are completed by the spring.
One exhibitor at yesterday's airport show said: 'If it is to become a
successful business airport, it is absolutely crucial they get their act
together with the roads.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Exports of Scotch earn record Pounds
1.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTCH WHISKY exports earned a record Pounds 1.83bn last year, an increase
of 7 per cent on the Pounds 1.71bn overseas sales in 1990.
Exports to the rest of the European Community rose by 15 per cent to Pounds
717m, accounting for 39 per cent of worldwide sales.
Mr Bill Bewsher, director-general of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the
figures underlined the importance of the EC market to the industry and
emphasised the need for a robust stand by the government to ensure fair tax
treatment.
Recent EC tax harmonisation proposals threatened to raise whisky prices,
particularly in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, which accounted for half
of export earnings from the EC last year.
Sales to those four countries increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 364m.
Mr Bewsher said: 'It is essential for the long-term well-being of the
industry's exports that the government negotiate strongly to reduce and
eventually eliminate the substantial discrimination which Scotch whisky
faces in the EC.
'There is a real need to ensure that not only does Scotch whisky suffer no
disadvantage in its major market, but that the wrong signal is not sent to
the other 175 countries in which it is sold.' Export volumes to the EC
increased by 1 per cent but declined worldwide by slightly more than 4 per
cent to 227.75bn litres of pure alcohol.
Brands bottled in Scotland were resilient to difficult trading conditions,
exacerbated by the Gulf war in the early part of the year.
Overseas volume sales of those brands declined only 2 per cent and earnings
increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.49bn.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Business starts at 500 a day in 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 500 businesses started up each working day during the 1980s,
according to the most comprehensive study made on the role of small
companies in the UK economy.
Such rapid growth in net business starts - after allowing for failures  -
took the total number of businesses to just under 3m at the end of 1989 from
1.8m at the end of 1979, a study published today in Employment Gazette, a
Department of Employment magazine, shows.
Nearly 97 per cent of UK businesses employed fewer than 20 people, and those
buisnesses accounted for almost 35 per cent of total employment outside
central and local government. Less than 0.1 per cent of businesses employed
more than 500, although those companies accounted for just over 34 per cent
of employment.
The growing role of small business in the economy is reflected by the fact
that in 1979 companies employing fewer than 20 people accounted for less
than 27 per cent of total employment. The largest companies accounted for
nearly 43 per cent of employment. The study is based on detailed statistics
up to 1989, but the increased role of small businesses has been maintained
since then, the magazine says. The number of businesses registering for
value added tax rose by 1,000 a week during 1990, and business starts
continued to outnumber failures last year.
The overall numbers are dominated by the very smallest companies, employing
only one or two people. But even if the one-person business, run only by the
owner, is excluded, the general picture is little changed, the researchers
said.
The overall number of companies then drops below 1.5m but the proportion of
those employing fewer than 20 people is still around 95 per cent.
Although the latest studies are comprehensive, small businesses are still
hampered by the large number of sources of data, each of which gives only a
partial view of their role in the economy.

FT  06 FEB 92 / BAA launches programme to improve services at Glasgow
airport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, launched a Pounds 60m investment programme
yesterday to improve international passenger services at Glasgow airport.
The development will be the second stage in the extension and improvement of
the airport. The first stage, also costing Pounds 60m, is due to be
completed in June to provide 70 per cent more space for passengers.
The second stage will include an international pier for up to eight widebody
airliners, taxiways and aprons and an extension to the terminal to improve
international passenger services. Work is to be completed by 1996.
Glasgow has seen an increase in international traffic after the government's
'open skies' policy for Scotland, introduced in 1990. Last year more than 4m
passengers went through Glasgow, of whom almost half were international
travellers. The expansion programme will increase annual capacity from 5.5m
passengers to 10m.
BAA is negotiating the sale of Prestwick airport, Ayrshire. International
traffic has fallen there and switched to Glasgow because of the 'open skies'
policy.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Government body fails to meet training
target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Employment Service, the government agency that helps the unemployed find
work and pays out unemployment benefit, yesterday admitted that it had
failed to meet its training target.
The target, one of a number set annually by Mr Michael Howard, the
employment secretary, specified that for every 2.5 people the service refers
to Employment Training, the government scheme which aims to help the
long-term unemployed return to work, one person should take up a place. In
the current quarter, one person starts a course for every 2.9 people who are
referred.
Mr Ron Leighton, Labour chairman of the Commons employment committee, said
the gap was 'a major shortfall'.
Mr Leighton asked Mr Michael Fogden, chief executive of the Employment
Service, whether the shortfall had arisen because the number of training
places available was fewer than promised.
Mr Fogden said the shortfall could not be attributed to the number of places
available. He said: 'It is about the quality of our selectiveness and
advisory skills.'
This week the Labour party accused the government of underspending the
Employment Training budget by Pounds 70m and raiding the budget to make good
its promises on the parallel Youth Training scheme.
Mr Fogden said the figures were an improvement on the last quarter, when for
every person starting training, 3.2 people had been referred.

FT  06 FEB 92 / MoD knew of supergun project in 1989, MPs are told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICES of Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Alan Clark, a junior defence
minister, were contacted by the company that supplied propellant for the
Iraqi supergun months before parliament learned of the project's existence,
MPs heard yesterday.
Mr Gerald James, former chairman of Astra, the UK defence manufacturer which
went into receivership earlier this week, told the Commons trade and
industry committee that he and Mr Christopher Gumbley, then Astra's chief
executive, notified the Ministry of Defence of the project in September
1989.
Astra had just acquired PRB, the Belgian munitions company, and discovered
that it was working on 'unusual types of propellants for very large guns'
for Iraq.
Officials from the Department of Trade and Industry, the MoD and the Foreign
Office have confirmed that they became aware of Project Babylon as a result
of Astra's disclosures in autumn 1989. Mr James alleged yesterday that Mr
Gumbley had also discussed the company's business with the offices of Mrs
Thatcher and Mr Clark in early 1990. Mr Gumbley was later jailed for nine
months for bribing an MoD official. At his trial he said he was being
'victimised' for his part in exposing the supergun project.
Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, told the Commons in
April 1990 that the government had 'only recently' become aware of the
supergun project.
Mr James told MPs he believed the propellant contract was being financed by
Midland Bank, and said he had learned that Mr Stephan Kock, a former
non-executive director of Astra and consultant for Midland Bank's defence
export financing department, had visited Baghdad in 1988 to arrange the
financing. The bank will give evidence to the committee next week.
In more than 50 pages of evidence, Mr James accused the government and
security services of an 'apparent and deliberate effort to fudge and confuse
the issues by attacking manufacturers and industrialists as if they are
entirely to blame for the government's conduct, when in reality they were
meeting requirements initiated by government'.
Mr James alleged that Astra had been steered into three of its biggest
acquisitions, including that of PRB, in the 1980s by members of the
government and security services. During the acquisition of PRB, Sir John
Cuckney, a former Midland Bank director and an ex-member of MI5 and chairman
of venture capital group 3i, Astra's main shareholder, had telephoned him to
urge him to complete the deal as quickly as possible.
Mr James said the UK defence industry in the 1980s was being influenced by a
group he called the 'Savoy mafia', which he alleged comprised ministers,
defence officials and company directors who met at the suite of Mr Alan
Curtis, chairman of the Lotus group, in the Savoy Hotel in London. They
included Mr George Younger, then defence secretary, Mr Colin Chandler, head
of defence sales, Sir Peter Levene, then head of defence procurement, and
others whose names Mr James said he would supply privately to the committee.
Mr James said Mr Curtis also seemed to work closely with Mr Steve Tipping, a
close friend of Mr Mark Thatcher, son of the former prime minister. Mr James
was introduced to Mr Curtis at an Army Air Corps open day at Middle Wallop,
Hampshire, in 1988, at which Sir Denis Thatcher and Mark were present.
Mr Ken Warren, committee chairman, said: 'It appeared to you that Mr Curtis,
as chairman of Lotus, could open doors right to the very top in government?'
Mr James said 'Yes.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Peugeot Talbot likely to go ahead with
working changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT TALBOT, the carmaker, is likely to introduce changes in working
practices at its Coventry plants today after workers voted by a small
majority for industrial action against them.
Fewer than 1,400 voted in the ballot to sanction industrial action short of
a strike and about 1,200 voted against. Although union leaders can legally
order action if more than half of votes are in favour of it, the likelihood
is that they will not do so at Peugeot because the majority is so narrow.
Peugeot's plans are the latest in a series of moves among carmakers to
improve productivity in the face of growing competition from Japanese
companies setting up or expanding plants in the UK. Peugeot intends to
increase production-line speeds and cut break periods.
Since first announcing its plans in early December it has indicated that the
initial target of cutting 12 minutes a day from workers' breaks will be
eased.
It is still seeking the 4 per cent increase in line speeds that it
originally sought.
The changes are aimed at increasing productivity by about 5.5 per cent,
against the 7 per cent originally envisaged. The new target would increase
weekly output of 2,120 cars by about 115.
Peugeot would not comment yesterday on its plans. In the past, it has said
the changes would not put pressure on the hardest-working employees. Work
would be reorganised at points on the line where pressure was greatest,
although overall the number of workers would not be increased.
The changes will affect about 2,500 of the 3,500 hourly paid Peugeot
workforce. The company employs 6,000, including managers and white-collar
staff.
Peugeot originally planned to introduce the changes at the beginning of this
year. It says that the present 42 minutes each day for tea breaks is
inconsistent with the rest of the motor manufacturing industry. Other
carmakers seeking agreements to change working practices from their
workforces include Rover and Vauxhall.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Orient-style carpet sells for pounds 33,000: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CARPET created by William Morris in about 1890 for Old Swan House on
London's Chelsea Embankment sold for Pounds 33,000 at Christie's yesterday,
slightly above estimate. The carpet, measuring 396 cm by 380 cm, was
inspired by Persian and Turkish designs of the 16th century.
It was the top price in an auction of British decorative arts from 1880 to
the present day.
A design by Morris for a stained glass window, depicting a minstrel holding
cymbals, sold for Pounds 9,350, while a Burne-Jones design, of the Virgin
Mary, for another stained glass window, made by Morris &amp; Co, went for Pounds
10,450.
Other important names with work in the auction were Charles Rennie
Mackin-tosh and Sir Edward Lutyens.
An ebonised and painted corner cabinet, catalogued as designed by Mackintosh
and painted by his wife Margaret, sold for Pounds 13,200, slightly below
forecast. There had been some doubts about its provenance.
Much of the furniture designed by Lutyens was withdrawn before the auction,
but a pair of side cabinets, in the Renaissance style, part of the interior
decoration of Heathcote, Ilkley, West Yorkshire, the first commission in
which Lutyens designed the house as well as the contents, sold for Pounds
5,500.
The biggest surprise of the day was the Pounds 28,600 paid for the Yatman
bed, designed by William Burges in 1858 in the Jacobean style as a wedding
present for his patron, the Rev J. A. Yatman. The half-tester bed doubled
its estimate.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BT may impose redundancies in building
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT is considering compulsory redundancies in the running down of its
building services division, according to a management discussion document.
BT has so far avoided compulsory redundancies in its programme, which
started in April 1990, aimed at cutting the 220,000-strong workforce by more
than 30,000.
The internal memo now says that, to contract out more building work, an
'enabling tool' will be required from the personnel department to allow
compulsory redundancies for grades covered by the National Communications
Union, the main BT union.
BT has never formally ruled out compulsory redundancies. But it has a
comprehensive voluntary redundancy agreement with the NCU which provides for
generous severance terms.
Nevertheless, the company has been having difficulty in reaching its
redundancy targets voluntarily. It has also refused to refrain from
compulsorily retiring 4,000 male workers aged 60 or over, although the NCU
says it has improved severance terms.
The NCU believes that the 30,000 redundancy target has now been raised to
50,000. The union says the company may seek a further 18,000 redundancies
this year.
Mr Billy McClory, an NCU official, said yesterday that the pressure for
compulsory redundancies was growing and said that areas of BT that were
seeking labour, such as personal communications, were not taking it from
those which were trying to shed it, such as business communications.
Plans to shed 1,500 cleaning jobs were also disclosed yesterday. The move is
part of the effort to dispose of 'non-core' activities by selling businesses
or contracting out services.
Six years ago BT had 4,000 cleaning staff - numbers have been reduced by
contracting out and the process is due to be completed within the next two
years.
BT said that, in a similar exercise in 1990 involving 3,000 catering staff,
80 per cent of the employees involved took up jobs with the catering company
that won the contract.
BT says it is likely the cleaning jobs will follow a similar pattern. A
voluntary redundancy package is on offer for those who do not go to work for
private contractors, but enforced job losses have not been ruled out.
The Union of Communication Workers, which represents most of the cleaners,
has failed to win contracts for cleaning co-operatives.
It now fears that some cleaners may end up taking a wage cut if they work
for private contractors.
BT pay is Pounds 3.63 an hour but the UCW says it has found some contractors
paying as little as Pounds 2.50 an hour.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Many restrictions on dealers must cease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE commission finds that the selective and exclusive distribution system
operated by car suppliers constitutes a complex monopoly in favour of the 24
main suppliers in the market for new cars.
It recommends removal of restrictions on franchised dealers which:
Limit a dealership's freedom to advertise outside its territory.
Limit a dealership's freedom to hold or acquire dealerships outside that
territory from other suppliers.
Prevent a dealership holding or acquiring competing dealerships within its
territory, although the supplier may require that any other dealership
acquired must be on a distinct and separate site and a reasonable distance
from the acquiring dealership.
Restrict the extent to which a dealership can sell car-related goods or
services, such as hire, second-hand car sales, fast-fit or multi-brand
servicing outside its territory.
Limit the total number of the supplier's cars that any dealer or dealer
group may sell during any given period, or the proportion of the total sales
of its cars that may be made by any dealer or dealer group.
The selective and exclusive distribution arrangements 'restrict the dealers'
independence and freedom of action, and some of the restrictions have
adverse effects on competition and prices,' the commission says.
It accepts, however, the car industry's argument that the system provides
'consumers with after-sales repair and service facilities that they can be
confident are backed by the car suppliers' and it says the system also
encourages inter-brand competition.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Few significant differences in prices found: MMC reports on
the car industry broadly back UK dealers but find that smaller vehicles are
much cheaper in France and Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANALYSIS of car price differences across Europe was a core task for the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Surveys in recent years by the Consumers Association and the Federation of
European Consumer Associations have claimed that UK prices are substantially
higher than those for comparable cars in some other EC countries.
The commission concludes, however, that 'a comparison of the price ranges in
the UK with those in France and Germany, the two markets studied most
similar to the UK in size and both with substantial indigenous manufacturing
capacity, does not indicate a significant difference in general price
levels.'
That does not apply so closely to prices for smaller cars, however. The
commission says there are several model variants in France and Germany
'whose adjusted prices appear on any of our assumptions to be considerably
lower than those in the UK'.
The commission points out that prices in Belgium and in the Netherlands tend
to be below those in the other markets in all segments, with particularly
noticeable differences in the segment for small cars.
'These smaller markets, however, are affected by a number of factors,
including the Belgian price control system and the absence in both countries
of a major indigenous manufacturer. Prices in markets of this nature are
necessarily less reliable guides to the potential level of prices in the
UK.'
The commission says the results of its work do not lead it to expect
significant differences in prices between the UK and France or Germany in
the future. 'We think it reasonable to assume, however, that for individual
models, particularly in the smaller car segment, prices to private customers
in the UK will be higher than those available in other EC countries, and
especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, and that from time to time even
the general level of prices may be expected to diverge.'
The commission says that list-price differences between the UK and other EC
markets are indeed wide, but they narrow considerably when they are adjusted
for different levels of equipment specification. In addition, 'some
estimation of actual transaction prices is essential,' says the report.
The commission relied on information from the carmakers for its evidence for
discount levels and other financial benefits offered to buyers and therefore
for actual transaction prices. It also accepted that exchange-rate
fluctuations have an 'major impact on price differences at any point in
time' and accordingly made further significant price adjustments.
An appendix to the report indicates the fierce lobbying carried out by the
carmakers, in particular in response to the controversial early comparative
price research carried out for the commission by Ludvigsen Associates (LAL).
'We received criticisms of various aspects of the LAL report,' says the
commission.
'We also received serious complaints from two of the major suppliers,
Vauxhall and Ford. Vauxhall, following the recent publication by a company
associated with LAL of a report on the motor industry, suggested that LAL
had made use of the work it had carried out for us and information supplied
in confidence by Vauxhall, in a publication made with a view to commercial
gain. It was suggested that a breach of the prohibition in section 133 (1)
of the act on the disclosure of information might have occurred.'
Ford argued that LAL's apparent commercial interest in a marketing venture
whose success was not consistent with selective distribution in its present
form was incompatible with its role as the commission's consultant.
Vauxhall raised other objections, and the commission says: 'We were
therefore requested to expunge from our report all reference to the LAL work
and to base no conclusions on this work.'
LAL rejected the allegations of bias, however, and the commission backed it
up.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Auditors criticise banking practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, yesterday criticised international
practices that allowed banks to transfer funds in 'such a way that the
identity of the original paying or receiving bank's customer is concealed'.
The comment came in the firm's first detailed account of its role as auditor
to Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the group closed last year
after being fraudulently managed for years.
The firm was replying to questions from the Commons Treasury and Civil
Service committee, which is trying to ascertain - among other issues -
whether PW was remiss in its duties as auditor or whether the regulatory
system needs changing.
PW said the fraud was kept hidden for years because BCCI used a 'scheme of
deception' which was both 'sophisticated and complex'. It highlighted four
factors that prevented outsiders from uncovering the fraud:
All significant executive power was concentrated in the hands of two men,
the founder, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, and his chief executive officer, Mr Swaleh
Naqvi.
The board of directors, which 'included several experienced European
bankers', gave credibility to the bank's loan portfolio;
The rapid worldwide expansion of the group and the scale of daily banking
business helped it hide and spread improper transactions.
The resources of bank regulators in Luxembourg and Cayman, BCCI's main
territories of incorporation, were 'not commensurate with the fast expanding
worldwide operations of the group'.
The next question it addressed was when it first detected 'widespread
fraud'. It said that its 1987 and 1988 audits found imprudent lending and
that during the 1989 audit it identified that - contrary to management's
assurances - further lending had been made to customer accounts that had
already received big loans.
PW identified loan transactions 'for which senior management were unable to
provide adequate explanation'.
The accountancy firm then 'communicated concerns and their implications on
the credibility of management to the Bank of England in early 1990'.
PW continued to brief the Bank of England, in March and April 1990, having
become concerned about other banking transactions. At the suggestion of PW,
BCCI's audit committee set up a task force to investigate the suspicious
transactions.
In a report to the Bank on April 18 1990, more than a year before BCCI was
closed by the Bank, PW wrote: 'Our inquiries . . . have indicated that
certain accounting transactions principally booked in Cayman and other
offshore centres have either been false or deceitful'.
Four months later, PW learned that Dollars 500m of loans to 'major
customers' had been concealed.
By October, the size of the fraud had become more apparent since the Abu
Dhabi government, the controlling shareholder in BCCI, was pledging Dollars
1.5bn of support to cover potential losses on the problem loan accounts.
In the coming months, PW uncovered more details of the fraud, culminating in
the report it delivered on June 22 last year to the Bank of England which
led to the closure of BCCI.
However, the auditors said they never expressed an opinion to the Bank of
England on the matter of whether BCCI should retain its authorisation as a
bank.
Price Waterhouse said it did not believe that bank secrecy laws impeded its
work as BCCI's auditor or undermined its separate role as accountants
reporting on BCCI to the Bank of England.
However, it mentioned an exception in the case of Swiss secrecy laws, which
precluded BCCI's Swiss affiliate from providing BCCI with 'customer specific
information'.
On the other hand, it was critical of practice which allowed banks to
transfer funds throughout the international banking system in 'such a way
that the identity of the original paying or receiving bank's customer is
concealed'.
Price Waterhouse then gave a clue to how the fraud was committed by making a
recommendation on new controls that could be introduced to prevent misuse of
the banking system.
It stated that when funds are transferred between correspondent banks - or
banks which have a close business relationship - officials of those banks
should insist on being told the identity of all parties involved in the
transaction, including the banks' customers.
Price Waterhouse also provided an explanation of why it did not qualify
BCCI's 1989 accounts - an accounting procedure that would have cast doubt on
BCCI's fin-ancial performance - even though the accountancy firm had
evidence of 'deceitful transactions'.
Among other reasons, it said, 'the Bank of England . . . had been informed
of all the uncertainties known to Price Waterhouse and of the
financial-support commit-ment by the government of Abu Dhabi, and decided to
allow BCCI to continue to operate'.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Market distorted by use of company cars as perks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY cars, particularly when given wholly or partly as a perk, distort
the UK car market, the commission says.
'We consider that they have been a factor in leading to a generally higher
level of specification in the UK within model ranges and that this has been
reflected in prices.'
The report says that in the company-car sector, big fleet purchasers can
secure fleet and volume discounts not available to others - and particularly
not to private consumers.
It concludes that this has raised the prices paid by private buyers. It
adds, however, that UK cars are much more richly equipped than equivalent
models in continental markets.
The report says the present system of company-car provision puts the private
buyer at a disadvantage.
It says: 'The higher prices paid by the private consumer finance the
discounts given to company car buyers, since the major suppliers have to
retrieve from other buyers the revenues forgone by offering extra discounts
on these substantial sales if they are to keep their UK operations viable
over time.'
The commission accepts that recent increases in the level of taxation of the
benefit of private use of company cars have reduced their attractiveness. It
says the higher tax level and the introduction in 1992-93 of employers'
liability for national insurance contributions on company-car benefits may
reduce the number of company cars.
It adds: 'Company cars, however, still offer substantial private-use
benefits and we recognise that the company-car culture and current attitudes
cannot easily be changed even if tax neutrality were attained.'
The commission suggests that banding the tax-scale charges by original
market value and engine capacity has caused a clustering of highly specified
cars at particular thresholds.
It recommends that banding should be replaced by expressing the scale charge
as a percentage of the car list price or cost. That would remove
discrimination against those buying cheaper cars in the band.

FT  06 FEB 92 / TV company to take case to the Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL SHAPE of the new ITV network was still in doubt last night after
the Appeal Court gave Television South West permission to go to the House of
Lords to challenge the Independent Television Commission's decision not to
renew its franchise.
TSW failed to persuade the court to quash the ITC's decision to award the
licence for south-west England to Westcountry Television, which bid Pounds
7.8m against TSW's Pounds 16.1m.
Mr Harry Turner, TSW's managing director, said the company's stance had been
totally vindicated. 'We have shone a torch in the very dusty corners of some
ITC procedures,' he said.
TSW had criticised the ITC's decision as 'unfair and irrational' and said it
had misled TSW by applying more stringent criteria in assessing its key
financial forecasts than had been originally indicated.
The ITC rejected TSW's application on the ground that it had overbid to such
an extent that it would not be able to sustain a quality service over the
10-year licence period. It described TSW's forecast of growth in advertising
revenue over the period as 'excessively optimistic'.
Dismissing TSW's case by a 2-1 majority, the Appeal Court said the detailed
grounds on which the commission had assessed TSW's business plan as
unacceptably optimistic had been put before the court. Lord Justice Nolan
said: 'The judgment of the ITC may be right or wrong, but it is fully
explained and, thus explained, it is plainly one which the ITC was entitled
to make.'
Lord Justice Steyn, agreeing, said TSW had not established its claim that
the ITC's decision was influenced by a flawed and unfair assessment of its
bid prepared by the ITC staff.
The assessment was so obviously a distortion of the true position that the
commission's experienced members would probably not have been misled by it,
he said.
In a dissenting judgment, Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, said he would
have set aside the ITC decision so the commissioners could take a 'fresh
look' at both bids for the south-west franchise.
Lord Donaldson said that, although his description of the staff assessment
paper during the court hearing as a 'hatchet job' might have been an
exaggeration, the fact remained that it did not fairly state the case for,
as well as against, TSW's application.
There were 'reasonable grounds' for considering that TSW's bid had not
received the fair evaluation to which it was entitled under the 1990
Broadcasting Act.
The evidence put in by the ITC had not changed his mind on that point.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Businessman remanded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSINESSMAN charged over the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International was refused bail when he appeared before City of London
magistrates yesterday.
Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, 66, of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, is accused of
conspiring to falsely inform accountants that a company owed BCCI more than
Dollars 76m. He was remanded in custody until February 11.
Mr Baqi is a former managing director of Attock Oil, an oilproducing and
trading group based in London. He is the first person to be arrested in
Britain in connection with the investigation.
It is alleged that he conspired with Mr Basheer Chowdry and other members of
the BCCI senior management to supply audit confirmations to Price
Waterhouse, external auditors of BCCI (Overseas) Ltd, showing that Attock
Oil International owed BCCI sums totalling Dollars 76,517,952 - to his
knowledge misleading, false or deceptive in that the debts were not in fact
owed.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Productivity at Ford lagged rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE leading UK carmakers, Ford, Rover and Vauxhall, have provided the
commission with data on productivity improvements in the five years to 1990.
It shows Ford lagging sharply behind its rivals.
The commission's calculations show that Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot - at its
Ryton, Coventry assembly plant - have achieved large improvements in
productivity.
Based on output per employee, Vauxhall achieved a 78 per cent rise in
productivity between 1986 and 1990, and Peugeot achieved a similar increase
of 74 per cent.
Ford's productivity in 1990 was only 9 per cent better than in 1986,
however, and actually fell back in 1990 from 1989.
Rover, which said it saw itself as 'fully competitive with other European
plants' measured by the hours taken to produce a car, said that it was
disadvantaged in terms of other costs by its low scale of output.
It improved its productivity by 28 per cent between 1986 and 1990 but also
deteriorated between 1989 and 1990.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Monopoly is found in supply of parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE commission's report into the supply of car parts UK finds that a complex
monopoly exists in favour of carmakers, but that there are no practices
operating against the public interest.
The commission says there is active competition between component suppliers
and in wholesaling to the independent sector.
However, there is still little direct competition in supply to the
carmakers' franchised dealers, in spite of the partial removal of exclusive
purchasing requirements after the commission's investigation of cars parts
in 1982.
The complex monopoly exists, the commission says, because carmakers use one
or more of the following restrictive practices in supplying parts to their
franchised dealers:
Taking account of parts sales in calculating general dealer bonuses and
rebates, which was an inducement for dealers to sell the maker's parts.
Preventing dealers from acting as distributors for suppliers of competing
parts.
Refusing to supply branded parts except to their own franchised dealers.
Withholding diagnostic equipment or related information required for
servicing their cars from persons other than their dealers.
Applying conditions that restrict the ability of com-ponent manufacturers to
supply the independent sector.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Death toll rises in Algeria: Demonstrators take to guns in
street battles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIGHTING resumed yesterday in the Algerian mountain town of Batna, where
Moslem militants say 15 people have been killed and dozens wounded in
two-days of clashes with troops and police.
Local security forces said eight people had been killed and 57 wounded since
the violence erupted on Tuesday. Algiers radio reported last night that
sporadic gunfire could still be heard and helicopters were flying over the
town. It added that the security forces had again used teargas in continuing
clashes with the fundamentalists angered that a Batna court had sentenced a
local preacher to two months in jail for inciting rebellion.
He was one of scores of preachers arrested in a government crackdown on the
use of mosques for political ends by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS), which won 47 per cent of the vote in last December's first
round of elections and was confident of victory had the second round not
been cancelled.
An army captain was among those wounded in Batna and the authorities
reported the first use of guns by demonstrators since last June's riots.
The incident is the latest in a string of protests which have led to running
street battles and to protesters being killed. The most serious clashes last
week were in the eastern capital of Constantine and the southern town of
Laghouat.
The FIS has called on militants to march after Friday prayers on February 14
from Algiers' May 1st Square to Martyrs' Square. The march would demand an
end to 'political piracy' which the FIS says brought a five-man presidency
to power last month in a coup d'etat.
Meanwhile, at least four bombs were thrown in Algiers during the past week.
The targets included the US embassy, the French consulate, and the Ministry
of Justice. Friday prayers in the three or four areas of the city which are
FIS strongholds (Bab el Oued, Kouba, Belcourt and Badjarah) remain tense
with an ever present risk of violence. The FIS yesterday repeated its claim
that only an an Islamic state can achieve stability.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Indonesia 'committed' to E Timor inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING and GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALI ALATAS, Indonesia's foreign minister, last night reaffirmed his
government's commitment to bring to justice all involved in the killing of
dozens of civilians by security forces in an East Timor funeral procession
clash in November.
But he said he did not know if a specially appointed military council would
court-martial any of the armed forces involved, nor did he indicate when its
investigations would be completed. He pleaded only for the international
community not to prejudge the affair.
At a press conference in London after meeting Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK
foreign secretary, he pledged that a United Nations envoy, due to arrive in
Jakarta on Sunday, would be given free rein to examine what Mr Alatas
described as the 'tragedy'.
He gave a detailed breakdown of the numbers of civilians - among them
supporters of the island's Fretilin independence movement - whom he said
were still being held for their part in allegedly inciting the violence. Of
56 in detention, four were ready to be brought to trial on charges of
subversion, to which they had 'readily and proudly confessed'.
Twelve others would stand trial on lesser criminal counts, while most or all
of the rest were to be released.
At their meeting Mr Hurd reiterated Britain's concern over human rights in
Indonesia but welcomed the summary report of the Jakarta government's
inquiry. The report estimated that 50 died and 90 were still missing,
figures which are challenged by independent witnesses as too low.
Britain has since resumed its aid programme, and annual discussions on aid
between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the former colonial power, are to
take place this month as scheduled.
New aid from Canada remains suspended, although a spokesman for that
government said it too was encouraged by the summary report and Mr Alatas is
expected in Ottawa later this month.
Mr Alatas last night condemned the cut-off of aid by some countries as
'irrational and maybe counter-productive'.
Portugal remains hostile to Indonesia and has accused the government of
torturing East Timorese arrested after the November 12 massacre. Indonesia
invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, annexing the
territory a year later in a move still unrecognised by the UN.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, this week appointed Mr
Amos Waco, Kenya's attorney general, as his special envoy.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Iran presses on with campaign to rebuild its military might
/ A report on Tehran's re-armament, fuelled by a desire for regional power
as well as suspicion of its neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEHRAN Radio, in a rare announcement recently, gave some details of Iran's
defence budget: the country's parliament had approved an allocation of
IR413bn to the Ministry of Defence and Armed Force Logistics for training,
technical research and arms purchase. This money would translate into
Dollars 5.9bn at the artificially high official exchange rate of IR70 to the
dollar or into Dollars 295m at the more realistic floating rate of IR1400 to
the dollar.
But, even though reliable estimates are hard to come by, it is highly
unlikely that Iran is spending as little as Dollars 295m a year on
rebuilding its defences since the end following its eight-year war with Iraq
that ended four years ago.
'Military Balance,' the annual defence review of the International Institute
of Strategic Studies, put the defence budget at just over Dollars 3bn for
1990 and Dollars 3.8bn for 1991.
This would account for 17 per cent of the Dollars 17.3bn in foreign exchange
earnings from oil in 1990 and just under 24 per cent for last year. If the
latter is true, then 1990 defence expenditure higher would be greater than
that spent on food imports. A report published in the Tehran daily newspaper
Jomhuri Islami said that Iran spent just under Dollars 12bn during the
1980-88 war against Iraq, making an average of Dollars 1.5bn a year. This
compares with an average of Dollars 8.4bn per annum during the last four
years of the Shah's rule.
However much Iran is spending on defence today, one thing is certain,
according to Dr Nikola Schahgaldian of the US-based Rand Corporation: 'The
rebuilding of the Iranian armed forces is a basic goal of the government in
Tehran; there is no disagreement between the decision makers on this.'
It would be surprising were it otherwise.
Iran's capitulation to the Iraqis, in the form of accepting UN Security
Council Resolution 598 calling for a ceasefire, was because it no longer had
the weapons with which to fight. Mr Mohsen Rezai, commander of the
Revolutionary Guards, said a few months after the ceasefire: 'They had
armour and we did not . . . We were unarmed infantrymen against the enemy's
cavalry.' With Saddam Hussein still in power in Iraq and continuing to make
bellicose noises towards Iran, Tehran views the defence of its western
border as vital. It does not want to be caught off guard as it was when Iraq
took advantage of the internal Iranian turmoil caused by the 1979
revolution. Iraq was able to invade when the highest ranking military
officer in Iran was a colonel.
The break-up of the Soviet Union is another factor. Iran is anxious about
the long-term potential for stability in the re-emerging Moslem republics
along its northern border. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati went on a ten-day tour of
six republics last November and has signed a series of co-operation
agreements.
But the potential for conflict remains, particularly with Azerbaijan, since
there is a risk that Iran's own Azeri minority might attempt to break away
and join their northern neighbour.
Moreover, Iran's desire to rebuild its armed forces is not confined solely
to defensive considerations.
It also wants to become the major power in the Gulf, filling the vacuum
caused by the recent defeat of rival Iraq by the US-led coalition. Tehran's
security plan is to establish a common defence pact with the six nations of
the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) - an offer which has been extended a
highly cautious welcome by the council members.
Bruised by the experience of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, some GCC
countries, notably Kuwait and Qatar, have decided, at least for the time
being, to rely on the US for support through bilateral pacts.
Iran is also keeping a wary eye on Saudi Arabia and would consider any
build-up in US-Saudi security arrangements as a potential threat to its own
security. Iran is therefore aiming to build its forces to match the far
superior Saudi military.
There is, however, little likelihood that Iran could quickly return to the
formidable defensive capability it enjoyed under the Shah. As one of the
US's closest allies, the Shah was allowed the cream of US and West European
technology and weaponry. Tehran now has to resort to anything it can buy,
and the result is a mishmash of armoury from East and West.
Iran has bought two squadrons of Mig-29 fighter aircraft Sukhoi bombers and
tanks from the Soviet Union. It has more than 100 aircraft from the Iraqi
army which it has not returned, comprising mostly Soviet makes but also
French Mirage aircraft. These are alongside US F-14s from the Shah's era,
most of which lack spare parts and maintenance. Other military purchases
have been made from China, North Korea, western Europe, Brazil, Argentina
and Pakistan.
Western criticism of Soviet arms sales to Iran may put a brake on military
transfers; Marshal Yevgeni Shaposhnikov, chief of the armed forces of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, said earlier this week that arms sales
to Iran would be reduced.
The Iranian army and navy are being streamlined with attempts to merge the
forces of the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) with the more professional regular
forces. The two navies operated under a unified command in exercises late
last year. The Ministry for the Revolutionary Guards was subsumed under the
Defence Ministry by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani soon after he
took office in 1989.
Meanwhile, speculation about Iran's seeking a nuclear weapons capability
remains just that. Tehran is continuing the nuclear power programme started
by the Shah but as yet has no completed nuclear reactors. Germany has pulled
out of building the Bushehr nuclear power plant, but China has confirmed
furnishing some equipment. However, Iran, which is a signatory to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is obliged to allow visits from the
International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its facilities.
The agency inspected Iran's nuclear facilities last November and it hopes to
send inspectors again this month. 'We are satisfied with what Iran has
declared to us,' the agency said yesterday. 'We are aware of rumours of
activities beyond that, and are examining the possibility of clarifying the
true situation with the Iranian authorities.'
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati this week denied western press
reports that Iran was trying to lure nuclear scientists from the former
Soviet Union. 'That is a false, hostile propaganda against us,' he said.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Mohammed is favourite name for Israeli babies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN ISRAEL last year, the most popular name for newborn babies was not Moshe,
or Rachel, but Mohammed. Third most popular, according to Interior Ministry
figures, was Ahmed.
The explanation lies in the fact that the birth rate among Israel's Arab
minority is much greater, proportionately, than among the Jewish population,
a trend which has profound long-term political implications.
Official figures show that in 1991, Israel's 4.1m Jews produced 71,000
babies, while the Arab population of 900,000 produced 30,000. The official
Arab numbers include 150,000 in occupied East Jerusalem but not those in the
West Bank and Gaza.
Israeli concern to prevent a steady erosion of the Jewish majority is one of
the reasons the country's leaders have rejoiced at the flood of Jewish
immigration from the former Soviet Union over the past two years. It is also
one of the reasons why there is anxiety over a recent fall in the numbers of
olim, or immigrants, arriving from the Commonwealth of Independent States.
In 1991 and 1990, immigration totalled more than 370,000, the vast majority
coming from Russia and other former Soviet states. This boosted annual
Jewish population growth to more than 5 per cent, ahead of the Arab rate of
about 3 per cent for the first time in some years.
With officials confidently predicting the arrival of a further 600,000 to
700,000 Jews from the CIS by mid-decade, the Israeli fear that the Arab
minority would within three decades account from more than one quarter of
the population - gaining, for example, enough electoral power to make or
break governments - receded. Officials talked of the Jewish state gaining
'critical mass'.
However, the severe economic difficulties engendered by immigration,
particularly unemployment of 10 per cent and rising, have recently been
blamed for a sharp decline in the the numbers of immigrants from the CIS.
In January, immigration totalled just under 7,375, of whom 6,237 were from
former Soviet territories, the lowest monthly count since the explosion of
Soviet emigration in late 1989.
'I think we are on the verge of missing a big opportunity for immigration
because of the hardships of severe unemployment and housing problems,' said
Mr Uri Gordon, a senior official at the Jewish Agency, the body responsible
for immigration, last week. 'Continuation of the current situation could
slowly extinguish immigration.' That view is seen by many as too
pessimistic. A few years ago, monthly Jewish immigration of more than 5,000
would have been seen as a spectacular achievement by the government.
If so, the Jewishness of the Jewish state will be cemented. But in the
broader context of both Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
the immigration wave is not expected to delay for very long the catch-up
effect of a faster Arab birth-rate.
Reuter adds from Washington: Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, said
yesterday the US would not grant Israel the Dollars 10bn loan guarantees
unless it was sure the money would not be used to promote policies it
opposed.
Speaking to the Senate foreign relations committee, Mr Baker made it clear
the US was by no means committed to giving Israel any or all of the aid it
has requested to pay for the immigration of hundreds of thousands of people
from the former Soviet Union. He did not mention the word 'settlements' but
that clearly was his intent when he said: 'We should give consideration to
those things that would make it clear that if we were going to do this we
would do it in a manner that supported United States policy and not in
manner that ran counter to United States policy.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: EC to extend copyright for heirs of
authors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEIRS of authors would earn protected royalties from the writer's work for
an additional 10 or 20 years after the writer's death in most EC countries,
under draft copyright legislation approved by the European Commission
yesterday.
The Commission plans to harmonise copyright protection at 70 years in the
Community. That would mean an extension of protection in all countries
except Germany, which already has a 70-year limit, and Spain, which protects
authors' copyright for 60 years. All 10 remaining member states have a limit
of 50 years.
The rights of performers, broadcasters and record producers would be set at
50 years after publication or broadcasting, compared with between 20 and 50
years in most member states.
If approved by EC members states, the legislation could play havoc with
publishers' forward planning for this decade.
In recent years the industry has welcomed the expiry of copyright as an
opportunity to commission new editions of famous works. In Britain, for
example, 1992 will see a spate of new editions of the novels of James Joyce
and Virginia Woolf. They both died in 1941, and their oeuvres came out of
copyright at the beginning of last month.
The draft legislation would mean that any writers' work still covered by
copyright protection on January 1, 1994, would earn an extension from 50 or
60 years to the new 70-year limit.
Protection would not be renewed for works which had already emerged from
copyright.
The Commission move is aimed at removing potential distortions in the
publishing market after internal EC barriers to trade come down at the end
of this year. But according to officials the draft directive is also in line
with the trend worldwide.
The World Intellectual Property Organisation is looking at a standard
70-year limit, and a number of countries have tabled draft legislation which
proposes 70 years of protection.

FT  06 FEB 92 / EC acts on Dutch building cartel
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has begun legal proceedings against the Dutch
government, which the EC believes condoned an illegal cartel operated by the
country's industry federation involving up to 7,000 builders, writes Andrew
Hill from Brussels.
According to the Commission, the cartel has dominated the Dutch construction
industry for the last 12 years, and accounts for about 40 per cent of the
sector's turnover. Brussels yesterday imposed fines of Ecu22.5m (Pounds
16.04m) on the 28 construction associations which are members of the
federation, the SPO.
The Commission has been investigating the cartel for more than three years.
The SPO had offered to amend its methods - which involved deciding in
advance the terms and candidates for contract tenders - but could not go far
enough to satisfy Brussels.
The Commission said it had imposed only a token fine on the SPO partly
because of the federation's 'relatively co-operative attitude'. All three
Baltic states will reach trade and co-operation agreements with the EC this
month, as a first step to formal association with the Community. Terms will
be similar to those negotiated with central European states, writes David
Buchan in Brussels.
Following the initialling of trade and co-operation accords with Lithuania
and Latvia on February 1 and 4, the Commission said yesterday a similar
arrangement would be reached with Estonia on February 24.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Bonn to merge railways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government is to go ahead with reforms to transform its
debt-laden, loss-making railways into competitive, commercial businesses, Mr
Gunther Krause, the transport minister, said yesterday.
He was commissioned by the Bonn cabinet yesterday to produce a grand plan by
midsummer for merging the west German Bundesbahn and the eastern Reichsbahn,
and running them together as an Aktiengesellschaft (public limited company),
to be called Deutsche Eisenbahn AG.
The government, meanwhile, gave itself until the middle of next year to push
through constitutional changes necessary to give up direct state
administration of the networks.
By freeing the rail system from direct state control, Mr Krause claimed, the
expected burden on taxpayers of DM417bn (Pounds 145.2bn) by the end of the
decade could be reduced to DM257bn.
At present the Reichsbahn is losing about DM10bn a year and the Bundesbahn,
with twice as much track, about DM7bn on turnover of DM20bn. Each has its
own management, although Mr Heinz Durr, a supporter of a more business-like
approach, is in overall charge.
Mr Krause yesterday gave some hints that he might consider some of Mr Durr's
more adventurous proposals, such as selling off land and privatising bus
lines currently owned by the Bundesbahn. He suggested, for example, possible
'other uses' for railway property.
The Bundesbahn, DM45bn in debt, owns or holds stakes in a wide range of
businesses, including travel agencies, house-building concerns and financial
services.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Russian military adviser calls for army to defend country's

<TEXT>
THE military adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin has called for the
formation of a Russian army to defend the country's national interests,
writes John Lloyd. The call comes as the Ministry of Defence, theoretically
serving forces united under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, drafts a document on control of the military ahead of the next CIS
meeting in Minsk on February 14. Few give it much chance of success.
Mr Yeltsin's adviser, General Konstantin Kobets, said yesterday in an
article that 'an uncontrollable process was now beginning' in the armed
forces and that clear decisions had to be taken. 'We must state that Russia
has its own interests and will defend them with force,' Gen Kobets warned.

THE struggle to keep the Russian budget deficit within reasonable limits was
further weakened yesterday. Ministers admitted that state spending would
have to rise while some taxes would be cut to protect living standards,
writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
At the same time huge sums are being lost through the non-collection of
taxes.
The battle for budget containment, if lost, will have a serious effect on
Russia's attempt to obtain Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn (Pounds 2.8bn-Pounds
3.4bn) from the west to stabilise the rouble. The two main contributors to
such a fund - the US and Japan - point to continuing financial indiscipline
in Russia as a reason for waiting to give support until Russia is granted
IMF membership - probably in May or June.
The Russian authorities are now showing signs of strain, even of panic, in
face of relentless price rises. There are also, as yet, few signs of
increased production and supply - though ministers insist shops are becoming
better stocked.
Mr Genady Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister of Russia, last night
told a group of Russian deputies that a new party must be formed to support
President Boris Yeltsin and sustain the reform process.
His speech appears to open a campaign to rally organised support for the
Russian president. Opposition demonstrations are planned in Moscow this
weekend.
Mr Burbulis's call, made to the party led by Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the
vice-president, who has been critical of Mr Yeltsin, appears designed to
rally the centrist forces in the Russian parliament around the president at
a time when the new political parties are in disarray and the banned
Communist party is seeking a come-back under a variety of guises.
The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper concluded yesterday that 'the president
(Mr Yeltsin) is frightened by the decrease in his own popularity and is
taking steps to head off the reform. Next step will be to head off the
government'.
In a harshly realistic survey of the reforms so far, Mr Alexander Shokhin,
the deputy prime minister in charge of social affairs, yesterday said it
would be 'very hard to resolve the dilemma' posed for the budget by a mass
of cuts in its revenue and demands for further payments.
These include an estimated cut in revenues of Rbs25bn-Rbs30bn resulting from
a decrease in the value added tax from 25 to 15 per cent on a range of
foodstuffs, and the abolition of VAT on most canteen meals.
There will also be increased spending of at least Rbs15bn for pensions,
students stipends and other state wages to cover price rises. Mr Shokhin
said that prices had risen by 3.5 times in January, compared with government
forecasts of 2.5 times. The wage needed to sustain a basic standard of
living had risen to Rbs550 a month, but the present minimum pension is
Rbs342.
Ukraine's parliament voted yesterday to create a special debt repayment fund
by taxing the hard currency profits of exporters, Reuter reports from Kiev.
Exporters will pay between 15 and 70 per cent of hard currency profits to
the fund. A further 5 per cent will go to local governments.
Ukraine has offered to take responsibility for 16.37 per cent of the total
former Soviet foreign debt, estimated at Dollars 70bn.

FT  06 FEB 92 / WEU to study defence corps: Germany summons Europe's
military planners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has invited all member states of the Western European Union (WEU)
'seriously interested' in setting up an integrated European defence corps to
attend a brainstorming session in Bonn on February 19 and 20.
The seminar will flesh out the Franco-German plan for such a unit. It will
also explore the possibilities for reconciling the idea with the alternative
Anglo-Italian plan for a European rapid reaction force to operate outside
the Nato area.
The intention is to bring together military planners to give practical
substance to the Franco-German political initiative launched by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand last year. They proposed
building a European corps on the basis of the existing Franco-German
brigade, based in Baden-Wurttemberg, as the military arm of a future common
European defence policy.
It is clear that Bonn and Paris are determined to press ahead with their
plan, in spite of a mixed response.
Spain and Belgium have expressed a serious interest, while Britain and the
Netherlands, in particular, were very sceptical, and the US was studiously
non-committal.
Invitations to the seminar were given last week by General Klaus Naumann,
the inspector-general of the German Bundeswehr, or German armed forces, at a
meeting in Bonn of the chiefs of the defence staffs of the nine WEU nations.
They came together for the first time since the European Community summit in
Maastricht to think through the military implications of the EC treaty on
political union.
The question now is which members of the WEU will attend the seminar, in the
light of Gen Naumann's emphasis that they should be 'seriously interested'
in the European corps idea. Officials in London suggested that some
sceptical states might send 'quite low- level people to take notes.'
The recent meeting of the chiefs of staff discussed three issues arising
directly out of the Maastricht summit:
How and when the chiefs should meet regularly, and what they could
contribute to the WEU process.
How the proposed planning staff at the WEU should be constituted.
What the European leaders actually meant by 'forces answerable to the WEU'.
Gen Naumann said that all participants were unanimous on the question that
any moves to build up a 'European defence identity' must be 'complementary
to and compatible with Nato's efforts.'
However it is precisely that question of what would be complementary to
Nato, and what would merely duplicate Nato efforts, which still divides the
WEU in its efforts to forge a military identity.
The Franco-German plan would duplicate Nato to the extent that the corps
would operate inside the Nato area. Germany argues that its concept would
involve France directly in Nato military operations, and therefore
strengthen the alliance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN employers' attempts to damp pay demands were reinforced yesterday by
official figures which showed a sharp increase in job losses in the west and
a flood of new registrations in east German unemployment offices.
The engineering industry said 20,000 workers had been put out of work last
year because of high labour costs. It warned that 50,000-60,000 further jobs
could go this year as companies attempted to cut costs and transfer work to
low-cost labour markets outside Germany.
Ministers appealed for more investment in eastern industry to create
permanent employment and save jobs threatened by a lack of buyers for former
state-owned businesses.
Slowing economic growth caused unemployment in the west to rise steeply from
5.8 per cent in December to 6.3 per cent last month. The end of special
short-time working subsidies in the east pushed up sharply the proportion in
the former DDR from 11.8 per cent to 16.5 per cent.
There are now more than 3.2m registered unemployed in the country: 1.88m in
the west, and 1.34m in the east. Mr Heinrich Franke, president of the
federal labour office in Nuremberg, said: 'The days of the employment boom
are behind us.'
Mr Dieter Kirchner, director of Gesamtmetall, an association representing
most of the country's engineering, metal-working and electronics companies,
described this year's 9.5 per cent pay claim from the IG Metall union as
'exaggerated'. A poll of members showed 90 per cent had been unable to cover
increased labour costs - resulting from last year's 6.7 per cent award - by
routine rationalisation measures.
As a result, 20,000 jobs had been cut between May and November. For this
year's negotiations, he added: 'It is a question of how ready our members
are to resist wage demands which I can only describe as destructive for
prices and employment.'
Anxiety has grown among employers since last weekend's pay award of 6.35 per
cent in the steel industry, which followed a 6 per cent rise in 1991. Union
officials have seized on this as a 'guideline' for the rest of this year's
settlements. Mr Kirchner claimed that even a 5.7 per cent rise for engineers
was 'unreasonable'. Productivity, expected to rise 2.5 per cent in
engineering this year, should be the guide, he added.
Industry, government, economists and the central Bundesbank have all warned
in recent weeks that excessive pay rises will lead to accelerated job cuts
in the west and hamper recovery in the east.
At present one in six of the east German labour force is out of work.

MR Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, called last night for quick action
to prevent the Yugoslav ceasefire from breaking down, but stressed it was
still not possible to deploy a large international peacekeeping force.
In a report to the Security Council, he recommended instead increasing from
50 to 75 the number of UN military liaison officers sent in last month to
help consolidate the truce.
Earlier in the day Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace
conference on Yugoslavia, arrived in Belgrade on a mission aimed at
hammering out differences over the UN peace initiative and reviving the EC's
role as mediator.
At the same time, about 4,000 people turned out in Belgrade in support of Mr
Milan Babic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in
southern Croatia.
Mr Babic is seen by Serb leaders as the main obstacle to deployment of
10,000 UN peacekeepers in Serb-populated regions of Croatia.
However, at yesterday's low-key rally, as a Belgrade journalist reported,
'most of the crowd were refugees from Croatia. Mr Babic has little support
in war-weary Serbia.'
During his two-day mission Lord Carrington, a former British foreign
secretary, will assess whether the EC conference can be reconvened.
Serbia has called on the UN to take over as political mediator, accusing the
EC of taking sides in the conflict.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Paris plans friendship pact with Yeltsin

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Russia plan to sign a friendship treaty to conclude a two-day
state visit by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
The two governments are also expected to sign a number of co-operation
deals, including an agreement to increase security surrounding the former
Soviet nuclear arsenal.
After a meeting between Mr Yeltsin and French President Francois Mitterrand
yesterday, the first day of the Russian president's visit, a French official
said Mr Yeltsin had made no specific request for a cut in French nuclear
forces, despite earlier reports that he planned to do so.
'The most important element was the great convergence of views on the notion
of defence sufficiency, of minimal deterrence,' the official said.
Following last Friday's meeting of heads of state at the United Nations
Security Council, the French government claims to have secured US agreement
for a special meeting of nuclear powers, to discuss the security of such
weapons in the former Soviet Union.
Paris has not made clear when such a meeting would be held, or whether the
former Soviet Union would be represented by Russia or by the four republics
with nuclear weapons on their territory - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and
Kazakhstan.
France is according Mr Yeltsin high ceremonial honours during his visit.
This is partly to make up for the cool reception Mr Yeltsin received when he
last visited France, in April last year.
AP adds: Russia intends to sell or lease 50 percent of its oil production
and exploration to foreigners, a top foreign ministry official travelling
with Mr Yeltsin announced yesterday.
Mr Vladislav Sorokin, chief of the foreign ministry's economics department,
said that two laws are currently being prepared that would allow foreign
companies to take out large shareholdings in soon-to-be privatized oil
companies, and to obtain 60-year leases on exploration sites.
Royalties paid by the foreign companies will allow Russia to finance a
substantial part of its economic modernization, he said.
Alexander Mariachine, presidnet of the Neftgazstroibank, the Russian
commercial bank charged with privatizing part of the petroleum industry,
said that numerous private companies were being created to take over the
state-run sector.
The privatization process will take three to five years, he said.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Parties unite to play down Ashdown's affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrat MPs yesterday rallied round Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's
leader, after he said he had a brief affair with his former secretary five
years ago.
He also won backing from Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, who both
insisted that the affair should not become an election issue.
Mr Ashdown was forced to make the admission after the theft last month of
personal papers from his solicitors - Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite in the City
of London.
The effect of Mr Ashdown's statement on Liberal Democrats' election fortunes
remains uncertain. At Westminster his greatest strength was seen as
portraying Liberal Democrats as above what he regards as Britain's outdated
and unfair political system.
There have been a number of thefts and break-ins at political offices in
recent months, intensifying fears at Westminster that this year's election
campaign would be the dirtiest on record. All political parties have
suffered burglaries, particularly of computer equipment.
The Conservatives last night catalogued 37 break-ins which had occurred at
25 of their constituency offices over the last three years, including the
telephone bugging of an office in Southampton. Most involved the theft of
computer equipment. Labour last night said it was carrying out a similar
survey of its constituency offices.
There were signs from Downing Street yesterday that the government was
sympathetic to calls for tougher security measures at the Commons.
One senior Liberal Democrat official said the explanation for the spate of
break-ins probably lay 'somewhere between overt conspiracy and coincidence'.
However, Conservative Central Office said there was no reason to suppose the
incidents were anything but common theft.
Lord Holme, a colleague of Mr Ashdown, said on BBC radio he feared a new
form of civil crime might be emerging 'where people see the opportunity for
getting hold of confidential documents and selling them on to the press'.
At a meeting of the parliamentary party last night Mr Ashdown apologised for
any difficulties he might have caused. He received unanimous support from
his colleagues.
At the weekend he had taken out legal injunctions against all the main
national media outlets after Mr Andrew Phillips, his solicitor, heard that
the News of the World had been offered a copy of a note stolen from a safe.
The note was an account of a meeting in May 1990 in which Mr Ashdown told Mr
Phillips about the affair.
Mr Ashdown decided to make his statement after the injunctions were referred
to in a Scottish newspaper. Party officials said he recognised he would have
to make a statement eventually - in spite of his belief that the affair
should remain a private matter.
Within minutes of his statement, Mr Major said: 'These matters are not
relevant to Mr Ashdown's policies or his capabilities. They should not be a
political issue.'
Mr Kinnock said: 'His private life has nothing to do with the political
issues that face the nation.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / Car industry report attacked as 'sell-out'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on new car sales in the UK was
condemned yesterday as a 'sell-out' by the Consumers' Association, and was
greeted mostly with relief by motor manufacturers and dealers.
The 1,000-page report, published yesterday, concludes that consumers,
particularly private motorists, pay more for their cars than they should,
and proposes a range of measures to increase competition.
It also finds there is a complex monopoly involving 24 carmakers and
importers, and a number of restrictions imposed by suppliers on their
dealers which operate against the public interest.
In spite of these findings, the report largely absolves carmakers and
dealers of profiteering and effectively rejects consumer group calls for the
current system of exclusively franchised dealers to be scrapped in favour of
a market 'free-for-all'.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, acknowledged that the MMC had
examples of cars priced 'significantly lower' in some continental European
countries than in the UK.
Nevertheless, 'a comparison of the price ranges in the UK with those in the
markets most similar to the UK - France and Germany - did not indicate
significant differences in general price levels', he said.
Mr Lilley, who has had the report for three months, said that before taking
any decisions he wanted to hear the views of motorists, dealers, importers
and carmakers.
But with the consultation period lasting until April 3, government action is
unlikely before the general election.
Most significantly Mr Lilley said yesterday the government would be
considering whether the UK should remove all restrictions on Japanese
vehicle imports before the end of 1999, the date agreed last year by the
European Commission and the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and
Industry for full liberalisation of the EC new car market.
A voluntary export restraint (VER) or gentleman's agreement, in existence in
the UK since 1975, has effectively limited the share of Japanese imported
cars to about 11 per cent of the UK new car market.
This restraint must be terminated by the end of 1992 under the terms of last
year's EC-Japan accord, but will be replaced by an overall VER for the whole
of the EC.
There will be no limit on Japanese production in Europe, however, and the
share of Japanese makes in the UK is widely expected to more than double
during the decade.
The MMC report says that on competition grounds alone the restraint should
be removed as soon as possible.
The Consumers' Association claimed UK motorists would still be paying up to
Pounds 3,000 more than they should for a new car, in spite of the report's
conclusion that there was a complex monopoly.
'It still hammers motorists,' said Dr John Beishon, the CA's director,
adding that 'the only people to gain from it are car manufacturers, dealers
and company car buyers'.
However, the Retail Motor Industry Federation said the report demonstrated
that the motor trade was 'the most price-competitive area of consumer goods
retailing in the UK economy'.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Brittan aims to have Rover 'sweeteners' case reopened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, plans to reopen the
case against the UK government over 'sweeteners' paid to British Aerospace
when it bought Rover, the UK car manufacturer, in 1988.
On Tuesday, the European Commission suffered a legal setback when the
European Court of Justice threw out on procedural grounds Brussels' order
forcing repayment of Pounds 44.4m of sweeteners.
BAe and Rover had appealed against the Commission's decision.
But Sir Leon said yesterday he had considered the ruling and had decided not
to let the UK government off the hook.
He said: 'It is clear that the judgment relates wholly to procedural matters
and does not touch the merits of the actual decision. I shall therefore be
recommending the Commission to reopen the case by commencing formal
proceedings.'
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'After years
of deception and evasion, it is now time for a speedy resolution to this
long-running and regrettable saga.'
Sir Leon could start a full state aid investigation, if his fellow
commissioners agree.
Should the Commission then conclude that the subsidy to BAe was illegal, it
could again try to force BAe to repay the Pounds 44.4m. Alternatively, the
Commission could complain to the court that Britain did not respect
conditions laid down by Brussels for the Rover sale.
The government deferred payment of the Pounds 150m initial purchase price
beyond the original August 1988 deadline agreed with Brussels.
Most of the Pounds 44.4m relates to the interest benefits BAe may have
received due to the deferral.
Tuesday's ruling said the Commission should have come direct to the court in
1990 or opened a new state aid investigation. Instead, the Commission's
sweeteners inquiry was based on the earlier 1988 decision on the BAe-Rover
deal, under which the UK government had to cut its subsidy to BAe from
Pounds 800m to Pounds 469m.
Brussels yesterday extended Sir Leon's mandate to control EC merger policy
until the end of the year, ending any possibility of a challenge by other
commissioners who wanted more influence over merger decisions.
Sir Leon will continue to handle internal decisions on EC merger inquiries
jointly with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president.
Sir Leon - whose mandate under the EC merger regulation comes up for review
annually - accepted an increased obligation to keep his fellow commissioners
informed about the progress of investigations.
If he opts to open a new state aid investigation, then the UK government and
other interested parties will again be given one to two months to provide
evidence to the Commission.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Five die in Belfast shooting: Wave of sectarian killings
leads to unionist calls for internment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on ministers to take decisive action over the handling of Northern
Ireland intensified last night after the killing of five Catholics in a
Belfast betting shop.
The attack was described as 'murder madness' by Sir Hugh Annesley, chief
constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The prime minister called it a
horrific attack which would be repudiated throughout the UK.
Loyalist paramilitaries burst into the betting shop in Ormeau Road, south
Belfast and fired indiscriminately. Almost every person in the crowded shop
was hit. Five men were killed and at least 12 others were taken to hospital.
Last night the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, the illegal military wing
of the Ulster Defence Association, claimed responsibility.
The killings brought to 26 the number of deaths so far this year through
terrorist violence in Northern Ireland - a rate reminiscent of the worst
years in the 1970s. All of those killed have been civilians. The number of
civilian deaths last year was 94.
The wave of sectarian killings has intensified pressure on the government to
increase still further the efforts of UK security forces in the province.
Sir Hugh insisted that the situation was under control, saying security
forces were stopping 85 per cent of terrorist attacks before they happened.
The suspension last month by the government of its efforts to start
'round-table' talks on the province's future has added to the atmosphere of
gloom and drift.
Unionists are demanding internment of both loyalist and republican terrorist
suspects - a measure not ruled out definitively by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern
Ireland secretary, but one that would bring bitter criticism from the Irish
government.
Mr Brooke will make a statement to the Commons today. Last night he said:
'It is critically important at a time like this for the community to keep
its nerve.'
Yesterday's killings came 24 hours after a policeman shot dead three men at
the advice centre of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in Belfast. He
later committed suicide.
Three weeks ago, eight Protestant civilians working for the security forces
were killed in an IRA attack at Teebane Cross, County Tyrone.
The UFF's statement claiming responsibility for yesterday's attack was
headed 'Remember Teebane'.
Earlier, an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier shot dead a gunman who attacked
him near Northern Ireland's border with the Irish republic.
The part-time soldier, who was off-duty at the time, was wounded in the
incident.
Archbishop Robin Eames, head of the Church of Ireland, said that the
province was now witnessing 'unbridled madness'. He went on to say: 'If the
killing does not stop, everyone will be sucked into the morass of violence.'
At Westminster, however, the demands of nationalist and Unionist MPs for a
government statement were tempered by a realisation that there was little
prospect of the government offering more than a renewed determination to
defeat terrorism and offer sympathy for the victims.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist party's security spokesman, asked how
many more people had to die before internment was reintroduced - regarded by
many Unionist MPs as the only alternative which is left to the government.

FT  06 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities slip lower in nervous
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNCERTAINTIES currently overhanging the London stock market increased
yesterday and UK equities refused to respond to the strong rise on Wall
Street overnight. An erratic session saw the FT-SE Index move through a
range of more than 20 points to lose the 2,550 mark in late trading.
Once again, trading volume was extremely thin and the trend in the Footsie
often reflected sharp movements in a handful of leading stocks.
The session opened nervously after rumours of impending political
developments were followed by a personal statement from Mr Paddy Ashdown,
leader of the UK Liberal Democrats. An early gain of 12.3 on the Footsie
quickly evaporated as the March futures contract made a poor start and by
mid-session the Index was testing the 2,550 level.
The market then rallied but turned back again when Wall Street made an
uncertain start to the new trading session, although it showed a further
gain of 10 Dow points when London ceased trading.
The FT-SE Index closed at 2,547.1 for a net loss on the day of 9.7 points.
London now shows a historically high differential of more than 700 points
against Wall Street, raising the question of whether the UK market can
decouple itself from New York.
London remained very cautious towards Wall Street yesterday, turning down
smartly when the Dow moved briefly into negative territory in early trading.
But the outstanding feature of the market was the low level of business in
equities. The Seaq system recorded volume of 491.8m shares compared with
468.8m on Tuesday. Customer, or retail, volume remained weak on Tuesday at
Pounds 811.2m, extending the run of poor retail business of the past week.
With sterling testing the lower end of its ERM range during the day, the
blue chip stocks lacked an overall trend and it was left to specific factors
to provide the direction of share prices. Weakness in the US dollar
discouraged the overseas earning stocks which often record the bulk of sales
in the US currency. At the same time, the persistent worry over inflationary
pressures in Germany unsettled the London market.
Oil shares were generally easier, led by British Petroleum which reacted to
reports in the UK press of boardroom tensions regarding dividend policy,
although the company, which announces profits next Thursday, rejected the
reports yesterday.
ICI, Britain's premier chemical company, improved very modestly after
announcing the disposal of its salt interests in the UK. Pharmaceutical
stocks held steady, with the exception of Wellcome which fell sharply.
'There are so many uncertainties around now that most fund managers have
decided not to bother for the time being,' said the strategist at a leading
international house yesterday. The statement from Mr Ashdown was seen as
introducing a fresh element ahead of the UK general election which is
expected in early-April.
While another half point reduction in domestic base rates is widely expected
ahead of the election, stock market traders are now resigned to having to
wait for this move until Mr Major makes his formal announcement of the date
for the general election.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edward Walker-Arnott, 52, head of the company and commercial department of
City solicitors Herbert Smith is to become the firm's senior partner in May
next year in succession to John Rowson. He will share responsibilities with
Rowson from May this year.
Walker-Arnott was prominent in a number of the major takeovers in the 1980s
mergers and acquisitions boom and together with Richard Fleck was
responsible for the representation of the Al Fayed brothers in their
celebrated takeover of the House of Fraser stores group.
His whole career has been with Herbert Smith; he became a partner at the
early age of 28. From 1977 to 1982 he was a member of the Insolvency Law
Committee chaired by the late Sir Kenneth Cork. He sat on the Council of
Lloyds from 1983 to 1989 and is a non-executive director of Sturge Holdings,
a Lloyds agency business.
Herbert Smith, which prides itself on its hard-nosed attitude to commercial
litigation, is the UK's seventh largest law firm.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As senior appointments in Japanese companies tend to go, Kobe Steel Europe's
new director and chief financial officer is highly unusual in that he is
neither old nor is he Japanese.
Reg Clark, 33, joined Kobe from Oxford with a degree in modern history and
no particular connection with Japan. 'It was regarded as a very bizarre
option at the time (the late 1970s).'
After a 'very tough' three years in Japan on the international side of the
heavy machinery operations, he decided that Kobe could not teach him what he
wanted to know about finance, and that anyway he wanted a career in the
Euromarkets.
So he returned to the UK, to work in turn for Yamaichi International, Swiss
Bank Corporation and J P Morgan.
'Once Kobe understood I had no plans to rejoin, they were very friendly,'
even putting some of their Eurobond business his way. But unspec-ified
'family circumstances' dictated that he left the punishingly long hours of
the City in 1988, at which point he took up with Kobe again.
Speaking Japanese 'well enough to get by but not remotely fluently', he
professes he is surprised he has got as far as he has; he is probably the
most senior foreigner at Kobe. Now he has to help make a go of Europe - with
expansion so far largely frustrated as a series of acquisitions have fallen
through at the eleventh hour.

FT  06 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Burst of activity in BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRIS PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent suggestions in the stock market that a split had opened up in the BP
boardroom over the group's dividend policy burst into the open yesterday,
triggering a sharp decline in BP shares. BP moved quickly to deny the
stories emphatically.
At their worst yesterday, BP shares had fallen to 276p, but they later
steadied to close a net 5 1/2 off at 278 1/2 p. Turnover in BP reached 10m,
around double the usual level of activity in the stock.
BP is scheduled to report preliminary results next Thursday. There have been
worries in the City for many months that a maintained dividend in real terms
would not be covered by earnings.
Stories yesterday highlighted the steep decline in the BP share price since
last November which has seen the stock decline by some 16 per cent. Analysts
expect BP to increase the fourth quarter dividend, with most plumping for
4.3p but some expecting 4.4p, compared with last time's 4.2p.
One leading oil analyst described the boardroom rift stories as 'pure
mischief' adding: 'Obviously there has been a serious debate about the
dividend at BP, but then there should always be a serious debate about the
level of dividends.' He said the chances of BP cutting its dividend were
'zero'. Another specialist said the press revelations 'illustrate the level
of concern surrounding the dividend policy and indicate that the group is in
a corner and may need more cost cutting and asset sales.'
Reuters deal
Late selling in Reuters Holdings, yesterday, applied the brakes to the rapid
rise the company's shares have seen over the past few months.
Reuters shares had been holding up strongly at around the 1125 level against
a weak London market for most of the day. However, shortly before the close
of trading one UK investment bank took on a line of 1.1m shares at 1085p and
sought to place them at at 1095p, some 20p below the market price. The
effect of offering such a massive line of stock - worth around Pounds 12m
and equivalent to the normal turnover for a whole day - was that the shares
tumbled sharply to close 28 off on the day at 1098p. Later, the Seaq
electronic network showed an unusually heavy turnover of 3.1m, indicating
that the shares had been successfully placed.
The move is the first significant check to a rise which began in
mid-November, when the shares stood at 860p. The rise was given further
momentum recently from optimism over the company's new trading system
Dealing 2000-2. The shares have also been strong ahead of the company's
full-year results, to be announced next Wednesday.
Properties reel
Leading property shares reeled as the market took fright at news of the
depth of the fall in office values, reported yesterday. This suggested that
the fall in the City was an unexpectedly large 32.5 per cent and would lead
to revisions in net asset valuations by at least one leading securities
house. There was also a degree of profit-taking after some strong buying by
one house on Tuesday.
Busy turnover of 2.5m in MEPC left it 10 off at 370p, Land Securities fell
11 to 462p, Hammerson 'A' slipped 12 to 472p, while British Land was off 14
at 253p.
Motor distributors were lifted by a favourable Monopolies and Mergers
Commission report on the car retail trade. Investment enthusiasm was
encouraged by a positive note to institutions by Albert E. Sharpe, the
Birmingham-based broker which prophesied 'far-reaching changes in motor
retailing.' Among Sharpe's recommendations, Pendragon jumped 19 to 193p and
Evans Halshaw firmed 6 to 275p. Lex Service added 3 to 220p while Dagenham
Motor jumped 3 to 118p.
A recommendation in the same report that the voluntary 11 per cent ceiling
placed on the import of Japanese cars be lifted drove Inchcape, the sole
importer of Toyota vehicles into the UK, sharply forward. The shares jumped
12 to 432p.
EC commissioner Mr Leon Brittan's proposal for a new inquiry over the Pounds
44.4m British Aerospace 'sweeteners' row, left it off 4 at 286p.
Nervous trading in British Airways ahead of KLM's results today saw the
share dip 6 to 234p. An announcement on talks about a merger between the two
airlines is expected later today.
Siebe bounced 7 to 562p after Kleinwort Benson recommended the stock.
The bear story on BP upset the other oil stocks with Shell 2 easier at 474p
on keen turnover of 4.7m. Lasmo came under pressure with a couple of
institutional sellers said to have been responsible for lowering the share
price 7 to 238p.
Burmah Castrol dropped 12 to 499p, responding to suggestions in the market
that the group had sold its abrasives and diamond products division for a
disappointing price.
Among brewers, Allied Lyons and Grand Metropolitan remained particularly
weak, reflecting fears of a squeeze on profits. Both companies have been hit
by profit downgrades from brokers.
Allied fell 10 to 620p as County NatWest followed the recent reassessment by
Warburg Securities of the likely profit figures for the next two years.
County expects Allied to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 635m this year,
against a previous estimate of Pounds 662m, and Pounds 730m in 1993 compared
with an earlier forecast of Pounds 760m.
Grand Metropolitan lost 14 to 912p after UBS Phillips and Drew cut its
profits forecast for the company by Pounds 25m to Pounds 1.06bn for the year
ending September 1992 and by Pounds 30m to Pounds 1.19bn for the following
year. Pension fund surpluses, which have been a major source of profit
growth over the last three years, are likely to be static in 1992, according
to the broker.
A Warburg Securities buy recommendation, the first document issued by
Warburg on BT since its involvement as global co-ordinator to the flotation
of part of the government's remaining stake in the telecoms, helped sustain
both classes of BT stock. The 'new' improved 1 3/4 to 122 1/2 p on 12m
traded, making the stock the second heaviest traded in the market yesterday,
while the 'old' held at 331p on turnover of 4.7m.
Racal Electronics initially edged up to 52p before coming back to close a
fraction easier on the session at 50p with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to have
carried out the lion's share of trading yesterday, when 9.6m traded, and on
Tuesday when turnover topped 31m.
Analysts attending Forte's day of presentations to the City quoted the hotel
group as saying that January occupancy figures were up on the same month
last year although no details were forthcoming. A speech last night by chief
executive Mr Rocco Forte was expected to flesh out the group's current
performance.
The market is waiting to see if the shares will stay above 226p since it is
at this level at which a warrant is exercisable on 10 March. If the price
falls below that level, the bonds will have to be redeemed by Forte at a
cost of around Pounds 93m. The shares eased a penny yesterday to 224p.
SmithKline Beecham was up 20 in early dealing on hopes for its prostate
drug. The enthusiasm followed approval by a US Food and Drug Administration
committee of US company Merck's Proscar drug for non-cancerous prostate
disease. However, a number of analysts pointed out that it would be at least
three years before SmithKline's drug was on the market and the shares eased
later to close 13 better at 968p.
Another company to benefit from the strength in Merck was Glaxo, gaining 10
to 847p.
Medeva lifted 10 to 283p, ahead of a presentation by Mr Bernard Taylor, the
chairman, at the company's US joint broker Merrill Lynch today.
Profit-taking was said to have prompted Wellcome to tumble 32 to 1126p.

FT  06 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by the March stock index futures contract to break through the
2,600 barrier petered out yesterday after Wall Street's failure to extend
Tuesday's record run, writes Joel Kibazo.
March opened strongly, on the back of the firm performance on Wall Street
and soon gained a premium of 35 to the underlying cash market. However,
2,596 proved a resistance level and the contract drifted lower, pulling the
underlying cash market with it.
The poor opening on Wall Street served to bring out more profit-taking in
March with sizeable selling just before the official market close. March
closed at 2,567, down 16 on the previous session but some 7 ahead of its
estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Turnover reached 5,730
contracts.
In LTOM, dealers reported one of the dullest sessions in recent days as
turnover reached a meagre 18,099 contracts, well short of the 30,000
break-even level. The FT-SE 100 Index traded 6,337 contracts.
Dixons and BP each traded 1,217 lots. The June 240 puts were particularly
busy in Dixons while, in BP, the April 280 options were busy in the calls
and puts. BTR, Forte and Ladbrokes were also active.

JOHANNESBURG gained some ground in thin afternoon trading after a listless
morning session. The late rally mainly reflected a renewed weakening in the
financial rand after Tuesday's modest recovery.
The all-gold index ended 10 higher at 1,270, while the industrial index
crept up 29 to 4,436. The overall share index closed slightly higher at
3616, up 22.
In the gold sector, Vaal Reefs rose R3 to R225 and Driefontein 50 cents to
R42 despite slightly lower world gold prices. In diamonds, De Beers rose 50
cents to R93.50.

FT  06 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on selling
by investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE-RELATED activity dominated trading yesterday, and share prices
posted marginal losses after fluctuating in low volume, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 63.23 at 21,936.37, failing to remain above
the 22,000 level which it had recovered in the morning session. After
hitting the day's low of 21,844.67, the index regained strength from a rise
in the futures market. The 225-issue average advanced to the day's high of
22,135.58 in early afternoon trading, but later fell on selling by
investment trusts.
Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 180m. Advances led declines by 484
to 451, with 179 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell
2.81 to 1,626.05 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.13 to
1,249.18.
Despite the lack of investor activity, traders said that sentiment had not
soured. Fears that the Nikkei would plunge below 20,000, previously dominant
among market participants, have subsided. 'We've cleared the danger level
and there is a feeling of stability,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel.
Buying orders around the 21,900 level from foreign investors and life
assurers also supported the optimism. Light foreign buying in companies with
firm earnings was also noted.
QP, the leading mayonnaise maker, rose Y70 to Y1,330 on prospects of higher
earnings due to a fall in egg prices. Other food stocks were also firm with
Kikkoman, the soy sauce maker, up Y30 to Y1,060 and Ajinomoto Y10 better at
Y1,380.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical rose Y90 to Y1,690 on reports that a drug developed
by the company was found to be effective against leprosy.
Nissan Fire and Marine Insurance fell Y100 to Y1,980. Rumours that a leading
speculator who held Nissan shares was in financial trouble spurred the
selling.
Investors looking for quick profits sought highly-priced, small-capital
stocks with low liquidity. Nippon Television Network rose Y300 to Y20,400
and Sega Enterprises added Y300 to Y14,000.
Coca-Cola bottling companies firmed on prospects of higher earnings due to a
planned increase in beverage prices. Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling rose Y60 to
Y2,630 and Chukyo Coca-Cola Bottling gained Y30 to Y1,700.
Paper issues lost ground on earnings concerns. Jujo Paper fell Y35 to Y600
on reports that an affiliated paper company would post sharp falls in
profits for the current year to March. Oji Paper declined Y15 to Y850 and
Kanzaki Paper lost Y12 to Y650.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 33.12 to 23,589.47. Volume surged to 124.9m
shares from 84.5m on cross trading before the March book closing.
After the close, the Osaka Stock Exchange announced measures to dilute the
impact of Nikkei-225 stock futures and options trading on stock prices in an
attempt to support the stock market, agencies report.
An exchange official said that the move reflects the exchange's concern
about the continued thinness of the stock market, in which volatility caused
by futures- and options-linked trading has scared off investors.
Effective today, the exchange will close futures and options trading 10
minutes earlier at 0600 GMT, the same time as stock trading. The decision is
in response to criticism that speculative futures trading after the stock
market closes often affects prices on the following day.
Other measures:
Trading details of the 20 most active exchange members in both instruments
will be disclosed on a daily basis, and the open interest held by the top 15
members disclosed on a weekly basis.
Options exercises will be limited to once a month on expiration day, instead
of the current once a week on Thursdays, starting with the June contract.
The exercise price for options on expiration day will be the special
quotation price, calculated from the opening price of all 225 issues in the
Nikkei average on the following day, starting with the June contract.
Roundup
AUSTRALIA continued to be nervous ahead of the economic statement due on
February 26. Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Taiwan remained
closed.
AUSTRALIA rose strongly on Wall Street before falling back. The
All-Ordinaries index put on 2.7 to 1,602.9 in turnover of ADollars 302.7m.
ACI, which announced half-year results, was the most active stock, trading
37.3m shares. It was unchanged at 20 cents. CSR fell 6 cents to ADollars
4.76 on reporting that an asset writedown would lead to ADollars 558m net
extraordinary loss this year.
BHP gained 4 cents to ADollars 3.52, News Corp rose 18 cents to ADollars
14.58, Brambles by 10 cents to ADollars 17.46 and Lend Lease by 22 cents to
ADollars 16.22. The bank sector was mixed: National Australia rose 2 cents
to ADollars 7.48 and ANZ by 1 cent to ADollars 4.12, but Commonwealth shed 4
cents to ADollars 7.12.
NEW ZEALAND rose in good volume. The NZSE-40 index gained 7.29 to 1,461.54
in turnover of NZDollars 30m. Air New Zealand put on 7 cents to NZDollars
1.63 and Fisher and Paykel, the white goods manufacturer, rose 6 cents to
NZDollars 2.28.
Brierley Investments gained 2 cents to NZDollars 1.05, Fletcher Challenge 3
cents to NZDollars 3.48, and Carter Holt Harvey 2 cents to NZDollars 2.35.
JAKARTA closed higher in active trade, pushing the index 2.41 up to 288.46.

Turnover fell to 8.16m shares from 14.2m. Bank International Indonesia rose
Rp250 to Rp3,750, with 574,500 shares traded.
MANILA eased, dampened by fears that two bomb explosions in the capital
might herald violence in the May elections. The composite index fell 15.07
to 1,246.87. Turnover rose to 255m pesos (155m pesos).
BOMBAY ended mixed. The BSE index rose 9.71 to 1,057.28, on news that a
Rp2bn fund was being set up to help workers affected by company closures.

FT  06 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): New York's overnight rise
encourages the continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL bourses were encouraged by Wall Street's record close overnight,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT majored on carmakers and retailers, but kept its interest in
special situations. The DAX index closed 10.22 better at 1,686.62 after a
rise of 3.43 to 687.16 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM5bn to
DM7bn.
There was a transatlantic influence, too, in the car sector where improved
US January car sales figures left BMW DM8 higher DM547, and Volkswagen up
DM7.50 at DM342.50. The fact that a steel strike in Germany had been averted
continued to lift sentiment.
The inflationary aspect of the steel pay settlement was reflected in
retailers where Douglas rose DM24 to DM657, Karstadt by DM13 to DM626 and
Kaufhof DM12 to DM478. Dealers said that the 6.4 per cent rise for
steelworkers was expected to result in significant rises in real income in
other sectors. Asko, which raised its stake in fellow retailer Ava to a
majority, put on DM25 to DM700, taking its gains to 10 per cent in just over
a week.
Lufthansa took its fall to over 10 per cent in two days, dropping another
DM9.70 to DM162.80 after confirming this week that it would report a 1991
loss of around DM400m, its first deficit since 1973.
The tyremaker Continental said it had no explanation for the recent strength
in its shares, up another DM5 to DM235.50 yesterday.
PARIS continued to focus on individual stocks. The CAC-40 index ended 9.31
higher at 1,865.79, helped by recoveries in Elf and Eurotunnel, after
trading in a 15-point range. Volume rose to FFr2.1bn from FFr1.8bn.
Shares in Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging company, went in opposite
directions. Pechiney International rose FFr5.30 to FFr174 with 141,700
shares traded on rumours that it would sell its aluminium activities back to
its parent and, therefore, become a purer packaging play. Pechiney CIs fell
FFr13 or 4.1 per cent to FFr300 with 41,450 units traded.
Another active share was Michelin which rose FFr4.80 or 3.2 per cent to
FFr157 with 309,250 shares traded; but dealers could find few reasons for
the move.
Casino, the supermarkets group, rose FFr6.50 to FFr148.50 with 215,000
shares traded on better-than-expected 1991 results. Casino announced a 35.5
per cent rise to FFr530.0m in net attributable profit, beating the market
consensus of a 20 per cent rise.
MILAN held on to early gains. The Comit index rose 5.46 to 550.71 in
turnover estimated at more than L106bn.
The government's approval of Fiat's plan to put about 5,000 workers into an
early-retirement programme boosted the shares by L96 or 1.9 per cent to
L5,133.
In the financial sector, Ambroveneto surged L172 or 4 per cent to L4,385 on
speculation that a French bank was poised to raise its shareholding in the
Italian bank.
Olivetti continued to gain, adding L34 to L2,847 on persistent merger
speculation and in spite of comments by the chairman, Mr Carlo De Benedetti,
that the company was likely to break even or make a slight profit this year
after a bigger-than-expected net loss of L380bn last year.
The insurance sector outperformed the general index, ending up 1.2 per cent,
as Generali closed up L350 at L30,900.
AMSTERDAM slipped back after rising moderately in early trading. The CBS
Tendency Index was down 0.3 to 122.4. Elsevier fell on profit taking. It
closed Fl 2.2 or 2 per cent lower at Fl 106.20.
Philips, taking a 25 per cent stake in a US communications company for
Dollars 175m, drifted back Fl 0.20 to Fl 30.60. Heineken hit an all-time
high boosted by bid rumours, gaining Fl 1.80 to Fl 173.30; but KLM, which is
due to report its third quarter results today, fell Fl 1.50 to Fl 41.50.
STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trade in turnover of SKr420m after SKr587m as
the Affarsvarlden General index closed 8.7 higher at 978.3.
Relief at Tuesday's Electrolux decision to hold its dividend was reinforced
by Wall Street and improved Swedish car sales figures. Electrolux B rose
another SKr13 to SKr260 and Volvo B by SKr7 to SKr385. Ericsson B gained
SKr3 to SKr122 ahead of its results next Tuesday.
By sectors, forestry registered the session's biggest gain, up 2.1 per cent.
Dealers said that the improvement stemmed from reports of higher pulp prices
in coming months.
OSLO edged higher, the all-share index up 1.99 to 442.47 in turnover of
Nkr237.4m (NKr207.18m). Hafslund, the healthcare group, was active,
accounting for 20 per cent of turnover: its A shares fell Nkr0.5 to NKr268.
ISTANBUL plunged 4.2 per cent on heavy selling. The index fell 193.06 to
4,374.04, the lowest since January 3, in turnover of TL348.8bn, up from
TL285.5bn.

FT  06 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok Land's debut confounds sceptics
 -Its success coincides with record trading volume on the exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The holiday atmosphere of the Chinese New Year was not enough to prevent
Thailand's determined punters from crowding into stockbrokers' offices as
usual yesterday to bet on a market which has seen record trading volumes in
the past few weeks.
Yesterday's main attraction was the newly-listed property shares of Bangkok
Land, which immediately became the largest company on the exchange by
capitalisation and accounted for around one-third of the day's turnover.
Investors crowded around the brokers' price screens, gasping and biting
their lips as the shares, priced at Bt90 each at the initial public offering
four months ago, opened at Bt150 (Dollars 6), jumped to Bt161 and then
settled back to close at Bt154, valuing the company at Bt92.4bn (more than
Dollars 3.6bn).
It was otherwise an unremarkable day, and the SET index closed down 6.31 at
763.41. But the market has been humming with activity since the end of last
year, a trend best illustrated by the change in sentiment about Bangkok
Land; four months ago, at Bt90, the underwriters had trouble selling the 60m
shares on offer (10 per cent of the equity), a problem which is now earning
them handsome profits as they unload the stock. 'Three months ago everyone
hated the stock because conditions were all wrong for it,' said one broker
yesterday.
The revival of the Thai stock exchange was led by the banks. They had been
shunned by many investors because of their repeated forays into the market
to raise capital as their business expanded. But a decision by the Thai
authorities to apply Bank of International Settlements regulations on
capital ratios in the near future is expected to allow them to include
property as part of their second-tier capital, and so slow down the dilution
of their earnings per share. At the same time, local investors have been
encouraged by rumours of 10-for-one share splits, which would make the
expensive counters much more liquid for the country's numerous small-time
speculators.
The banks were followed upwards by the volatile financial and securities
stocks; they benefit from increased market activity and provide a leveraged
bet on the market as a whole. Lower interest rates and better-than-expected
company results also contributed to a rise in the SET index, which was
languishing below 700 until December. 'Often in Thailand it goes sector by
sector,' said one broker yesterday. 'There is still potential in other
sectors.'
Volume has been boosted since last year by the computerisation of trading on
the exchange, by the increasing input from provincial brokers and
speculators, and by renewed foreign interest in January. The exchange is
expected to lengthen the trading time to four hours from three later this
year by introducing an afternoon session. At present the exchange is open
between 9 am and midday.
Interest in the market is likely to be maintained by the privatisation and
flotation of Thai Airways in the next few months, although foreign brokers
say they cannot understand why the government is suggesting a price which
would give the company a price/earnings ratio of nearly 13, higher than
rival regional airlines which are regarded as better quality investments.
In the meantime there are suggestions that the rally of the last few weeks
may already have run out of steam with the approach of the March elections
and the political uncertainty that they imply.

OVERNIGHT rates in the UK fell as low as 7 1/2 per cent yesterday, as the
Bank of England removed any doubts over its attitude to liquidity through
early and decisive action.
'Someone must have got wind that a lot more paper would be offered,' said
one senior dealer describing the southward movement of overnight rates after
the bank's first injection of Pounds 600m. There were 'several million'
pounds worth of trades at the 7.5 per cent level, he added. Overnight rates
bounced back to finish at 10 3/4 - 5/8.
Initially, the Bank forecast a Pounds 1bn shortage, which was then revised
to Pounds 1.1bn. The main reasons for the shortage were treasury bills and
maturing assistance, which took Pounds 676m out of the market, bills for
repurchase, accounting for Pounds 334m, and a rise in note circulation which
drained Pounds 60m. Bankers' balances were Pounds 10m below target.
Exchequer transactions injected Pounds 95m.
In early operations, the Bank bought bills totalling Pounds 600m for resale
on February 21 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. A subsequent
purchase of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent came to Pounds 392m. By
the afternoon, full liquidity was returned to the market with a bill
purchase totalling Pounds 110m at a rate of 10 3/8 per cent and late
assistance of Pounds 20m. Traders did not expect the bank to be as generous
tomorrow, however.
The key three-month interbank rate, which is a good indicator for sentiment
on UK interest rates, opened unchanged at 10- 9/16 per cent. During the day
they rose to close at 10 19/32 Pounds  17/32 .
March short sterling started the day one basis point up at 89.61, to finish
at 89.66.
In Germany, the Bundes-bank squeezed liquidity by withdrawing DM1.4bn in
this week's round of securities repurchase agreements, although it did not
force rates higher as many had feared. The repos were conducted at 9.4 per
cent.
The call money trading band widened slightly to 9.60/70 per cent, close to
the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. On Tuesday, rates had been
predominantly quoted at 9.65/70 per cent.
The Bundesbank is known to be unhappy with the 6.4 per cent wage rise agreed
by steel workers earlier in the week.
In the US, traders did not expect the Federal Reserve to operate in the
market. However, federal funds softened to 3 7/8 per cent, below the
presumed target of 4 per cent.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar declines amid rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world economic situation appeared to be conspiring against the dollar as
it continued its drift downwards yesterday, helped by fears over a US rate
cut and pessimism over German inflation, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The US currency came under pressure around the globe, opening lower in New
York, London and Tokyo. At the fix in Frankfurt the dollar stood at
DM1.5881, compared with Tuesday's DM1.5988.
The markets were becoming increasingly nervous ahead of tomorrow's jobs
data, which is expected to show anything from a rise in non-farm payrolls of
120,000 to a fall of 100,000.
That, together with the likelihood that Germany would retain its more
attractive rates for some time to come, encouraged dollar for D-Mark trade.
The attraction of Germany was enhanced by strong comments from Bundesbank
member Mr Lothar Mueller, that there was no prospect of a rate cut in
Germany for some time.
The bears on the dollar were restrained, however, by support at the DM1.58
level. The jobs data could make or break that support.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5880, down from the previous close of
DM1.5920. In New York, the US currency opened lower at DM1.5835/40 and
Y125.72/77, compared with a close of DM1.5925/35 and Y126.15/25
respectively.
Sterling enjoyed a brief flutter of excitement as rumours of a political
scandal involving a senior UK politician depressed the currency.
At one point, sterling was trading at DM2.8640 as dealers worked themselves
in a lather over a possible Tory scandal before the general election.
However, sterling made a strong recovery when it was revealed that the
politician involved was Liberal Democrat leader Mr Paddy Ashdown.
The UK currency jumped 100 basis points to DM2.8740 on the news. Sterling
finished the day at DM2.87, compared with a previous close of DM2.8675.
Against the dollar, sterling finished at Dollars 1.8075, compared with
Tuesday's Dollars 1.8005.
The Canadian dollar recovered some of the ground it has lost recently.
Intervention from the Bank of Canada and the weaker US dollar were believed
to be behind its recovery.
Both the Canadian and Australian currencies have been suffering as domestic
interest rates decline and economic troubles widen. Dr Mark Austin, an
economist with HongKong bank, said he expected to see further declines in
both currencies.
The D-Mark maintained its lead within the European Monetary System, on a
generally quiet day. Sterling remained at the bottom of the grid, 44 per
cent below its allowed divergence from the central rate.
The Bank of Portugal intervened twice yesterday to re-strain the upward
flight of the escudo.
Dealers said the bank wants to stabilise the currency in advance of
Portugal's expected ERM membership later this year or early in the next.

falls by 16%

<TEXT>
GERMAN AGRICULTURE suffered a 16 per cent drop in income in 1990-91 and most
full-time farmers face the prospect of no improvement in the current year,
according to the government's latest annual agricultural report.
However, a recovery in both output and prices for cereals, rapeseed,
potatoes and wine should mean an overall improvement in farm incomes of
between 5 and 10 per cent, to claw back some of the losses, Mr Ignaz
Kiechle, the agriculture minister, said yesterday.
In spite of all the European Community rules, agricultural incomes in
Germany are still determined primarily by market forces, he said. Pigmeat
prices were good, because there was no over-supply, whereas beef prices were
falling because surpluses were piling up in the warehouses. The only way to
ensure a lasting improvement in farm incomes was to bring order to the
markets, he said.
The other black spot for German agriculture was the virtual collapse of
production and employment in the former East Germany, although reliable
output statistics have yet to be produced. As far as farm jobs in the east
were concerned, only 300,000 out of a former workforce of 850,000 still had
jobs on the land at the end of 1991, and 158,000 of those were on
short-time: most of the latter are likely to be declared unemployed in the
coming months.
The relatively cautious pessimism of the annual report, and its forecasts
for the present year, were immediately condemned by the German
Bauernverband, the farmers' union, as over-optimistic. The economic
situation in many agricultural enterprises in the former East Germany, in
particular, it described as 'catastrophic'.
The union estimated the drop in incomes at 21 per cent, and forecast that
incomes for the animal feed-based sectors - including dairy, fatstock, and
sheepmeat - were more likely to fall this year than rise.
Mr Kiechle said in his report that the number of agricultural enterprises in
Germany fell by 5.5 per cent in 1991, to about 595,000, compared with a
four-year average since 1987 of 3.4 per cent per year. Full-time farms now
account for slightly less than half of all enterprises, and German
agriculture remains dominated by small units, even where they are full-time
operations. The average size of full-time farms was 31.4 hectares, and of
part-time operations 19.1 hectares.
The minister avoided any comment on the current Uruguay round of
negotiations in the Genral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, over which he has
been fighting a rearguard action to ensure open-ended income support for
German farmers, in place of price subsidies. The German government remains
split between Mr Kiechle and Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the Economics Minister,
who is pushing for greater concessions on agriculture to ensure a successful
outcome to the negotiations.
Mr Kiechle has managed to protect his farmers this year, by negotiating
additional income support measures to replace the 3 per cent VAT rebate (an
exclusively German national measure), which expired at the end of 1991.

Nevada gold mine

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN BARRICK is to build a new underground gold mine, with output of
400,000 ounces a year, adjacent to its Goldstrike property in Nevada.
The fast-growing, Toronto-based company said yesterday it expected the new
Meikle mine to be in full production by 1996. Thanks to the infrastructure
already in place at Goldstrike the capital cost of building the mine will be
a relatively modest USDollars 180m.
American Barrick also yesterday announced another year of record profits in
1991, thanks to rising production from Goldstrike and its active hedging
programme. Last year's net earnings were USDollars 92.4m, or 68 cents a
share, up from Dollars 58.2m, or 45 cents a share, in 1990. Revenues surged
to Dollars 344.7m from Dollars 251.6m.
Hedging enabled Barrick to obtain an average price of Dollars 438 a troy
ounce last year, compared with the Comex price of Dollars 362 an ounce.
Barrick's share of output from its five existing mines in the US and Canada
jumped by a third last year to 789,800 ounces. The contribution from
Goldstrike, which is set to become North America's biggest gold producer,
rose to 546,146 ounces, from 352,880 ounces.
Total output is expected to climb to 1.2m ounces this year. Mr Bob Smith,
the company's president, predicted yesterday that production could double by
the end of the decade.
The new Meikle mine, which will be located one mile north of Goldstrike on
the Purple Vein deposit, is expected to have a life of 11 years. Its
operating costs are estimated at Dollars 125 an ounce.
The Meikle development and an agreement with Newmont Gold to develop the
nearby Lower and Deep Post orebody have led Barrick to raise its gold
reserves estimate by 25 per cent to 25.3m ounces.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuelan smelter plans on
hold - The country's response to low aluminium prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S ambitious plans to expand its aluminium smelting capacity from
the current level of 644,000 tonnes a year to more than 2m tonnes a year by
the turn of the century have been stymied by world market conditions. Excess
production and a flood of shipments from the cash-hungry former Soviet Union
had forced prices to historic lows before they rallied last month.
The situation looked particularly grim late last year after Alcoa and
Austria Metall advised the Venezuelan government that they had decided to
'suspend' plans to invest in two aluminium smelters that would have added
more than 330,000 tonnes to Venezuela's annual smelting capacity.
In spite of this, the government of President Carlos Andres Perez and
Venezuelan aluminium industry executives believe that some important
smelting projects will be developed here over the short and medium term. 'I
expect that the next one or two large international aluminium smelters will
be built in Venezuela,' said Mr Miguel Rodriguez, Venezuela's minister of
planning and chief strategist of its economic reform programme.
Mr Rafael Rodriguez Pulido, president of Venezuela's oldest aluminium
producer, Alcasa, commented: 'The Venezuelan aluminium industry is losing
money because of the cyclical nature of the world aluminium industry. But
this doesn't mean that the industry is a bad investment, especially here'.
Two other projects to build large smelters, involving investors from Europe,
Korea and the US, are still nominally alive but there has been no word on
whether they will go ahead. However, Alcoa has taken pains to tell the
Venezuelan government that its project is not dead and that it will be
reviewed on a regular basis.
Venezuela's state-controlled aluminium sector closed 1991 with mixed
results. The country's two large smelters - Alcasa and Venalum - lost a
total of about USDollars 89m last year. But Venezuela's bauxite mine,
Bauxiven, last year increased production by 172 per cent to 2.1m tonnes,
after years of delays in raising production levels. Interalumina, the
country's producer of alumina (aluminium oxide), raised production capacity
to 2m tonnes a year and said it would post a profit for 1991.
Venalum, Venezuela's largest smelter, registered its first loss in 1991, of
about Dollars 39m, while Alcasa, a profitable company since 1982, expects
its 1991 losses to reach aboutDollars 50m. Venalum's red ink was due to
lower world prices for primary aluminium, while Alcasa's deficit was caused
by a combination of weak prices and high financing costs on its domestic
debt.
Venalum's equity is held by the Venezuelan government (80 per cent) and six
Japanese companies (Showa Denko, Kobe Steel, Sumitomo Chemical, Mitsubishi
Material, Mitsubishi Aluminium and Marubeni) which have a total of 20 per
cent.
Alcasa is 92.1 per cent owned by the Venezuelan government and 7.9 per cent
by Reynolds International.
Both companies are taking steps to improve their financial situations during
1992, including a variety of cost cutting measures. In Venalum's case, the
company plans to reduce personnel by 24 per cent to about 3,100. Alcasa says
it will raise efficiency at its plants and work out a plan to lower
financing charges.
Alcasa must work much harder than Venalum to improve production efficiency.
The latter is a relatively new plant, having started production on the first
of its five production lines in 1978. But three of Alcasa's four pot lines
were put into production between 1967 and 1978 and are less efficient than
newer lines.
Despite adverse market conditions in 1991, Venezuelan smelters did not cut
production significantly. Venalum, with installed smelting capacity of
430,000 tonnes a year, produced 395,600 of primary aluminium last year, down
0.04 per cent from 1990. Alcasa, with installed smelting capacity of 214,000
tonnes a year, produced an estimated 210,000 tonnes of primary aluminium, up
4 per cent from 1990. Alcasa also has 42,000 tonnes in rolling capacity for
products.
Venalum projects production of 401,000 tonnes this year, and Alcasa is
aiming at at 220,000 tonnes.
About 70 per cent of Venalum's production is exported to to Japan, while
Alcasa exports 40 per cent of output to a variety of international clients.
Both companies own shares in downstream aluminium producers outside
Venezuela.
Bauxiven, which is wholly-owned by the government, expects bauxite
production this year to exceed 3.5m tonnes.
Interalumina (owned 98.3 per cent by the Venezuelan government and 1.7 per
cent by Alusuisse) says that output will depend on demand. Interalumina in
the past has regularly produced at above its installed capacity.
Critics of Venezuela's aluminium sector say that the two large smelters
should have performed better last year, even in the face of weak prices.
Alcasa and Venalum enjoy comparative advantages such as low-cost
hydro-electic power and labour, plus supplies of alumina and bauxite from
nearby sources.
Industry officials say that they are working hard to make Venezuelan
smelters more efficient. And, they note, the government eliminated export
incentives in 1989-90, thus forcing Venalum and Alcasa to compete on real
terms internationally.
Executives at Venalum and Alcasa also point out that Venezuela still offers
strong comparative advantages to aluminium companies. These include
hydro-electric power at a cost ranking among the lowest worldwide; large
deposits of high-grade bauxite plus the capacity to produce 2m tonnes of
alumina a year; years of experience in smelting and in making aluminium
products; a network of downstream aluminium users in Venezuela and overseas
(in which Venezuelan smelters are equity partners); and a good location for
reaching world markets.
Mr Enrique Castells, former president of Venalum and now a management
consultant on aluminium, said that the decline in aluminium prices 'is good
for Venezuela' since it will force the sector 'to get into shape'. Moreover,
rather than halting new spending on smelting capacity, he said, 'smart
investors should be investing now in new plants'.
'The current price situation should force many high-cost producers out of
the market, and new, low-cost smelters should be started now in order to
take advantage of demand increases when the price cycle bottoms out'.

After an uncertain start to this week's Australian wool sales, prices have
moved steadily ahead. Strength is again most apparent in middle and broader
categories. New Zealand wool was also dearer for practically all categories
in the crossbred offering there, by around 5%. After a slow start to the
second half of the selling season demand appears to be picking up and
clearences to the trade have improved. The Australian Wool Corporation's

Gold closed lower on the London bullion market in generally dull trading.
Dealers saw little incentive for the market to break out of the Dollars 354
to Dollars 360 a troy ounce range ahead of next week's Comex options expiry.
Platinum eased as light profit taking emerged after this week's gains.
London cocoa prices dipped to fresh five-month lows in early trading before
recovering some of the losses. 'We've seen fund selling, although there was
some very scattered industry buying in the nearbys,' said one dealer. In New
York orange juice futures were sharply lower at midday. 'The market is
weighed down on expectations that the USDA will revise the early and
midseason orange estimate upwards, on preliminary estimates the 1992-93
Brazilian orange crop will be larger than expected and on technical
factors,' said one analyst. London robusta coffee prices moved ahead.
Dealers said the market appeared to have experienced a technical correction
after being oversold recently, with interest focused on the March contract
switching from the sterling contract to dollars. In contrast New York
arabicas were at new lows by midday. Analysts said renewed pressure
reflected bearish sentiment toward both fundamental and technical factors.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Review cuts Russian oil exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government's review of export licences helped cause a drop in
oil exports of some 400,000 barrels a day in the first three weeks of
January, the International Energy Agency, the west's energy watchdog, said.
Exports slipped to 600,000 b/d after dropping in December to 1m b/d from
1.1m b/d in November, according to the IEA's latest monthly oil market
report. Russia said it would review export licences at the end of November
and many shippers are still awaiting the award of licences for this year.
This has seen tankers which are waiting to load crude oil and products,
having to face abnormally long delays, particularly at Black Sea ports.
The IEA said that estimates of oil production in the former Soviet Union in
December ranged from as low as 9.4m b/d to 9.75m b/d.
The IEA said world oil demand for the first quarter of the year, is
projected at 67.9m b/d - 400,000 b/d above the level in the same period last
year. The agency estimated production by the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries at 24.3m b/d in January - a decline from December's
level of 24.4m b/d, which was the organisation's greatest output for 11
years.
Meanwhile, Dr Subroto, Opec secretary general, said the organisation's
production was running at 24.2m b/d after nine members cut output by 415,000
b/d. He estimated that world oil demand would fall in the second quarter by
1.8m b/d to 64.68m b/d.
Oil prices were unmoved by the production forecasts and North Sea Brent
crude added 5 cents at Dollars 18.25 a barrel. The market has remained
fairly stable this week as traders remain optimistic that Opec will agree to
cut output at its meeting next week in order to buoy prices.
In addition, Iraq's decision to break off talks with the United Nations over
the sale of its oil, makes the prospect of an Iraqi return to the market
this year even more remote.

off explorers'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROBLEMS IN exploration access, together with various barriers to
investment, have made Australia a less attractive target for an
overseas-based minerals explorer and developer, according to an executive of
the Australian miner, MIM Holdings.
Mr Ken Dredge, executive general manager of MIM Holdings (Lead and Zinc),
yesterday said 26 per cent of Australia's land mass is closed to mineral
exploration through either environmental or aboriginal claims. A further 22
per cent is under claims for further restriction.
Access to large land tracts at minimal costs is essential for successful
exploration. For every 1,000 initial explorations, roughly 100 warrant
further detailed work and just 10 are drilled. 'Limiting access to land only
increases these odds,' Mr Dredge said.
Speaking at an annual conference of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural
and Resource Economics, Mr Dredge noted the uncertainties in the country's
investment rules. He cited the ADollars 2bn (Pounds 830m) coal development
project of Utah Development Company in Bowen Basin in the late 1960s.
Shortly after the project started turning in handsome returns following
energy price rises in the early 1970s, the Australian government introduced
a special duty on open cut coal production and a regime of rail freights for
subsequent export coal projects that incorporated additional royalties.
Last year's federal government decision to refuse approval for gold and
platinum mining at Coronation Hill also illustrated the present mineral
investment environment. 'The uncertainty and confusion created by such
decisions resulted in Australian miners spending increasing proportions of
their exploration budget overseas,' Mr Dredge said.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese buying 'to underpin
copper prices'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHINESE have returned to the London Metal Exchange as substantial buyers
of copper and this should help to underpin prices, suggests Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group.
'With the western world market copper surplus in 1992 estimated at only
about 120,000 tonnes, renewed Chinese buying could see this surplus narrow
considerably, which should limit the downside for prices to about 90 cents a
lb in the next few months and contribute to an improvement thereafter,' says
analyst Mr Robin Bhar in Carr's latest Metal Markets Insight.
He forecasts that copper's price will average Dollars 1 a lb in 1992.
Mr Bhar points out that copper has been in short supply in China for many
years. Whereas between 1989 and 1990 output of aluminium rose by 14 per
cent, that of lead by 15 per cent and that of zinc by 16 per cent, copper
production was up by only 3.5 per cent.
'A continued need to import copper is therefore highly likely,' he suggests.
The shortfall in copper supply was projected by CNNIEC, the government's
import-export agency, to reach 220,000 tonnes in 1990.
Whereas annual aluminium production capacity is expected to reach 1.3m
tonnes by 1993, from 850,000 tonnes in 1990 and an estimated 1m tonnes last
year, copper smelter capacity is expected to be only 665,000 tonnes by 1993,
up from 560,000 in 1990.
Mr Bhar says the first signs that the Chinese had started importing copper
again emerged in July last year when unexpected stock falls were attributed
to merchants shipping copper to China. That country was expected to take
between 50,000 and 100,000 tonnes in the following 12 months.
Chile Copper Corporation (Codelco) provided confirmation a few weeks ago
when it indicated it was receiving heavy orders from China. Codelco sold
more than 15,000 tonnes in January this year and expects to sell a similar
tonnage in February, says Mr Bhar.
He says there have also been suggestions that China has been importing
nickel and this might be reflecting problems caused by the flooding and
cave-in at its main, 20,000 tonnes a year nickel mine at Jinchuan.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe to launch new Eurolira
futures contract

THE London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) plans to
introduce a futures contract on the three-month Eurolira interest rate on
May 12.
The step follows last week's decision by the Italian Ministry of Finance to
drop the 30 per cent withholding tax on domestic interbank deposits. Dealers
expect the move to boost activity in Italian money markets and lead to a
convergence between the domestic interbank and London-based Eurolira deposit
rates.
The move was also prompted by 'the continuous increase in size of the
Eurolira market (and) the high volatility of Eurolira interest rates,' Liffe
said.
The introduction of the contract will coincide with 'a change in the
attitudes of bank treasurers to the interbank market' and 'a dramatic
increase in the need to manage short-term interest rate risk', said Mr
Eugenio Namor, a derivatives broker at SanPaolo Bank in London.
Liffe had been planning to launch a Eurolira deposit contract for some time,
but switched its attention to Italian government bond futures as expected
abolition of the withholding tax languished. The bond future, launched in
September, is well established, traded 142,000 contracts last month. Liffe
trades three-month sterling, Eurodollar, Euromark, Ecu and Euroswiss
interest rate future contracts.
The contract size is L1bn, with a tick size of L25,000. Settlement will be
based on British Bankers' Association rates for three-month Eurolira
deposits on the last trading day.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Few issues emerge in sluggish market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAVY inventory of unplaced paper which is weighing on underwriters'
books contributed to the prevailing torpor in the Eurobond market, where
only a handful of new issues emerged yesterday.
The dollar sector remains the worst afflicted, due to the huge volume of
aggressively priced paper launched last month, much of which remains
unplaced. Dealers say there is little investor interest in these recent
deals, many of which are trading at spreads 10 basis points wider than at
launch. The fear of causing a further widening of these spreads may be
holding back further issuance.
In the D-Mark sector, where the market is also becoming rather clogged after
heavy volume, Total, the French oil company, launched a DM200m 10-year deal
via Deutsche Bank.
Meanwhile, Denmark's Ecu1bn domestic issue will not emerge for several
weeks, because technical details involving the structure of the issue still
have to be resolved. The deal, has been mandated to Den Danske Bank and
Unibank.
The bonds will be listed in Copenhagen and will clear through the Danish
domestic clearing system, but a Danish central bank official said the
structure will be designed to ensure they can be cleared through Euroclear
and Cedel, the European clearing houses.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Developing eastern Europe's
capital markets / A look at EBRD's proposals to assist and advise new
borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATE and corporate borrowers in eastern Europe may soon find it easier to
raise funds in the international and domestic capital markets.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the
London-based international institution set up to help with the economic and
political regeneration of eastern Europe, is currently working on plans to
develop the eastern European capital markets, both by bringing eastern
European state and corporate borrowers to the international markets and by
promoting the development of the domestic capital markets in the region.
While countries such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia are no strangers to the
international financial markets, having launched several public bond issues
already, the EBRD hopes to advise other eastern European countries in their
use of the capital markets.
The main areas where the EBRD sees scope for helping eastern European
borrowers are as follows:
To guarantee and underwrite international bonds issues so that certain
eastern European state and corporate borrowers may tap the international
capital markets for the first time.
Although Hungary and Czechoslovakia have launched public bonds in the
international capital markets in a range of currencies, they are considered
high-risk borrowers and therefore have to pay substantial margins in the
order of 200 to 300 basis points over the respective benchmark government
bonds.
In addition, as poor credits they are often confined to borrowing
short-term.
For example, in November Czechoslovakia launched a Dollars 200m bond in the
name of Statni Banka, the Central Bank. The three-year bonds were priced to
yield 300 basis points over the comparable US government securities, but are
now trading at about 340 basis points over the benchmark.
However, other eastern European borrowers are unable to issue bonds in the
international capital market at all because they are considered to be poor
credit risks by investors. So the EBRD is currently discussing the
possibility of guaranteeing and underwriting bond issues by such eastern
European borrowers over the next few months.
Mr Anders Ljungh, EBRD finance vice-president, points out this would allow
eastern European countries to borrow at a lower margin than when Hungary and
Czechoslovakia tapped the international bond markets.
For those borrowers which have not tapped the international capital markets
already, such an arrangement could help to introduce them to the
international markets.
'We're there to assist them by bringing them to the international market,'
said Mr Ljungh. 'Our role would be an interim one because we want them to
develop their own strength and so we would simply be helping them to take
their own steps in the market, borrowing for specific projects.'
In other words, once investors were familiar with the borrowers, the EBRD
would not be required to provide its guarantee.
Eastern European borrowers would have to pay the EBRD for carrying the risk,
though probably not on purely commercial terms. 'Our charge, or risk
premium, for providing the guarantee might differ from what a commercial
bank would charge,' said Mr Ljungh, adding that the EBRD has not started to
discuss the exact costs yet. At present, eastern European borrowers can only
reduce their borrowing costs on short-term credits by using short-term trade
insurance.
Some dealers at US securities houses believe that even with the EBRD's
guarantee, investors might still be reluctant to buy eastern European bonds
unless the deal were to be attractively priced. 'It would probably make more
sense for the EBRD to borrow in its own name, taking advantage of its triple
A rating to raise funds cheaply, and then simply lend the money to the
eastern European borrower,' said one dealer. In fact the EBRD already does
this, borrowing in its own name in the international bond markets and
lending the money for projects in eastern Europe. However, it has not yet
had a hand in guaranteeing any of the eastern European bond issues launched
so far and feels it could play a useful role by introducing borrowers to the
market in this way.
To help eastern European countries manage the foreign exchange risk
associated with existing debts.
The EBRD hopes to help eastern European borrowers swap their debts into a
currency matching their income stream. For example, if an eastern European
company has borrowed in yen but is selling its products in US dollars, it
faces an exchange rate risk. The borrower may not be able to swap the debt
into dollars because in the international markets it may be considered an
unacceptable credit risk. However, the EBRD believes that with its own
triple A rating it can help by taking on the counterparty risk, thereby
helping the borrowing company to swap its debt into a suitable currency.
'This kind of debt management will become much more important,' said Mr
Ljungh, adding that while the EBRD will help the borrower to avoid currency
risk, the bank's charges to the borrower are likely to be on a similar scale
to those in the international swaps market.
In addition, the EBRD said it is willing to finance projects in a currency
which matches the borrowing company's income, as well as offering the
possibility of switching between floating rate and fixed rate loans. This
might enable eastern European companies to borrow in the same currency as
that in which they are paid - something which is not always possible from
the export credit agencies. It would also allow the borrowing company to
switch from floating rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing if it believes
that interest rates have reached a low.
To help with the development of domestic bond markets.
The EBRD wants to be able to issue bonds in the domestic markets so that it
can fund projects in local currency.
At present, only Hungary has a well-developed domestic bond market.
McDonald's, the US fast-food chain, has tapped the Hungarian bond market
with a Ft400m issue, making it the first foreign or privately owned company
to raise money in the Hungarian domestic bond market since the Second World
War. The issue was a private placement and was bought by a handful of
Hungarian investors.
Now, other eastern European countries are studying how to set up domestic
bond markets. The EBRD hopes to play an important role in establishing
liquid money and bond markets, by offering training for staff, providing
technical equipment and advice on how to set up market-makers.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Bangkok Land valued at
Dollars 3.6bn in stock exchange debut

<TEXT>
BANGKOK LAND, the property developer, was valued at more than Dollars 3.6bn
yesterday when its shares were listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand,
giving it the largest capitalisation on the market.
The company's stock market debut attracted intense interest from Thai and
foreign investors and dealings in the shares amounted to about one-third of
total trading volume.
Bangkok Land closed at Bt154, up only Bt4 from its opening, but well above
last year's initial public offering price of Bt90, when the underwriters had
trouble finding buyers for the 10 per cent of the company on offer.
Market sentiment has improved since the initial offering - a process
described by one broker as 'neither initial nor public' in accordance with
Thai practice - and the shares had recently traded on the grey market at
around Bt140.
From today, the company, valued at Bt92.4bn, will make up about 8 per cent
of the SET index, giving the controlling Kanjanapas family considerable
influence in the market. One brother, Anant, runs Bangkok Land, and another,
Keeree, runs Thanayong, also a large property company.
Bangkok Land's main project is Muang Thong Thani, an embryonic residential,
commercial and industrial satellite city on the outskirts of Bangkok which
is said to be the world's largest private property development.
When construction of pre-fabricated units is running at full production, the
company expects to finish one condominium unit every five minutes.
Foreign brokers have generally advised their clients to be cautious of the
stock or have treated it as a speculative buy, partly because of initial
doubts about the way the company booked deposits on partially built
properties as earnings.
The property market has also started to soften, and although the low income
housing sector favoured by Bangkok Land has held up well, there are fears
the company in common with the developers of London's docklands, may have
difficulty attracting customers and the industrial units may be hard to
sell.
The next big new listing on the Thai stock market is expected to come from
the privatisation of Thai Airways.

Cedel increases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANNUAL results from Euroclear and Cedel, the two clearing systems for the
international bond market, show a strong increase in trading volumes last
year.
Euroclear turnover increased 40 per cent to Dollars 5,700bn equivalent,
while Cedel saw a 37 per cent increase to Dollars 3.336bn. The overall
increase in trading volume in both systems reflects the buoyancy of bond
markets last year and the high volume of new issues.
Both systems have increased their coverage of domestic bond markets.
Euroclear increased turnover of domestic bonds by 88 per cent, Cedel by 38.6
per cent.
The breakdown of turnover by currency underlines the decreasing importance
of US dollar denominated securities and the growth of the Ecu bond market as
a liquid sector.

<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust Australia, the Sydney-based offshoot of the US-controlled
financial services group, has moved against the banking trend in Australia
with a strong rise in earnings in 1991.
The company yesterday announced a 31 per cent advance in net profits to
ADollars 160.8m (USDollars 123.6m) from ADollars 122.8m a year earlier.
Pre-tax earnings rose 38.3 per cent to ADollars 279.1m.
Mr Rob Ferguson, managing director, said the company's return on average
shareholders' funds was 34.2 per cent, and group assets had grown to
ADollars 4.5bn from ADollars 3.6bn in the year.
'All areas of the bank posted increased profits,' he said. 'Funds management
accounted for one-third of all revenues, while investment banking accounted
for the rest.
'This improvement was in spite of the tough economic times. Banker Trust's
approach has been prudent in all business areas.'
But Mr Ferguson warned the 1991 trading year was unlikely to be repeated.
'Interest rates traded lower during the year,' he said. 'The 90-day Bank
Bill rate fell from about 12 per cent at the beginning of the year to less
than 8 per cent at the end of 1991.
'This extraordinary rally was clearly an advantageous environment for banks.
(In 1992), there may not be the trends in interest rates that characterised
1991. There should, however, be opportunities in other parts of our business
that will offset this factor.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Zealand government's ambitious borrowing programme suffered an
unexpected setback yesterday with the failure of the February bond tender.
The tender was the first to face a substantial shortfall since 1986 when the
Reserve Bank sold most of a tender to Rakiura Holdings, a small merchant
bank, which promptly failed.
Interest rates jumped sharply on news that only NZDollars 233m (USDollars
129.4m) of the NZDollars 350m was filled. The lack of support for the issue
concerned financial markets, as the government is scheduled to borrow a
further NZDollars 2.45bn before June through monthly tenders to meet latest
projections of increased budget deficits.
Dealers said the failure, in the tender's indicator maturity, November 1996,
was surprising as it had been the most popular in recent tenders. A Treasury
spokesman said he believed it may have been due to technical reasons.

from ADollars 90.6m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
Sales fell 14 per cent to ADollars 12.6m from ADollars 14.8m, while total
operating revenues fell 27.5 per cent to ADollars 36.4m from ADollars 50.2m.
ACIL said the result for the six months was abnormally affected by net
realised and unrealised foreign exchange losses of ADollars 17.7m.
Recently, ACIL agreed to sell its 50 per cent interest in National Brewing
Holdings, for ADollars 425m, to Lion Nathan of New Zealand, which owned the
other 50 per cent.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Importance of a shared memory /
A look at the potential of Intel's relationship with Sharp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by Intel, the world's leading microprocessor maker, to share
its most advanced memory technology with a Sharp company is bound to raise
eyebrows in Washington, where America's loss of industrial leadership to
Japan has become a controversial political issue.
Yet Mr Robert Reed, Intel's senior vice-president, was yesterday in no doubt
about who his main constituents were: Intel's shareholders. And for them, he
argued, the industrial and financial logic of the deal was compelling.
Intel now supplies 85 per cent of the world market for flash memory devices,
easily eraseable and recordable semiconductor chips that retain electronic
information after power is switched off. They are a natural replacement for
many magnetic recording devices, such as disk drives and tape recorders,
because they are smaller, lighter, use a fraction of the energy, and provide
faster access times. They are also becoming cheaper.
Flash memory devices are used now in some computers. Mr Richard Pashley,
general manager of Intel's memory component division, says they will become
generally available in portable computers in about a year.
Intel is having trouble now meeting the rapidly- growing demand in the
computer field, which is the mainstay of its business. Sharp, the Japanese
electronics company, will provide capital to expand manufacturing capability
and a research capability to advance the technology. More importantly,
however, it will give Intel a way in to the consumer electronics industry,
where it has no experience.
Mr Atsushi Asada, Sharp senior executive vice-president, yesterday outlined
a range of ideas for new products, including tiny voice recorders with no
moving parts, digital still cameras, hand-held electronic magazines, and
cellular fax machines that store and display transmissions electronically.
For Sharp, having access to Intel technology puts it instantly ahead of the
pack in Japan, although the companies would not disclose how much Sharp is
paying for this privilege.
Mr Reed said Intel would have difficulty retaining its technological and
market leadership without a strong partner. Intel has a current capital
expenditure budget of Dollars 1bn a year; Mr Reed argued that to spend an
additional Dollars 500m on a new plant for flash memories would not be
prudent.
This is particularly true as competition in the industry could become
bruising as the market grows, and Intel is going against large Japanese
companies such as Hitachi or NEC, which have much greater resources. It
expects to see its market share scaled back sharply, perhaps to 30 per cent,
while sales blossom.
And while flash memories may provide an important complement to Intel's core
business, leadership in microprocessors will remain its central focus.
'There are only so many things you can do well at the same time,' he said.
'And I think we are close to the limit. The deal raises the long-term
prospect of Intel's success in flash (memories).'
Intel has already tripled its production of flash memories at its plant in
New Mexico in the past six months. The devices use 1-micron process
technology. A micron, one millionth of a metre, refers to the size of the
line width etched into a silicon wafer.
Production of 0.8-micron devices is beginning now on behalf of Intel by NMB
Semiconductors, the Japanese company. Sharp and Intel plan jointly to
develop manufacturing technology for 0.6 and 0.4-micron devices with an aim
of starting production in 1994 at a Sharp facility in Fukuyama, Japan.
Intel said it had no plans to manufacture the smaller, more powerful devices
in the US, although it could decide to upgrade its New Mexico production to
the more advanced technology. While Intel considered a US partner, it
selected Sharp in part because demand for flash memories was expected to be
strong in Japan.
Datastream says the worldwide market may grow from about Dollars 130m a year
today to about Dollars 1.5bn by 1995. Yesterday there was talk of a Dollars
10bn market by the turn of the century, one that may rival the market for
dynamic random access memory (Dram) devices in size.
Mr Pashley says that, per unit of memory capacity, flash devices are
fundamentally cheaper to make because they are less complex. As
manufacturing volume accelerates, Intel expects price per unit of memory to
match Dram chips by 1994, and then decline.
As for mini hard disk drives, a 40-MByte flash card is expected to be
cheaper than a 1.8-inch drive by 1995. Smaller capacity cards are already
competitive.
As a taste of things to come, Intel this week halved the prices of its
memory cards already on the market. The price of a 4-MByte card was cut to
Dollars 492 in the US.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: American Express plans to
relaunch Optima card
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express yesterday said it planned to relaunch its troubled Optima
credit card, the loss-making business that suffered heavy credit loss
provisions last year.
The relaunch involves tightening the criteria for new card-holders and
creating a three-tiered pricing structure that rewards the best customers
with a low interest rate.
Optima, which was launched in 1987 and has more than 3m cardholders,
suffered 1991 losses that are estimated by analysts at around Dollars 150m.
Last November, American Express named Mr Frank Skillern to take over the
Optima business, following a Dollars 155m third-quarter charge related to
Optima losses from consumer delinquencies. Mr Skillern yesterday said the
new tiered pricing structure would be accompanied by a move to deploy more
resources that focus on potential delinquencies earlier in the credit
process.
More than 50 per cent of the Dollars 697m pre-tax increase in 1991 credit
loss provisions at American Express's Travel Related Services (TRS) division
is believed to have come from the Optima business.
Optima, operated through the Delaware-based Centurion Bank, is not expected
by American Express to return to profitability until 1994.
The new pricing structure, which will only be available in the US, will
offer the lowest interest rate - 12.50 per cent - for cardholders who have
at least one year's tenure, have made no late payments over the past 12
months, and spend at least Dollars 1,000 annually with Optima.
Cardholders who have not been in good standing will pay a rate of 18.75 per
cent, while a middle-tier rate of 14.75 per cent will be charged to
card-holders who have been in good standing but do not meet other
requirements.

SHARES in Federated Department Stores, the new parent company for the
Federated and Allied store chains, were due to start trading on a 'when
issued' basis yesterday - marking the group's formal emergence from
bankruptcy, writes Nikki Tait.
The emergence of the retail business - which encompasses 11 different
chains, including Bloomingdale's - from corporate purgatory was heralded
last month. The bankruptcy court then approved a reorganisation plan
hammered out between management and the company's creditors.
The chains' failure in 1990 had seemed to mark the end of an era of
debt-financed deals.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: S&amp;P takes dim view of TWA's
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit ratings agency, estimated the chances of a
successful reorganisation of Trans World Airlines to be 'even, at best',
adding that it viewed the airline's long-term prospects as 'poor'.
TWA last Friday filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy
Code, and its owner, Mr Carl Icahn, has been reported as saying that the
carrier has a '90-10 chance to make it'.
However, some analysts have been more sceptical. S&amp;P has already attached
'D' ratings to the company's senior notes.
The agency pointed out that the filing fell short of a 'pre-packaged
bankruptcy' - where a reorganisation scheme has already been agreed with all
creditors and the bankruptcy mechanism is merely used to implement it.
It suggests that the timing of the filing 'appears to be motivated by the
conclusion of preliminary agreements with most creditors and a continuing
cash drain that may necessitate debtor-in-possession financing to continue
operations'.
However, S&amp;P also noted the potential pension problem at TWA, and the fact
that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation - a federal agency which
essentially guarantees basic pension payments - has not agreed to the
reorganisation as outlined.
The PBGC has claimed that TWA's pension plans are underfunded by Dollars
933m, although this is subject to some dispute.
At present, because of the level of Mr Icahn's ownership, a liquidation at
TWA could allow the PBGC to seek recovery from other Icahn-controlled
entities.
However, if the reorganisation scheme reduced Mr Icahn's stake below 50 per
cent - as envisaged - this access would disappear under US law.

ADollars 558m assets writedown
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CSR, the Australian building and sugar company, yesterday surprised the
markets by announcing a ADollars 558m (USDollars 419.50m) asset write-down.
Mr Alan Coates, chairman, said the write-down, representing about 10 per
cent of total non-current assets, was in line with a subdued outlook for the
company's businesses.
He said it followed an extensive asset review 'imposed on directors' by
revised Australian accounting standards. The relevant standard, AASB 1010,
obliged directors to ensure that non-current assets were not recorded in
accounts at amounts exceeding recoverable values.
CSR's stark interpretation of the revised accounting standard raises the
possibility of a series of large write-downs by other leading Australian
companies.
With an offsetting upward revaluation of ADollars 186.4m on CSR's land and
buildings, the effect will be to reduce shareholders' funds by ADollars
372m, or 46.5 cents a share. The company showed shareholders' funds of
almost ADollars 3.2 in its March 1991 balance sheet.
Announcement of the write-downs initially sent CSR shares tumbling by 14
cents to ADollars 4.68 on the Australian Stock Exchange, but they later
recovered to close at ADollars 4.76.
Mr Coates said the write-downs came from independent valuations, where
appropriate. 'The company's drive for continuous improvement in the
production and distribution of its products, as well as the
recession-induced reduction in demand, have led to the closure of a number
of plants, requiring reduction in their value to that of their estimated
worth on disposal,' he said.
'There has also been a considerable fall in the value attributed to the
goodwill and trademarks of some CSR activities.
'Recent changes in perceptions of economic growth in the countries in which
CSR manufactures and/or sells its products have added greatly to the
uncertainty attached to the value of the company's assets, particularly
where significant intangibles such as goodwill are involved.'
Almost ADollars 216m of the write-down came off goodwill, with another
ADollars 120.6m off patents and trademarks. The next biggest item was a
ADollars 193.5m reduction in plant and equipment values.
Mr Coates said one positive outcome would be to improve CSR's future
profitability by around ADollars 15m a year through lower depreciation and
amortisation charges.
He indicated that, under the accounting standards, the upward valuation on
land and buildings would go into capital reserves. The ADollars 558m
write-down of other asset categories, however, must be dealt with through
the profit and loss account.
'Without other action, the write-down would leave a negative balance in the
retained profits of the company, which would preclude payment of a final
dividend this year and seriously impair the ability to pay future
dividends,' Mr Coates said.
'CSR's directors consider this is not justified. To remove this constraint
on CSR's capacity to pay future dividends, we propose seeking court approval
to use ADollars 558m of the share premium reserve to offset the loss and so
reinstate retained profits to their previous figure.
'Even after using this ADollars 558m, the share premium reserve will exceed
ADollars 900m.'

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has announced a partnership with National
Semiconductor focused on the technology for local area networks (LANs),
which link personal computers and workstations in offices and factories.
IBM said it would work with National, a leading manufacturer of LAN
semiconductor chips, to develop products that make networking easier.
The new relationship brings together the strongest proponents of rival LAN
technologies. IBM is the dominant supplier of Token-Ring networking
products, while National is the leader in chips used in Ethernet LAN
products.
In Token-Ring, LANs users exchange information packets through a 'token'
that acts as a courier travelling around the network loop from computer to
computer. In Ethernet LANs, information is exchanged along a network
'highway'.
The two approaches together represent about 60 per cent of the Dollars 2bn
networking equipment market, according to market analysts, with Ethernet
claiming about 35 per cent and Token-Ring about 25 per cent. Both are
growing at a rate of about 30 per cent a year.
With their new relationship, IBM and National are putting aside past debates
over the merits of each technology and stressing that both approaches must
co-exist.
As a first step IBM has licensed National to sell an IBM-built single-chip
controller device for Token-Ring networks. For IBM, the agreement represents
an opportunity to expand sales of the controller chip without having to
build up a sales and marketing organisation for the devices.
The agreement with National also enables IBM to establish its technology as
an alternative industry standard.
National hopes to increase its sales of networking chips by about Dollars
30m over the next 18 months.

EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest maker of photographic equipment, reported
a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 400m following a Dollars 597m after-tax
charge to cover the cost of an early retirement programme and further
restructuring moves.
Kodak, in the throes of its fifth restructuring since 1983, warned in
December that it would be taking a Dollars 495m charge, but said Dollars
102m had been added, mainly to cover additional employees who might seek
early retirement. It said that some 6,750 employees had elected to retire
early and a further 2,000 would be eligible this year.
The company also took a Dollars 435m charge in the third quarter, some
Dollars 200m of it for the retirement programme, which produced a Dollars
118m net loss.
Kodak said that in the absence of the charge, fourth quarter net earnings
would have been Dollars 197m, or 61 cents a share, compared with Dollars
326m, or Dollars 1.01, in 1990.
For the year, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 17m, or 5 cents a
share, following after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 1bn. Excluding
the charges, net earnings would have been Dollars 1.05bn, compared with
Dollars 1.27bn, or Dollars 3.91, in 1990, before deducting the damages won
by Polaroid in litigation against Kodak.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said: 'Despite concerns about the economic
background, we expect 1992 to be a time when benefits of what was done last
year will show in category growth, higher sales and better earnings.

<TEXT>
GULF Canada Resources, controlled by property group Olympia &amp; York
Developments, is pulling out of a consortium developing the Hibernia oil and
gas field off the coast of Newfoundland.
Gulf said the initiative to withdraw from the CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars
4.48bn) project came from the company's management and not from O&amp;Y, whose
own resources have recently been strained by the slump in the international
property market.
O&amp;Y, owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, has indicated, however, that its
highest priority for the moment is its real estate business. It has been
reducing its exposure to the resource sector.
Gulf has a 25 per cent interest in the Hibernia project, which is due to
come on stream in 1996 with an initial production of 110,000 barrels of oil
a day.
The company said it was reluctant to commit a large chunk of its resources
to a single project which would not contribute any cash flow for at least
the next six years. It said it has failed to find a buyer for its stake, and
there was no mechanism for a partial withdrawal. The decision will result in
an after-tax charge of between CDollars 90m and CDollars 300m.
The Canadian and Newfoundland governments, as well as the three other
members of the consortium, have insisted that the Hibernia venture will
still go ahead.
The two governments are providing generous financial incentives for the
project, on which Newfoundland is pinning much of its hopes of economic
growth in the 1990s.
The other members of the consortium are Mobil Oil Canada, Chevron Canada
Resources and Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada has also indicated that it would
like to reduce its commitment.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-running bondholder suit involving Washington Public Power Supply
System (WPPSS) has moved a step closer to resolution. A federal appeals
court has approved a settlement which would pay around Dollars 800m to
investors who purchased certain WPPSS bonds over a decade ago.
The settlement, if finally upheld, would represent the largest successful
investor suit brought in the US.
The investors involved bought bonds sold to help finance the construction of
two nuclear power plants in the north-western US. The plants were
commissioned in 1976 but abandoned in 1982 after cost overruns. Default on
the Dollars 2.25bn bond issue followed in 1983.
The bondholders' lawsuits, which were first filed over a decade ago, alleged
fraud and securities law violations by WPPSS, its directors, and cities and
utilities which participated in the project.
The settlement was reached in 1988, but legal wranglings between the various
interested parties has prevented any payout.
The appeals court ruling threw out challenges to the settlement from one
bondholder grouping and from some post-default investors.
If and when the settlement is paid out, the 20,000 people who bought bonds
between 1977 and 1983 are unlikely to share in the full Dollars 800m.
Some money will be set aside for investors who bought bonds after 1983,
while the class-action lawyers have asked for over Dollars 100m in fees.
This figure has been cut by one judge to nearer Dollars 40m, but the matter
is also under appeal.

<TEXT>
MR ERIK PENSER, the Swedish financier, yesterday filed a SKr3.8bn (Dollars
657m) lawsuit against Nordbanken, claiming the Swedish state-owned bank last
year illegally seized his majority shareholding in Nobel Industries, the
chemicals and defence group.
'The circumstances surrounding the seizure of the Nobel shares were not
consistent with valid legal procedures,' said Mr Bjorn Edgren, an attorney
for Mr Penser, in filing the suit for damages.
Nordbanken took over Mr Penser's holdings after he suffered a liquidity
squeeze last August. Mr Penser has said he was forced to give up control of
Nobel for a symbolic SKr1 because Nordbanken threatened him with
insol-vency.
The suit comes a week after an independent investigator appointed by Nobel
concluded that Nordbanken and other banks pressured it into helping them
rescue the finance subsidiary, Gamlestaden.
An agreement by Nobel to provide a SKr2.3bn capital contribution to
Gamlestaden was described as invalid due to the pressure applied by the
banks on Nobel, according to the investigation.

SASIB, the Italian specialised engineering group controlled by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti's CIR holding company, raised turnover by almost 24 per cent to
L766bn (Dollars 639m) last year thanks to continuing acquisitions.
Adjusted for the takeover of General Railway Signal and LUZI, two railway
equipment groups bought but only partly consolidated in 1991, sales rose by
5.3 per cent. Including the acquisitions, Sasib's order book jumped by 73
per cent to L735bn at the end of last year against L425.5bn at end-1990.
To fund its continued expansion and bolster its balance sheet, the company
is raising at least L78.5bn in new capital. Sasib will issue 15.7m new
savings shares, to be priced at no less than L5,000 each, as part of a
convertible bond issue.
The money will help to improve Sasib's balance sheet after last year's
acquisitions, which contributed to a L54.4bn fall in net liquidity to L68bn
at the end of 1991.

FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Olivetti warns of losses far
higher than expected
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo De Benedetti, chairman and controlling shareholder of Olivetti, the
troubled Italian computers and office equipment group, warned yesterday that
losses for last year would be much bigger than expected.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he forecast a
loss of around L380bn (Dollars 317m) in 1991. That is almost double
analysts' previous estimates and reflects the crisis in the world computer
industry.
Mr Benedetti said losses last year would amount to around 4.4 per cent of
sales. Last year, Olivetti's turnover slipped by about 5 per cent to
L8,600bn. A formal 1991 earnings statement is not expected until late April.
He predicted the company could break even or make a small profit for this
year thanks to cost-savings and an upturn in the world economy. Olivetti has
already announced a big restructuring programme aimed at saving around
L400bn a year.
Mr De Benedetti's remarks came just as Olivetti executives met union leaders
and government ministers in Rome to discuss the group's latest cost-cutting
drive to lay off 2,500 workers in Italy this year and close two plants. The
proposals have triggered a series of strikes and received a cool response
from the government, which would partly finance 2,200 of the redundancies.
However, with a general election looming, chances of greater co-operation
with the public sector may have increased. Last week's accord between Bull
and IBM in France and recent overtures by senior Italian IBM executives
towards Olivetti have led to a new focus on the idea, originally raised by
Mr De Benedetti, of closer co-operation with the state.
Olivetti's public position has been to seek state help in the form of more
public sector orders and greater assistance with research and development
spending. The company's latest three-year plan called for L4,500bn in public
sector contracts, of which L1,000bn should be spent this year.
Growing international collaboration in the computer industry has also
rekindled discussion about a link between Olivetti Information Services
(OIS), the group's software subsidiary, and Finsiel, the much bigger
state-owned software house which is part of the IRI group.

<TEXT>
BAD loan provisions pushed Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest
commercial bank, into the red last year and forced the bank to pass its
dividend.
KOP made a loss after financial items of FM1.64bn (Dollars 377m), against a
1990 profit of FM1.09bn. KOP's new chief executive, Mr Pertti Voutilainen,
said loan write-offs jumped by 144 per cent to FM1.343bn.
Although denying the bank was in a crisis, Mr Voutilainen, who took over the
day-to-day running of the bank last month, admitted it would 'be difficult
to return to profits this year'.
He said the bank was likely to suffer comparably large loan write-offs this
year but he added that KOP was 'a strong institution' and that 'its
foundations would not be shaken by losses incurred in one or even two years.
'These can be absorbed by reserves accumulated in the past,' he said.
Mr Voutilainen admitted the setback stemmed from a number of mistaken
decisions taken by KOP in recent years and were not just due to the severe
recession at present hitting Finland.
KOP's mistakes led to a FM270m loss due to the so-called Kouri affair, a
series of complex share deals carried out under the bank's authorisation by
Mr Pentti Kouri, a New York-based Finnish financier. A further loss of
FM122m was incurred from exposure to the failed London merchant bank,
Wallace Smith.
On top of this, KOP also suffered FM489m of credit losses to small and
medium-sized Finnish companies and a further FM65m was written-off from
household lending.
KOP said its portfolio of non-performing loans (on which interest had not
been paid to the bank for at least three months) stood at FM5.1bn at the end
of last year, while its exposure to companies and banks in Russia amounted
to FM1.1bn, with FM12m as a specific provision set against those debts.

ASKO, the German retail chain, has increased its shareholding in rival
retailer AVA from 24 per cent to more than 50 per cent, Reuter reports from
Saarbrucken.
ASKO acquired the additional AVA shares in return for shares in its Co op
offshoot, reducing ASKO's Co op stake to about 74 per cent.
'Through this investment . . . (ASKO) is buying the majority in one of the
best run and most successful German trading groups,' ASKO said.
Mr Klaus Wiegandt, ASKO chief executive, said AVA was a geographically ideal
supplement to ASKO's network of supermarkets. AVA made a net profit of DM52m
(Dollars 32.7m) on sales of DM4.41bn in 1990. It expects a further increase
in results for 1991.
In the first half of 1991, ASKO net profits were DM75m on sales of DM9bn.
Full-year results are due in July. In 1990, Co op made a loss of DM301m on
sales of DM10.25bn.
Co op was on the brink of bankruptcy when ASKO bought it at the end of 1990
and has since gone through a hard hitting restructuring.
Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency hopes to sell the east German
chemical manufacturer Buna and the chemical divisions of Leuna to western
investors by the summer.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: City flashes red as Amber Day succumbs to
Green - Cheap, cheerful and profitable. Jane Fuller files a report from the
bottom of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUNNING A chain of discount stores in a recession sounds like a licence to
print money. Amber Day, headed by Mr Philip Green, a 'love him or hate him'
type of businessman, seems to have borne out this theory.
Last year it more than trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m thanks to the
What Everyone Wants discount chain. WEW contributed an impressive Pounds
13.1m operating profit on Pounds 81m sales. Mr Green had bought the
Glasgow-based concern in June 1990 from Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld -
since departed because of a disagreement.
This year, with debt virtually wiped out by a rights issue and the
loss-making menswear business discarded, Amber Day is forecast to add
another Pounds 5m to pre-tax profits.
And yet the performance of the share price over the past couple of months
has been dismal. After climbing to a peak of 129p in November, the price
sunk as low as 71p last week. A recovery in the past few days has taken it
to 86p, just above last June's rights issue level of 83p.
The company has been the subject of two bear raids, one after Mr Green's
statement at the annual meeting that like-for-like sales were down a bit,
the other after a rather more personalised whispering campaign.
Supporters of the stock insist that the group is telling a plausible success
story, fuelled by growth in the discount sector.
The background is amply described by County NatWest in its recent report on
discount retailing. It presents the bustling UK high street of the 1980s as
an aberration. 'Trading up was a pervasive trend, with retailers becoming
design- and marketing-led rather than buying- and price-led.'
This left an increasing gap at the bottom of the market and it contrasted
with other countries, particularly the US, 'where price continued to be a
potent weapon and a multiplicity of new discount formats emerged'.
WEW, which has been going for about 20 years, has exploited that basement
gap through its concentration on low costs, buying power and high sales
volume.
Going round WEW shops, which have the bargain-appeal of a street market but
are laid out like a department store, it is easy to see why customers come:
two thirds of the items are priced at less than Pounds 10. But how can an
operating margin of 16 per cent be delivered at this level?
The low-cost element of the formula revolves around the sites and the staff.
Mr Graham Coles, finance director, says shop rents have accounted for less
than 2 per cent of sales - as with Kwik Save and Marks and Spencer -
compared with up to 13 per cent at some high-street boutiques.
WEW shops are edge-of-centre and a third are either freehold or long lease.
The large floorspace reduces the average rent per sq ft and the amount of
selling space is maximised.
Staffing numbers are kept flexible through the use of part-timers. At the
recently opened store in Coventry, for instance, the weekly wage bill before
Christmas was Pounds 5,200; in January it was cut to Pounds 2,200.
On the buying side, Mr Green has long been combing the Far East for cheap
goods. 'I've been going there since 1975 and I understand everything from
buying the fabric to putting the zippers in. I have a lot of knowledge of
what the intrinsic cost is.'
Importing directly from the manufacturer, buying in bulk and having the cash
to close a deal quickly all play their part.
Once the goods arrive in the shops, the emphasis is on shifting them. 'The
stock room is a dirty word in this business,' says one area manager.
But although sales volume is an obvious ingredient, the emphasis since Mr
Green took over has switched to the bottom line. Indeed last year's sales of
Pounds 81m were only Pounds 6m ahead of the 1989-90 figure, even though the
number of shops went up from 36 to 44 (now 51). Profit, on the other hand,
roughly doubled.
Mr Green says: 'When I bought it, the gross margin was 27 per cent, stock
loss (mainly theft) was 7 per cent, and mark-downs 10 per cent. I won't say
what the gross margin is now, but it's obviously better. We've halved the
stock loss and mark-downs are only 4 per cent.'
So why the continued scepticism, manifesting itself not only in the
vulnerability to bear raids, but also in a lack of coverage by some of the
main retail analysts?
Part of the answer lies in Amber Day's history, or lack of it.
In 1987, a consortium including Mr Irvine Sellar, whose property company
Ford Sellar Morris recently failed, injected Pounds 2m into Amber Day
Holdings, a loss-making clothes maker and importer.
The following year, Mr Green came in with the backing of Mr Tony Berry,
fellow Tottenham Hotspur fan and then still head of Blue Arrow. Mr Green
invested proceeds from the sale of his Jean Jeannie business and Blue Arrow
took a 10 per cent stake - promptly sold after Mr Berry's resignation in
1989.
One of the first moves was to buy the Review menswear shops from Mr Sellar's
company for Pounds 5.5m. Review and Woodhouse, another acquisition, fell
into losses of Pounds 300,000 last year (after a couple of years of profits)
and were sold in December for Pounds 750,000. One analyst remarked icily
that the sliding performance of these shops suggested that Mr Green was 'not
such a brilliant retailer'.
Amber Day also had a tilt at Moss Bros in 1989, but was brushed off rather
sniffily.
After that thwarting, Mr Green's set his sights on WEW. A 5-for-8 rights
issue at 45p per share raised just over Pounds 13m towards the Pounds 46.7m
purchase - twice the market value of Amber Day.
Not surprisingly, a 1-for-3 rights issue was launched last June to raise
Pounds 24.4m to cut debt.
The effect is that in less than two years, Amber Day has mounted a big
money-raising exercise in order to relaunch itself as What Everyone Wants.
Hence the truncated track record.
To try to improve the group's credibility, Mr Green has changed auditors -
from Stoy Hayward to Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte; changed brokers - from
Laing &amp; Cruickshank to Smith New Court - and appointed a finance director.
But he remains chairman and chief executive, an out-of-fashion combination
that has helped fuel a fear he might be the next Gerald Ratner.
For the future, questions revolve partly around the sustainability of
profits growth in discount retailing. Competition has intensified from more
upmarket high-street retailers, which keep putting on sales, and from
several regional discount chains.
As for margins, with price as the main competitive weapon, the potential
pressure is clear.
Others suspect that the bigger WEW gets, the less easy it will be for it to
make use of 'opportunity buys' - ends of lines, cancelled orders, fire-sale
batches from receivers. Mr Green argues that that type of deal only provides
a few per cent of group sales these days.
The final question goes back to the recession. When the UK comes out of it,
will some of WEW's customers trade up again? Mr Green says: 'Why will people
pay more just because someone tells them the recession is over?'
As these imponderables swirl around, some scepticism is bound to persist
about the company. It is worth remembering that because of the extra shares
in issue, it must raise pre-tax profits by 26 per cent this year just to
keep earnings in line with last year's 7.05p. This excludes an extraordinary
charge that will be taken for the menswear business disposal.
One thing is certain, however. Mr Green is the just the sort of man who
would love to prove the sceptics wrong.

DIRECTORS of Alphameric yesterday put forward a three-pronged financial
package aimed at helping the loss-making electronic data processing
equipment group continue to trade.
They warned that if the proposals were not approved and implemented it was,
in their opinion, 'unlikely that the group will be able to continue to
trade.' They added that as a result, it was 'doubtful that there would be
any assets for distribution to shareholders.'
The group is calling for:
Pounds 4.3m net via a placing and open offer of 20.62m new shares at 23p
each. The shares have been conditionally placed with institutions with a
clawback for qualifying shareholders on an 11-for-2 basis.
A reorganisation of the ordinary capital entailing the consolidation of 30
existing 5p shares into one new ordinary share with a nominal value of 150p
and then sub-dividing each consolidated share into one new 2.5p ordinary and
one deferred share of 147.5p. Each new ordinary will have the same rights as
those attaching to the existing shares.
A capital reduction via the cancellation of the deferred and special
redeemable shares together with cancellation of the amount remaining in the
share premium account following payment in full of the new offer shares.
The cancellations would result in the creation of a separate reserve
amounting to Pounds 20.5m against which the company would be able to write
off the Pounds 15.4m deficit on its profit and loss account and set off
goodwill arising on consolidation.
The convertible preference share capital, currently owned by 3i Group, is
also subject to changes.
The proposals are subject to approval by shareholders at an extraordinary
meeting convened for February 28 and the High Court.
The group also reported a loss of Pounds 377,000 (Pounds 1.75m) pre-tax for
the six months to end-September after taking account of an exceptional
credit of Pounds 1.12m which arose from the sale of the financial systems
division.
Turnover from continuing activities totalled Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 3.89m).
Losses per share emerged at 0.3p (1.7p).
The shares closed 1 1/4 p lower at 1p.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hambros Currency net revenue lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the six months to December 31, Hambros Currency Fund showed a slight
decline in net revenue from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 1.39m. Operating income
for the period was made up of Pounds 1.43m investment income and Pounds
101,000 call deposit interest, compared with Pounds 1.51m and Pounds
146,000.
In accordance with normal policy dividends have not been paid. Therefore
income will be accumulated by the company and reflected in the price of
participating shares.
The company is an open-ended investment vehicle issuing and redeeming
participating redeemable preference shares in sterling, dollars and D-Marks
at their net asset value. It is registered in Guernsey.

<TEXT>
British Thornton Holdings, a manufacturer of educational and scientific
furniture, returned profits of Pounds 20,000 pre-tax for the half year to
October 31.
The result, which compared with previous losses of Pounds 413,000, was
achieved from turnover of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 354,000) and excluded benefits
from acquisitions made in October.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.1p (losses 1.2p). Directors expect to pay a
maiden dividend following the full year results.
The group moved from the USM to a full listing in October. With the proceeds
of last year's rights issue, positive cash flow and a strong balance sheet
it is actively seeking acquisitions to expand its core businesses.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Raglan Property Trust were cut from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds
685,346 over the half year ended September 30. The figures reflected a
reduction in exceptional provisions from Pounds 3.65m to Pounds 405,341.
The exceptionals related to amounts written off properties and fees in
connection with the agreement between the company and its three main
bankers.
In November 1991 Raglan reported that its lending banks had confirmed its
request for continued support to March 31. In the absence of any other
funding this support would be required after March 1992, the company added.
Turnover showed a sharp improvement at Pounds 8.22m (Pounds 2.15m). Losses
per share worked through at 0.4p (1.9p) and net assets per share at
period-end stood at 0.7p (1.1p).

A HIGH COURT judge will rule today on a bid by Mr Asil Nadir, the former
chairman of Polly Peck International, the electronics and fruit group, to
halt the Pounds 378m civil action against him pending the outcome of his
trial on criminal charges.
The civil suit was launched last October by the administrators of Polly Peck
in a bid to recover money allegedly misappropriated from the company by Mr
Nadir, who is also facing 76 criminal charges of theft and false accounting.
Mr Nadir denies the charges and said he has a 'complete defence' to the
civil action. The court has heard that the criminal trial is expected to
start early next year.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Northern Rock climbs 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Newcastle-based Northern Rock Building Society yesterday announced
record annual results with increases of 29 per cent, from Pounds 42.3m to
Pounds 54.6m, in pre-tax profits, and from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 4.4bn, in
assets.
In 1991 the society boosted net profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 36.6m
(Pounds 27.5m), and mortgage lending by 45 per cent to Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds
814m).
The results, which lift the society two places to 11th in the current
building society league table, underlined the contrast between the 1991
housing markets in north-east England, the focus of half its business, and
in the south-east. Of its 138,000 mortgages, fewer than one fifth are in the
south-east, but that region accounted for nearly half of its 515
repossessions last year.
The society said that its performance was enhanced both by the relatively
low number of repossessions and the opportunity offered by rivals' cutbacks
in lending to pick up good quality business. It also highlighted the success
of its current and investment accounts, which attracted Pounds 442m (Pounds
237m) in retail receipts.
Mr Chris Sharp, managing director, said that strong asset growth coupled to
firm cost control had reduced unit costs by 12 per cent; the
management/expense ratio fell by 0.21 percentage points to 1.4 per cent. The
free capital ratio, at 5.25 per cent, was one of the strongest in the
industry, he said.
'In just about the worst housing market since the war, we are reporting our
best-ever financial results,' he said. 'While other societies have had to
repair the damage being done, we've not been as badly affected, and we've
been adroit in both the mortgage and savings markets.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Vodafone expands into Europe - Investment
of Pounds 21.75m will give telephone group 25% of NordicTel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE GROUP, the UK mobile telephone group formerly part of Racal
Electronics, is investing up to Pounds 21.75m over the next two years for a
25 per cent stake in NordicTel Holdings, one of three Swedish groups
licensed to operate GSM digital cellular networks for pan-European mobile
communications.
The move is a further step in Vodafone's ambitions to expand its presence in
western Europe.
It was able to obtain such a large stake in the Swedish company after an
unnamed investor in the original consortium decided to back out.
Vodafone is initially paying Pounds 350,000 for an 18.9 per cent stake in
NordicTel and a further Pounds 150,000 which gives it an option to take
another 6.1 per cent stake on or before January 1 1995.
The other shareholders in the holding company are a Trelleborg subsidiary,
Volvo and Spectra Physics, each with a 25 per cent stake.
The UK group will inject Pounds 8.75m into the consortium's shareholders'
funds this year and Pounds 12.5m in 1993. The capital injections by the
other shareholders will be on a pro rata basis.
Vodafone will relinquish its current 10 per cent holding in AB NordicTel,
the operating company.
As a result, NordicTel Holdings will have 100 per cent ownership of the
operating company, with Vodafone eventually controlling 25 per cent through
its stake in the holding company.
The arrangement will also give Vodafone a 5 per cent stake in a Danish GSM
digital cellular network which is 20 per cent owned by NordicTel Holdings.
NordicTel, along with Televerket, the Swedish national carrier and Comvik,
an analog network, have licences in Sweden to operate the GSM digital
cellular network, which will be a pan-European network.
There are more than 600,000 cellular phone users in Sweden but the current
system can only be used throughout Scandinavia and is not pan-European.
Vodafone thus expects NordicTel to win over a substantial number of existing
users when it starts to offer its service in September.
Vodafone, which has a 56 per cent share of the UK mobile telephone market,
also has a 4 per cent stake in the second public sector licence in France,
80 per cent of an operator in Malta and 30 per cent of an operator in Hong
Kong.
It is keen to expand particularly in Italy, which is likely to issue a
second licence soon, and Germany, which has said it might issue a third
licence.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Expansion takes Steel Burrill into
bloodstock insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEEL BURRILL Jones yesterday announced the acquisition of Nelson Steavenson
Bloodstock, a specialist bloodstock insurance broker, for an initial
consideration of Pounds 1m.
The deal is the latest of a number of acquisitions by SBJ, which is
continuing a drive to reduce its initial dependence on marine reinsurance
business.
SBJ will fund the purchase through the issue of 349,090 new ordinary shares.
Kleinwort Benson Securities has agreed to place 298,243 shares with
institutional investors at 285p apiece.
The vendors will be entitled to receive a deferred consideration in April
1995 related to the level of profits earned in the three years to December
31 1994.
NSB, which specialises in the wholesale broking of risks related to
bloodstock and domestic pets, employs 20 people and places the bulk of its
business at Lloyd's.
Most of its bloodstock business is generated in the US. The company's
brokerage income in the year to March 31 was over Pounds 1.8m, when pre-tax
profits amounted to Pounds 153,000.
Net tangible assets at that date were Pounds 92,000.
Last December, in its biggest ever takeover, SBJ acquired Regis Low, a
Lloyd's broker with a substantial energy, marine hull, and protection and
indemnity account for Pounds 33.4m. SBJ also financed that deal with paper.
In November SBJ bought a 45 per cent stake in a newly-formed company to
broke Australian and other overseas risks into the Lloyd's and London
markets.

Castletown, the Dublin-based stationery and printing group, reported pre-tax
profits of IPounds 71,000 (Pounds 66,000) for the six months to October 31.
The decline from last time's IPounds 114,000 came on turnover of IPounds
1.72m (IPounds 1.43m). Directors said, however, that a combination of recent
acquisitions, restructuring, new management and exposure to UK markets
should 'generate a strong recovery in the second half'.
A dividend of 0.9p (1.26p) is payable from fully diluted earnings of 1.76p
(3.13p).

former executives.
Further proceedings may be initiated by the group against other parties

In addition, extraordinary charges of IPounds 1.1m were taken in respect of
estimated aggregate costs and expenditure payable to various professional
advisers retained by the group throughout the period.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: TV franchises were jeopardised by high
bids, ITC minutes show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE TELEVISION and Tyne Tees Television were on the verge of losing
their franchises because of bids that were feared to be too high, according
to confidential Independent Television Commission documents.
Both companies were on a list of five 'problem' decisions that were the
subject of a second ITC staff assessment considered by Commission members in
the franchise-awarding process.
The detailed assessment of the five companies concerned - Yorkshire, Tyne
Tees, TVNI - an unsuccessful bidder for the Ulster franchise - TVS
Entertainment, and Television South West - was available to the High Court
when it heard the judicial review of the TSW decision. The court also had
minutes of the principal ITC decision-taking meeting taken by Ms Caroline
Gladstone, assistant secretary of the ITC.
The content of the documents was never revealed in open court. Yorkshire and
Tyne Tees were referred to as 'Company A' and 'Company B'. Counsel in the
case started calling the group of high bidders 'The Fearful Five'.
It is believed that ITC's staff and its financial adviser, Hill Samuel, the
merchant bank, recommended that neither Yorkshire nor Tyne Tees should
regain their franchises. Yorkshire, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times has a 20 per cent stake, bid Pounds 37.7m compared with the rival
White Rose bid of Pounds 17.4m. Tyne Tees bid Pounds 15.06m compared with
North East TV's Pounds 5.01m.
The ITC minutes also suggest that TVS was not turned down because of its
Pounds 59.75m bid, but because of uncertainties over MTM, its loss-making US
production company.
The ITC said that although the bid was very high, it clearly had shareholder
support. 'That doesn't take account of the MTM factor,' the minutes say.
Only one line is devoted to TSW, which lost its judicial review yesterday
but which was given leave to appeal to the House of Lords. The minutes say
that the staff recommendation (to turn down TSW) was supported.
ITC minutes clearly show how uncertain the regulatory body was about giving
Yorkshire a new franchise. The fact that it was a large company was seen as
a strength and it was suggested there would be extra cost savings because of
the links with Tyne Tees. Yorkshire has a 20 per cent stake in its
north-eastern neighbour.
Yorkshire may have been saved by the fact that Thames Television had lost
and the ITC did not want to lose a second large network production company.
The ITC declined to comment last night.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Astra subsidiary follows parent into
receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING the appointment of Cork Gully as receivers to Astra Holdings, the
munitions and fireworks maker being investigated by the Department of Trade
and Industry, Astra's largest UK subsidiary has also gone into receivership.
BMARC, based in Lincolnshire, makes armaments, ammunition and pyrotechnics.
Cork Gully said it aimed to find a buyer for the business as a going
concern. It has been returned to profit at the operating level.
It was bought for Pounds 32m in May 1988, funded by a rights issue. But debt
associated with the acquisition made the total cost impact nearly twice
that, according to Mr Tony McCann, one of the company doctors running Astra
prior to the receivership.
Soon after the BMARC purchase, Astra arranged a Pounds 50m credit facility
with five banks. With debt stuck at close to that amount, recent attempts at
a restructuring fell through and the banks called in Cork Gully.
About 75 per cent of Astra's business lies in the US, where operating
profits have continued to be made through the period of upheaval at the
parent company, which dates back two years to the discovery of difficulties
with PRB, a Belgian acquisition that was never consolidated, and the descent
into loss of the group.
The US subsidiaries have not been put into receivership. Cork Gully said
this was to facilitate a 'ring-fence' being put around them. Haley and
Weller, a UK concern, has not been put into receivership either.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Myersons pressurise Liberty to accept funds plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African Myerson family is pressing Liberty, the fashion retailer
and wholesaler, to accept its proposals for the strategic development of the
group which would lead to the appointment of a new chief executive and the
injection of capital through a Pounds 20m rights issue.
The Myersons, who own 15.08 per cent of Liberty's ordinary voting shares,
are calling for an extraordinary general meeting to allow shareholders to
consider its suggestions.
The Myersons' investment vehicle, Concerto Capital Corporation, said it
would consider underwriting the proposed rights issue by subscribing Pounds
13m which would result in it increasing its shareholding to 28 per cent. But
Concerto proposed that Liberty's existing shareholders should be able to
exercise their pre-emption rights at the current market price of Pounds
6.50.
Liberty rejected the outline proposals which it claimed lacked 'any
substance'. Its advisers pointed out that Liberty was in no need of a rights
issue as it had minimal borrowings.
The Myersons, through their financial advisers, Hambro Magan, have been
wooing the various members of the founding Liberty family, who own 50 per
cent of the company's shares.
Since the end of last year, several meetings have been held with both the
'inner' Stewart-Liberty family, which controls 35 per cent of the equity,
and the 'wider' family, which controls a further 15 per cent. Earlier this
week, Hambro Magan had a further meeting with Mr Harry Weblin, chairman of
Liberty, and representatives of the Stewart-Liberty family.
Mr Brian Myerson, said Concerto would now write to Liberty's shareholders
explaining its stance and would seek meetings with institutional investors.
'We belive that a rights issue would put Liberty in a position where it
could grow far more aggressively over the next five years,' he said.
The Myersons started buying shares in Liberty last June and bought a further
14.6 per cent stake in October at a cost of Pounds 10.8m. Mr Myerson said at
the time that he had 'no present intention of bidding' and he repeated the
pledge yesterday.
Two years ago Mr Myerson accumulated shares in Aquascutum before the
upmarket fashion house turned and embraced a recommended bid from Renown,
the Japanese clothing group.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: No advice given on landing slots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID STARKIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your story, 'Commission opposes move to trade airport landing slots'
(January 28), incorrectly stated that we advised the Commission that
airlines should be allowed to buy and sell the rights to land at European
airports. We were asked to report only on practices at US airports;
recommendations for European airports were not part of our brief.
It has to be borne in mind that there exists in Europe a well-developed and
administratively efficient system of allocating landing slots by scheduling
committees. In contrast the equivalent system was not working well when the
buy-sell scheme was introduced in the US in the mid-1980s.
A formal system of trading slots in Europe would require clarification of
the right of airlines to buy and sell slots. Evidence reported recently by
the House of Commons transport committee suggests that airlines do not have
such rights. Of course, slots as saleable commodities are potentially
valuable. A possible way forward might be for the authorities to sanction
the trading of some slots, thus establishing their book value to the
airlines, in return for the release of others for the re-allocation to those
wishing to start new services.

It costs me Pounds 32 in petrol, or about Pounds 44 in marginal costs, to
drive to London and back (460 miles) in a BMW 525i. Yet when my younger
child soon reaches the age of five, it will cost Pounds 390 if we travel
first class by rail, ie in comfort commensurate with the car, or Pounds 590
if we were to take one of the children's grandparents with us.
Costs arising from depreciation, insurance and road tax are barely relevant,
unless the alternative consideration is to have no car at all, as they are
incurred in any event.
In any case, most people mentally write off the cost of car purchase on the
day of purchase, and not against each mile travelled.

THE MONARCHY Central Office of Information HMSO Pounds 5
ROYAL FORTUNE: TAX, MONEY AND THE MONARCHY By Phillip Hall Bloomsbury Pounds
18.99
ELIZABETH R By Antony Jay BBC Books Pounds 14.95
Britain's monarchy has been around since the ninth century. It existed four
centuries before parliament, three centuries before the law courts. So
whoever is on the throne should be used to outbreaks of royal unpopularity.
It comes with the job.
Nevertheless, Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates 40 years on the throne
today, is bound to be conscious that her subjects have become increasingly
vexed of late about the issue of her tax-exempt status. In terms of popular
debate, the question of the Queen's exemption generates far more heat than
equally serious ones such as her support for the honours system, or her role
as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Three new books take up the
issue.
The Monarchy, the Central Office of Information's official handbook on
British royalty, states the position simply: 'As part of the royal
prerogative, the Queen does not pay tax on either her private wealth and
income or her Civil List payments, unless parliament decides otherwise.'
This begs for explanation, particularly since opinion polls show that
three-quarters of the public feel that the Queen should pay tax. Phillip
Hall, a sociology lecturer at a west London college of further education,
does his best to elaborate in Royal Fortune: Tax, Money and the Monarchy.
A big portion of his book 'reveals the long and hitherto hidden history of
royal tax-paying and the devious and secretive ways by which it was brought
to an end'. Of the seven changes in royal tax status since 1910 only two
were made public at the time and one of the crucial files explaining changes
in the king's tax status in the late 1930s was destroyed in 1977.
The thesis is that throughout the 20th century, while more and more people
have been caught in the tax net, British monarchs have lobbied successfully
to escape taxation and to accumulate wealth. The Swedish king pays tax on
his private income, as does the Japanese emperor. Italy ended the Vatican's
tax exemption on its investment income in 1968. According to Hall, the Queen
is Britain's richest person - so why shouldn't she pay her share? Equity
demands that she should, according to Hall.
Partiality harms his case. Despite a heroic trawl through the archives,
Hall's arguments are weakened by his own bias against the monarchy.
When The Economist - which has no obvious anti-monarchical bias - decided to
look into the subject of the Queen's finances, it was taken to task for
suggesting that the Queen's fortune is probably less than Pounds 50m, rather
than more than Pounds 7bn, as is sometimes suggested. The journalist Paul
Foot dismissed the estimate as 'crude establishment disinformation printed
in an establishment newspaper to protect the Queen from (Hall's) critical
book'.
It is tempting to blame outbreaks of royal unpopularity on ill-informed and
ill-disposed members of the media. But, as Antony Jay, author of the
television series Yes Minister, says in Elizabeth R, the press is rather
like the old London mob. 'They may have got hold of the wrong information
and ideas, their demands may be impossible to put into practice and their
methods may be questionable, but the feelings . . . are a reality and it is
dangerous to ignore them.'
The Queen's tax-free life is an example. 'There is something about royal tax
exemption that stirs primitive emotions in the British taxpayer's breast: a
feeling of 'I pay, so why shouldn't she?', which cannot be refuted by
rational argument,' says Jay.
The Queen is not the only public figure with special tax privileges, but she
is the only one who does not pay any income tax or death duties. Clearly,
the tax-free status of her personal fortune is a big perk. But since its
size and rate of growth are unknown, it is impossible to judge the scale of
the privilege.
Jay differs from Hall in his view that the Queen's personal wealth is not in
the same league as the Duke of Westminster's or even the Sainsbury family's.
One way of defusing the controversy would be to release a semi-official
estimate of the Queen's personal wealth. However, putting a figure on the
fortune is complicated by the fact that there is no clear distinction
between what belongs to the state and what is the monarch's own.
Another possibility would be for the Queen to follow the Prince of Wales's
example and pay 25 per cent of income in lieu of tax. But this opens the
issue of whether it would be dignified for the Queen to take steps to
minimise even her voluntary payment. She can hardly go offshore.
And if she starts paying taxes, will she be allowed to vote? In law, the
Queen as a private person can do no wrong. She is immune from civil or
criminal proceedings and cannot be sued. So what happens if there is a
dispute with the tax authorities? Walter Bagehot might turn in his grave,
but perhaps it is time for a Select Committee to look into the whole matter.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: An argument for the environmental balance favouring
diesel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J L GORMEZANO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to David Parker's letter ('Diesel not least polluting', January
28) and to John Griffiths's article ('Technology: diesel cleans up its act',
January 21). Sadly, the use of hydrocarbons fuels results in unwanted
exhaust and evaporative VOC (hydrocarbon Volatile Organic Compound)
emissions. Some emissions are more harmful than others, particularly
benzene, a human carcinogen, present in some HC emissions. Actions to reduce
one type of emission sometimes result in increasing others. The design of a
'clean' engine is therefore a process of optimisation.
Engine environmental performance depends on the way we define 'the
environment'. The current definition consisting of HC, CO, NOx and PM
(particulate matter) is being enlarged to include CO and evaporative VOCs.
So the optimisation point is shifting.
With the notable exception of PM, the environmental performance of
unregulated diesels is far better than that of unregulated petrol engines.
Current 3-way catalysts, which do not work with diesel engines, reduce
petrol engine NOx emissions significantly below those of diesels, but their
HC, CO, CO and evaporative VOC emissions still remain considerably higher
than those of diesel engines.
Diesel engine performance will be further improved with the use of oxidation
catalysts and improved fuel injection systems. As far as CO emissions are
concerned the effect of the slightly higher carbon content of diesel fuel,
less than 2 per cent, is more than offset by the diesel's better fuel
economy, conservatively 10-15 per cent or more.
In the absence of a totally clean engine, the environmental balance favours
the diesel.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALASTAIR MORTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I adjust three impressions conveyed by Lex in its item headlined,
'The Eurotunnel paperchase' (February 5).
First, Eurotunnel did not confirm that there is a plan to issue shares to
the TML contractors. Eurotunnel issued a press release on Tuesday afternoon,
saying: 'The stories in the press are purely speculative.'
Second, Lex says it is 'most unlikely' that Eurotunnel's financial resources
will be adequate to bring the Channel tunnel to opening next year. In fact,
Eurotunnel's directors have informed shareholders that, provided project
progress continues to be acceptable to our bankers, the Pounds 8.9bn
available to us will be substantially more than project costs and interest
payable by opening.
Third, Lex asks if our contractors will 'surrender their right' to money
settlement of their claims. Eurotunnel has a contract with TML: only claims
justified under that contract have the right to be paid. TML has not
justified anywhere near the level of claims put about in the press.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: Pollution could result from radio-link telephones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT LATIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your story 'Radio-link residential telephone service licensed'
(January 30) it was envisaged that 'one million homes could have telephone
aerials on their roofs by early next century'. I have little wish to be a
killjoy, but shouldn't the government investigate how much electromagnetic
energy should be allowed to be carried in our environment?
There must be a limit to the amount of electromagnetic energy we can pump
out before human beings become seriously affected; we cannot be totally
immune from such influences. Do we have to wait until the first effects
become apparent, as we did with sea, river, land and air pollution?
Several years ago as a chief research engineer, I was asked by the Cabinet
Office what I considered to be the most worrying problem for the 1990s and
beyond. I had no hesitation in responding: electromagnetic pollution. Time
has moved on, and we continue to treat our environment as an infinite
absorbing container for electromagnetic emissions. Energy cannot be created
or destroyed; so where is all this electromagnetic energy ending up and how
much is being absorbed by us?
Do we have to repeat past mistakes and incur costly penalties in first
waiting for some unacceptable manifestations to occur?

With Brits at large eagerly poring over advertisements for packaged
holidays, Tynesiders are being invited to plan for something different: a
boxed mystery-trip, which is inevitable.
Taking advantage of the lifting of the ban on funeral advertising, the North
East Co-op is using local radio commercials to plug its Funeral Bond
service, designed for the ultimately tidy-minded. It offers a rich range of
rites, through to such final touches as choice of flowers and coffin-lining,
and the down-payment guarantees no posthumous extra charges.
'Everything moves into action once death occurs,' promises a spokesman,
somewhat equivocally.
Some 2,500 people have bought the bond in its three years' existence, and
the Co-op believes the 'very tasteful' commercials will persuade many others
to follow them. It also apparently believes itself more than usually immune
to the fate its customers are heir to.
Asked how - bearing in mind recessions and whatnot - the company could be
sure it was still around to honour its obligations to the bond-holders, the
spokesman replied: 'We've been here for 100 years, and we don't think
anything's going to change that.'

All clear] South Africa's many fans in the UK business community can come

If BI - which has the backing of the Bank of England and the foreign office

need to feel so embarrassed about thinking up an excuse for a business trip

Rodney Galpin, an old Bank of England hand although now chairman of Standard

to use London as their international gateway.
BI is fielding a middling City side for its first official tour. Morgan

And Commerzbank's Gottfried Bruder will be expected to continue to boast
about why London is so superior as a financial centre to Frankfurt, another

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Besides thoughts of 'there but for the grace of God . . .', the Paddy
Ashdown affair raises questions about the governance of Britain's
newspapers. After all, we've been on probation since the replacement of the
old Press Council by the Press Complaints Commission as the final trial of
self-regulation in the industry.
Set up a year ago, it was recommended by a committee led by Takeover Panel
chief Sir David Calcutt which stipulated that if the press did not put its
own house in order soon, it should be statutorily compelled to. The trouble
is that the committee had in mind statutory measures covering privacy and
the right to reply - notions hard to define, at least in ways compatible
with public freedom of speech.
In the industry itself, the general view is that since the commission was
set up the tabloids have mended their ways. In particular they have tended,
at any rate until very recently, to lay off the Royals (though some have it
that orders handed down to the younger generations to behave themselves in
public have simply resulted in fewer splashable stories).
While electioneering politicians may be a more tempting target - as
Ashdown's example suggests - newspapers still need to think carefully.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Leading Article: One cheer for the MMC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOTOR industry is no doubt suitably relieved by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission's failure to uncover any solid evidence that new car
prices in Britain systematically exceed levels elsewhere in the European
Community. However, the investigation raises enough other awkward questions
about the structure of the UK car market to suggest the need for corrective
action, beyond what the MMC or the government appear ready to consider.
The MMC's most striking finding on prices is the scale of differentials
inside the UK. As it points out, the ability of large fleet operators to
obtain far more generous discounts than private buyers compels the latter,
in practice, to subsidise the former. The inequity lies not in bulk
discounts per se, which are normal in most businesses, but in the fact that
they are the direct result of a distortion created by tax breaks on company
cars. As the MMC report puts it, 'the present tax system disadvantages the
private buyer and screens out a large part of the market from consumer
choice'.
Though recent budgets have reduced tax concessions on the company car, its
continuing popularity suggests they have not yet been eliminated entirely.
As well as adopting the MMC's sensible proposal to abolish the current
'banding' system and relate tax to actual purchase prices, the chancellor
should ensure in the next budget that associated perks such as free
insurance and repairs are fully taxed.
Selective distribution
The report is far less satisfactory when it comes to the selective
distribution system, which permits car manufacturers to choose which dealers
they supply. It proposes some minor modifications, but their effectiveness
remains uncertain, given the failure to address the central issues.
Specifically, the MMC seems to have accepted too readily industry arguments
in favour of the system's supposed benefits to consumers, without attempting
to weigh them against the advantages to be gained from free competition at
the retail level.
Perhaps the MMC was inhibited from inquiring too deeply by the unfortunate
results of its efforts to weaken vertical integration in the brewing
industry. But beer and cars are very different products, with very different
markets. Indeed, the legal basis for selective distribution - a system which
would be regarded as anti-competitive in any other industry - is that cars'
technical sophistication makes them unique products, requiring standards of
service and customer support which only franchised dealers can provide.
Uneven service
However, the much increased reliability of modern cars and the mixed quality
of service provided by many UK franchised dealers raise doubts about the
validity of this proposition. It is disappointing that nowhere in its
1,000-page report does the MMC attempt to question it. This is a serious
omission, all the more so because the issue will be central to the EC's
forthcoming discussions on whether to extend beyond 1995 its exemption of
selective distribution from competition rules. It is to be hoped that the
EC's deliberations will be based on a more rigorous analysis of the system
than the MMC has provided.
The undertaking by Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, to
consider the report's proposal to open the British market freely to Japanese
car imports is welcome. But in the circumstances, it may amount to little
more than a belated gesture of repentance. The British government signed
away to Brussels control over this area of trade policy when it went along
last year with plans to replace national quotas on Japanese car imports with
overall EC restraints.
That would have been the moment to press for unrestricted imports. But
ministers were much more concerned with avoiding output restrictions on
Japanese-owned plants in the UK. Indeed, the prospect of continued
protection of the British market seemed hardly to perturb them. Whether they
will summon up greater determination to fight for free trade now remains an
open question.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Unity hangs on people's will: Ethiopia's stability is again
under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ethiopia's transition from famine, civil war and state socialism to peace
and democracy is uneasily poised between success and violent disintegration.
The interim government, dominated by the rebel Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) which seized power eight months ago,
is attempting to consolidate its position. But it faces increasing
difficulties as a result of its political programme and its failure to stop
Ethiopia's economic decline.
Growing internecine ethnic clashes in the south of the country, open splits
between the political groups which make up the loose coalition government,
increasing economic hardship, opposition from the civil service, and a large
body of disenchanted urban middle-class professionals have all begun to
undermine the government's stability and authority.
Ethiopian political observers and western diplomats are increasingly alarmed
about the government's policy of decentralising power on tribal lines into
what is being termed 'ethnic federalism', and the absence of any serious
economic reform measures.
At the heart of the scepticism lies a concern that the EPRDF, which grabbed
the most powerful cabinet posts in the government when it seized power in
May last year, remains wedded to the outdated, peasant-based, socialist and
ethnic political philosophy it developed over years in isolation in the
bush.
Compounding Ethiopia's difficulties is the legacy of the collapsed regime of
Mr Mengistu Haile Mariam, the former president who ruled for 14 years and
exacerbated an already long-running civil war. The end of the war left
350,000 soldiers waiting to be demobilised, millions of weapons outside
state armories and 20,000-25,000 former officials detained on charges from
genocide to corruption.
It also left the already weak economy in tatters. Between 1988 and the end
of last year income per head declined an average of 3.7 per cent a year. By
the time Mr Mengistu fled in the face of advancing rebels, payments on
servicing Ethiopia's USDollars 3bn foreign debt had reached 76 per cent of
export earnings. Domestic investment and savings had fallen sharply and
inflation had climbed to an annual rate of almost 30 per cent.
'The pressures are enormous,' said one close adviser to President Meles
Zenawi. 'There is only a 50:50 chance that it will all work out.'
The greatest threat to stability is the government's policy of ethnic
federalism which has unleashed potent tribal conflicts that could escalate
into another bout of civil war. When the EPRDF seized power, it convened a
national conference of political and ethnic groups to create a consensus for
a coalition government, a two-and-a-half-year transitional democratic
programme and to hammer out a charter enshrining basic human rights. In the
process, the conference committed Ethiopia to a decentralisation of power on
tribal lines.
The country has been divided into 14 ethnic regions which are scheduled to
hold Ethiopia's first democratic elections in March. Voters will decide the
composition of 14 regional assemblies which will have significant autonomy
over policing, education, language and local taxation.
But in the run-up to the polls, dominant tribes in each area have been
jockeying for power against their minority rivals and fighting has been
intense, particularly in the south. Several thousand lives have been lost in
the past seven months. Villages have also been razed as competing groups try
to seize more land.
President Meles admits that the policy of ethnic federalism is fraught with
'dangers' and 'irrational fall-outs'. But he said that after years of
central government and the oppression of ethnic groups there was no
alternative. 'Ethiopia can be united under one condition - if the people so
desire. Any other attempt is a recipe for civil war.'
However, efforts to broaden the EPRDF beyond its traditionally narrow
political base of the Tigrayan and northern Amhara peoples have failed. It
seems likely that after the elections the country will have about 20 ethnic
political groups but no national political organisation capable of winning
support across them.
Absorbed by this political transformation the government has neglected the
economy. President Meles says his government has already prepared sweeping
revisions of the labour and investment codes, transport sector policy and is
studying how to liberalise trade, restructure the financial system and
dismantle state-owned industries. A government delegation was also due to
sign its first agreement with the World Bank in Washington last week for an
emergency programme which would be worth about USDollars 650m over two
years.
But the government has yet to transform any economic ideas into concrete
measures. Critics say the recently published transitional economic policy
document is too half-hearted in its commitment to the free market.
The pressures released by Mr Meles' takeover of Ethiopia remain formidable.
Without greater speed on economic reform and political consensus-building,
Ethiopia is likely to lose another opportunity to end its sad history of
impoverishment and fratricidal civil war.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S democracy will be healthier when there is no market for stolen
documents relating to the personal lives of leading politicians. That there
is a market, and that the News of the World was apparently regarded by the
thief as a potential buyer, is a sad comment on both the popular press and
the state of mind of some of its readers. In a sane polity the response of
the burglar who found himself in possession of a paper relating to Mr Paddy
Ashdown's brief relationship with a secretary in 1986 would have been bitter
disappointment at having lifted nothing of commercial value.
It may be that the mood of the times is turning against the hypocrisy
inherent in manufacturing 'news' about public figures on the basis of
behaviour which is of solely private significance. If so, the market for
salacious tidbits about persons in the public eye will be diminished. In
France personal liaisons are not deemed to be politically significant; would
