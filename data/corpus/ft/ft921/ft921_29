FT  06 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Save the PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE SOLEY, the shadow housing spokesman, let slip on Tuesday that
Labour was considering changes to the definition of the public sector
borrowing requirement. This would allow Pounds 8bn of local authority
capital receipts to be released for housing without increasing the PSBR. The
Conservative chairman, Mr Chris Patten, immediately accused Labour of
employing 'the Arthur Daley approach to accounting'. The shadow chancellor,
Mr John Smith, categorically denied that Labour would change the definition
to increase public expenditure.
The hapless Mr Soley had little choice but to recant. But he is not the only
member of the shadow cabinet to have expressed an interest in finding a
'cost-free' way of increasing public expenditure. The attractions of
off-balance-sheet financing are manifest for a party which wishes to spend
more on housing, transport and local services while proclaiming its fiscal
responsibility to the markets. Mr Smith is right to resist any attempt to
find a quick fix which would allow a Labour government to give an early
boost to public spending before economic growth provides the resources.
Without Mr Smith's backing as chancellor, there would in any case be little
chance of the Treasury's agreement to such creative accountancy. But there
are merits in regularly reviewing the definitions of the statistics which
are so central to economic management. The failure to distinguish between
current and capital expenditure in the national accounts, for example, is
more than mere semantics.
And since economic performance indicators will be used to judge EC member
states' fitness for monetary union, there is a case for ensuring that
definitions used in the UK are harmonised with those used elsewhere in
Europe. The best way to address issues such as these would be through an
independent review conducted by economists and statisticians without the
benefit of political interference. The Central Statistical Office would be
the appropriate body to carry out such a review.
However, no amount of redefining the figures can create new resources for
politicians to spend. The Pounds 8bn of capital receipts which local
authorities hold following the sale of council houses has been long regarded
in local government as a pot of gold, withheld only by the perversity of the
Treasury. Nothing could be further from the truth: to release more than the
25 per cent which is now permitted to be spent on housing would add to the
PSBR in just the same way as any other addition to government spending.
If more is to be spent from the public purse on housing or any other sort of
public service, it requires a spending decision which is subject to control
and public scrutiny. In the current British context that control can only be
exercised by the Treasury. If he has reminded his colleagues of that basic
truth, Mr Soley is to be congratulated, whatever his lack of prudence in
speaking out of turn.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: A Mongolian fairy story - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URGA (PG) Curzon Mayfair
FOR THE BOYS (15) Odeon West End
DEATH IN BRUNSWICK (15) Metro, Cannons Tottenham Ct Rd and Chelsea
THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE (18) Cannons West End
DOUBLE IMPACT (18) Plaza, Odeon Marble Arch
What do nine men and women living in luxury on an Italian island know about
life in inner Mongolia? Yet last year's Venice Film Festival jury, after
several hours of cosseted deliberation at the Lido's Excelsior Hotel, gave
the Golden Lion for best film to Urga, a French-Soviet movie about a Russian
road-builder's friendship with a Mongolian peasant.
Cinema - this is a long-established Andrews Theory - can make us believe
anything. Consider this praised film by Nikita Mikhalkov of Oblomov and Dark
Eyes. How do we know that the picturesque story of Sergei and Gombo, who
meet when Sergei's truck drives into a lake and he finds help and
hospitality with the tent-dwelling Gombo and his family, intersects with
ethnographic truth at any point?
We are all the more gullible because the film is so mischievously
enthralling. The horror of the outsider at the Easterners' methods of food
preparation. (These include using a knife to give a live sheep a slow
puncture while he and we watch.) The peasant daughter's improbable
virtuosity with an accordion. The city-reared wife's demand that the tent be
stocked with condoms and a TV. The drunken uncle Bagartou. And Gombo's own
expertise with the titular 'urga', a hunting device comprising a long pole
with an adjustable noose.
How do we know that the word 'urga' and its definition have not stolen in
from a Call My Bluff programme? (No doubt the use and practice of an urga is
called urganomics.) In short, are the details of this film true or false and
which of us will journey to Mongolia to find out?
I am not being merely frivolous. Ever since cinema opened up the world to us
as no art form has done before, we have been caught on the hook of the
proverb 'seeing is believing.' Our senses cannot lie; we see remote
civilisations recorded by the camera; ergo, we must believe it is all true.
Yet deep down the appeal of Urga lies not in our certainty of its
authenticity but in our uncertainty. How much is it having us on? After the
National Geographical prelude on the plains, Sergei and Gombo travel to town
where a series of shaggy-dog episodes occupy the movie's second half. Gombo
shops, has a ride at a funfair and visits a doleful priest at a shrine.
('You have problems?' says the priest; 'so do I'). Sergei gets drunk, sings
sentimental Russian songs in a dance-hall and is arrested. A Chopin-playing
friend in a dinner jacket comes to bail him out.
Finally we are back on the plains, where the resting Gombo's precious TV
sits on a grassy slope gazing out at a grassy infinity. This is not
ethnography, it is surrealism with scenery. Urga's great virtue, amid the
waving seas of green and the bucolic or bustling horizons, is its virtual
silence. No pat wisdoms are dispensed by Mikhalkov about inter-ethnic
accord; no laboured exposition is offered about contrary lifestyles.
Instead the film has a puffball tragicomic fragility. The fairy-tale
encounter, and its pollen-blown continuation in the town, outlines a world
where loving brotherhood lies in tolerant mutual incomprehension. Enough
that we as human beings share the basic needs: food, sex, survival. The rest
is a vast human comedy, infinitely varied and infinitely elusive according
to our different backgrounds.
*****
Watching For The Boys is like being dragged gagged and silent through a
hundred Hollywood story conferences. This 2 1/2 -hour vaudeville with tears
stars Bette Midler and James Caan as two troupers who keep going off to
entertain the troops. Second World War, Korea, Vietnam: we suffer with them
through it all. And yet we still have enough energy at the end of the film
to walk out of the cinema, hail a cab and collapse whimpering onto its back
seat. Directed by Mark Rydell of The Rose, this new Midler vehicle wears the
sign 'customised by committee'. Three screenwriters co-penned it, five
producers co-produced it and the strain of trying to fit so many episodes
and emotions inside one piece of bodywork tells from the start.
We first meet our heroine in old age. At least we assume that is her
condition. Wearing heavily wattled make-up and no eyebrows, Midler resembles
a Munchkin who has been in a road accident. Happily we soon flashback to the
glory years, where we try to work out why James Caan is the toast of the
American variety scene when he neither sings well nor tells good jokes.
Midler, joining him as a callow youngster, gooses up the act, but still not
enough to stop us puzzling over phrases like 'the new Burns and Allen' or
'bigger than Hope and Crosby.'
But then this film started falling from a great height without a parachute
early on. What begins as breezy inanity develops into free-fall idiocy. When
the couple visit Vietnam to see Midler's darling son, what would you expect
but that the Vietcong attack in mid-cabaret and Junior is soon a
shrapnel-perforated statistic on the muddy ground? Cue Pieta position and
Oscar-pleading grief from Midler.
Is a film like this cynical or innocent? Mistaken question. In Hollywood the
two conditions are synonymous. While making a play for the box-office by
packing in every saleable theme and feeling, stars and studios can still
believe they are offering genuine dramatic goods. The enthusiasm has to be
respected. One admires Caan and Midler's commitment even while one wishes
they could be committed. And whenever it is allowed to put down its
handkerchief, For The Boys can be quite funny. No movie is dismissable that
contains the following chat-up exchange. Man in bar: 'What would I have to
give you for a little kiss?' Girl: 'Chloroform.'
*****
The Australian film Death In Brunswick is a wonderful flyblown black comedy.
Everything about fortyish Carl (Sam Neill) spells loser: from his house in
suburban Melbourne with its yellow water and exploding gas-heater to his new
job as a short order cook in a sleazy nightclub. Then there is mother, a
sort of genteel live-in stick insect. She chain-smokes, chain-nags and
chain-listens to Mahler on her son's gramophone. And she is appalled when
Carl arrives home one night covered in filth after burying the immigrant
kitchen hand he has accidentally killed with a fork . . .
This fastidiously helpless, very funny film is a first feature from John
Ruane. Ruane seized an unpublished novel by Boyd Oxlade and co-adapted it
with the author, drafting in Sam Neill to give a performance we never
thought him capable of.
Playing an over-the-hill leather boy, Neill has quiet desperation written
all through him, using the wrinkles in his brow as letters. His last bid for
youth is a fling with the nightclub's 19-year-old Greek immigrant bar-girl
(Zoe Carides). His latest bid for self-destruction is the fracas with the
kitchen hand, which yields the film's funniest scene. Carl and his
gravedigger chum Dave must dispose of the cadaver, making room for it in a
grave where they must do things to the mouldering corpse already resident
that Carl would not do even to - well, to his own mother. (He has sleeping
pills saved up for her.)
This comedy of frayed nerves and strained tethers reaches the end of its own
rope earlier than it should. There is a time limit on the laughs you can
extract from a life going threadbare. But for at least an hour its rueful
rhythms are a joy and for actor Sam Neill life has clearly begun at forty.
*****
Life has a hard time beginning at all in The Pleasure Principle and Double
Impact. The first is an Alfie-style sex comedy written and directed by
first-time film-maker David Cohen and funded by his local bank. Peter Firth
dashes about between the sheets and Haydn Gwynne, Lynsey Baxter and Lysette
Anthony are the girls trying to keep up his interest. Routine plot,
flattered by good performances.
Double Impact is two hours of Hong Kong chop socky featuring martial arts
star Jean-Claude Van Damme. It should never have escaped from the video
market, although it creates some picturesque mayhem now that it has. Sheldon
Lettich directs.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: Ballet du Nord - Sadler's Wells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ballet du Nord is a medium-size company based in Roubaix. From its
inception in 1983 it reflected the artistic lineage of its founder-director
Alfonso Cata, who danced with New York City Ballet, but had also experienced
the madcap ways of the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, of blessed and
slightly improbable memory. Cata educated his dancers with Balanchine - and
also more exotic fare - and led his troupe round the world to considerable
acclaim, paying visits to regional theatres in this country. On his death a
year ago, the Ballet du Nord gained Jean-Paul Comelin as director, and he
has now brought the company for its first London visit. I wish I could
report that the programme chosen for this week at Sadler's Wells showed the
troupe at its best. Balanchine's Apollo must always hold the stage in
splendour, even when given - as here - a somewhat fidgety interpretation,
but neither Jose Limon's There is a time nor M. Comelin's realisation of the
Mozart Requiem, which completed the bill, bear any serious contemplation.
There is a time looks like the death-throes of traditional American dance.
Made in 1956 by one of the greatest modern dancers, it proposes a sequence
of emotional studies in which joy, grief, reaping and sowing, and the
tedious paraphernalia of life, love and death, are exposed in exquisitely
naif little scenas. There is an ingratiating score by Norman dello Joio that
challenges you not to love its home-spun predictabilities. The dancers wear
costumes that make them look as if they are in search of an audition for
Shakespearean peasantry. They scamper, form rings, laugh (and are terrible,
as The Immortal Hour so acutely observed). Given with the physical weight
and purpose that marked Limon's own performance - his style owed much to the
intensities of Doris Humphrey, pioneer of American dance - There is a time
might still make sense, but it demands a way of moving unknown to
ballet-trained artists today. Ecclesiastes may not have mentioned it, but
there is a time to leave old dance pieces alone. And it is now.
About M. Comelin's Requiem I speak with the reluctance of anyone asked to
comment upon some merry soul attempting to climb the Matterhorn on a
pogo-stick. That M. Comelin sees Mozart as a suitable basis for gymnastic
exercises - and not particularly adventurous ones - is a first problem. That
he peoples the stage with women in dull nightdresses and men in underpants
(sagging haunches abound) is a further matter for concern. That the movement
vocabulary relies upon repetition of dull little sequences which contrive to
make the dancers look foolish, was, I found, a final noxious touch. The Wren
orchestra, a chorus and soloists were also involved in this outbreak of
kitsch religiosity. Send not to know for whom the bell tolls - it tolls for
them all.

<TEXT>
On one side of the stage is a bargain-basement sax player who thinks he can
fly like the Bird; on the other, a burnt-out jazzman hallucinates about his
glory days, in a council-sponsored guesthouse where his saxophone rusts away
under the bed. Just how the younger Morgan could have turned into the older
one is the gist of Paul Sirett's surprisingly touching new play.
I say surprisingly because, on several counts, Sirett sets himself pretty
tough odds. The jazz club setting, centred around Morgan's quartet, creates
basic practical problems, only partially answered, of finding actors who can
play and players who can act. Then there is the plotline, which unfolds like
a medley of trad cliches: a musician coming to terms with mediocrity;
ill-starred romance between sober black saxophonist and drunken white
vocalist; artistic paralysis following some sort of life crisis.
They are all familiar themes, which Sirett gleefully pushes into genuinely
unexpected variations, forcing us - as does all good theatre  - to
re-examine our preconceptions and question our ability to judge on a given
body of evidence. We are, for instance, given three valuations of the young
Morgan. His own fear is that his playing is second-rate, his girlfriend
Gillian thinks it is dated, while the club owner believes he is the best
thing since bebop.
The torment of the older Morgan is fired by his compulsion to order this
cacophony of voices from the past into a cogent account of what went wrong
and, even more difficult to face, what might have gone right had he not,
literally and metaphorically, gone into a skid. One minute he takes refuge
in fantasy, informing his concerned Pakistani neighbour in the most
excitable terms, that he once played with Miles Davis; the next minute, he
dismisses the story as lies.
You realise how well Sirett and the older Morgan, Doyle Richmond, have been
playing together when the thoughtless confiscation of his saxophone by a
social worker becomes a genuinely tragic moment, observed only by the
Pakistani (Shobu McAuley), who no-one listens to, and Morgan, who cannot
speak.
Richmond creates a character who combines frailty and confusion with a
commanding dignity. Alan Cooke, as his younger self, deals attractively and
ably with the high of the early scenes but is less convincing on the low
notes, and I found it hard to believe in the self-destructiveness of Ruth
McKenzie's pole-straight and ever-elegant Gillian. Through all, under Jeff
Teare's moody direction, the band plays on - a lugubrious lot whose
down-beat presence tides this moving play over the occasional musical
anachronism.

Despite the popularity of ITV's soap opera built around a London police
station, The Bill (8.00) and its Scottish detective series Taggart (9.00),
each normally capable of capturing 15 or 16 million viewers, there seems
little doubt that tonight's biggest attraction will be Elizabeth R on BBC1
(8.00). Covering a year in the life of the Queen, it comes 21 years after
Richard Cawston's seminal documentary 'Royal Family' which, for the first
time, provided an informal portrait of the royals and was watched by nearly
40 million people. Today's programme has been made by Edward Mirzoeff to
mark the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne. It shows
formal and informal aspects of her life: an audience with John Major, a
state banquet for Lech Walesa, but also moments relaxing with her
grandchildren in one or other of her homes - Sandringham, Windsor and so on.
Also at 8.00, BBC2 starts Episode 2 of its series Redundant. John, who was
earning Pounds 50,000 as a regional sales manager for Everest Double Glazing
in 1988, has been out of work for more than three years. He has debts of
Pounds 170,000, has applied for over 200 jobs, but feels the good times may
be gone for ever.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Technology: Olympic forecasts win gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA CASASSUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the biggest worries about sporting events is that the weather may not
co-operate. At the Winter Olympic Games, which begins on Saturday in
Albertville, France, a new forecasting system should remove uncertainty
about what is in store for competitors over the next two weeks.
Meteo-France is launching a computerised forecasting model which will offer
more accurate information than previously possible. The Super-Peridot system
will reduce the distance between measuring points from 150 kms on the global
statistical model Emeraude to 3.5 kms.
Twenty-three Miria automatic weather stations have been set up around the
region at altitudes ranging from 333 metres to 3,582 metres to register wind
speed and direction, temperature, humidity, precipitation and pressure.
Calculations are made every four minutes and are taken from 30 levels to
take account of the effect the relief has on wind and other factors. This
compares with 15 or 20 levels for other systems.
The information is gathered from the stations by the weather centre in
Lyon-Bron and relayed to the control centre in Albertville either by the
European satellite Meteosat or the Transpac packet-switched data network.
They are then transmitted for processing by Meteo-France's Cray II
supercomputer in Toulouse.
When the French meteorological office started work on the system five years
ago it faced a difficult task. 'The Savoie region is complicated
geophysically, since every valley has a micro-climate,' explained
Meteo-France engineer Georges Dhonneur. Moreover, the Games will be spread
over nine sites, compared with only three in 1988.
Greater precision offered by the system would be useful for agriculture,
pollution control, power supply, civil aviation and yacht races among other
applications. 'We say that every franc invested in weather forecasting gives
a return of FFr165 by preventing losses,' Dhonneur said.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Labour says it is
being sold short Financial services - John Authers investigates claims,
counter claims and allegations of scare tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's 'tax bombshell' has been a boon for the marketing brains teams of
the financial services industry. The Conservative onslaught on Labour's
proposals has done a lot of the work for them.
'Act now to beat the tax man,' urges Abbey Life, the life assurance group in
a circular to customers. It goes on to warn: 'It is no secret that a future
Labour government would abolish a number of the tax planning opportunities
that currently exist'.
Hardly surprisingly, such tactics have not pleased the Labour party.
Earlier this week, Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's city spokesperson, complained
to Lautro, the industry's regulator, claiming that Abbey was trying to
'panic customers into making important financial decisions on the basis of
unfounded speculation about what a future Labour government would do'.
Abbey Life hotly denies that the letter was a scare tactic. Every February
it sends out letters about tax-planning to alert clients about the Budget
and the end of the tax year - traditionally the 'harvest season' for the
financial services industry.
Abbey says the letter was not politically biased and adds that many other
companies had used similar tactics.
Mowlam may not be convinced by the first bit, but she will probably accept
that Abbey is not the only offender. Most of the industry has been using the
spectre of a Labour government to chivvy investors into various politically
sensitive investments.
One advertisement from Murray Johnstone Investment Trusts says 'Elect for a
PEP . . . While you've still got a vote]' It goes on to say: 'Another
general election is coming - and one of the parties has already announced
that it may abolish all future PEPs as soon as they take over the reins of
office'.
Another advertisement, from the brokers Hargreaves Lansdown, carries the
words 'What if . . . a major upset to your investments?', next to a
photograph of Neil and Glenys Kinnock outside No 10, Downing Street.
There are no specific rules on political bias in financial advertising. The
Securities and Investments Board says that all advertisements should be
adequate and fair and inform customers of the risks involved. The finer
details are delegated to self-regulatory organisations, such as Lautro.
Many investment managers and advisers have published guides to pre-election
tax-planning. General enquiries are up from last year, but sales have not
yet increased significantly. Over the next two months, marketeers will try
to convert vague political neuroses into hard sales.
This affects not only advertising and promotional material, but also product
design. One of the most sweeping tax reliefs now available is the
tax-efficient Personal Equity Plan.
Thanks to an obscure tax loophole, investors can benefit most from
investment trust shares (popular with small savers) - if they move the
shares to a PEP within 42 days of the launch of the trust. With the election
due soon after the end of the tax year, fund managers scent rich pickings.
Several fund managers are now floating investment trusts, timed so that
investors can put the shares into a PEP both this tax year and next. The
timing is deliberate.
The most striking launch comes from M&amp;G, the UK's largest unit trust
manager, which is spending Pounds 3m on promoting its new Recovery
Investment Trust. It expects to raise Pounds 300m, but is prepared to accept
'considerably more'.
M&amp;G's launch has all the trappings of privatisation campaigns - mailshots
have been sent to 4m homes and around Pounds 500,000 is being spent on
television advertising.
The launch closes on March 27, the latest possible date to allow investors
to put money into PEPs for both this tax year and next. This timing has
brought complaints from some brokers that the launch is marketing-led and
does not make investment sense.
M&amp;G denies this and points to the strong long-term performance of its
Recovery unit trust.
According to Bryan Jennings of M&amp;G: 'Our view is that this is the right
thing to do in investment terms. But the 2-year PEP element is
marketing-led. That is an opportunity given us by the political situation.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Telephone selling
plan on the line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A draft proposal placing severe restrictions on the use of telephones, faxes
and other electronic devices to market goods and services, has fallen by the
wayside in its passage through the European Commission.
The now-junked 'distance selling' directive would have required prior
consumer consent before a company could approach the customer via any form
of electronic communication.
That would probably have rendered many forms of currently legitimate UK
business activity both more expensive and cumbersome.
Some in the direct marketing field argue that it would have doomed their
activities entirely.
The scheme was rejected on January 23 and is unlikely to re-surface without
substantial liberalising changes. According to the UK Advertising
Association, the distance selling directive has 'fallen victim' to the
Maastricht agreement on subsidiarity.
This promulgated the principle that legislation should be implemented by the
lowest level of government.
But one important implication of the rethink is that the equally restrictive
draft on data protection - which closely reflects the German practice of
severely curtailing the gathering of personal information - is also likely
to fail to win approval.
Direct marketing of all forms, including distance selling, in the UK
accounted for some Pounds 1.86bn of advertising expenditure in 1990, while
direct mail agencies grew by 17 per cent during a year when advertising
generally was in steep decline.
The Advertising Association is claiming that it and its fellow European
lobbyists have brought about a sea-change in the thinking of EC officials,
weaning them off an inclination towards heavily-protective consumer
legislation.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Business Law: Capital structures threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEIRDRE CURTIN and JOHN DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A legislative sword of Damocles hangs over the share capital structures of
many substantial EC companies. The companies affected are those with dual or
multiple class share structures providing for non-voting, restricted or
multiple voting shares.
The threat is in the European Commission's draft Fifth Company Law
Directive, in the form of a proposal to introduce a mandatory 'one share,
one vote' system of proportionality. Although first tabled in 1972, little
attention has been paid to this aspect of the draft directive. Now, however,
it appears that the Council of Ministers may reach a political agreement or
'common position' on the issue during the next 12 months.
Before the sword falls, enfranchising non-voting shareholders overnight and
effectively disappropriating the property of others, it is worth examining
the legality under Community law of a mandatory 'one share, one vote'
proposal.
The mandatory impact of the proposed Directive appears to threaten such
veteran Community law principles as proportionality and respect for acquired
property rights, as well as the principle that legislation should not impose
burdens on individuals retroactively.
If adopted in its current form, article 33 of the draft would oblige public
limited companies throughout the EC (and possibly throughout the larger
European Economic Area) to respect the principle of 'one share, one vote'.
Currently, the only exception is for certain kinds of genuine preference
shares. The main concern from a legal standpoint is that it purports to
cover the share capital structure of all public limited companies
irrespective of when or how their capital structures were established and
not just those which come into existence after the Directive has been
adopted.
The Commission's political will on this issue has hardened over the years.
It started from the premise that equity and modernity required a Community
standard of 'one share, one vote' on the basis that it would facilitate the
reduction of any 'democratic deficit' in a company's shareholding.
However, as part of the takeover package proposed by Commissioner Bangemann
in 1990, the Commission tabled amendments to the proposed Directive,
including article 33, with the aim of creating a level-playing field for
takeovers within the EC.
The Commission's philosophy now seems to be that the principle of 'one
share, one vote' enhances its takeover package because it facilitates
transfers of control. Non-voting, restricted voting or multiple voting
shares, it argues, can make transfers of control and, in particular, hostile
takeover bids, more difficult because they allow a concentration of votes in
certain hands.
The Commission's views are also incorporated in the current proposal for a
Council Regulation introducing the Statute for a European Company ('Societas
Europeas'), which includes parallel provisions prohibiting restrictions on
voting rights.
This Regulation could well be adopted during 1992, thereby creating a
precedent for the draft Fifth Directive.
However, the approach of the Commission to share voting proportionality may
be questionable. First, unequal voting rights are not necessarily
inconsistent with the principle of corporate democracy.
Investors who are given a choice between voting and non-voting shares may
choose the latter because they are more interested in the investment
potential than they are in voting rights. The acquisition of shareholdings
in a company consists of a series of contractual relationships freely
entered into by economic players in a market to maximise their joint
welfare.
Secondly, the Commission's implicit equating of non-voting, restricted
voting or multiple voting shares with defensive tactics in response to the
threat of takeovers may require further thought.
It needs to take account of the historical perspective which shows that many
companies have had multiple class share structures for several generations,
long before hostile takeovers became common.
Moreover, differential share structures can be seen as attempts to maintain
control of the company in the light of additional equity financing rather
than attempts to prevent outsiders from taking over the company.
It has also not been clearly established how far the introduction of the
principle of 'one share, one vote' would in fact contribute to achieving the
objective of a level playing field in the EC given the many other obstacles
which exist.
Even if the gains were significant, it is questionable whether the objective
is important enough to justify undoing the balance of established
contractual relationships in a company's capital structure.
This is a crucial point from the perspective of Community law. If it cannot
be established that the means chosen (introduction of the principle of 'one
share, one vote') are both appropriate and necessary to attain the objective
of a level playing field then a fundamental principle of Community law, the
principle of proportionality, will not be respected.
However, the draft article 33 also raises other concerns under Community
law. As currently worded, the article requires existing companies to adjust
their share structures to respect the 'one share, one vote' principle
irrespective of when or how those structures were established. Therefore, it
disrupts existing legal situations created by the company's statutes on
which shareholders based their decisions to invest in the company.
Inevitably, existing voting shareholders in those companies affected will
find the value of their shareholdings dramatically diluted overnight and
non-voting shareholders will be likewise automatically enfranchised when
their original contractual bargain did not provide for voting rights.
It is this element of disappropriation which may further taint the current
formulation of article 33. It is, arguably, in breach of both the acquired
property and other rights of a defined class of shareholders in a manner
incompatible with Community law.
Any resolution of this problem would necessarily involve payment of
compensation to the holders of the voting shares for their dilution of
voting power. This issue is not yet addressed in the draft Directive and
presumably the intention is to leave it for EC countries to resolve when
they implement the provisions of the Directive into national law.
If so, it will be up to each country to choose, at its discretion, whether
and how to deal with it. This could lead to differences in treatment between
EC states. If a state does act then - quite apart from the extraordinarily
difficult computation problems in finding a solution of universal
application which puts a value on company 'control' - it will have to decide
who should pay the compensation.
One possible solution would be for the compensation to come from the holders
of the enfranchised shares. However, any attempt to implement compensation
along these lines will give rise to a host of other, equally difficult,
problems since it would be asking enfranchised shareholders to pay for
something they do not necessarily want.
Finally, Community legislation should not impose burdens and obligations on
individuals retroactively. The proposed article 33 would do this. This
general principle is embodied in the legal systems of most EC states and
therefore forms part of the Community legal order. It is inspired by the
principle of legal certainty as well as the requirements of the rule of law.
The exception to this principle which to date has been applied by the
European Court of Justice is where the purpose to be achieved by the
legislation clearly requires it. The requirements of 'public interest' are
material here and the legitimate expectations of those concerned must be
duly respected. Neither of those criteria are fulfilled in the case of the
proposed article 33.
To avoid the legal consequences of the effects of expropriation and
retroactivity, the proposed Directive should make some provision for
'grandfathering'. This would allow companies which already have non-voting,
restricted voting and multiple voting share structures to continue with them
and to make further share issues.
That done, the answer to the question of whether the Community should apply
a rigid 'one share, one vote' principle for the future to companies which
are not grandfathered should depend on establishing that it is an
appropriate means of achieving a level playing field for takeovers in the
EC.

Accounts
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCREPANCIES in the accounts of the Insolvency Services Agency of the
Department of Trade and Industry, responsible for overseeing liquidations
and bankruptcies, were caused by faulty computer systems, the public
accounts committee heard yesterday.
The report on the agency's accounts indicated a difference of Pounds 13.3m
between balances in different records was discovered during a changeover of
computer systems in 1989.
Mr Peter Joyce, the agency's chief executive and inspector general, said the
errors occurred because of manual reconciliation of two different systems.
The shortfall has now been reduced to Pounds 133,000. Mr Joyce said the
difference could not necessarily be eliminated entirely.
MPs criticised the agency for not planning its information technolology
strategy adequately.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mellor attack on PSBR proposals -
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY frontbenchers yesterday sought to exploit uncertainty about Labour's
plans for redefining the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the
wake of the apparent climbdown over capital receipts by Mr Clive Soley, the
party's housing spokesman.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour was claiming
to have 'discovered the political philosopher's stone'.
The capital receipts had already been counted as negative public
expenditure, he said. 'If the spending has to be made, the money has to be
raised, and no amount of creative accounting will obscure that fact.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, turned his guns on Mr John
Prescott, his opposite number in the shadow cabinet, who he said had
'recently dismissed the prevailing Treasury rules on public borrowing as
'stupid''.
Labour's transport spokesman claimed to have the backing of Mr John Smith,
the shadow chancellor, to change those rules, Mr Rifkind continued. 'The
travelling public are entitled to an explanation. They need to know whether
this really is agreed Labour policy, or just another example of a promise
made 'on the hoof'.'
Mr Prescott's office confirmed that he had secured clearance from the party
leadership for two specific Treasury rule changes, in connection with a
proposal to allow British Rail to lease badly needed commuter trains for
Network SouthEast.
The changes would ease restrictions on the sources of British Rail's
borrowings and remove the need to include the entire capital cost of the
trains in the PSBR in the first year of the leasing period.
The proportion of the capital cost paid back in any given year under the
terms of the lease would, however, count for PSBR purposes, Mr Prescott's
office said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of beneficiaries of profit-sharing schemes and discretionary
share option schemes fell in the year to March 31 1991, according to Inland
Revenue statistics.
Only the number in a third government scheme, the savings-related share
option, increased during 1990-91, although the total number of all three
types of schemes approved by the Revenue rose during the period.
The number of employees allocated shares under profit-sharing schemes fell
by 20,000 to 900,000. The initial value of the shares allocated fell by
Pounds 20m to Pounds 410m. The total number of schemes approved rose by 72
to 880.
The number granted options under discretionary share option schemes, which
give selected employees the right to buy shares, fell by 35,000 to 65,000.
The initial value of the shares over which options were granted fell Pounds
420m to Pounds 1.4bn. The number of schemes approved rose by 395 to 4,121.
The number of employees granted options under savings-related share options
rose by 80,000 to 540,000, representing an increase in the initial value of
Pounds 380m to Pounds 1.4bn. The number of schemes approved rose by 81 to
804.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Sleight of hand brings forth economic sense: A Labour
suggestion that could produce a crock of gold from the PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS LABOUR thinking of using smoke and mirrors to mask the cost of the
transport, housing and other infrastructural policies many of its spokesmen
and women would like to implement?
The party has lately shown much ingenuity in devising 'cost-free' schemes
for achieving specific policy goals - for example, it proposes to trade part
of the government's stake in the two non-nuclear electricity generating
companies for control of the National Grid.
Critics might say this week's suggestion that the party would like to
redefine the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) smacks of an even
greater desire for Labour to have its cake and eat it.
For all its newly found rigour in economic management, Labour still harbours
deep desires to increase public expenditure - and is attracted by
'off-balance-sheet' financing as a way of paying for it.
The specific proposal alluded to on Tuesday by Mr Clive Soley, the party's
housing spokesman, is for Labour to exclude from the definition of
public-sector borrowing the recycling into housing investment of
local-authority capital receipts from the sale of council houses. That would
provide a crock of gold to fund an expansion in house building and repairs
which Labour councils are itching to launch to help kick-start the economy.
Any intention to change the definition of PSBR was later denied by the
party, which attempted to portray it as a gaffe by a junior spokesman. But
it has the support of several frontbench spokesmen.
Many policy advisers see the present rules as unnecessarily restricted,
particularly in relation to borrowing for public-expenditure projects that
would yield a stream of revenue to service the debt.
Other changes - including separating current spending from capital
investment for PSBR purposes - are also being assessed. A range of options
for improving the access of public bodies such as British Rail and local
authorities to private funding outside the PSBR is being explored.
Labour is quick to insist that its intentions for the public accounts are
not linked in any way to its spending proposals - real or illusory.
Yet the party's argument would be more convincing if it had been able on
Tuesday to agree its reasons for thinking some changes are necessary. Is it
to make the figures more accurately reflect what is happening in the
underlying economy or to make UK practice conform with Europe and North
America?
The latter may be a necessary step for any government in the aftermath of
the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union. Among the
terms for monetary union is a condition that 'general government borrowing'
should not exceed 3 per cent of GDP. That definition of public borrowing is
more restrictive than that of the PSBR - it excludes borrowing for
commercial operations, for example.
If the UK is not to be more severely constrained than other EC countries by
the terms for monetary union, a redefinition of the PSBR may be necessary,
regardless of the party in power.
There are other good reasons for bringing British public accounting
practices into closer harmony with international standards.
A recent report by Arthur Andersen, the audit and business advisory group,
argues that UK investment is low in comparison with its European
counterparts and that UK government debt is among the lowest in Europe.
The report suggests that an audit based on commercial accounting principles
would show that the case for lifting government borrowing to finance
investment appeared stronger in Britain than elsewhere. That view would
certainly be music to the ears of politicians seeking to increase public
expenditure.
So, too, is the notion of distinguishing in the public accounts current
spending (bad) from capital investment (good).
The attractions of such reforms of public accounts are not limited to Labour
politicians. They might have great appeal to the present government as it
increases the PSBR to improve public services. If the change could be
attributed to a need for harmonisation in the EC, so much the better.
In short, a sound case for public-accounts reform could be constructed by
whomsoever resolved to grasp the nettle.
Skilfully deployed, that could provide a strong defence against charges of
cooking the books for political advantage, although under present
circumstances changes would look remarkably expedient.

FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Disabled quota not being met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY ONE government department out of a total of 29 is meeting a quota of 3
per cent for the employment of registered disabled people, official figures
published yesterday show.
The Civil Service is not bound by the same law that requires other employers
to meet the quota but says it tries to meet the standard voluntarily. About
22 per cent of employers overall are estimated to meet the quota.
The figures show that 3.2 per cent of the Department of Employment's
workforce is registered disabled. The overall average for government
departments is 1.4 per cent.
The analysis, published by the Department of Employment in Employment
Gazette, also shows that only 12 district councils in England and Wales out
of 366, and none of 47 county councils or 33 London boroughs, meet the
quota. In Scotland, two districts out of 53, but none of the nine regional
or three island councils meet the 3 per cent figure.
Other nationalised and public authorities not meeting the quota, according
to the figures are the BBC, BR, the Civil Aviation Authority, British Coal
and the Post Office.
The government says the figures are distorted because many disabled people
prefer not to register. It added that the number of disabled people had
declined and it was no longer possible for organisations to meet the 3 per
cent quota.

FT  06 FEB 92 / High rate of poll tax court calls reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN one in five of poll tax payers in Labour-controlled boroughs have
received summonses for non-payment, three in four of which have led to court
liability orders, according to a survey of 21 district councils.
The survey, published yesterday by the Local Government Information Unit,
was confined to Labour councils in England. It confirms a report last year
by the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, which found that 21
per cent of poll tax payers required a summons before paying.
According to the survey, conducted between April 1990 and September 1991,
summonses were issued against 442,000 of the nearly 2m poll tax payers
covered by the councils; 77 per cent resulted in liability orders.
Fewer than one in 10 of those summoned had paid their tax in full before
their cases came to court, while 86 per cent of liability orders were being
pursued by bailiffs at the time of the survey.
Reading district, one of those surveyed, summoned 34,000 of its 98,000 poll
tax payers in the 1990-91 financial year, with liability orders made against
30,000 - up from 26,000 in the first year of the tax. About one in seven of
the orders applied to those paying only 20 per cent of the tax - mostly
students or those on income support - who make up a tenth of the boroughs'
charge payers.
'The administrative costs of recovering money from those paying at the
reduced rate are out of all proportion to the sums involved,' said Mr Peter
Innes, the borough treasurer.

THE Coalfield Communities Campaign, a local-authority pressure group,
yesterday called for European Community subsidies to keep the UK coal
industry alive.
The group wants a moratorium on pit closures while ways are found to support
the industry.
MEPs with coalmining interests have joined forces with the local authorities
in seeking a moratorium on closures in the face of continued threats of more
closures.
Mr Stephen Fothergill, the campaign's national director, said: 'UK mining
communities deserve a breathing space and the miners themselves deserve
recognition for their magnificent achievement in doubling production.'
This is the last full year before the expiry of a contract between the
electricity generators and British Coal, which gave the industry a
guaranteed market.
There is concern that the end of the contract will lead to a switch to coal
imports.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Business site plan for Black Country
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Black Country Development Corporation announced plans yesterday to
establish a manufacturing and business focus on a 250-acre site at
Wednesbury, north-east of Birmingham.
The state-funded body, which has the task of regerating one of the UK's most
depressed areas, said it was negotiating with Sandwell Borough Council to
buy the 93 acres of land that were once the Patent Shaft steelworks, which
closed in 1979.
Completion of negotiations, or compulsory acquisition through a
parliamentary vesting order, would complete the assembly of land for the
business area and make the site the largest available for development in the
Black Country.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, has said he would consider
a vesting order, a measure which, after parliamentary debate, permits
transfer of land from one public body to another.
Sandwell has already designated the land at Wednesbury as suitable for
business use. The decision of the development corporation to purchase Patent
Shaft means that plans for a retail and leisure centre have been abandoned.
Speyhawk Land and Estates, the London property group, has outline planning
approval for such a centre, but its plans have been set back by a
combination of financial troubles, the collapse of the commercial property
market and the development of the nearby Merry Hill shopping centre.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES and offices re-opened in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas
yesterday, one day after an attempted coup d'etat was crushed by military
units loyal to the government of President Carlos Andres Perez. However,
many Venezuelans, still shocked by the attempted coup, formed long queues to
buy extra supplies of food and petrol.
The uprising, in which about 150 army officers and over 1,000 enlisted men
participated, left as many as 78 people dead, most of them civilians caught
in crossfire.
General Fernando Ochoa Antich, Venezuela's minister of defence, said 133
officers and 953 enlisted men had been arrested.
The rebel Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement for National Salvation was
unhappy with the course of Venezuela's modern history and the divergence
from the ideals advanced by Simon Bolivar, the father of Venezuela's
revolution, Gen Ochoa Antich said.
While it is not clear what kind of a government the rebels would have
installed if successful, it appears that the officers were not only
concerned over the country's economic and social problems, corruption, and
the image of the armed forces. They were also highly motivated by an
ideological attachment to Bolivar's notions on democracy and the state.
One detained coup leader, Lt Col Francisco Arias, said the rebels sought to
'rescue the Venezuelan people from politicians, from demagoguery and
bureaucracy.'
The general public offered no support to the rebels on the day of the
uprising. However, public opinion polls regularly show that Venezuelans are
unhappy with the country's current situation and are particularly opposed to
the government's economic reform programme.
Publicly, administration officials said there would be no witch hunts
against the military. But the fact that leaders of the attempted coup,
including Lt Col Arias, were involved in past rebellions has raised
questions about how well the military has dealt with its black sheep.
Businessmen are asking whether the government will ease the commitment to
free market policies that has caused so much social unrest since 1989. They
are worried that the government may try to devote more money to social
welfare and other projects aimed at easing social tensions.
Many politicians say the attempted uprising proves that the government's
unpopular economic policies, initiated three years ago, must be changed.
However, many in the business community would argue that these tough
policies are only just starting to bear fruit and must be continued in order
to provide the country with long-term growth and low inflation.
A country with a democratic history of more than three decades may turn
violent and unstable, with repetitions of last year's sustained street
protests and further unrest among the military.
In one respect, however, Venezuela is lucky. Thanks to its oil export
revenues it has the financial resources to address its problems better than
most developing nations.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Plan drawn up for sweeping CIA reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO powerful congressional committee chairmen have drawn up plans for a
sweeping re-organisation of the Central Intelligence Agency, including a
potentially controversial merger of domestic and foreign counter-spying
operations.
Mr Robert Gates, CIA director, would become the new intelligence supremo
under the proposed reforms which have been driven by the collapse of the
former Soviet Union.
The chief sponsor of the reform is Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, chairman
of the Senate intelligence committee, who shepherded Mr Gates' controversial
nomination through the Senate last year. Congressman Dave McCurdy, also of
Oklahoma, who chairs the House intelligence committee, is also calling for
an overhaul of US intelligence gathering to meet post-Cold War needs.
Mr Boren reportedly favours giving the CIA control over the FBI's
counter-intelligence budget as part of the re-organisation, but this is
likely to run into criticism because the CIA has traditionally been barred
from operating inside the US.
Americans have always been keen to stress the difference between the CIA and
the KGB, the Soviet intelligence apparatus, which from Stalin to Gorbachev
controlled spying at home and abroad. The FBI has acted as the domestic
counter-spying apparatus, most notably under the long reign of Mr J. Edgar
Hoover.
According to congressional officials, the reforms also propose reducing the
CIA's role in covert operations and handing responsibility to the Pentagon;
moving the National Security Agency, the electronic eavesdropping agency,
under the supervision of the CIA; and creating a civilian agency to handle
spy satellites and photographic reconnaissance.
These moves would enhance considerably the power of the congressional
intelligence committees. Some legislators are already calling the plan a
'power-grab' by Mr Boren.
Separately, Mr Gates is considering setting up a new electronic news network
operated by the CIA which would offer news bulletins to an elite audience of
US government officials. The Washington Post reported that a panel
recommended the idea so government officials would not be so dependent on
Cable News Network.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday intensified his campaign to persuade
Congress to approve his economic recovery plan, urging the business
community to send legislators a message of 'no more delay, no substitutes'.
Speaking to the Small Business Legislative Council, he asked for support in
his 'rifle-shot approach to stimulate this economy'. It was the latest in a
series of appearances to promote the programme in his State of the Union
address last week.
The president emphasised the themes in his plan: a 90- day moratorium on new
regulations 'that destroy jobs and weigh down business'; a lowering of
capital gains tax; a 15 per cent investment tax credit; penalty-free
withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other measures to
boost housing; and a new health plan, to be unveiled today in Cleveland.
Congress is not ignoring the president's programme or his deadline of March
20. Senate majority leader George Mitchell yesterday was said to be prepared
to ask senators to work through their scheduled March 9-13 recess.
However, with polls showing little voter enthusiasm for the president's
plan, the Democrats are working on their own versions in both the House and
the Senate.
The House Ways and Means Committee has begun to mark up legislation
providing a Dollars 200 (Pounds 111) to Dollars 400 middle class tax refund
over the next two years paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy.
It may also include a narrowly focused capital gains tax cut, an investment
tax credit and liberalisation of IRAs.
In Congress as a whole, the Democrats have yet to achieve a consensus.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate finance committee, will hold
hearings later this month starting with his own tax credit and savings
proposal. He would finance his scheme by higher cuts in defence spending.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve should be prepared to ease monetary policy further if
the economic recovery expected this spring fails to materialise, Mr Michael
Boskin, the White House chief economic adviser, indicated in a briefing
yesterday.
Releasing the 1992 Economic Report of the president, he said monetary policy
had to be 'forward looking'. He said the Fed had been surprised by the
sluggishness of monetary aggregates in the face of repeated cuts in interest
rates.
In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
said he would not rule out further interest rate cuts if the economy failed
to improve. But he hoped the existing stimulus would be sufficient.
The Fed met this week to discuss monetary targets for 1992. Some private
sector economists, including Mr Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor and
economic adviser in the Reagan White House, have urged the Fed to raise its
monetary target this year. This would probably require further cuts in
interest rates.
Mr Boskin acknowledged that the Bush administration had not yet gained
control of the budget deficit.
There was 'still a huge gaping hole in the budget', he said, referring to
this year's expected shortfall of Dollars 400bn - a record 6.7 per cent of
gross domestic product.
He said the best way to reduce the deficit in the medium-term would be to
restrain growth of spending on entitlement programmes such as health care
for the elderly. This would free resources for private sector investment.
Mr Boskin defended the administration's claim that stimulatory measures in
the budget would raise annual GDP growth 0.4 percentage points in coming
years. He said this reflected 'confidence effects' as well as the incentive
effect of measures such as the proposed cut in capital gains taxes and
temporary investment allowances for companies.

MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the Japanese consumer electronics group and
one of the country's biggest exporters, will import American-made sportswear
and outdoor equipment as part of an effort to ease trade tensions with the
US.
Matsushita said the move was part of the 'Business Global Partnership'
import-boosting programme devised by the Japanese Ministry of Trade and
Industry (Miti) to defuse US criticism of Japan's trade surplus.
However, Matsushita's move could provoke anger in the US, which is concerned
not only about the volume of exports to Japan but also their composition.
It would like to see high-technology groups such as Matsushita import more
US-made high-tech equipment.
Matsushita said the company's global partnership programme did not
necessarily target electronic goods. 'We already import whisky and cruiser
yachts. We're starting off with smaller things,' it said. Matsushita, which
imported Y420bn (Pounds 1.9bn) of goods this year, intends to expand imports
to Y600bn in the year to March 1995.
Matsushita said it would team up with Seiyu, a leading retailer, in setting
up a joint venture, which will import and market products by LL Bean, the US
maker of outdoor-wear, starting in April.
The electronics group is one of the 23 top manufacturers pledging to
increase imports, including imports of parts and capital equipment, boost
local procurement in foreign countries and expand commercial ties with
non-Japanese groups.
The venture will lead to the first foreign outlet for LL Bean, which had
sales of Dollars 600m (Pounds 331.4m) last year.
The company already markets an estimated Y2bn (Pounds 9m)-worth of goods in
Japan through mail order.

FT  06 FEB 92 / ANC officials renew foreign loans warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress has repeated a threat to renege on foreign
loans to the current white government, despite a personal assurance from Mr
Nelson Mandela, ANC president, that all such loans would be honoured if the
ANC came to power.
Earlier this week, Mr Mandela repudiated ANC statements suggesting that a
future ANC government would refuse to repay loans made now to the National
Party government. He said they represented the personal views of officials,
and were not policy.
'We are obliged to honour these loans or else we will be in a great deal of
trouble,' he told journalists at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland.
Yesterday, however, the ANC repeated that it might not honour loans made to
the 'present illegitimate South African regime and its agencies' before a
multi-racial interim government had asked for financial sanctions to be
lifted.
The main proponent of this view within the ANC is Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the
secretary general, whose influence within the organisation rivals that of Mr
Mandela.
The public dispute between the two men highlights the confusion over
economic policy within the ANC, with officials repeatedly contradicting each
other over crucial issues such as nationalisation.
Yesterday's incident raises doubts over Mr Mandela's assurances at Davos on
nationalisation. Asked whether he could assure investors that new
investments would never be nationalised, he said: 'We have made this clear.
. . we are well aware that if you cannot co-operate with business you cannot
succeed in generating growth. . . we would like to create the conditions for
investors to invest without any fear of their properties being nationalised,
or of not being able to repatriate their profits and getting a safe return
on their investments.'
The threat to default on foreign loans is made with a strategic goal in
mind: ANC officials believe that access to new lending will strengthen
Pretoria's hand in constitutional negotiations; they see the threat of
default as a potent weapon against government, which has recently re-entered
international capital markets blocked since the mid-1980s.
However, Mr Gerard Croeser, the government's director general of finance,
warned: 'The ANC has a simple choice: if they think they are going to be the
government and they think they will need loans in future, renege on the
first one and you won't raise a cent ever.'
ANC opposition has already blocked a planned foreign issue by the
Independent Development Trust, a quasi-government organisation which is
spending R2bn (Pounds 400m) on black housing and education. Yesterday's
statement was aimed at blocking a foreign bond issue planned by the
Development Bank of Southern Africa, a parastatal organisation.
Confusion within the ANC might not matter but for its proximity to power.
The organisation wants to share economic power with Pretoria in an interim
government but concrete policies remain distant, as advisers and officials
indulge in endless debate.

JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry has asked electronic
goods manufacturers to cut the number of times they redesign their products,
Reuter reports from Tokyo. Frequent model changes do not benefit consumers,
use up natural resources and lengthen working hours, a Miti official said
yesterday.
Makers change models of videotape recorders and air-conditioners about once
every six months while cordless telephones and word processors get a
face-lift every few months.
Competition between electronics makers for market share and the hefty
appetite of Japanese consumers have led to a frenzy of model changes.
'Consumers have to buy new products because they often can't get hold of
parts for broken ones,' Mr Hiroko Ota,a social and economic analyst, told
the daily Sankei Shimbun yesterday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night faced increasing
difficulties in securing the passage through the Diet of the 1992-93 budget
after opposition demands for a parliamentary investigation into recent
scandals.
Opposition parties yesterday started a boycott of the Diet, refusing to take
part unless the ruling Liberal Democratic party summoned witnesses to give
evidence in connection with a bribery scandal allegedly involving Mr Fumio
Abe, a former cabinet minister. They also demanded that an aide to Mr
Miyazawa should give evidence about the prime minister's role in the 1988-89
Recruit scandal.
Although he still has room for manoeuvre, Mr Miyazawa could be forced out of
office if he fails to resolve the dispute. The government plans to have the
budget passed through the lower house of the Diet by the end of the month.
If it misses the deadline, ministers may have trouble winning approval of
the upper house in time for the beginning of April, when the new budget
takes effect.
To make matters worse, the prime minister has been criticised for his gaffe
in referring to Americans as lacking the 'work ethic' and for failing to
deflect US criticism of Japanese trade practices. Mr Miyazawa also has to
steer through the Diet controversial legislation allowing for despatch of
Japanese troops to serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions. He must
also take a delicate decision on opening the rice market to help resolve the
impasse in the Uruguay Round talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
Even if he clears these hurdles, Mr Miyazawa could come under pressure over
the LDP's apparent involvement in a third scandal - the Sagawa Kyubin
affair. Sagawa Kyubin, a leading transport company, is being investigated by
the public prosecutor's office for alleged links with a gangster
organisation. There is said to be evidence the company made extensive
donations to LDP leaders' campaign funds. Some of these donations are
alleged to have been so large as to have been improper but the prosecutor's
office has not aired evidence on this score.
Mr Miyazawa's personal reputation could be at stake in the affair of Mr Abe,
who was a close aide and secretary general of Mr Miyazawa's faction until
last December. Mr Abe is accused of taking Y80m (Pounds 360,300) in bribes
from Kyowa, a steel stockholding and property development company, in return
for leaking planning information while he held government office in 1989-90.
The opposition also wants to investigate details of how Mr Miyazawa accepted
cut-price shares from Recruit, a publishing company which offered cheap
stock to scores of politicians and other influential people. Mr Miyazawa,
who was finance minister at the time of the scandal, resigned after his
links became known. But opposition parties aim to embarrass him by seeking
more information.

KRUPP Koppers, part of the German industrial conglomerate, has won the main
work on a DM450m (Pounds 156.7m) project at Bandar Imam Khomeini, the big
Iranian petrochemical complex which was damaged in the Iran-Iraq war, writes
Andrew Baxter.
The Essen-based company has been awarded a turnkey contract for a vinyl
chloride monomer plant. In a second agreement, a consortium lead by Krupp
Koppers and including Klockner Industrie-Anlagen of Duisburg will build a
turnkey polyvinyl chloride plant.
Financing of the orders, awarded by Tehran-based Bandar Imam Petrochemical,
will come from Germany and Italy. They provide more evidence of the
resurgence of infrastructure spending in Iran, which has also led to recent
orders for western-manufactured power equipment. Construction is expected to
begin later this year, with the VC and PVC plants coming on stream 24 and 28
months, respectively, after the agreements come into effect.
The complex will produce 175,000 tonnes of PVC a year from ethylene and
chlorine. A modern process devised by Huls, the German chemicals company,
will be used to produce a range of plastic products from the vinyl chloride.
Krupp said this would lead to a further increase in demand for machinery and
plants for the plastic processing industry in Iran.

ICL, the UK-based computer group which is majority owned by Fujitsu of
Japan, is to sell its high performance Unix-based mid-range computers in the
Japanese market through a subsidiary of C Itoh, the large Japanese trading
house, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
The agreement with C Itoh represents a breakthrough for ICL into the highly
competitive Japanese computer market and provides it with an opportunity to
underline its independence from its Japanese parent company.
'For ICL to be able to get into the Japanese market this way has some
significance and we are not doing this through Fujitsu,' ICL said.
The group, which was excluded from some European joint research projects
because of its Japanese ownership, has consistently claimed that
commercially it operates at an arm's length from Fujitsu.
Fujitsu sells the same Unix-based DRS 6000 system, which is manufactured in
Manchester, in Spain, North America, parts of South-East Asia and
Australasia but not in Japan.
Although details of the agreement with C Itoh have not been disclosed, ICL
is optimistic about the benefits of the new relationship.
C Itoh Techno-Science , the subsidiary that will market ICL's computers, is
a systems integrator that has been the sole Wang systems integrator in Japan
for 20 years.

<TEXT>
WORLDWIDE savings of Dollars 75bn (Pounds 41.4bn) a year or more could be
achieved through more efficient trade administration and practices,
including computerisation of customs procedures, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) says in a report prepared for
its eighth session which begins on Saturday.
The calculation assumes a 25 per cent cut in transaction costs, put at
roughly Dollars 300bn, or 10 per cent of world merchandise trade.
But the report says potential savings cannot be fully realised because
developing countries and the transition economies of eastern Europe do not
have suitable information technologies.
The efforts of these countries to liberalise foreign trade and integrate
themselves into the global economy are thus being less well rewarded than
they should be, for any given level of protectionism abroad.
Unctad, which will hold the meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, has already
helped countries such as Mauritius and Mauritania to computerise foreign
trade procedures. For as little as Dollars 1m, the procedures have speeded
customs clearance and increased revenue.

FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Companies face finance hurdle in Russian
ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN companies seeking joint ventures in Russia and other republics are
unlikely to receive benefits from the aid pledged to the former Soviet Union
by their governments last week.
The message from the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department is that
guarantees will not be provided until the IMF agrees a programme with
Russia, or until banks are in place with the authority to provide sovereign
guarantees. Other western export credit agencies are expected to take a
similar view.
For executives at the UK engineering group, John Brown, keen to press ahead
with their Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) polyethylene-producing joint venture in
Russia, the message is frustrating: 'We are ready to make major progress,
and are seeking all sorts of possible ways of going ahead with what is
certainly one of the most bankable projects around,' says Mr Tony Bruce,
director of marketing.
The venture would be John Brown's second large project in Russia, and would
make 300,000 tonnes a year of polyethylene for export, using natural gas
that is currently being flared off.
Its partner, Gasprom, already has foreign exchange earnings from long-term
contracts selling gas for export. John Brown's first joint venture, signed
in April 1988, has run smoothly and is near completion. It will boost output
from an existing polyethylene plant from 100,000 to 300,000 tonnes a year,
again for the export market.
Although Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, last week offered to
provide Pounds 280m in new export credits to Russia and other republics,
until an institution is in place prospective projects will either be
stalled, or will go ahead without export credit protection.
Prospects for projects in other republics - like Chevron's plans to develop
Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field - are even more deeply in the mire.
'There is no ready and immediate solution,' says Mr Bruce: 'It requires our
project finance team, and Morgan Grenfell our financial advisers, to be even
more creative and imaginative than would normally be required.'
John Brown is better placed than many to 'multi-source' financing: Linde in
Germany is doing work for the project, and is being pressed to seek credit
cover from Hermes; John Brown, apart from approaching Britain's ECGD, can
source work in the US, enabling it to approach the US Exim Bank for cover.
Gasprom is being approached to provide foreign exchange, at least to cover
interest costs arising during the three to four years it will take to
complete the project.
But the single most helpful development would be the emergence of a credible
guarantor institution to replace the Soviet Union's former export credit
bank, Vnesheconombank. There was talk of a breakthrough early this week when
Japan's Exim bank indicated it would accept guarantees from Vneshtorgbank,
Russia's leading commercial bank.
However, the EC has signalled that it is seeking guarantees from the central
bank of Russia - a move which, if it succeeds, is likely to throw doubt over
Vneshtorgbank's authority as a guarantor.

FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Fresh cracks in US-Japan chip pact / A
report on Silicon Valley's growing anger over the market-share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US trade representative, Mrs Carla Hills, disappointed US semiconductor
manufacturers last week by softening her support for a key element of the
US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement signed last year.
The agreement, in which Japan agreed to give foreign producers greater
access to its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11bn) semiconductor market, specifies a
foreign market share of 20 per cent by the end of this year.
However, playing down the significance of market share, Mrs Hills said that
it is only one of about a dozen indices that the US government will use to
determine whether Japan has complied with the pact.
The bitterly fought semiconductor trade battle threatens to become the focus
of rising resentment in the US toward Japan for its alleged unfair trade
practices.
Mrs Hills defended the Bush administration's record on Japanese trade,
noting that several important market-opening agreements have been signed
during the past three years, including the recent computer trade pact. The
administration's trade policy 'is working', she claimed, adopting President
George Bush's new slogan.
Yet her comments, made during a brief visit to San Francisco, come amid
growing concern that the semiconductor agreement will fail to provide US
chip makers with greater access to the lucrative Japanese market.
The foreign share of the Japanese chip market has declined during the past
year, according to US semiconductor industry officials, from a high of 15.5
per cent in the second quarter of 1990 to 14.3 per cent in the third quarter
of 1991.
The market share data has been recalculated according to a new formula
agreed on by the US and Japan in the 1991 pact.
US chip makers are determined that market share should remain 'the most
important measure of compliance', said a spokesman for the Semiconductor
Industry Association (SIA), the trade group that has spearheaded the US
industry's campaign. Executives are hoping that Washington will take a tough
stand if current trends continue; Mrs Hills' remarks were therefore a bitter
disappointment.
Industry officials were particularly perturbed to hear that she had referred
to the 20 per cent market share goal as only a benchmark.
'If the market share is 19 per cent,' she said, 'that will not necessarily
be a breach (of the agreement)'. American computer industry executives
disagree.
'Progress in semiconductor trade must be measured in terms of results, and
that means market share. We will accept nothing less,' said an official at
Advanced Micro Devices, one of Silicon Valley's leading semiconductor
manufacturers.
'Rather than finding excuses for why Japan cannot live up to its
commitments, the trade representative should be keeping up the pressure,'
said an SIA spokesman.
The first US-Japanese semiconductor trade agreement, in 1986, set a 20 per
cent market share goal, but, when this five-year pact expired, a new
deadline was set for the end of 1992. To reach the year-end market-share
goal, Japan would have to import a record Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 660m)-worth
of semiconductor products this year.
US industry officials now acknowledge that this appears very unlikely.
Another concern among executives is a steep drop in the number of
'design-wins' that they have been able to obtain in Japan over the past six
months.
These occur when a semiconductor device is incorporated into the design of a
new electronic product.
Tracking design-wins provides a rough measure of the volume of business that
a chip maker can expect to achieve in coming months. The Japanese
electronics companies' increasing reluctance to design foreign semiconductor
devices into their products is attributed in part to weakening economic
conditions in Japan.
'We are the last to be designed-in and the first to be designed-out when
times get tough,' a US industry official said.
The semiconductor trade dispute may come to a head this summer, when US and
Japanese executives meet in Tokyo. After waging their trade battle with
Japan for more than a decade, the US industry is in no mood for compromise.
Unless there is a significant improvement in Japanese trade before then, the
US industry is determined to retaliate.
What form the US industry's response will take has yet to be decided.
One of the options frequently mentioned, however, is to urge the US
government to impose trade sanctions aimed selectively at Japanese companies
that have failed to increase their foreign semiconductor purchases, while
acknowledging the efforts of those that have adhered to the spirit of the
agreement.

   SIMFEROPOL, CRIMEA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of senior Ukrainian politicians yesterday visited the contentious
Crimean peninsula, in an effort to restrain separatism and ease
Ukrainian-Russian strains over the region.
Crimea, transferred to Ukraine from Russia in 1954, has long been a sore
point between the two republics, with each advancing claims to the Black Sea
region. On Monday, Crimeans put forward a third option, complete
independence, when the Republican Movement of Crimea initiated a petition to
call for a referendum.
The Ukrainian team, led by the deputy chairman of the parliament, Mr
Volodymyr Hryniov, negotiated a conciliatory communique with Crimean
leaders, proposing a meeting between Ukraine and Russia, with Crimean
participation, as soon as possible.
Disturbed by growing discontent in Crimea, facing fuel shortages and
transport problems, the Ukrainians offered Crimea generous conditions if it
agreed to remain part of the republic. The communique calls for Ukraine and
Crimea to negotiate a division of political powers within the next month.
Senior Ukrainian officials say they will be willing to offer Crimea
everything apart from military, monetary and foreign policy.
In a clause surely attractive to the Communist old guard which still
controls Crimea, the Ukrainians conceded that all property on the Crimean
peninsula should come under control of the Crimean government. 'Stable
relations between Ukraine and Russia have no price,' Mr Hryniov told Crimean
deputies. 'Even the Black Sea fleet would not be too high a price to pay.'
In addition to its importance for Ukrainian-Russian relations, 'Crimea is a
litmus test for development of democracy in Ukraine.'
But standing in the shadow of the Lenin statue which still dominates
Simferopol's central square, angry Crimeans were more concerned about daily
living than democracy. Most, who narrowly supported Ukrainian independence
in the December 1 referendum, were confident Ukraine had better economic
prospects than Russia. But Ukraine's ineffectual economic reform has
disenchanted many. The Republican Movement of Crimea hopes to collect
signatures from 180,000 disappointed Crimeans. If the group succeeds by
April 3, the autonomous republic will hold a referendum to determine if it
should become fully independent.

Milan Babic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in
southern Croatia.
Mr Babic is seen by Serb leaders as the main obstacle to deployment of
10,000 UN peacekeepers in Serb-populated regions of Croatia.
But at yesterday's low-key rally, as a Belgrade journalist reported, 'most
of the crowd were refugees from Croatia. Mr Babic has little support in
war-weary Serbia.'
A western diplomat based in Belgrade said Lord Carrington would see if he
'can knock some heads together' in an effort to iron out differences between
Mr Babic and the republic of Serbia, led by President Slobodan Milosevic.
During his two-day mission Lord Carrington, a former British foreign
secretary, will assess whether the EC conference can be reconvened.
Serbia has called on the UN to take over as political mediator, accusing the
EC of taking sides in the conflict.
After talks with Serb leaders yesterday, Lord Carrington was due to travel
to Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Many fear an eruption of
violence between Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats in the run-up to a
referendum on independence for the central republic on February 29.
Lord Carrington will later meet Croat leaders in Zagreb. Croatia has come
under criticism for stalling the UN plan. It says the peacekeepers' mandate
should be limited to one year.
Recent statements from the Croat leadership have heightened fears in Krajina
that Croatia intends to reimpose authority over the region, which is
currently under Serb and federal army con-trol.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Breakaway Macedonia strives to keep economy afloat: No one
has yet been able to work out the cost of independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUNDAY is a working day for the Albanian currency dealers, slight dark men
in overcoats who trade in D-marks and dollars in the cobbled bazaar of the
Macedonian capital, Skopje. 'The difference at weekends is that you make
your own market because you can't phone Vienna for the latest prices,' says
one.
Unofficial foreign exchange dealing is illegal but tolerated of necessity in
Macedonia since it declared independence in January, becoming the third
Yugoslav republic to break away from the collapsing federation.
Remittances from an estimated 100,000 Macedonian migrant workers in Germany
and Switzerland, many of them from the Albanian minority which makes up a
third of the 2.3m population, underpin an economy struggling desperately to
stay afloat. The monthly inflation rate is approaching 200 per cent, while
unemployment is more than 20 per cent. Figures on foreign exchange inflows
are hard to come by: the federal banking system is in disarray and
cash-carrying emigres take an aircraft home every few months. However,
economists estimate that Dollars 800m (Pounds 441.9m) arrived last year,
equivalent to about a quarter of Macedonia's gross domestic product (GDP).
No one has yet worked out the economic cost of becoming independent, but
further economic deterioration is expected this year, with annual inflation
likely to reach at least 2,000 per cent and living standards experiencing a
marked decline.
Even before the onset of civil war, landlocked Macedonia was the poorest of
the six Yugoslav republics, contributing only 6-7 per cent of overall gross
national product (GNP). The other republics were the main customers for its
agricultural produce, while its chemical and metallurgical industries were
dependent for raw materials on the former Soviet Union or the Yugoslavian
republics of Slovenia and Croatia. Industrial production fell last year by
18 per cent.
On the other hand, exports were up by 7 per cent in 1991, totalling Dollars
1.1bn. Initial fears that European Community sanctions against Yugoslavia
would ruin the textile industry, which imports fabric from Germany to be
made up for export, proved unfounded. A small but flourishing trade in early
tomatoes and cucumbers to EC countries also survived almost unscathed.
Macedonia has been fending for itself since federal subsidies were cut off
three years ago. The Skopje government has not approved any payments to
Yugoslavia's federal government for almost two years. Working out the trade
balance with each republic is now one of the Economy Ministry's main
concerns. 'We're trying to get precise figures, which is difficult because
middleman companies are involved. But the balance is in our favour,' says Mr
Petrus Stefanov, the deputy minister. Overall debt is estimated at about
Dollars 80m.
Economic missions from Skopje are making the rounds of the other republics.
Macedonia is anxious to put ties with Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia on a new
footing as soon as possible, for otherwise its chances of subsisting will be
sharply reduced.
Economy Ministry officials say that, in spite of political tensions with
Serbia, it is still possible to hold talks on future transport arrangements,
assessment of the Serbian debt to Macedonia, estimated at about Dollars 25m,
and methods of payment.
Plans to launch a Macedonian currency this year are well advanced, but, with
foreign exchange reserves totalling under Dollars 30m and only a small
amount of gold available, outside support will be needed.
One idea is to peg the new currency to the D-mark. As one banker put it:
'The D-mark is already the unofficial currency. Everyone in Skopje uses it
to calculate how much their salary can buy'. The alternative would be to
seek a loan abroad, 'perhaps of about Dollars 1bn' to support the currency
until the economy stabilises and foreign exchange remittances are deposited
in the banks.
However, little aid can be expected until Macedonia succeeds in obtaining
international recognition. The government is waging a diplomatic campaign
but so far has been recognised only by Bulgaria.
Macedonia faces more obstacles than Slovenia and Croatia in winning EC
recognition, despite the conclusions of the Badinter Report, prepared for
the European Commission by a group of legal experts, that it meets Community
requirements for sovereignty.
While Italy is ready to push strongly for EC recognition, Greece objects,
claiming that Macedonia's choice of name implies a territorial claim on
northern Greece and should be changed. This position harks back to
Macedonia's former Communist days. Skopje had kept up a propaganda campaign
aimed at the Slav-speakers in northern Greece and calling for the uniting of
Macedonia with the Greek province of the same name and the wealthy port of
Salonica.
Although Macedonia's new constitution was recently amended to underline that
it has no territorial ambitions, Greek hostility persists. This worries the
government, because a large percentage of Macedonian imports, including its
oil supply, passes through Salonica.
Plans are under discussion for building an oil terminal at Durres in
Albania. Already, trucks from Skopje board ferries there for Italy, avoiding
the hazardous route through Croatia.

FT  06 FEB 92 / French Socialists face censure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S conservative opposition parties will attempt to bring down the
government by tabling a censure motion after tomorrow's one-day
parliamentary session, writes Ian Davidson.
The motion condemns the handling of a political crisis provoked by the brief
hospitalisation in Paris last week of Palestinian leader George Habash.
The opposition motion is likely to fall short of the absolute majority
required to bring down the government, but the debates will give the
opposition a platform to attack the government's performance.
President Francois Mitterrand has called the special session hoping it will
finally put to rest the crisis over the Habash affair, in which the
government has been battered by indignant protests from both the opposition
parties and from leading members of its own Socialist party.
In a hurriedly scheduled TV interview on Tuesday evening, Mr Mitterrand did
his best to play down the significance of the incident. 'The affair is not
serious', he said. 'There was an error of judgment which I punished. I dealt
with the problem in 48 hours, and there is no longer a Habash affair.'
However, the terms of tomorrow's parliamentary session show that the
president feels the need to play safe. The government is not expected to
table its own vote of confidence, as it is not sure it can rely on the
backing of its normal supporters.
Instead, it is leaving the opposition to table a censure motion as it
believes it can rely on Socialists and the Communists for support.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community should follow Japan's example and draw up a
co-ordinated strategy to make its industry internationally competitive, a
leading European industrialist said yesterday, Reuter reports from Davos,
Switzerland.
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman and chief executive of Olivetti, the Italian
computer company, said the EC had to choose in which sectors it wanted to be
leader or play a global role.
'I think that due to the fact that in future years financial resources will
be scarce, you have to make a strategic choice on where you want to allocate
the resources,' he told a news conference during the annual World Economic
Forum.
The industrialist earlier told business and political leaders attending the
conference that the move by the EC towards monetary union and political
integration was not enough.
He said Europe's industrial base was slowly deteriorating and each EC
government had its own approach to tackling the problem - ranging from the
interventionism of the French to the 'laissez-faire' polices of the Germans
and British. 'This diversity is a sign of a weak Europe.'
He called for big infrastructural projects on a pan-European basis,
programmes for joint research and innovation and incentives for alliances
among European companies.

FT  06 FEB 92 / EC acts over Dutch construction cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has begun legal proceedings against the Dutch
government, which the EC believes condoned an illegal cartel operated by the
country's industry federation involving up to 7,000 builders.
According to the Commission, the cartel has dominated the Dutch construction
industry for the last 12 years, and accounts for about 40 per cent of the
sector's turnover. Brussels yesterday imposed fines of Ecu22.5m (Pounds
16.04m) on the 28 construction associations which are members of the
federation, the SPO.
The Commission has been investigating the cartel, which operated quite
openly, for more than three years and had to examine tens of thousands of
invoices to uncover the exact structure of the organisation. The SPO had
offered to amend its methods - which involved deciding in advance the terms
and candidates for contract tenders - but could not go far enough to satisfy
Brussels.
'It's over now,' said one Commission official yesterday. 'It will have to
go, as of tonight.'
The Commission said it had imposed only a token fine on the members of the
SPO partly because of the federation's 'relatively co-operative attitude'.
The Commission has also attempted to play down the involvement of the
Netherlands government, which could be taken to the European Court of
Justice if it fails to satisfy Brussels about its role in the cartel.
Apart from 4,000 builders linked directly to the SPO, some 3,000 others were
involved in the cartel on a case-by-case basis. According to the Commission,
150 of those were established in other member states.
All three Baltic states will reach trade and co-operation agreements with
the EC this month, as a first step to formal association with the Community.
Terms will be similar to those negotiated with central European states,
writes David Buchan in Brussels.
Following the initialling of trade and co-operation accords with Lithuania
and Latvia on February 1 and 4, the Commission said yesterday a similar
arrangement would be reached with Estonia on February 24.
The economic section of the agreements, which remove discriminatory quotas
and tariffs and set up joint co-operation bodies, confers little more
benefit on the Baltic states than they had enjoyed under the defunct
EC-Soviet agreement.
But the agreements go further politically, with the EC committing itself to
drawing the new states into its foreign policy consultations and the Baltics
pledging observance of individual and minority rights.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Hungary set to take off this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORT GROWTH of 8-10 per cent will lift the Hungarian economy out of
recession in 1992, according to official forecasts announced yesterday,
Nicholas Denton reports from Budapest.
'A marked increase in total exports is why we think this is the year of
turn-around,' Mr Bela Kadar, minister of international economic relations,
said yesterday. 'This will result in economic take-off, hopefully by
Christmas.'
Driving the improvement is a continuing boom in exports to the west.
Hungary's association agreement with the EC is expected to cushion the
knock-on effect from any German growth recession.
Hungary expects the direct effect of easier access to EC markets alone to
push up exports by Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.2m) to Dollars 200m a year.
Increasing signs are that last year's collapse of the Soviet market has run
its course. 'The real basis for optimism is that this year we cannot lose
more than last,' said Mr Kadar, predicting a slight increase in exports to
the east in 1992 from a low base.
Hungary's deliveries to the developed world grew 31 per cent in 1991 over
the previous year, pushing total hard currency earnings up to Dollars 10.2bn
but this was negated by a fall of over 50 per cent in exports to the former
Soviet Union.
One factor behind the increase in Hungary's western market share has been a
record inflow of foreign companies, improving the marketability of Hungarian
goods.
Foreign direct investment was Dollars 1.4bn (4 per cent of GDP) in 1992,
raising the total to Dollars 2.8bn. That represented over half the Dollars
5bn total committed by western investors to eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE, the state-owned airline, yesterday came under attack for
allegedly favouring Boeing, the US aircraft maker, over Airbus, the European
aircraft consortium, William Dawkins reports from Paris.
Mr Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse, where Airbus's main assembly plant
is based, warned Mrs Edith Cresson, French premier, that a decision by Air
France to buy three Boeing 767-300 medium-sized carriers would have
'regrettable consequences'.
The amount at stake is less than the Pounds 4bn (Dollars 7.24bn) order
British Airways placed with Boeing last year, which triggered an Airbus
complaint to the European Commission. But it is a further example of the
political sensitivities behind aircraft purchasing.
Air France was puzzled by Mr Baudis' objections as the group has been buying
Boeings, alongside Airbuses, for years. The latest order simply replaces a
cancelled order for two Boeing 747-400s.
French industrial output in the third quarter of 1991 rose 0.9 per cent over
the previous three months, Insee, the state statistics body, said, Alice
Rawsthorn writes from Paris.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EAST Germany's former planned economy is being transformed into a market
economy with a noticeably different structure to that of west Germany,
according to a report by Berliner Bank.
Industry in the east, once dominated by investment goods production, will be
more weighted toward consumer goods, a sector already expanding at an annual
rate of nearly 50 per cent.
East German industrial output, which fell 28 per cent in the first eight
months of 1991, would suffer a permanent loss in its share of regional GNP,
the bank forecast. The sectors showing strongest growth in east German
industry would differ from those in the west:
Construction. Building activity revival has been delayed, but the report
predicted that DM17bn (Dollars 10.6bn) in public infrastructure projects
this year would help boost construction output by 30 per cent and serve as a
catalyst for economic recovery. Food processing. Production fell in December
1990 to 60 per cent of the previous year's level, but output is set to
expand sharply, following investment by west German food processors and a
shift to local products by eastern consumers.
Printing. Output fell 20.5 per cent by December 1990 but rose 14 per cent by
August 1991 over the previous year's third quarter.
Steel and light construction. In January 1991, this sector produced only 63
per cent of output compared with July 1990. Output has since recovered
dramatically, soaring 50 per cent to August 1991.

Jones to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
STRONG DEMAND for blue chips and an influx of available funds helped the Dow
Jones Industrial Average reach a record high, writes Karen Zagor in New
York.
At the close the Dow was 38.69 stronger at 3,272.81, edging the index above
its previous all-time peak of 3,272.14 registered on January 28. Turnover on
the New York Stock Exchange was moderately heavy at 232.3m shares. Advancing
issues outpaced those declining by 1083 to 632. On Monday, the Dow added
10.73 to close at 3,234.12.
Among other market indices, the broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed
4.32 higher at 413.85. The Dow Jones Utilities index, which lost ground
through most of the day, turned higher in the last half hour of trading to
close at 209, up 0.12.
Mr Laszlo Birinyi, a Wall Street strategist at Birinyi Associates, said the
rally was helped by good, solid leadership of big stocks, such as Merck,
which did well during the day. The strong bond market performance also
helped stocks.
Testimony from Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, provided no
surprises about the US economy or economic policy. He described recent
economic performance as disappointing. However, he did not foresee
significant economic contraction in the short-term.
Positive comments from Mr George Salem, an analyst at Prudential Securities,
helped the banking sector. Citicorp gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 15 3/8 ,
BankAmerica rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 40 5/8 and Chemical Banking added
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29, although Mr Salem was less than bullish on
Citicorp and BankAmerica.
Predictions of improved car sales for January helped shares in the big three
US automobile makers post gains. Chrysler jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 16
3/8 , its 52-week high, in active trading. Ford firmed Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 33 3/8 and General Motors improved Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 35.
A number of issues moved on the back of corporate results. Sears edged
Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 39 7/8 after posting fourth quarter net income
of Dollars 513.1m or Dollars 1.48 a share including an accounting change.
Pepsico, which turned in fourth quarter earnings of 41 cents a share,
excluding charges of 7 cents a share, rose Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 .
Control Data rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 12 1/4 after the company unveiled a
fourth quarter loss of 36 cents a share, against 56 cents a year earlier.
Beckman Instruments climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 1/4 on news that a
group including two of the Bass Brothers had taken a 5.3 per cent stake in
Beckman.
Disappointing results from Kemper, which posted fourth quarter earnings of
91 cents a share from 98 cents a year earlier, depressed the company's share
price, which tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 36 3/4 . The secondary market also
hit a record high, with the Nasdaq composite quoted 7.57 higher at 631.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended higher on solid volume, led by a jump in the real
estate and construction sector.
The composite index gained 23.67 points, or 0.66 per cent, to close at
3,618.07, with advancing issues leading decliners 320 to 246. Volume was
30.8m shares worth CDollars 348.3m against the previous 24.9m shares worth
CDollars 272.7m.
Imperial Oil, whose shares moved up  3/4 to 42, announced a major corporate
restructuring which will reduce its workforce by about 1,700 and its number
of service stations by 1,000 over the next few years.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark rises on pay accord
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK led the way in Europe, as the consequences of the 6.4 per cent
pay settlement with German steel workers began to filter through to the
foreign exchange markets.
Some economists feared that the 6.4 per cent mark would be used as a basis
for the next round of pay talks, due to begin this week. Such a move would
eliminate any remaining hopes for an easing of German monetary policy.
'People are changing their minds about the course of German rates,' said Dr
Mark Austin, an economist with HongKong Bank.
The D-Mark strengthened against the lira - rising from 751.40/60 lire to
751.73/83 - and the peseta, increasing from 62.89/92 to 62.99/02.
The German currency also took some heart from a weaker dollar as mixed
comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, did little to
encourage investors. Mr Greenspan said that he felt current easing was
enough to turn the US economy around, but added that recent economic
performance had been disappointing.
Traders said the dollar had not yet shown the effects of the consistently
disappointing US data, and added that it could be set for a sharp fall.
However, most dealers were prepared to hold on for Friday's employment data,
perceived to be the first real economic indicator of the year. Trading was
expected to remain in fairly narrow bands.
The dollar softened in London from DM1.5975 to close at DM1.5920 and opened
in New York at DM1.5965/70.
The yen was not immune to the D-Mark's strength, despite speculation that
the G7 had informally agreed to keep Japan's currency strong. The yen was
trading at 79.33/38 per D-Mark in New York, compared with the 77.30 range at
the end of last week.
'That's quite a sharp move in a generally quiet market,' said one trader.
'Maybe it is time to think about Bank of Japan intervention.'
Sterling followed the dollar's drift during the day, partly because of
political uncertainty.
The speculation over a date for the general election was damping any
potential buoyancy in sterling. 'If we didn't have the political
uncertainty,' said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank, 'we could have had
investors buying the pound.' In the end, sterling rallied to close unchanged
at DM2.8675 in London.
Within the European Monetary System, the D-Mark finished at 38 per cent of
its allowed swing above the central Ecu rate. Sterling lay firmly locked at
the bottom of the grid, while Spain's high interest rates held the peseta
steady at the top.
However, the Spanish currency was close to its ceiling of 6.18 per cent
above the central rate, at 6.09 per cent.
Some traders suggested that speculation on a revaluation within the EMS
would return as it appeared more likely that German rates would remain high.

THE WORLD'S two largest futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, saw record increases in trading volume last
month.
The CME posted the best single month in its history, with a recorded 12.4m
futures and futures-options traded. The CBOT enjoyed its third highest
volume month, with 15.1m contracts traded.
The CME's January trading volume jump was 45.4 per cent higher than the same
month in 1991. The exchange's Eurodollar pit was its busiest, setting its
highest ever trading record at 5.4m contracts. In currencies, the D-Mark
also broke the 1m volume mark for a record month.
At the CBOT, overall trading volume for the month raddedose 51.6 per cent,
the highest increase of any exchange. Treasury bonds, 10-year notes,
five-year notes and 30-day interest rates led the volume increases on the
financial side, while wheat futures and futures-options led on the
agricultural side. Volume in Treasury bond futures was up 29.6 per cent to
7,523,352 contracts.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Resolving a corporate mystery
 -A law compelling shareholders to reveal any stake of more than 5 per cent
in Dutch companies listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE delight of Dutch daily newspapers, nearly 250 companies listed on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange are virtually guaranteed to order extra advertising
space in the next few weeks.
The advertisments will be used to clear up one of the mysteries of the Dutch
corporate world - the precise identity of the main shareholders in the
country's bourse-quoted companies.
Under a law which came into force this week, domestic and foreign investors
have 30 days to register any stake of more than 5 per cent in Dutch
companies or investment funds listed on the Amsterdam bourse. Now, they must
also notify the companies and the Securities Board of the Netherlands, the
regulatory agency entrusted with supervising compliance, whenever their
shareholdings rise above or fall below the trigger thresholds of 10, 25, 50
and 66 2/3 per cent.
The legislation, which brings the Netherlands into line with a 1988 EC
directive, will, for the first time, produce a relatively reliable overview
of who owns what in the Dutch corporate sector. (Foreign companies with
Amsterdam listings are excluded from the legislation, as are a handful of
Dutch companies such as Hunter Douglas, the window-dressing group, which is
incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles.)
In a country where shares generally take the form of bearer securities, the
law may also spark brief bursts of bourse activity as investors react to
revelations about company ownership.
Until now, it has been possible for an investor to build up a significant
stake in a company before announcing its purchases, as Hong Kong-based First
Pacific did in May 1991 when it stunned the Dutch market by revealing it had
amassed a 43 per cent stake in Interatio-Mueller, the Rotterdam industrial
conglomerate.
Mr Frank Hoogendijk, chief analyst at merchant bank Pierson, Heldring &amp;
Pierson, said many of the share disclosures would not come as a surprise.
Institutional investors such as Internationale Nederlanden Groep are widely
known to have 5 per cent stakes in most leading Dutch companies. At the same
time, shares in many listed companies, such as brewers Heineken and Grolsch
or publisher De Telegraaf, remain concentrated in the hands of the founding
families, though the exact percentages are not always publicised.
The mandatory disclosures may well affect trading in individual companies,
such as insurer Stad Rotterdam, which are often the subject of takeover
speculation. 'In the long term, greater openness will be good for the
Amsterdam bourse,' Mr Hoogendijk said.
Analysts also expect the new law to play a role in the continuing debate on
whether Dutch companies should give up some of their extensive anti-takeover
protection. Until now, one argument against proposals for reining in a
comtors has been that Dutch companies are vulnerable to takeover because
they do not know who is buying their shares in the market.
Mr Bert Canneman, director-secretary of the Securities Board, expects to
receive some 1,200 registrations over the next month from investors whose
stakes exceed the 5 per cent minimum.
Companies must publish the individual disclosures they receive 'forthwith'
in a national newspaper. They are barred from saving them up and publishing
them in a single advertisement, though an overview of all disclosures is
expected to be released, probably next month.
At home seminars for bankers, brokers, accountants and lawyers have been
organised to explain the disclosure procedures. Abroad, details have been
forwarded to stock exchanges and regulatory authorities, but otherwise no
publicity campaign has been mounted. 'We're assuming that the big foreign
investors have expert contacts in the Netherlands and that Dutch banks or
brokers will alert them to the changes,' he said.
Belgium, France and the UK are among the EC countries which already operate
a system of shareholder disclosure, as required by the EC. Germany has yet
to turn the EC directive into national law, but will probably do so as part
of planned reforms of German capital markets.
In the Netherlands, disclosure procedures are complicated by the fact that
some companies restrict the voting rights of their shareholders. In these
cases, shareholders must give details not only of their stake in the
company's capital but also of their share of the vote. 'Potential' shares
resulting from options or short positions must also be disclosed.
The law provides for an exemption if disclosure is deemed 'contrary to the
public interest.' However, parliament has made clear this exemption will not
apply to the Dutch royal family, often rumoured to hold big equity stakes in
companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell and ABN Amro. The popular press has
speculated that the law change will force Queen Beatrix to divulge details
of her wealth, but few professional brokers believe she holds as much as 5
per cent of Shell, a stake which would be worth more than Fl 6bn (Dollars
3.3bn).

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan debt slips on
secondary market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELAN debt slid sharply on the secondary market yesterday as news of an
attempted coup spread, but recovered some of its lost ground later as the
threat to the government of Mr Carlos Andres Perez appeared to have been
overcome.
That left Venezuelan debt yielding around 30 basis points more than
comparable Mexican instruments by the close of London trading - a reversal
of the position during most of the second half of last year.
Venezuelan par bonds, the most liquid of the bonds issued as part of the
country's Brady-style debt reduction plans in 1990, fell from around 66
cents in the dollar to below 62 at one stage. However, later the price of
the bonds, of which Dollars 6.7bn have been issued, rose to 64 1/4 . The
country's Debt Conversion Bonds, of which Dollars 5.3bn are in issue, fell
by a similar amount, from around 71 1/2 to 68.
Reports varied over the volume of trading that took place, although most
traders said the bulk of activity was between dealers. This left the market
unsure about whether prices will weaken further.
In the Eurobond market, the price of bonds issued recently by Bariven, a
subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company, weakened,
though they remained above their re-offered price. But news of the attempted
coup helped to undermine hopes that Eurobonds issued by Venezuelan borrowers
would return to investment grade this year.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian corporate bond
issues climb to ADollars 7.19bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL issuance in the Australian corporate bond market rose 9.5 per cent to
ADollars 7.19bn last year, according to investment bank Bain and Co, Reuter
reports.
Bain said this pushed total outstanding issues in the market to ADollars
18.8bn at December 31, reflecting an impressive growth rate since the
market's inception in 1988. It said notable features of 1991 included the
relaxation of controls on borrowings by foreign governments and
international organisations.
'The creation of a new category of supranational foreign borrowers is an
exciting development for the domestic market,' Bain said in its annual
corporate bond market review.
Foreign organisations to tap the Australian markets in 1991 were the
European Investment Bank which issued ADollars 400m of bonds and Eurofima
which issued ADollars 200m. Corporate bond issuance rose to ADollars 6.5bn
in 1990 from ADollars 2.65bn in 1989 and ADollars 3.58bn in 1988. Bain said
AAA-rated issuers accounted for 69.5 per cent of 1991 issues - 94.1 per cent
in the first half of 1991. It said this reflected investors' preoccupation
with credit worthiness.

<TEXT>
EASTMAN KODAK, the biggest maker of photographic equipment, reported a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 400m following a Dollars 597m after-tax
charge to cover the cost of an early retirement programme and further
restructuring moves.
Kodak, in the throes of its fifth restructuring since 1983, warned in
December that it would be taking a Dollars 495m charge, but said yesterday a
Dollars 102m had been added, mainly to cover additional employees who might
seek early retirement. It said that some 6,750 employees had elected to
retire early and a further 2,000 would be eligible this year.
The company also took a Dollars 435m charge in the third quarter, some
Dollars 200m of it for the retirement programme, which produced a Dollars
118m net loss.
Kodak said yesterday that in the absence of the charge, fourth quarter net
earnings would have been Dollars 197m, or 61 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 326m, or Dollars 1.01, in 1990.
For the year, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 17m, or 5 cents a
share, following after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 1bn. Excluding
the charges, net earnings would have been Dollars 1.05bn, compared with
Dollars 1.27bn, or Dollars 3.91 a share, in 1990, before deducting the
damages won by Polaroid in litigation against Kodak.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said: 'Despite concerns about the economic
background, we expect 1992 to be a time when benefits of what was done last
year will show in category growth, higher sales and better earnings'.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Merck drug clears key FDA hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCK, the world's biggest drugs company, yesterday was given a big boost
when the US Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel decided that the
benefits of the company's Proscar drug, to treat and control benign prostate
disease, outweighed the risks.
Merck said the committee was not asked to vote on whether the drug should be
cleared for marketing. However, the FDA is now expected to give its final
approval in the coming months.
The potential market for Proscar is enormous. About half of all men over 50
suffer from prostate enlargement. Although there are other drugs available
to treat the symptoms of prostate enlargement, there is no other drug on the
market that inhibits the enzyme that triggers the production of DHT, which
causes the condition.
Merck paced the pharmaceutical industry through the 1980s with its new drug
introductions, and analysts view Proscar as Merck's next blockbuster.
Ms Hayley Kissel, an analyst at Smith Barney, said: 'This is probably
Merck's most significant new drug between now and the end of 1995.' She
believes that Proscar could generate sales of between Dollars 750m and
Dollars 1bn by 1995.
On Wall Street, anticipation of a favourable recommendation helped Merck's
shares climb Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 158 7/8 . The decision came after the
close of trading.
The advisory panel said Proscar had no significant side-effects. The
benefits of the drug, while limited to a small group of patients studied,
significantly outweighed the risks of the drug.
Proscar's side-effects include reduced sexual drive, but the advisory panel
concluded that these problems were not serious and were reversible in many
cases.
The test results considered by the FDA showed that the drug reduced prostate
size by about 20 per cent. It also reduced the levels of the hormones
implicated in prostate enlargement by as much as 70 per cent.
However, some analysts had been concerned about the efficacy of the drug.
The tests showed that only one-third of patients achieved the target urinary
flow rates. They pointed out that drugs already on the market created more
symptomatic relief than Proscar.
Merck has argued that the drug deals with the cause of problems by retarding
the growth of the prostrate. Proscar may be capable of halting progression
of the disease and could also be used with existing symptomatic relief
drugs, the company said.
The drug is the first in a new class of drug called 5-alpha reductose
inhibitors which deal with the underlying hormonal changes such as those
causing prostrate enlargement.
Merck applied for European licences last summer.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLOWDOWN in world stainless steel production and weak prices caused
Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), the world's second largest
ferrochrome producer, to record a small loss in the six months to
end-December.
CMI, a member of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, made
an attributable loss of R180,000 (Dollars 64,000). This was a considerable
improvement over the R14.7m loss the group made in the same period in 1990.
Turnover rose by 41 per cent to R143.7m and operating profit improved to
R10.4m from a R5.1m loss previously. Interest payments were down, following
a R102m rights issue last year, but payment of a R4.3m preference dividend
drove the company into loss.
Mr David Kovarsky, chairman, said the results were worse than expected
because volumes had been down and the group had hoped for a higher price. He
added, however, that the group was happy to be keeping its head above water,
given the difficult state of the ferrochrome market.
Mr Allan Kuhnert, marketing director, said world stainless steel production
had dropped 6.6 per cent in the second half of 1991 compared with 1990
levels.
No interim dividend was declared.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Sterling resilience helps gilts advance
strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds gained up to half a point yesterday, boosted by
sterling's resilience and some switching out of the German and French bond
markets into gilts.
The market started strongly and rose further on news that the Bank of
England will issue Pounds 550m in tap stocks for sale today.
The long end of the gilt-edged market appears to have benefited from
Monday's wage settlement in Germany: market participants feel the Bundesbank
will be forced to keep German interest rates high for some time, following
the German steelworkers' 6.4 per cent pay increase, thereby reducing the
scope for a cut in the UK base rate.
'The high wage settlement in Germany is good for inflation in the UK, so
people are switching out of short-dated gilts into longer-dated issues,'
said one dealer yesterday.
The long end of the market gained up to half a percentage point, with the
benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rising from 115 13/16 to 116 9/32
by late afternoon.
The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 97.13 to a high of 98.00 before
ending at around 97.26.
News of the tap issues was well received in the market. The Bank of England
is issuing Pounds 150m of the 9 1/2 per cent Treasury loan due 1999, Pounds
150m of the 12 1/4 per cent Exchequer stock due 1999 and Pounds 250m of 9
1/2 per cent Conversion stock due 2005.
Traders said that demand for the gilts due 1999 was likely to be good as the
market is short of these issues.
GERMAN government bond prices picked up yesterday, helped by the US Treasury
bond market's lead, but closed only slightly higher, having failed to break
through an important resistance level.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.83 and traded up to 87.95, but
was unable to break through the 88.00 resistance level.
JAPANESE government bonds closed lower yesterday following an increase in
some short-term interest rates and weakness in the US Treasury bond market
on Monday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 5.395 per
cent to close at 5.455 in Tokyo, although traders noted that European buying
helped to push up prices in London trading with the No 129's yield reaching
5.44 per cent.
Three-month certificate of deposit rates continued to rise, trading up to
5.19 per cent yesterday from Monday's level of 5.15 per cent. US TREASURIES
followed overseas markets higher yesterday, but trading was thin ahead of
today's refunding announcement.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond regained most of Monday's losses,
adding to 102 23/32 and yielding 7.76 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities,
which fell less dramatically the previous day, posted more modest gains of
about  1/8 in late trading.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange overnight matched
sales when Fed funds were trading at 3 7/8 per cent. There was no policy
meaning attached to the move, which drains reserves from the banking system.
The market initially lost ground after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, indicated a fur ther easing of monetary policy was
unlikely.
However, the market later took some of its strength from comments by Mr
Greenspan which left the door open for a further easing if economic
conditions warrant.

COCA-COLA Amatil, Aus-tralia's largest soft drink and snack food group, has
lent weight to the recession-proof reputation of its operations with a solid
sales and earnings performance for 1991, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The company yesterday announced an 8.2 per cent rise in net profits to
ADollars 68.9m (USDollars 51.8m) for the year to December against ADollars
63.7m a year earlier.
Sales advanced 16.6 per cent to ADollars 1.79bn from ADollars 1.54bn. The
annual dividend is up to 15.5 cents a share from 14.5 cents.
Coca-Cola Amatil, which dominates Coke bottling and distribution in the
Pacific Basin, completed a divestment programme during the year to limit its
operations to the core businesses of beverages and snack food.
The biggest divestment was the company's packaging division which helped
reduce net interest payments from ADollars 92.9m to ADollars 82.3m.
Depreciation charges also dropped from ADollars 58.7m to ADollars 54.0 m.

PEPSICO, the international soft drinks, restaurants and snacks group,
yesterday reported near-static after-tax profits for 1991 of Dollars 1.08bn
compared with Dollars 1.076bn for the previous year. The fourth-quarter
earnings figure improved marginally from Dollars 265.9m to Dollars 271.1m.
However, year-on-year comparisons are muddied by restructuring and other
charges.
Pepsico said 1991 income from continuing operations stood at Dollars 1.67bn
 -unchanged from the previous year. This was scored after a Dollars 127m
restructuring item at the snack foods business, Dollars 34m at Kentucky
Fried Chicken worldwide, and Dollars 9m at the domestic Kentucky Fried
Chicken operation.
Restructuring charges in the fourth quarter totalled Dollars 69.6m.
The previous year's figure for operating income from continuing operations,
also Dollars 1.67bn, enjoyed the benefit of a Dollars 35.2m unusual surplus
item.
During the year, Pepsico reported that overall sales growth was 10 per cent,
reaching Dollars 19.6bn.
Soft drinks saw an overall 11 per cent profits advance before unusual
charges, on 6 per cent sales growth.

   TORONTO, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian subsidiaries of Dow Chemical and Amoco have agreed to a vast
swap of interests in oil and gas properties, paving the way for the creation
of a leading, publicly-traded energy company.
The exchange involves about 5,000 properties in western Canada valued at
over CDollars 1bn (USDollars 854.7m), and also includes Encor, an ailing
Calgary-based oil and gas producer which had a partial interest in many of
the properties.
As a result of the exchange, Amoco will have sole ownership of 2,500
properties, while Encor will own 1,100. The remainder will be owned by
Maligne Resources, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical.
Amoco and Maligne plan a further rationalisation in which many of the
properties will be placed in Crestar Energy, a new company which is expected
to be taken public by 1994.
The formation of Crestar will allow Dow to withdraw from the oil and gas
business by spinning off Maligne. Dow became involved in the oil and gas
sector in the 1970s. The company hoped to use the business as a lever to
expand its interests in petrochemicals, notably ethylene.
The properties that Amoco will contribute to Crestar are mostly those that
it bought as part of its CDollars 5.2bn takeover of Dome Petroleum in 1988.
In the process, Amoco will be able to fulfil a promise to the Canadian
government at the time of the Dome Petroleum acquisition to spin off part of
its business to the Canadian public. NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and
chemicals conglomerate, suffered a sharp fall in operating profit last year
to FIM2.7bn from the FIM4.1bn in 1990, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The company blamed the decline on the performance of its chemicals business.
Net sales, however, rose by 11 per cent to FM51.9bn, with the biggest
increase coming in the group's oil trading activities and sales of crude
oil.

<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit ratings agency, yesterday estimated the
chances of a successful reorganisation at Trans World Airlines to be 'even,
at best', adding that it viewed the airline's long-term prospects as 'poor'.
TWA filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code last
Friday, and its owner, Mr Carl Icahn, has been reported as saying that the
carrier has a '90-10 chance to make it'. However, some analysts have been
more sceptical. S&amp;P has already attached 'D' ratings to the company's senior
notes.
In its analysis of the situation, S&amp;P pointed out that the filing fell short
of a 'pre-packaged bankruptcy' - where a reorganisation scheme has already
been agreed with all creditors and the bankruptcy mechanism is merely used
to implement it.
It suggests that the timing of the filing 'appears to be motivated by the
conclusion of preliminary agreements with most creditors and a continuing
cash drain that may necessitate debtor-in-possession financing to continue
operations'.
However, S&amp;P also noted the potential pension problem at TWA, and the fact
that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation - a federal agency which
essentially guarantees basic pension payments - has not agreed to the
reorganisation as outlined.
The PBGC has claimed that TWA's pension plans are underfunded by Dollars
933m, although this is subject to some dispute. At present, because of the
level of Mr Icahn's ownership, a liquidation at TWA could allow the PBGC to
seek recovery from other Icahn-controlled entities. However, if the
reorganisation scheme reduced Mr Icahn's stake below 50 per cent - as
envisaged - this access would disappear under US law.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Apple and Dell slash prices by
over 30%

<TEXT>
PERSONAL computer prices continue to tumble in the US as manufacturers
compete fiercely for a larger share of the slow-growth market. Two leading
manufacturers yesterday announced price cuts of over 30 per cent.
Apple Computer cut US prices for several of its Macintosh models by up to 36
per cent. The company is expected to introduce new models later in the year,
and analysts suggested the cuts were designed to clear inventories.
Apple said the price reductions would allow it to continue the momentum of
its aggressive strategy to build market share, launched a year ago when it
sharply cut its prices.
The company said that last year it had increased Macintosh unit shipments by
more than 60 per cent and net sales by 14 per cent.
The current price reductions cover most of Apple's Macintosh product family,
with the exception of the highest performance models and the new portable
Macintosh PowerBook 140 and 170 models.
Dell Computer also slashed prices by up to 38 per cent across its full line
of portable, desktop and floor-standing personal computers.
Dell has brought considerable competitive pressure to bear upon market
leaders, including International Business Machines and Compaq Computer, with
its direct sales marketing strategy and lower prices.
Recently, however, its prices have been undercut by a myriad of 'clone'
builders offering similar systems at even lower prices through discount
computer 'superstores' in the US.
Dell's new price reductions would make it even more difficult for companies
such as Compaq to compete in the US personal computer market, analysts said.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: American Express to back insurer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express and its Shearson Lehman investment banking subsidiary have
agreed to inject Dollars 50m in First Capital Life Insurance (FCL), the
ailing life company seized last May by state insurance regulators. They have
also agreed to underpin the value of policyholders' contracts.
The aim is to rehabilitate the insurer, whose troubles stemmed largely from
its heavy junk bond exposure and a significant policyholder run last year.
As part of the deal with the California regulators, American Express and
Shearson will take over management of FCL - earning a 'modest' but
undisclosed fee - while selling down a portion of the junk bond portfolio.
During a five-year rehabilitation programme and for a short period after
this, they will also have an option to acquire 100 per cent of First
Capital's assets and liabilities at 20 per cent of their
actuarial-determined value. At end-1991, First Capital had around Dollars
4bn in assets, 190,000 policyholders and 60,000 annuitants.
The involvement of American Express and Shearson with First Capital dates
back to the 1980s. In November 1988, Robert Weingarten, who had built the
fast-growing company partly by acquisitions and partly by selling highly
competitive policies backed by a high-yielding portfolio of junk bonds, sold
his family stake in the insurer's parent company to Shearson.
Shearson, meanwhile, sold a large number of First Capital policies to its
own clients between 1986 and 1991.
When the junk bond market collapsed and the troubles at neighbouring
Executive Life, another junk bond-ridden California insurer, hit the
headlines, many First Capital policyholders sought to cash in their
policies. Around 36,000 contracts were surrendered between January 1991 and
May, when the regulators stepped in.
Last spring, Mr John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner, had
sought a capital infusion from American Express/Shearson - which holds a 28
per cent stake in First Capital Holdings, the bankrupt parent company - but
he met resistance. Asked yesterday why this solution had taken so long to
arrange, he said only that it was 'a very complex business'.

Whitecroft, the building products, lighting and textiles group, has sold the
housebuilding division of its George Longden Estates subsidiary to a
management buy-out as part of its plan to withdraw from property
development.
The sale, for a total Pounds 6.95m, includes the repayment of borrowings of
Pounds 5.07m and an initial cash payment of Pounds 1.06m which will reduce
Whitecroft's borrowings by Pounds 6.13m.
A further Pounds 820,000 in cash will be paid one year from completion.
Whitecroft has retained some part-exchange houses and an almost completed
development in Cheshire which is expected to realise a total of Pounds 4m.
In the year to March 31 1991 the division achieved profits of Pounds 697,000
and net assets at that date were Pounds 3.27m.
The managers are supported by 3i, Murray Ventures and Ventures North West.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced costs of sales, distribution and administration, together with lower
interest charges, helped Heritage, the USM-quoted housewares importer and
distributor, to report reduced interim losses.
The deficit of Pounds 96,000 pre-tax for the six months to October 31
compared with a loss of Pounds 198,000 last time, a figure struck after
exceptional costs of Pounds 205,000.
Interest charges amounted to Pounds 246,000, down from Pounds 326,000.
Turnover dipped from Pounds 5.82m to Pounds 5.36m, but Mr Jeffrey Lampert,
chairman and chief executive, said the shortfall would be made up in the
second half. Turnover in the last full year totalled Pounds 10.5m.
Losses per share were cut from 3.7p to 1.78p, but directors considered it
'inappropriate' to declare an interim distribution.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Tougher times for composites - Rising
reinsurance rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALREADY enfeebled by their losses from recession and weather-related claims
over the past two years, UK composite insurers are facing tough increases in
their reinsurance costs and a reduction in cover in some instances.
With negotiations still proceeding in some cases, insurers are reluctant to
give details, but five of the country's leading insurers - General Accident,
Sun Alliance, Commercial Union, Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance
 -face increases of at least 25 per cent. Underpinning these developments
are two related trends.
UK insurers are presenting their reinsurers with serious losses. In 1990
four of the five recorded pre-tax losses for the first time for at least a
generation. That result was heavily influenced by the Pounds 4bn cost of the
storm losses of January and February 1990 and reinsurers responded by
pushing up rates by multiples of three and four times.
Reinsurers, such as Germany's Munich Re and Switzerland's Swiss Re, are
themselves facing much tighter conditions in the retrocession market, where
they buy their own reinsurance protections. Between 1987 and 1990 reinsurers
in the retrocession market, much of which is concentrated at Lloyd's of
London, were hit by a string of catastrophe losses - ranging from the Piper
Alpha oil rig explosion in the North Sea in 1988, to hurricane Hugo in 1989
and the January storms in 1990.
Total losses amounted to more than Pounds 18bn and the impact has forced
many players out of business with those remaining pushing through
significant increases in rates. And although 1991 was relatively free of
major catastrophe losses, reinsurers were hit by a number of medium-sized
losses in the last three months of the year. Together losses from Typhoon 19
in Japan, a forest fire in Oakland, California, a hailstorm in Calgary and
hurricane Bob in North America led to claims in excess of Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.6bn).
Reinsurers have, therefore, been squeezed and although UK insurers had hoped
to escape further increases this year they have found their reinsurers in a
surprisingly tough mood over the past three months.
As a result negotiations have been long drawn out. Many contracts which are
normally completed a number of weeks before Christmas have only been
completed in the past few days. One large mutual office is understood to
have completed its programme last week.
'This has been the most horrendous renewal season that most individuals on
the market can remember,' comments one London broker. 'European reinsurers
were unhappy with the extent of increases they were able to obtain last year
and since the summer of last year have been co-ordinating efforts to obtain
much higher rates', says another broker.
Reinsurers have been forcing through tough new terms for the proportional
treaties - in which they assume a fixed percentage of an insurer's
liabilities for a fixed percentage of the original premium.
The rate of commission which reinsurers pay for this business has been cut
drastically. Reinsurers who paid between 25 per cent and 27 per cent at the
beginning of 1991 have paid as little as 7.5 per cent this year.
In one case reinsurers have insisted on the introduction of 'loss
participation clauses,' arrangements whereby insurers refund the original
reinsurance commission if the business they cede eventually generates
losses.
Not surprisingly, many insurers have refused to buy proportional covers on
these terms and have been forced to rely exclusively on non-proportional
covers, in which the reinsurer agrees to pay all losses above an annual
aggregate level.
Here, too, though prices have been increased and terms have been tightened.
Last year four of the UK's five composite insurers paid between Pounds 25m
and Pounds 30m for policies covering them from aggregate losses of up about
Pounds 250m.
Reinsurers are known to have successfully achieved rate increases of at
least 25 per cent - following rises of up to 400 per cent last year.
Last year the UK's leading five insurers paid over Pounds 125m for their
non-proportional reinsurance.
And in at least one case a trigger point of about Pounds 50m has been set,
with the implication that insurers carry a much higher proportion of their
losses on their own books.
This shift has also had implications for the cash flow of insurers.
While payments for proportional reinsurance are made on a quarterly basis,
insurers pay up front for their non-proportional protections.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Activities that distort earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME engineering companies are using Britain's ambiguous accounting
standards to boost their earnings per share figures, a research report from
Williams de Broe, the brokers, suggests.
It concludes that some UK engineering groups are 'smoothing' their earnings
in a way that does not fairly reflect trading performance, although it
stresses that none is contravening accounting standards.
Mr Mustapha Omar, an engineering analyst, highlights a series of activities
which distort earnings in the companies.
TI Group had made sizeable provisions over the last few years to allow it to
restructure companies that it has acquired. It writes off these costs
against the balance sheet and feeds them back over a period of up to four
years. It is unclear how these sums allocated for restructuring are spent.
De Broe estimates that TI will have Pounds 25m to spend in 1992 and beyond
which will make it difficult to determine the company's underlying
profitability.
TI's depreciation rates on plant, machinery and equipment - at 7.5 per cent
to 10 per cent - are about half the sector average of 16 per cent.
Even when weighted to reflect the type of assets held within this range, de
Broe estimates that TI's depreciation is still 12.5 per cent. This has the
effect of increasing pre-tax profits for 1990 by Pounds 8.3m above the level
that would be generated if the sector average was used.
Siebe has gradually been capitalising more of its research and development
costs, including prototype costs and computer software, and extending the
period over which they are written off.
Prototype costs have risen as a result from nil in 1988 to Pounds 33.3m in
1991.
British Aerospace makes substantial provisions in the balance sheet on
acquisitions which can later release to the profit and loss account to help
boost earnings. For example, in 1990 it released Pounds 130m in provisions,
which converted operating losses of Pounds 44m against Rover into profits of
Pounds 55m.
However, Mr Michael Garner, finance director at TI, said the analysis was
'pretty extreme'. He stressed that comparisons between the different
companies were difficult because of the nature of their business.
TI, he said, had slower depreciation rates because it was less
capital-intensive than many of its counter-parts.
He added that the group would be disclosing its provisions on pensions from
next year, which would make the accounts clearer.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Contractors may be paid in Tunnel shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL, the Anglo-French tunnel operator, could offer new shares in part
settlement of claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn being sought
by contractors building the project.
Such a move would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders but might get
over a hurdle of how to finance part of the increased cost of the project
which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn.
Eurotunnel's share price yesterday fell 15p to 445p following speculation
that settlement of claims might include a share issue.
Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French
construction companies building the project, have been locked in
negotiations with Eurotunnel over claims for extra payments since November.
A member of the consortium said yesterday: 'Various possibilities are being
explored including the possibility of Eurotunnel issuing new shares.
'These discussions are continuing and no deal has been agreed. If such an an
offer was made it would form only a very small part of any settlement.'
Eurotunnel yesterday declined to comment on speculation of how it might fund
payment of claims. It said: 'At present there is no agreement in prospect
either on the amount or on the possible form of payment.'
It added that any issue of new shares 'would require the consent of
Eurotunnel shareholders which has not been sought.'
Transmanche is claiming extra payments of up to Pounds 800m at 1985 prices,
including a Pounds 160m additional management fee, to cover the increased
cost of fitting out the rail tunnels and building two passenger terminals at
Folkestone, Kent, and Sangatte, northern France.
Eurotunnel has told contractors that it has set aside contingency funds of
up to Pounds 450m at 1985 prices to cover possible claims - although not all
this money might be available if contractors do not substantiate their
claims under the terms of the contract.
TML has threatened to halt work on the project unless it is paid at least
sufficient to cover the cost of the works. A bid by Eurotunnel to prevent
contractors halting work on installing a cooling system in the twin rail
tunnel was rejected last month by the British Court of Appeal.
The contractors, however, are unlikely to halt work while negotiations are
continuing.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Forte cleared over property depreciation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels group, yesterday agreed to provide more information on
property depreciation policies in its next annual report, in the fourth
public settlement reached by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the new
watchdog of the Accounting Standards Board.
The panel said it accepted Forte's explanation and saw no need for further
action, but that the company had agreed to provide more information on
depreciation policies in the future.
The move appeared to clear Forte of any violation of existing accounting
standards, but also implicitly endorsed the practice of not depreciating
certain fixed assets which has been adopted by a significant number of
companies.
Forte does not depreciate freehold properties or leaseholds longer than 20
years, arguing that their long lives and the money spent each year on their
repair and improvement make any depreciation charge 'insignificant'.
The panel investigated the company's approach to see whether it contravened
SSAP 12, an accounting standard that deals with depreciation. It states that
there should be a provision for depreciation on fixed assets with a 'finite
useful economic life' equivalent to the difference between their cost and
their 'estimated residual value'.
In Forte's accounts for the year to January 31 1991, land and buildings held
freehold or on long leases are valued at Pounds 2.7bn or 62 per cent of all
fixed assets, compared with Pounds 2.6bn or 66 per cent for the previous 12
months.
Mr Donald Main, finance director, said the company typically spends about 10
per cent of turnover from its hotels division on improving buildings. That
would represent about Pounds 91m last year.
'Our philosophy is that we invest heavily in our property on a regular basis
to maintain and improve the buildings so they appreciate in value. There is
no logic in depreciating them.'
However, in the absence of any new accounting standard on depreciation, the
panel's acceptance of Forte's accounts is likely to encourage other
companies to continue using similar techniques on their balance sheets.
Mr Allan Cook, technical director of the Accounting Standards Board, said:
'This whole area is in dispute at the moment. We will not dodge the issue
but we want to address it as a whole and not slate individual companies.'
The ASB may issue a draft reporting standard on property values after the
summer.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Insurers face 25% increasein cost of reinsurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH insurers are facing increases of at least 25 per cent in their
reinsurance costs following negotiations with international reinsurance
companies.
Five of the country's biggest general insurers - Commercial Union, Sun
Alliance, Royal Insurance, Guardian Royal Exchange and General Accident  -
are all affected by the rises.
Reinsurers, such as Germany's Munich Re, increased rates by up to 400 per
cent last year after they bore the brunt of the devastating storms of
January 1990.
The general insurers had been expecting to avoid further increases this
year, but reinsurers, who are themselves facing losses from a string of
catastrophes over the past five years, have taken a hard line and forced
through price rises and tougher terms.
According Mr Allan Nicholls, analyst at James Capel, the stockbroker, the
'market has tightened further for UK companies'.
Analysts suggest some companies have not been able to complete their
reinsurance programmes and insurers have been forced to carry a greater
proportion of risks on their own accounts.
The extra costs come as the industry braces itself for record-breaking
losses of more than Pounds 1bn in 1991 when its reporting season begins in
three weeks.
Mortgage indemnity business - which is not generally reinsured - will
generate more than half the total loss.
Mr Stephen Bird, analyst at Smith New Court, the securities house, expects
deterioration in other areas with losses from recession and weather-related
claims climbing.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Crisis casts a long shadow / A look at prospects for the
world's steelmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The world steel industry probably wishes it could start 1992 over again. It
has got off to a bad start.
In Europe thousands of jobs are being cut. Early last month British Steel
announced plans to close the remaining blast furnaces at its forlorn
Ravenscraig plant in Scotland.
Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned group which is Europe's largest
producer, last week estimated its 1991 losses at FFr3.1bn (Pounds 317m) and
announced plans to cut 8,000 jobs, about 13 per cent of its workforce in the
next three years.
The normally stable German producers, the heart of the European industry
accounting for about a third of production, are in turmoil. This week's pay
agreement with IG Metall to avert a strike is likely to lead to a faster
rate of job losses. German analysts expect at least 6,000 job losses this
year in the industry's workforce of 130,000.
They will be partly produced by mergers among Germany's string of
steelmakers. By the end of the year Krupp and Hoesch should have merged to
create a second force in the German industry to compete with Thyssen, which
is merging its special steels division into general steel.
The prospect of both these groups cutting their costs is almost certain to
put pressure on medium-sized steel producers such as Klockner Werke and
Peine Salzgitter in Germany and Hoogovens in the Netherlands to follow suit
by gaining economies of scale through partnerships and alliances.
Ilva, the Italian group which is Europe's second largest producer is in the
midst of a plan to sell 20 per cent of its production. But with its profits
plunging and few buyers in the market for inefficient steel plants it seems
almost certain that Ilva will be pushed soon into politically painful moves
to cut costs and jobs, especially at its Piombino plant on the coast
opposite Elba.
The tale of woe from Europe's leading integrated steel producers is echoed
across the Atlantic.
Inland Steel last month reported it made its largest ever loss in 1991 of
Dollars 275m (Pounds 151m). It plans to spend about Dollars 215m in the next
three years to cut about 3,500 jobs.
US Steel, the largest integrated producer which is the steel arm of USX,
reported a loss for the year of Dollars 507m against net income of Dollars
310m in 1990. Bethlehem Steel, the second largest producer, is to cut its
workforce by almost 25 per cent by selling or closing down several
operations.
In the coming months the US and European producers could be joined by
Japan's integrated producers in declaring sharply lower profits. The mighty
Nippon Steel, the world's largest producer has already warned that profits
are under severe pressure.
Yet these three months may mark the industry's low point from which it could
begin to recover.
Demand may be stabilising. The OECD expects steel demand in the OECD
economies to fall by about 1 per cent this year after a 5.2 per cent fall
last year. Prices for steel used in some consumer products are firming in
Europe and the US. The worst may be over as stronger world growth encourages
a revival in investment and output from vital customer industries such as
cars and trucks.
That optimism may be misplaced. The path to recovery is difficult to predict
because the course of the downturn has confounded expectations. In both the
US and Europe the decline in output and demand has been relatively modest
but the impact on the steelmakers' finances has been great.
Mr Christopher Plummer, director of steel services for Wefa, the
Pennsylvania-based forecasting group said: 'The volume of US steel shipped
to customers last year fell by 8 per cent. In previous recessions the fall
was more than 20 per cent. The fall in volumes has been mild but the
financial and corporate impact has been huge.'
The explanation is that in Europe as well as the US structural factors have
exacerbated the fall in output as marginal producers have been able to set
very low prices.
In the US the main complicating factor has been the rise of the low cost
mini-mills, which combine new technology electric arc furnaces with
non-union labour, innovative payment systems and wafer-thin management
layers, to produce low cost steel especially for the construction industry.
Through the depths of the recession the most competitive mini-mills - Nucor,
Chapparal and Birmingham - have been making profits, according to Mr
Plummer.
In Europe the problem has been created by subsidised public sector producers
who cut prices to maintain market share and keep plants running. These
producers have driven down prices for the rest of the industry.
The growing integration of world steel markets has amplified the pricing
problem. For much of the last two years lower demand from the former Soviet
Union and China has forced exporters to find other markets for their steel.
In the next year lower steel demand in Japan and Germany will force their
producers to export more. This could dash the hopes of US and European
producers that 1992 will bring a measure of stability.
This year US exports are likely to fall by 22 per cent while imports to rise
8 per cent sucked in by the expected recovery.
Any recovery this year in the steel markets of Europe and the US is likely
to be halting and patchy. The companies which stand to benefit will be in
the right parts of the steel market, in the right parts of the world.
Long products producers, who supply beams and heavy-duty wire to the
construction industry, will continue to suffer on both sides of the
Atlantic. In the US virtually all the big integrated producers have
withdrawn from this sector in the face of the competitive challenge of the
mini-mills.
The main beneficiaries of recovery will be groups such as Usinor, Hoesch and
Thyssen of Germany which are the biggest flat products makers.
The other factor which should distinguish groups able to take advantage of
recovery will be the geographic spread of their activities. Thyssen should
be hit by slower growth in Germany but it makes 15 per cent of its revenues
in the US which should be recovering, compared with US turnover of 5 per
cent at British Steel.
The boom of the late 1980s which returned steelmakers to profit in the US
and Europe proved shortlived. The effects of the downturn of the early 1990s
will reverberate through the industry for several years to come.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Agnelli setback in bid for Perrier
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AGNELLI family of Italy yesterday suffered a setback in its battle with
Nestle, the powerful Swiss food group, for control of Perrier, France's
famous mineral water group, when an investigation by the French stock market
authorities uncovered 'serious weaknesses' in the conduct of Perrier and
Exor, its controlling shareholder.
This investigation comes at a critical time for the Agnellis who late last
month saw their friendly FFr5.6bn (Pounds 572.2m) bid for Exor turn into a
dramatic fight for Perrier when Nestle launched a FFr13.42bn hostile bid for
the mineral water company in conjunction with with Banque Indosuez, the
Paris bank.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the regulatory body behind the
investigation, also raised questions about the recent FFr1.5bn purchase of
14 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, another company associated with the
Agnellis.
Although Exor president Mr Jacques Vincent also chairs Perrier, the COB said
it could not 'prove with certainty' that the boards of Exor and Saint Louis
had used 'privileged information about the Nestle bid' in orchestrating the
share sale.
The Agnellis' allies - Exor and Saint Louis - can effectively block the
Nestle bid as they control nearly 50 per cent of Perrier's shares.
However the legality of the Saint Louis share purchase is now the subject of
a case in the Paris commercial court. The court's ruling, due on February
25, will hinge on whether the Perrier board did act on privileged
information to sell the shares simply to block the imminent Nestle bid.
The COB will send the conclusions of its investigation to the Paris court.
It will also submit its findings on Exor's relationship with Perrier to the
commercial court in Nimes where Nestle has filed a case to freeze the voting
rights on Exor's 35 per cent share of the mineral water company. Nestle has
already won a temporary injunction for this.
The COB criticised the Exor and Perrier boards for the 'inadequacies' and
'contradictions' in the information released to shareholders about the
extent of Exor's involvement in Perrier.
It also criticised the role of Mr Gustave Leven, former president of the
mineral water company.
The COB's conclusions will help to influence the outcome of the Paris and
Nimes cases. If either court rules against the Agnelli camp, the blocking
stake against Nestle would disappear and Nestle and Indosuez could win
control of Perrier.
The European Commission has also begun a routine inquiry into the Agnellis'
bid for Exor.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Steel deal worries German industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN industry and stock markets expressed disappointment yesterday at the
6.35 per cent pay award for steelworkers as the implications of the pay deal
announced on Monday sank in.
Economists warned that the Bundesbank would keep monetary policy tight,
while the country's leading steelmaker, Thyssen Stahl, said the deal would
cost the company DM100m (Pounds 34.7m) this year.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the powerful IG Metall union, deepened the
depression with a declaration that the settlement would act as a 'guideline'
for his 4m engineering members, negotiations on whose pay starts next month.
Mr Hans Karl Schneider, chairman of the group of independent economic
advisers to the government known as the 'five wise men', said the steel
industry would find it very hard to live with the result. Rationalisation
and job losses would follow. The IfW world economic institute in Kiel
claimed the Bundesbank would respond with 'a restrictive monetary policy'.
However, no changes in interest rates are expected at tomorrow's Bundesbank
council meeting; the Lombard and discount rates were raised by an
unexpectedly high half a point in December. In Munich, the Ifo institute
said the steel settlement was too high, though it would not tip the economy
into recession. A lower pay deal would have made it simpler for the central
bank to ease policy later in the year. It expected no further monetary
tightening, however.
Most economic forecasts for this year have been based partly on the
assumption that pay awards would average 5.5 per cent. The weekend bargain,
reached after steelworkers voted overwhelmingly for strike action, suggests
employers will have to dig deeper.
The steel package comprised an all-round 5.9 per cent increase and a one-off
payment of DM175. In the light of the deal and Mr Steinkuhler's stance,
assumptions on pay increases have been increased to 6 per cent. The Dax
stock market index fell 12.61 yesterday and closed at the day's low of
1,674.6.
Motor manufacturers, while relieved that a strike had been avoided and that
steel deliveries would continue, were concerned that the 5.9 per cent basic
award should not apply to the engineering sector.
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, head of the metalworking industries' trade
association, said wages had to be related more closely to productivity.

<TEXT>
A remarkable number of flotations is being mooted on the London market,
ranging from the big to the enormous. The companies are domestic - MFI and
3i - and international, such as Guinness Peat Aviation and Waste Management
International. The revival of public offerings is not new in the US, where
the total raised last year was not far short of the 1987 record. But in the
UK the phenomenon is more curious, given the uncertain economic outlook and
the imminence of the election.
It could plausibly be argued that private companies have until lately been
crowded out of the UK market by the privatisation programme. It may also be
that companies are now more confident about their future; though in that
case, it is not immediately obvious why they should dilute their equity and
reduce their debt ahead of the upturn. It is also possible that UK companies
do not actually intend to float before the election, but nevertheless think
it prudent to set the ball rolling early. All that leaves open the question
of why investors, who are plainly in two minds about the equity market in
general, should warm to untried newcomers.
In the case of US companies seeking to float simultaneously in the US and
Europe, investors might be more wary again. International equity offerings
have become commonplace enough in recent years. But at a time when most US
stocks are rated higher than their UK counterparts, the attraction of
tapping a wider pool of savings may be offset by the reduction in the
earnings multiple. Investors may also recall London's great US flotations of
the past, ranging from the ghastly International Signal down to the hapless
Mrs Fields.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The lull in the battle for Perrier, as all sides seek advantage in the
courts, is another striking reminder of that great cross-frontier struggle
in 1988 between Mr Carlo De Benedetti and Societe Generale de Belgique.
Then, as now, an Italian was cast in the role of unwelcome guest at a
Francophone feast. Then, as now, the local establishment enlisted outside
support to repel the threat, and Parisian banks were at each other's
throats. Even the contentious issuing of Perrier Treasury stock to Agnelli's
allies at St Louis - the subject of the most important legal argument at
present - has a parallel in the hasty issue of shares by SGB to its trusted
friends.
The interesting question is whether the hectic Brussels denouement,
involving a frantic race for the last free shares, will be repeated. The
odds must be against it. One of the differences this time is that Mr Gianni
Agnelli, unlike Mr De Benedetti, is not an outsider. Pride would obviously
not allow him to accept outright defeat, but, though some of his alliances
appear to have broken down, they are probably strong enough to leave room
for compromise.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over electricity prices for large users has resurfaced at an awkward
time for the government, and more so for Mr John Baker, the chief executive
of National Power. Presumably, Mr Baker already regrets his recent attempt
to deflect criticism of the two generators, in which he urged large users to
look past higher prices and examine instead the subsidy they pay to Nuclear
Electric. He thereby handed them a surprisingly powerful weapon. Their
threat to withhold the nuclear levy, which adds 11 per cent to their bills,
is a neat way to extend an argument which appeared lost.
It may be that the government will turn a blind eye and hope the problem
fades as the next round of electricity contracts is signed. But there is no
suggestion that the generators intend to reduce prices. The prospect that
small consumers would eventually pick up the tab is uncomfortably close to
the hidden subsidy to industry that privatisation was designed to end.
Meanwhile, Nuclear Electric has been reminded that by any normal measure it
is hopelessly uncompetitive.
The question is whether there is anything more than political horse-trading
to be done. The answer is almost certainly not. After all, the roots of the
problem lie in the industry structure chosen by the government, which will
scarcely be altered now. The generating duopoly has been putting up
electricity prices much as forecast before privatisation. What was not
foreseen was that large industrial customers would be in deep recession. But
their attempt to appeal to the government is an implicit admission that
head-on confrontation with the generators is fruitless. That explains why
the generators' shares have so far been unaffected. Cautious investors are
doubtless not counting on the argument disappearing altogether.

FT  05 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: The Eurotunnel paperchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,556.8 (-3.4)
The difference between a Eurotunnel share issue and most others is that the
Anglo-French company ends up with nothing tangible to show for it. The
exercise is wholly dilutive. It is therefore not surprising that the market
was less than enthused by yesterday's rumours, later confirmed, that the
tunnel operator has toyed with a plan to issue new paper rather than ready
cash to the disgruntled contractors.
It is not clear, though, that existing shareholders need be sceptical. For a
start, Eurotunnel's articles ensure that nothing can be done behind their
backs. Beyond that, they might as well face facts. It is most unlikely that
the Pounds 850m or so margin between Eurotunnel's estimated peak financing
requirement and total available resources will be enough both to settle the
claims and to pay for the likely cost overruns between now and the tunnel
opening. Investors should not set their minds against anything which might
just break the present deadlock, and which would have the added attraction
of tying in the likes of Taylor Woodrow, Wimpey and Costain more firmly over
the next 18 months to two years.
The main issue, though, is whether the builders would be tempted. They are
arguably under more pressure than Eurotunnel, with the finalisation of their
1991 accounts looming. Whether they would surrender their right to real
money is another matter. They would certainly be wise to demand a hefty
discount on new shares in return for any restrictions on selling them.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez last night said that loyal troops
had finally stamped out all resistance from soldiers attempting to topple
the democratically-elected government.
Nearly 24 hours after the coup attempt, Mr Perez said in a televised address
that 'all those who participated in this disgraceful attack either gave
themselves up or were beaten'.
General Fernando Ochoa Antich, the defence minister, told a press conference
that the military counted 14 dead and 51 wounded as a result of the attack -
including both loyal forces and rebels. The loyalists detained 133 officers
and 956 soldiers.
Those captured included the coup leader, Commandante Hugo Chavez who also
appeared on television, urging his comrades to surrender. He said his
faction was called the Movimiento Militar Bolivariano, named after Simon
Bolivar, the Venezuelan who liberated South America from Spanish rule.
As Mr Perez sought yesterday to bring the country under his control, the
government decreed a 10-day suspension of constitutional guarantees. This
provided a wide range of special powers, including the right to search homes
and detain citizens without warrants.
Stock market activity was suspended for two days and a two-day halt decreed
in foreign currency transactions to avert panic in markets, Mr Ruben
Rodriguez, the labour minister, announced.
Gen Ochoa said the foiled coup, which started around midnight on Monday in
Caracas, the capital, and three other cities was organised by five army
units. It was the first attempt at a coup in Venezuela since the early 1960s
and follows growing anger over economic reforms that have failed to benefit
the majority of Venezuelans. However, the uprising took the country by
surprise despite rumours of a coup late last year.
In an earlier televised appearance yesterday Mr Perez, looking shaken, said
the rebels had tried to kill him.
President George Bush condemned the attempted coup and telephoned Mr Perez
to assure him of full US support. The European Community and 16 Latin
American presidents also condemned the attack.
The president was warned about the uprising upon his return to Venezuela
from a trip to Davos, Switzerland, and he went immediately from the airport
to the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas. Rebels, who first sought
him out at the La Casona presidential residence, then attacked the palace.
A senior officer said the rebels were within a few rooms of the president
before security staff took him to safety.
Gen Ochoa said the rebellious units also attacked the Defence Ministry, a
military airport in Caracas and other military targets.
Yesterday afternoon F-16 jets swooped over the capital as loyalist troops
sought to flush out resistance at the airport. During the uprising, the
commandant of the air force and the governor of Zulia state were taken
hostage.

THE MURDER of three men at offices of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA, yesterday formed a violent backdrop to the first official visit to
Northern Ireland by an Irish president since the partition of Ireland in
1921.
A 24-year-old off-duty police constable opened fire at Sinn Fein's west
Belfast advice centre about lunchtime, killing three and injuring two
others. He later shot himself dead.
It was the first time in more than two decades of 'troubles' that a member
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary has carried out an attack in such
circumstances.
Mrs Mary Robinson, president of the Irish Republic, was about a mile away
when the shooting occurred.
Unionist leaders organised a demonstration against her visit in protest at
articles two and three of the Irish constitution which lay claim to
jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. Mr Nigel Dodds, the lord mayor of
Belfast, said: 'I don't think that she can be welcome as long as those
articles remain.'
Previous Irish presidents have visited Northern Ireland in the past, but in
an unofficial capacity, for example to attend funerals of victims of
paramilitary killings. The west Belfast attack came as thousands gathered in
the city centre to demand an end to terrorist murder and intimidation of
workers. The rally, organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, was
called following the IRA killings last month of eight Protestant workers at
Teebane Crossroads near Cookstown.
The police constable gained admission to the advice centre, which also
houses the Republican Press Centre, by posing as a journalist who had
arranged an interview. Once inside, he opened fire with an automatic
shotgun. Eye witnesses said he later escaped in a BMW car.
About two hours later, the policeman's body was found on the shores of Loch
Neagh at Ballinderry, about 25 miles from Belfast. He had a gunshot wound to
the head and a shotgun was found nearby.
The day before, the constable had attended the funeral of a police colleague
at Comber, County Down. He was arrested after firing shots over the grave
later that evening.
Subsequently he was medically and scientifically examined and police took
possession of his service Ruger revolver. He was told to attend a further
examination yesterday morning but did not turn up, the RUC said last night.
An police inquiry is under way into the killings. One of the dead was an
elderly doorman and the other victims were a centre worker and a member of
the public.
Mrs Robinson said she was upset by the killing, saying: 'Any death by
violence is distressing.'
Mr Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister responsible for security, said
the deaths were 'an absolute tragedy, as is all waste of life in Northern
Ireland'.

SIR Leon Brittan, the Tory-appointed EC competition commissioner, yesterday
came under attack from the Labour party after the European Court of Justice
dismissed the controversial Pounds 44.4m Rover 'sweetener' case on a
technicality.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, demanded an
explanation from Sir Leon concerning the 'mistakes' made by his office. 'The
taxpayer has lost Pounds 44m through a mixture of British government
negligence and now EC incompetence,' he said.
The court ruled that British Aerospace would not have to repay Pounds 44.4m
worth of UK government 'sweeteners' which BAe received when it acquired the
Rover car group in 1988, because the EC did not follow the correct legal
procedures.
The verdict overturns an EC decision in July 1990, which demanded that the
UK government recover Pounds 44.4m of concessions it granted BAe to secure
the Rover sale.
The court dismissed the EC's case on procedural grounds without passing
judgment on whether the payments breached rules on European competition and
government subsidies.
'Nothing in the court decision contradicts the original analysis of the
Commission, and the opinion of the Commission about the (illegal nature of
the) aid has not changed,' a Commission official said in Brussels yesterday.
Sir Leon, who is in charge of EC competition policy, now faces a quandary.
He can let the matter drop. However, faced at present by several French
state aid cases, he is also under pressure to appear even-handed in his
treatment of EC states.
In addition, his demand for the recovery of the 'sweetener' payments was
seen at the time as a counter-balance to his decision not to question the
Pounds 150m sale price of Rover.
The court said the Commission could either start a full state aid procedure
to recover the Pounds 44m, or it could take the UK government to the court
for failing in its general EC state aid obligations, which include giving
Brussels full information. The payments were hidden from Brussels.
BAe said it was pleased to have won the judgment and the event helped lift
its share price by 11p. Shares closed in London at 290p. Lord Young, the
former trade and industry secretary who authorised the 'sweeteners', said he
was delighted with the outcome.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Benetton's ads not consistent with its values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC SALAMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your analysis of the controversy surrounding Benetton's Aids
advertisement (Management: 'Shocking tone for united colours', January 30)
overlooks the fundamental point.
All of our research suggests that companies must look to corporate branding
and to novel ways of communicating their image. Not only is there a hard
core of 20-30 per cent of consumers across Europe who are what we would call
'ethical consumers' - who use non-product related criteria in making their
purchasing decisions - but, at a time when there is a danger of the public
becoming overloaded with information and confused, there is a need for
strong brands to reassure consumers.
In this respect, the trouble with the Benetton campaigns is not that they
shock people, but that they are not consistent with Benetton's real brand
values. As far as I know, Benetton has not done anything in its employment
practices or in its dealings with suppliers to promote equal opportunity for
women and racial minorities or to help people suffering from Aids.
I would have no problem with companies such as Marks and Spencer or Shell
'shocking us' into changing our attitudes regarding staff welfare or the
environment, if it were clear they were committed, in practical terms, to
doing something about it.
The Benetton campaigns seek to make statements about issues to which
Benetton's own corporate policy appears to have little to offer. The brand
image which it promotes appears false and inconsistent.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Britain has more than a 'little left' of machine
tool industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON J BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Griffiths wrote, 'With little left of the UK machine tool industry
. . . ' in his report on Nissan's plans to invest Pounds 200m in its
Sunderland car plant ('Nissan to raise Sunderland capacity 30 per cent',
January 17).
This statement is factually incorrect and misleading. The UK machine tool
industry, while combating the effects of the recession, saw domestic
production of Pounds 960m in 1990 spread across more than 100 manufacturing
sites in the UK employing approximately 23,000 people.
Rolls-Royce, one of Britain's premier symbols of manufacturing, increased
its procurement of machine tools from British manufacturers to 70 per cent
in 1989, and there are many other examples.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Leading Article: German boom into bust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERVERSE as it may seem, this week's strike-averting pay deal in the German
steel industry has, if anything, thickened the cloud of uncertainty that
hangs over the country's economy. The agreement sets a worrying precedent
for the wage round; it is one which neither German industry nor the unions
can afford to follow. If they try, they will eventually fail - the
Bundesbank will see to that. But in failing, they will do unnecessary and
long-lasting damage to the newly united Germany.
It would be wrong to be prematurely apocalyptic. The steel agreement, a
total pay rise of 6.4 per cent, is the tail-end of last year's pay round, a
round in which the average settlement was above 7 per cent. Moreover, the
haste with which it was agreed might suggest that IG Metall, the metal
industry union, has made some more comforting promises behind the scenes. It
is the outcome of the forthcoming negotiations in the engineering industry
and public sector that will determine whether this optimism is justified.
Yet the Bundesbank is unlikely to see it in such a rosy light - rightly so.
Last year's settlements pushed the German rate of inflation above those in
France and profligate Britain. The rise in German interest rates in late
December was intended to send a tough message to wage bargainers, a message
that the troubled steel industry has chosen to ignore.
Tense present
The Bundesbank will be tempted to ram its point home harder still:
settlements around 6 per cent are at least a percentage point higher than
can be tolerated in a low inflation country, such as Germany is, or was. The
Bundesbank wants to keep this label in the present tense: this implies a
tense present. High interest rates are likely for the next six months at
least.
Premature easing would be interpreted by the markets as a sign of weakness,
especially if broad money growth remains outside its target zone.
Inevitably, then, west Germany's economic boom will be followed by a
traditionally British recession. The longer that the Bundesbank is forced to
keep rates high, the deeper it will be.
The root of this year's problem was also the cause of the boom that preceded
it: German unification. Monetary union has prompted an economic collapse in
the eastern Lander on a scale that even the pessimists underestimated.
Cushioning the blow has required huge transfers from the west.
Tax burden
Yet the German government has failed to build a consensus over how this tax
burden should be distributed. Workers, the unions argue, have shouldered
more than their fair share through higher income taxes, with a rise in
value-added tax in the pipeline. After-tax incomes grew by 3.8 per cent in
the year to the second quarter of 1991, but by just 0.4 per cent in the
third quarter, when the income tax surcharge came into effect.
Yet the unions' attempt to claw back this lost after-tax income through
higher wage claims cannot work. In the end, the former west Germans will pay
for unification; but only once-high interest rates and rising unemployment
have beaten wages down. As the west German economy catches a cold it imposes
high interest rates and slow growth on the rest of Europe. But the east
German Lander will pay the highest price: both economically, as output
stagnates and investment fails to materialise; and politically, as the
unwillingness of the west to make the necessary sacrifices sinks in.
All of this represents a failure on the part of Germany's political leaders.
The rigidly regulated west German labour market was always going to find
unification difficult to cope with in the manner of the free market
textbooks. But the social consensus alternative has not materialised. Until
last summer, Mr Kohl was unwilling even to acknowledge that the burden
existed.
Into this policy vacuum the Bundesbank has stepped. It is imposing a third
way that is both economically costly and politically damaging for the new
Germany. Unless its politicians, employers and unions can act together, and
soon, the outlook is decidedly bleak.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Princely capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINCE of Wales has undeniably left his mark, for better or worse, on
British architecture. Is he now about to use the luxury of his position as a
potential head of state to do the same for business?
His speech to the grandly named World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday
suggests that he aspires to do so. But capitalism is a tougher nut to crack
than the British architectural profession; and the prince's interpretation
of the business world is sufficiently idiosyncratic to raise a doubt or two
about his prescriptions.
Business, he asserts, is the core of modern society - a statement that might
just make sense of the Japanese social structure, but which seems to bear
little resemblance to anything that is happening in western Europe. And
business, he adds, has been the real victor of the Cold War. If we are to
find solutions to the challenges of the post-Cold War era, runs his
argument, business must work in partnership with governments, local
communities and pretty well everyone else to achieve not only economic, but
spiritual, social and ecological goals.
This is a novel interpretation of post-war history and it incorporates a
monumental non sequitur. There are many businesses in the former Soviet
Union which are not victors of the Cold War and whose problems stem
precisely from working in a collaborative system. It so happened that the
collaborative system was managerially and administratively less efficient
than the more market-oriented systems of the west.
Great irony
That said, the prince's worries about the ability of old-fashioned economic
liberalism to deliver in the late 20th century are not without point. The
great irony of the post-Cold War era is that if the former Soviet Union had
not collapsed we would now be discussing the dismal performance of
capitalism. The debt-laden Anglo-Saxon economies are resisting all attempts
at resuscitation; continental Europe appears to have lost the secret of job
creation; and the Japanese economic miracle has been won at the cost of a
stressfully uneven distribution of wealth. Many share the feeling that
deeper human values have been a casualty of the profit motive.
This is, of course, a rich man's complaint. And it leads the prince to a
curiously eclectic vision in which capitalist animal spirits are
incongruously leavened with nostalgia, social responsibility and something
that verges on natural mysticism. It is a vision whose pedigree runs from
the romanticism of Wordsworth, via the industrial reformism of Dickens's
Hard Times, to the socially conscious profitability of Marks and Spencer. It
may not be full-blooded collectivism (and it is not, alas, in inspired
pentameters) but it is, at the very least, corporatist in spirit.
Comparative advantage
For all that, there is one sense in which the prince may be more in tune
with the modern world than some neo-liberals. Comparative advantage in
today's world has much more to do with the efficient deployment of human
capital than of natural resource endowment. And there is no doubt that some
of the most successful models of economic growth in the Far East are highly
co-operative at company level, even though intense competition prevails
outside. Human capital is sometimes, though not invariably, treated with
greater respect in Japan than in the US or in Britain.
Yet it is hard to move from generalisations about mankind's relationship
with the urban or rural environment to concrete prescriptions about
corporate governance or social and environmental responsibility. And a
belief in 'working together' has to be tempered with the knowledge that
government has all too often proved a poor partner for business working in
the community.
Perhaps as well then that the Prince of Wales yesterday did little more than
urge what many employers would regard as best practice in relations with the
community and on the environment. Take away the mysticism and you have
something slightly woolly, very British and really rather familiar. But not
something likely to generate an economic miracle.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Arts: That was the era that was . . . - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to know how the world is changing watch the opening edition of
TV Heaven on Channel 4 and, in particular, be certain to see not only the
actual programmes - the drama which launched Callan, the famous edition of
The Frost Programme with Emil Savundra, and so on - but the 'filler'
material too. This coming weekend (on the first of 13 Saturday evenings to
be devoted to archive material from the 1950s, '60s and '70s) between At
Last The 1948 Show and Elsie Tanner's wedding in Coronation Street, there
are several contemporary clips, including one of Joan Bakewell whispering
winsomely into the microphone while covering some live event for Late Night
Line Up in 1967, the year from which all this week's material is selected.
Her come-hither glance at the camera is wonderful, but the significant point
is that Frank Muir, who is presenting these archive collections, does not
say 'There you go, the thinking man's crumpet' even though he was the one
who coined that phrase to describe Bakewell in the 1960s.
And why does he not quote his own epigram? Presumably because of the way
things have changed in 25 years: today the women's lobby, not best known for
its sense of humour, would be outraged at a line which, at its birth, was
seen as affectionate and admiring. What, after all was it saying? That the
woman had looks as well as brains. But one of the most powerful messages to
emerge, albeit tacitly, from this opening edition of a series which may
prove compelling to a remarkably large number of people, is that in a
quarter of a century attitudes towards women have altered out of all
recognition.
It is perfectly acceptable these days to screen a drama such as The Cloning
Of Joanna May, shown by ITV over the past two Sunday evenings in 90-minute
slabs, in which the general message is the one we have learned to expect
from Fay Weldon: 'Oh God, aren't men disgusting'. There is surely no good
reason why she should be prevented from delivering such a message. But
anyone on television who tried making generalisations about women - over
emotional, frightened of mice, whatever - would be in deep trouble. It is
quite okay today for a woman on television to exploit the brains that nature
endowed her with, but any attempt to exploit the body, endowed by the same
power, will attract howls of execration. Hence the disappearance of beauty
contests from television.
The contrast with 1967 could hardly be more vivid. Happily John Wyver and
Linda Zuck, whose company Illuminations has put this huge package together,
have managed to come up with material from At Last The 1948 Show, a series
long mourned among the cognoscenti as completely lost, and tragically so
since it was such a direct forerunner of Monty Python's Flying Circus.
Produced under David Frost it starred John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Tim
Brooke-Taylor, and Marty Feldman. Now it seems that five compilation tapes
have been discovered in the vaults of Swedish television and, although the
picture looks as though it was shot through a flour sack, Saturday's episode
proves that this was, indeed, a decidedly seminal show. Not only does it
pre-figure Python in its general craziness, there are also particular
moments which look astonishingly recognisable: Cleese as a goose-stepping
gauleiter, Tim Brooke-Taylor asking 'What are the nurses like then, eh?'
(nudge) 'eh?' (nudge, leer, nudge) and Cleese, Chapman and Feldman as three
macho policemen in drag, but for the size 13 boots.
The contrast with today emerges from the use of women on the show. Aimi
MacDonald, wearing a succession of revealing leotards and not much else,
flutters her eyelashes while serving as a punctuation mark between sketches.
At the end she does a little gag about blackmailing the director into
letting her dance and we see her doing some high kicks. Dutiful feminists
will close their eyes in pain and declare how much healthier it is to have
Victoria Wood or French and Saunders winning kudos as comedians on
television today. Those who suspect that really funny women have been
welcome in show business since the days of music hall and before, and who
cannot see that the pleasure given by the physical nature of Aimi
MacDonald's performance is any different from the pleasure given by those
hulking great men in the 'Strongest Man' series, and who reckon that it
takes all sorts to make a world, may feel that the world has been
impoverished by doctrinaire feminism in the past 25 years.
Whatever your feelings, these compilations serve as the most powerful
mnemonics imaginable, bringing back the period with a vividness which few
other cultural phenomena could equal. From the little hippy dance performed
by Twiggy at the start to the commercial with Bing Crosby singing 'I'm going
well, I'm going Shell', from Patrick McGoohan in that most typical of all
1960s symbols, the Lotus sports car, with the voice-over declaring 'I am not
a number I am a free man]' to Vanessa Redgrave posing sexily for Norman
Parkinson, it could only possibly come from the mid sixties. Coronation
Street still featured Ena Sharples and Minnie Caldwell, not to mention Elsie
Tanner's son in a Union Jack waistcoat, and Granada were willing to tolerate
major fluffs rather than re-shoot a scene for the sake of one line.
Above all there is A Magnum For Schneider, the 'Armchair Theatre' drama
which introduced us to Edward Woodward's Callan, who was 'licensed to kill'
but in all other respects the deliberate antithesis of James Bond: a sad and
bitter loner who fraternised in gloomy pubs with the lowest of the low,
notably Russell Hunter's malodorous Lonely, and who contemptuously rejected
the values of the establishment which Bond so enthusiastically embraced. To
watch this again now is to recognise immediately Callan's antecedents: not
only Bond but the loner gumshoes of the Hollywood film noir in the 1940s,
and Alfred Burke's scruffy detective Frank Marker in Public Eye which
appeared on ITV in 1965. It also makes you realise how ominously dominant
the glamorous surface detail has become in today's series - Inspector
Morse's Jaguar - and brings out the near total triumph of film in television
drama.
There are splendid treats to come: an early episode of The Avengers with
Honor Blackman; Regan, the pilot for The Sweeney; the opening episode of Do
Not Adjust Your Set which starred all the Pythons who were not in At Last
The 1948 Show (Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) plus David Jason
and The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band; the opening episode of Rumpole (unseen since
1979) and Upstairs Downstairs; and Granada's Woody Allen Show from 1965, all
with clips and commercials from the period. It seems a pity that the only
linking comment is Frank Muir's comfy line in saloon bar gossip. As a
pay-off to the notorious Savundra programme it scarcely seems sufficient to
say 'Many people were rightly appalled by this dangerous move towards trial
by television, but it did make riveting television'.
The most striking fact to emerge is one that has been emphasised in this
column since 1972 when it was relinquished by its creator, TC Worsley. His
articles from the mid-sixties, bringing such insight to many of the
programmes now to be shown in this Channel 4 season, were published in book
form under the title Television: The Ephemeral Art and at the time that
title seemed a fair description. Today, with video recorders in 80 per cent
of British households, a far greater awareness of the importance of
television archives, and even budget-conscious producers no longer needing
to re-cycle videotape and thus destroy irreplaceable programmes (much of the
early Dixon Of Dock Green, Dr Who, and Till Death Us Do Part and most of
David Mercer's early plays) television is simply not an ephemeral art any
more.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Jobs: First trial for subsidised self-marketing - Bowater
sponsors advertising space for unemployed business-development executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT takes more than rising with the lark to get one up on a chief executive.
Mind you, the Jobs column thought it had done the trick the other cockcrow
when it telephoned Bowater's David Lyon at his office. 'I'll put you
through,' said a brisk yet friendly operator, and tried . . . but no answer.
So on getting through to him later, I contrived to mention - though
good-humouredly of course - that I had called him before, just after eight.
He knew, he replied. As it was a Monday, he'd had to come in from the
country and had not been at his desk as early as usual. 'But when I got in
and called you back minutes after, you weren't there,' he added. 'You rang
me from home, didn't you?'
Touche ]
The reason for my original dawn activity was that Mr Lyon had let slip the
fact that he is in the habit of conducting job-interviews at 8am, and
candidates who happen to be currently unemployed have impressed him by never
failing to turn up on the dot. But the reason why he made the disclosure in
the first place was the proposal put forward in this corner of the FT a week
ago. As some in today's congregation may not have been present then,
however, I had better recapitulate a little.
The aim of the scheme, brainchild of redundancy victim Peter Laurence, is to
give folk in his unfortunate position a bit of help towards finding new
work. His idea is that this paper should try to provide them with a
subsidised market by inviting employers to contribute - say - half the cost
of a regular space in our recruitment-advertising pages, in which people out
of work could offer their skills at a commensurately reduced price.
When I put the idea to the FT's classified advertisement director Brian
Powell, he not only agreed that it was worth giving a go, but said he'd join
in the sponsoring by running the ad at a special rate. Hence my request last
week for corporate volunteers willing, at least in principle, to support the
enterprise.
The result has been nearly a dozen letters and telephone calls, not all from
enthusiasts for the scheme. Seven, although mostly conceding that it would
do no harm, say it falls far short of what is required. In their view, the
need is for government action, and they suggest various types of taxpayers'
subsidies to persuade organisations to fill their job openings from the
ranks of the unemployed.
To which my own response is that their argument, while perhaps sensible,
misses the point. It may well be that far more help than the sponsored ad is
needed, and that government might get round to providing same in time. But
Mr Laurence's idea has the strength of being something that could be done
quickly, and by a relative handful of companies at that.
Alas, getting the necessary few together is another matter. After all,
companies can be forgiven for not leaping forward to give money at times
like these. Accordingly, I wasn't expecting the idea to become reality for a
while. And nor will it do so - or, at any rate, not in the shape of a
regular sponsored market-place.
But thanks to David Lyon (who for all his difficulties in getting in on time
on Mondays, clearly acts fast) we can run a limited, one-off trial. On his
initiative, Bowater is joining the FT in subsidising an ad big enough to
carry short self-advertisements by six unemployed people with one particular
type of skill - in business development. For those inclined to try selling
themselves therein, however, there are certain snags.
One is that if their message appears, it will cost them Pounds 50. Another
is that they are subject to an absolute top limit of 60 words which must
include their name and any restrictions on where they are willing to work. A
third is that, if the offer is over-subscribed, the six to appear will be
chosen at random. The last is that their copy must reach me here at the
latest on Wednesday, February 19, so the ad can run the following week.
Which said, I'll wait to hear from you.
NOW to the table alongside, which is compiled from the PA Consulting Group's
latest survey of United Kingdom employers' plans for recruiting graduates.
Anyone wanting the survey, price Pounds 420, should contact Jenny Cambridge
of PA at 123 Buckingham Palace Rd, London SW1W 9SR; telephone 071-730 9000,
fax 071-333-5050.
My table is limited to the pay aspects of the 91 participating
organisations' graduate-recruitment policies. The figures, all averages, are
broken down by the employing outfits' sector of activity.
First come the starting salaries actually paid to degree-winners who were
newly taken on in 1991, followed by estimates (where ventured) of those to
be paid to those recruited this year. Then, for the six right-hand columns
of the table, we turn from new entrants to people engaged earlier, and from
basic salaries alone to total cash pay including bonuses.
The first pair of the six refer to graduates with one year's service, the
next two pairs to those with three, and five years respectively. In each
case a distinction is made for quality of work. The first of each pair of
columns shows the typical total cash rewards of just 'adequate' or averagely
performing staff. The second does likewise for their 'high-flying'
counterparts.
From what I hear, demand for new graduates this year is well down even on
the depressed levels of 12 months ago. Nevertheless the estimated starting
salaries are higher, apparently by 14 per cent in the case of banks although
by only 2 per cent on the overall figure.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont faces pressure over tax -
Financial Times Poll of Conservative MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Norman Lamont had any remaining doubts about what he should aim for in
his March 10 Budget, they will have been dispelled by the latest survey of
Conservative opinion at Westminster.
The FT's questionnaire was completed by 107 Tory MPs, representing 30 per
cent of the 367-strong parliamentary party and well over a third of
backbench MPs.
By a margin of more than three to one, government supporters believe the
chancellor should use what the Treasury insists is his strictly limited room
for manoeuvre to reduce income tax rather than to raise public spending.
The 71 per cent in favour of tax cuts compared with 19 per cent who
indicated that they would prefer any boost to the economy to come through
higher public spending. The remaining 10 per cent said that there was not a
direct choice, with most urging Mr Lamont to do both.
The results confirm that the priority of Tory MPs is high-profile action to
demonstrate in the weeks before the general election that the government is
determined to get the economy moving.
Tax cuts are seen as the best way to underline the essential difference
between the Conservatives and Labour during an election campaign which, if
Mr John Major opts for April 9, might start within two days of the Budget
speech.
The MPs appear less sure whether Mr Lamont should opt to raise income tax
thresholds by more than the rate of inflation or cut the basic rate. But the
9-percentage-point majority in favour of the former is significantly smaller
than in previous years, suggesting that a basic-rate reduction would win
strong support from the backbenches.
There is also strong support for measures to boost investment incentives for
industry, with more than 70 per cent of those polled pressing for them. By
contrast, the MPs are relatively evenly divided over whether Mr Lamont
should take special action to help the motor industry or to alleviate the
effects of increases in the uniform business rate.
In spite of the brickbats thrown at the chancellor by sections of media  -
and by some Tory MPs - the survey shows that most in the party are reluctant
to blame him for a recession which remains the main obstacle to a fourth
consecutive election victory.
A handful added disparaging comments about the chancellor to their
questionnaires - 'It would be disloyal to be frank', wrote one. But 60 per
cent rated his performance excellent or good and only 6 per cent
disappointing.
In spite of the constraint it imposes on interest rates, there is general
support for sterling's participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System. Nearly 30 per cent say it is 'vital' to maintain
the pound's present parity.
There are, however, small minorities on both the right and left of the party
who believe that the ERM is an obstacle to economic recovery. Some 20 per
cent describe the parity as 'unimportant'. A significant proportion of those
said that Mr Lamont should be ready to withdraw sterling from the system.
Overall, Conservative MPs are more equivocal in their commitment to the
present rate against the D-Mark should that threaten a rise in British
interest rates. Only a small majority think Mr Lamont should go as far as a
rise in borrowing costs to defend the pound.
Among other changes sought from the back benches, there are strong
minorities in favour of an extension of tax relief for child care and
reductions in or abolition of inheritance tax, stamp duties and capital
gains taxes.
There are also more eclectic requests. One respondent believes that all
household staff should attract tax relief for their employers, while a
colleague said that Mr Lamont's first priority on March 10 should be
'helping industry to get off its knees'.
Another replied frankly that Mr Lamont's task was to ensure 'the survival of
the government'. But if MPs are worried, few are willing to admit it.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            WHAT TORY MPS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE BUDGET
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Results shown in rounded percentages. The totals do not necessarily add
up to 100 because in some cases the repondents have not answered every
question and in others have chosen more than one option. Questionnaires

  Reduce or abolish stamp duties: 15
  Others: 12
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How important is it to maintain sterling's parity in the ERM:
  Vital: 29
  Important: 35
  Fairly important: 13
  Unimportant: 20
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Should he raise interest rates to defend that parity if necessity:
  Yes: 54
  No: 43
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How confident are you that the Conservatives will secure an overall
 majority at the general election:

THE GOVERNMENT last night made heavy weather of obtaining approval for
Pounds 450m of provisional payments to the European Community budget, as it
said the UK's net budget contribution was now likely to be 'in the region of
Pounds 2.5bn.'
Mr Francis Maude, the financial secretary to the Treasury, was besieged by
puzzled backbenchers from both sides of the Commons inquiring why the
payment was necessary.
Opposition to the measure was spearheaded by Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend
East) who suggested that all MPs who supported it should be surcharged. The
issue was whether parliament should pay for what was unlawful, he said.
The special estimate debated yesterday is required because the budget
adopted by the European parliament may be illegal.
Under these circumstances, Britain can limit payments to the contribution
due had a budget for 1992 not been adopted, with the balance - of some
Pounds 150m a month or Pounds 450m over the first quarter - to be approved
by parliament.
The large size of the discrepancy arises because last year's Pounds 1.2bn UK
contribution to the EC budget was abnormally low. Only Pounds 12m of the
overall payment relates to the portion of the budget which is in dispute.
An amendment advocating that the provisional payment be reduced by Pounds
100,000 was defeated by 220 votes to 27. The government motion was approved
with a majority of 207 (223-16).

FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories cheered by Nellist's act of
defiance - The impending battle for the Coventry South East constituency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COVENTRY Conservatives can scarcely believe their luck. Militant Mr Dave
Nellist is to stand as an Independent in South East, a seat they would never
otherwise have expected to win.
The Labour vote is split. Hold the 1987 vote and Martine Hyams, a first-time
candidate, might just squeak in, the Tories argue. And for good measure,
some of the heat might come off Mr John Butcher's marginal seat in
neighbouring South West.
Mr Ken Taylor, the Conservative organiser, said: 'This is the first time we
have had an opportunity of winning this seat.'
Indeed, Mr Nellist in 1983 succeeded Mr William Wilson, who had been a
Coventry Labour MP for 20 years. His critics say that he nearly lost the
seat for Labour in 1983. In 1987, however, Mr Nellist pushed his majority up
to a comfortable 17.6 per cent, or 6,653 votes.
Coventry South East is not a natural Conservative seat, especially not in a
recession. Although the proportion of home ownership is high, there are
extensive council estates and rundown areas with, in one ward, a high ethnic
population. Unemployment, in a population largely of skilled workers, has
been rising.
The Conservative campaign will be energetic but discreet. Mrs Hyams will
avoid direct confrontation with Mr Nellist. She will be a standard
Conservative. The aim will be to get the vote out - greater than the total
of more than 11,000 last time. The real struggle of the campaign will be for
the Labour vote. The conundrum is calculating the portion that will remain
loyal to Mr Nellist.
Now the outcast, Mr Nellist maintains that it is not he who has lost the way
but the Labour party itself. To the extent that he will address the broad
issues, it will be from a 1970s and early 1980s hard-left viewpoint 'in
defence of the socialist ideas the Labour Party was built on'. That means
unashamedly arguing for defence cuts, socialist planning and democracy, he
said.
Only he can keep the Conservatives out, he argues, not, as he puts it,
'somebody imposed from the outside.'
He grants that the record of independents in general elections is not
encouraging, but is quick to add: 'The historical trend can be bucked.'
Such arguments drive orthodox Labour supporters to apoplexy. It is not only
that the electorate has spent the last decade voting against hard-left
political solutions. It is not only because they believe he has frightened
Labour supporters away. It is also that they feel he identifies with
trouble.
Mr Duncan Simpson, divisional organiser of the Amalgamated Engineering Union
snorted: 'If anything, he thrives on stress. A good MP seeks to avoid it
happening.'
Mr Simpson added: 'We need an MP who is going to help Coventry regain its
manufacturing profile.' Coventry is the centre of the motor industry, the
argument runs, and yet investors like the Japanese go elsewhere.
For the next week or two, until an official Labour candidate emerges, Mr
Nellist has the field to himself.
By operating a more democratic selection procedure, Labour is seeking to
destroy the accusation that its candidate will be imposed.
Nomination papers went out last Monday. A shortlist will be drawn up by the
Labour national executive committee and there will then be a postal vote
among local party members to select a candidate. So far, there is no obvious
choice, certainly nobody with the local profile of Mr Nellist.
Meanwhile, Nellist supporters are out and about, canvassing. They claim
promises of support from 33.4 per cent of 13,400 people interviewed.
Mr Nellist said he was 'on target to win the seat'. He agreed, however, that
the returns needed to be treated with some caution because they tended to
understate the number of abstentions.
The Conservatives think returns need to be treated with caution because the
sort of people doing the canvassing are not the sort of people to whom you
would want to say 'no'.
General Election 1987: DJ Nellist (Lab), 17,969; A. Grant (C), 11,316; F.
Devine (SDP/All), 8,095; N. Hutchinson (Grn), 479. Lab Majority 6,653.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour says PM to blame for
recession - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons
yesterday of being primarily responsible for leading Britain into the
longest recession since the 1930s.
'There is no question of doubt that this government caused the recession,'
declared Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, as mounting pre-election fever
brought the prime minister under the most sustained attack he has faced
since taking over from Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Tory MPs rallied to Mr Major but were unable to prevent him from being
halted in his tracks by the ferocity of the Labour onslaught.
A deafening shout of 'Yes]' came from the opposition benches when the prime
minister, as a preliminary to listing other countries whose economies are in
trouble, asked: 'Did we cause the recession . . ?'
Mr Major quickly recovered and scoffed at the idea that the government was
also responsible for the recession in the US, Sweden, Japan, Australia and
New Zealand. To government cheers, he told Mr Kinnock: 'If you believe that,
you are certainly not capable of leading your party, let alone this
country.' Downing Street officials later also rejected Labour's claims that
the recession was the longest since the 1930s.
Mr Kinnock opened the Labour attack by reminding Mr Major of his earlier
comment that if the government's counter-inflation policies were 'not
hurting they were not working'.
The prime minister countered that the measures taken by the government had
been designed to enable Britain to emerge from the recession in a way that
ensured sustained recovery.
He said Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, had told
bankers on Monday that the conditions were now in place to 'underpin a
sustained recovery'.
Mr Kinnock said: 'This government caused the recession, continued the
recession and now has not got a clue how to get us out of the recession.'
The prime minister argued that if Mr Kinnock was 'genuinely concerned' about
recovery he would not be advocating higher taxes, which would only worsen
the situation.
Mr Kinnock shouted: 'You put taxes up]'
To government cheers, Mr Major insisted that Labour's policies would mean
'perpetual recession for this country'.
Mr Steve Norris (C Epping Forest) condemned Labour's 'crazy proposal' for
reviving the power of local authorities to fix the level of business rates.
The prime minister gave an undertaking that the government would not permit
a return to the former system under which councils had often increased
business rates by more than the rate of inflation - something that could not
happen now.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major underlines resistance to
self-rule - Scotland and Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday underlined his determination to
resist the political pressures for Scotland to leave the UK.
In his first public comment since an opinion poll showed that more than 50
per cent of Scots favour independence, he maintained that both Scotland and
England had benefited from the union and emphasised: 'I do not wish to see
it undermined'.
The prime minister also rejected a call for a Welsh parliament by Mr Ieuan
Jones, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ynys Mon.
Buoyant Scottish Nationalist MPs cheered Mr Andrew Welsh, (Angus East) when
he envisaged a surge in support for his party in the general election.
He asked the prime minister: 'Since this government has supported
independence in Russia, Lithuania and other parts of the world, when the
people of Scotland democratically and peacefully vote for independence, what
will this government say to them?'
Mr Major emphasised that the policies of the Scottish nationalists - and
those of Labour and the Liberal Democrats - would undermine the relationship
'that has served us so well in the union'.
He insisted: 'Devolution is not just a matter for Scotland. It is a matter
for the whole of the United Kingdom.'
A government spokesman made clear later that the prime minister had not
intended to imply that he favoured a referendum on the issue.
Mr Major also called on his critics on the opposition benches to explain how
Scotland's prosperity would be assisted by having additional taxes imposed
by a Scottish parliament.
He told Scottish nationalists: 'You ought to put a fair proposal before the
Scottish people, not the half-baked proposal you do put forward.'
The prime minister reminded Welsh nationalist MPs that on an earlier
occasion when there appeared to be a majority in favour of devolution a
referendum had produced a contrary result.
He emphasised: 'The people of Wales realised that the best interest of their
country and of the United Kingdom was to sustain the present arrangements.'

FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dem plan for housing - News in
Brief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE interest tax relief should be phased out and replaced with a new
housing cost allowance, targeted at the lower paid, and covering both rents
and mortgages, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday.
The party's 'Manifesto for Housing' said mortgage tax relief had created
'enormous economic and social problems without actually being of benefit to
home owners'.
Tax relief would continue to be available for existing mortgage holders.
For those entering the housing market, relief would be available at a level
equivalent to a proportion of housing costs - perhaps 50 per cent - between
regionally-determined lower and upper limits.
*****
DEFENCE: Mr Tom King, defence secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the
final cost of the Trident nuclear missile submarine programme was now
estimated to be Pounds 10.518bn.
He said: 'This marks a further small reduction against last year's estimate
and an overall real reduction of Pounds 3bn against the 1982 forecast'.
He confirmed that the order for the fourth submarine at VSEL Barrow would be
placed as soon as contract talks were completed.
*****
ENVIRONMENT: Mr John Major is to host a Downing Street seminar today on the
environment, attended by representatives of 'green' lobby groups and
industrialists. Officials said the prime minister was preparing for the
United Nations conference on environment and development which he hopes to
attend in Rio de Janeiro in June.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on size of classes - Labour
Education Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMITMENT to ensure that there are no classes of more than 40 pupils
within the first year of a Labour government was made in an opposition
offensive on education yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said that the pledge would cost
about Pounds 3m and would affect between 9,000 and 10,000 children. The
money could be found from existing plans for education spending.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said that a continuation of Tory
policies would mean 'more of the same back-of-the-envelope chopping and
changing, and a persistently undervalued and under-invested state system'.
The move, which is the second initiative on education in as many days, forms
part of Labour's effort to turn the political debate to public-service
issues, traditionally its stronger ground.
Labour's attack on the increase in class sizes under the Tories was directed
particularly at the rise in the number of classes with more than 30 pupils.
Mr Straw said that while Labour would embark on a programme of year-by-year
reductions in maximum class sizes, with the hope of reaching a maximum of 35
by the end of the third year, he could give no target date for making 30
children the class limit.
Mr Kinnock ridiculed the remarks made at the weekend by Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the education secretary, that he had 'no objection' to the re-emergence of
grammar schools, saying that Mr Clarke was 'succumbing to nostalgia for the
1950s'.
Labour repeated its broad promise to reverse the drop in the percentage of
national wealth spent on education, but Mr Clarke said that the opposition
had 'clearly abandoned their recent pledge to spend an extra Pounds 2.6bn on
education'.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine optimistic over poll tax
levels - Local Government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government set its face against Budget changes to the poll tax system
yesterday, as Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, expressed
optimism about the size of bills for the coming year. Ministers also
resisted renewed pressure to help businesses facing large increases in the
business rate.
Mr Michael Portillo, local-government minister, said the Department of the
Environment had neither sought nor expected Budget changes to the uniform
business rate, in spite of representations from organisations such as the
Confederation of British Industry. Industry has been pressing for improved
transitional relief.
Mr Heseltine said in the Commons that Labour's 'gloomy predictions' that
poll tax bills would be nearer Pounds 300 than the government's target of
Pounds 257 would not be fulfilled.
During a debate on government grants to councils, he told MPs that in the
third quarter of the current financial year, 29 per cent of the budgeted
yield had been collected, compared with 28 per cent in the third quarter of
the previous year. The total budgeted yield collected in the first nine
months of the year is, however, down on that for the previous year, at 68
per cent and 74 per cent respectively.
Earlier, Mr Portillo told a Westminster press conference that the losers
under the business revaluation - concentrated in the south-east  - would be
balanced by the large number of gainers from the revaluation in areas such
as the north of England.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the phasing in of property
revaluation that coincided with the abolition of domestic rates three years
ago will mean increases of 20 per cent plus inflation for 390,000 businesses
in the next financial year.
The CBI is among many business groups that have called for the increases to
be suspended because of the financial pressures imposed on industry by the
recession.
During the debate, ministers offered little comfort in the face of
cross-party backbench protests about how the government distributed grant
among councils and decided how much they needed to spend - their standard
spending assessments.
Mr John Biffen, a former Tory cabinet minister, warned that while Shropshire
county council had staved off cuts in nursery education by drawing on
balances, that route offered no longer-term solution.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, accused Mr Heseltine of
manipulating the grant system to benefit Tory shire districts.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Businessman charged with loan deception
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSINESSMAN was last night charged with fraud by officers investigating
the multi-billion pound losses at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil, is the first
man to be arrested in Britain in connection with the investigation. He was
detained by the Serious Fraud Office and City of London police on Monday.
Mr Baqi, 66, of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, is charged with conspiring
with BCCI to deceive BCCI (Overseas) auditors Price Waterhouse.
The charges say that between November 1987 and January 1990, Mr Baqi and a
man called Mr Basheer Chowdry, along with BCCI senior managers, told Price
Waterhouse that Attock Oil owed sums totalling more than Dollars 76m, or
about Pounds 40m, to BCCI. It is alleged Mr Baqi knew the sums were not owed
to BCCI, and would not therefore have formed part of the bank's assets.
Mr Baqi is due to appear at City of London magistrates' court today charged
with the offence under Section One of the Criminal Law Act 1977.
A Florida judge yesterday sharply reduced the jail sentences of three former
BCCI executives convicted in 1990.
The sentences were reduced by Judge William Hodges at the request of US
prosecutors who said the three had given them information leading to higher
ranking bank officers.
The three are Mr Akbar Bilgrami, whose 12-year sentence was cut to 6 1/2
years; Mr Syed Hussain, whose 7 1/4 -year sentence was cut to three years;
and Mr Sibte Hassan, whose sentence was reduced from three to two years.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Dealers bask in the heat of Nissan's dispute with Botnar:
Chris Tighe wonders if customers will benefit from the bewildering franchise
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POISED on a step-ladder, a workman takes down the Nissan sign above the
Newcastle upon Tyne premises of North East Garages and replaces it with a
hoarding for Seat.
In the showroom a couple, spurred into car hunting by reports of Nissan
price wars, are listening to a salesman extol the Spanish-made Seat Toledo.
The battle over Nissan sales is confusing for customers, and it is not yet
clear how far they will benefit from it. Nissan UK, the importer-distributor
headed by the 78-year-old Mr Octav Botnar, lost the Nissan franchise in
Britain from the start of this year when Nissan Motor, Japan's
second-largest carmaker, set up its own UK operation. But Mr Botnar's
operation still has a stock of new Nissans as well as a dealer network
through which to sell them.
Until last month North East Garages, with two sales outlets in Tyneside, was
the Japanese manufacturer's largest independent dealer in north-east
England. It was among the first in Britain to stock Sunderland-made Nissan
Bluebirds and sold more than 5,000 new Nissan models of all types in six
years. That helped to boost Nissan's market share in the north-east in 1990
to 15 per cent, three times its national figure.
North East's link with Nissan has now been severed by the end of the 21-year
relationship between Nissan Motor, the Japanese manufacturer, and Nissan UK.
North East has become a dealer for Seat, the carmaker which recently tried
to recruit workers from Nissan's Sunderland plant for its new factory near
Barcelona.
Mr Murray Shand, North East's owner and managing director, will not discuss
why his showrooms are not among the 151 outlets so far signed up by Nissan
Motor GB for its new dealer network. He does say that Mr Botnar was right to
fight the Japanese over their UK pricing policy.
Like other Tyne and Wear dealers caught in the crossfire between Nissan
Motor and Mr Botnar, Mr Shand is bullish about the upheaval. 'It's like a
breath of fresh air,' he says.
North-east England is an important battleground in the fight between Nissan
Motor GB and Mr Botnar's company. Meanwhile AFG dealerships - also part of
the Botnar empire - are strong in the area because of local loyalty to
Nissan's Sunderland plant. Mr David Hurst, Nissan Motor GB's deputy managing
director, says: 'It gives us one of our biggest challenges.'
So far, he has five outlets trading in Tyne and Wear and a sixth under
discussion. Of the five, two are new to Nissan, one is ex-Fiat and one an
independent that already sold Nissans. The fifth, Vic Young, switched from
new Nissans to used cars in 1988 after finding AFG was building a dealership
next door. Elsewhere in the north-east Nissan Motor GB's coverage is
non-existent, although intensive negotiations are in progress. Even in Tyne
and Wear it is having to compete against four AFG garages bearing the Nissan
logo and aggressively marketing the carmaker's models.
Proximity to the Sunderland plant gives the fight a personal edge. A
salesman at AFG's largest Tyneside branch, in Newcastle, says: 'At the
moment we're selling a lot of motor cars - to the detriment of Nissan Motor
GB, I hope.'
In Sunderland, executives of the big dealership chain Reg Vardy gathered for
the opening of their flagship Nissan outlet. They were amused that their AFG
competitor just along the road had washed his Nissan signs ready for the
drive-past by Nissan Motor GB management. 'That's a load of rubbish,' says
the AFG unit's manager. He adds that his sales since the new year have been
'fairly phenomenal'.
Both camps insist that they are doing good business, but is there really a
price war from which customers are benefiting?
Certainly cars are being sold. A Vardy salesman at the company's new
Sunderland showroom clinched a deal even as Mr Akio Sumitomo, Nissan Motor
GB's managing director, was giving his opening address.
Both new and old Nissan dealers in Tyne and Wear are willing to offer
discounts of up to 10 per cent on new Nissans. But as Mr Botnar has no
prospect of getting more Nissans to sell, neither side is likely to embark
on ruthless undercutting. Direct price comparisons are almost impossible
because of new model designations introduced on January 1 and special offers
such as a year's free insurance. Customers are also prey to conflicting
claims. Nissan's new dealers insist that AFG is selling 1991 cars, while AFG
salesmen maintain they will be classed as 1992 vehicles.
Mr Vic Young, at his newly approved Nissan dealership in South Shields,
says: 'Buying a car is always a time of trepidation for people.' There is no
sign that the Nissan dealers' war will make it less so.

<TEXT>
THE JURY in the Barlow Clowes fraud trial will retire later today to
consider its verdicts.
Mr Justice Phillips yesterday told jurors they might have to spend several
days before reaching conclusions.
The trial, held in a Chancery Lane extension of the Old Bailey in London,
has lasted 108 days and heard evidence from 113 witnesses.
The Serious Fraud Office has alleged that Mr Peter Clowes and three
co-defendants milked the funds of clients who believed their money was being
invested in gilt-edged government stock.
It is alleged that the money was spent on investments in other private and
public companies and on luxurious purchases such as a yacht, an executive
jet and a chateau and vineyard in France.
Mr Peter Clowes, Mr Guy Cramer, Mr Peter Naylor and Mr Christopher Newman
are accused of stealing Pounds 16.9m.
Mr Clowes, Mr Naylor and Mr Cramer are jointly charged with conspiring to
contravene section 13(1) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, which
deals with false statements made to induce people to invest. Mr Clowes alone
is accused of eight offences under the sub-section.
They deny all the charges.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Both sides to appeal in RSI test case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH SIDES of a legal test case over repetitive strain injury (RSI)
involving former BT keyboard operators are appealing, it emerged yesterday.
The NCU telecommunications workers' union said it was to appeal against some
aspects of the judgment, issued in December. BT announced last month that it
had lodged an appeal against the order to pay damages to the operators.
The case is being watched closely by employers, unions and RSI sufferers.
Previous cases have been settled out of court. The painful and sometimes
debilitating condition which affects arms and hands has mainly affected
blue-collar employees in the past but is being linked increasingly to
keyboard work.
BT has taken the unusual step of giving financial help to the NCU so that it
can defend the appeal. BT said that was in recognition of the case's wider
importance and the 'hefty' costs involved.
The former operators were awarded Pounds 6,000 damages each for pain and
suffering. Loss of earnings have yet to be calculated. The county court in
the City of London ruled that BT had failed to provide adequate desks and
chairs for the operators and had failed to ensure correct posture.
The NCU's appeal concerns the court's judgment on working practices. The
court found that the way operators were paid and monitored and the long
hours worked had contributed to RSI. It ruled, however, that BT could not
have been expected to have known about the risks during the early 1980s,
when the injuries were sustained. The union is contesting the finding.

FT  05 FEB 92 / MoD scraps plans to move unit north
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to relocate the Ministry of Defence quality assurance unit from south
London to Stockton-on-Tees in Cleveland, bringing 1,600 jobs to Teesside,
have been abandoned.
Mr Kenneth Carlisle, the junior defence procurement minister, said the MoD
had decided instead to disperse the unit's staff among a number of Defence
Research Agency sites in southern England. The announcement came in a
Commons written answer to Mr Tim Devlin, Conservative MP for Stockton South.
Later Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, announced that a
section of the 90-acre Preston Farm site in Stockton no longer required by
the MoD is to house a Pounds 7m factory development for Livera Foods, a
manufacturer of gateaux and cheesecakes, eventually creating up to 700 jobs.
He added that the Teesside Development Corporation, which is responsible for
the site, had received a number of other inquiries.
The Pounds 100m relocation of the quality assurance unit's Woolwich and
Bromley laboratories and test houses was announced by the government in
March 1989.
Although seen at that time as cost-effective, it was subsequently put on
hold. Last August the MoD said its Options for Change defence spending cuts
had made it necessary to review the plan.
Mr Carlisle said yesterday the 'most economical and operationally effective
way ahead' for the quality assurance technical support division was for it
to be dispersed and consolidated into the Defence Research Agency. Quality
assurance staffing will be reduced to 1,200 jobs.
The news was greeted with anger by the leaders of Cleveland county and
Stockton borough council, who have lobbied the government persistently not
to renege on its plan. The relocation had been seen as a means of
diversifying the area's economic base by an injection of high-quality jobs.
The county council said: 'No way can you compare 700 jobs at a cake factory
with the sort of high-quality, technical, scientific and training
opportunities which the MoD would have brought.'

FT  05 FEB 92 / Little-known group makes top bid for radio channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PREVIOUSLY unknown radio company, Independent National Broadcasting,
yesterday submitted the highest bid of five applicants for the UK's second
national commercial radio channel.
INBC bid Pounds 4.01m a year for the franchise, more than double the
second-highest bid of Pounds 1.883m submitted by Independent Music Radio, a
joint venture between Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Communications and TV-am,
the commercial breakfast television station that recently lost its
franchise.
INBC plans to broadcast pop and rock music from its headquarters in
Sheffield. It has been set up by three individuals and at the moment does
not appear to have heavyweight financial support.
The three are Mr Michael Mallett, chairman of Yorkshire Radio Network until
the group was taken over by Metro Radio in 1990; Viscount Lewisham, who was
involved in an unsuccessful bid for Yorkshire Television's franchise; and Mr
Toby Horton, a former managing director of Tees Radio.
Mr Mallett, INBC chairman, conceded yesterday that the company had not yet
raised the planned Pounds 12m needed for the radio station. A prospectus
will be issued in the next few weeks.
Rivals predicted yesterday that INBC would go the way of Showtime, which bid
the highest amount for the first national channel last year but could not
complete its financing. The franchise went instead to Classic FM. Mr Bruce
Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, said yesterday: 'There is no doubt about it. We
are the hot favourites.'
The Radio Authority, embarrassed by Showtime's failure, will be looking
closely at the applicants' business plans.
The Radio Authority, the industry regulatory body, will award the licence to
the highest cash bidder meeting basic requirements on programming and
financial viability.
The channel will use AM frequencies at present used by BBC Radio 3 and
should offer 85 per cent coverage of the UK.
The INBC application is supported by letters from two stockbrokers, Wise
Speake of Newcastle upon Tyne and Peel Hunt of London.
Mr Christopher Hunt, a director of Peel Hunt, said he had received
expressions of interest from financial institutions that had been told the
annual rate of return to the investor might be as high as 34 per cent to 35
per cent.
Capital Radio, the UK's largest commercial broadcaster, surprised the
industry by not bidding.
The other bidders were:
20/20 Radio, a consortium including Chiltern Radio, which bid Pounds 1.311m
and planned to broadcast adult contemporary music.
Score Radio, a consortium put together by Glasgow's successful Radio Clyde
group, which bid Pounds 701,000 and planned to broadcast music from the
1950s to the 1980s.
National Rock Radio, a joint venture between Ireland's national broadcaster
RTE and CLT of Luxembourg, which bid Pounds 211,000.
The winner will have to pay an annual licence fee of Pounds 645,000 and 4
per cent of revenue to the Treasury.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions attack 'vindictive' benefits
clawback rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTIMS of workplace accidents are being deterred from taking compensation
cases to court because of government rules on the clawback of social
security benefits, according to unions.
Before September 1990, only 50 per cent of social security payments had to
be paid back out of court awards. That was increased to 100 per cent under
the 1989 Social Security Act. The rules apply to awards of more than Pounds
2,500.
The TUC says the scheme is 'vindictive' and court awards to individuals are
reduced to 'virtually nothing' after social security clawbacks.
Up to five years of benefits paid to accident victims can be reclaimed from
costs and compensation ordered by the courts.
Unions argue that returns to the Benefits Agency are comparatively small,
while the consequences for individual victims can be severe.
Official figures confirm that between September 1990 and April last year a
total of Pounds 3.7m was repaid to the agency out of court awards, while
costs of Pounds 1.7m were incurred in the administration of the scheme.
The figures were disclosed at the end of last year in a letter from Mr
Michael Bichard, chief executive of the Department of Social Security
Benefits Agency, to Mr Graham Allen, Labour MP for Nottingham North.
The UCW postal workers' union, which has been monitoring the effects of the
new rules, cites the case of a postman who was involved in a road accident
while on duty and was forced to retire through ill health following a broken
arm with pains in his back and upper body.
His compensation claim took more that 2 1/2 years to settle and the final
award was Pounds 24,000. He had claimed a disablement pension and other
benefits totalling Pounds 15,000 from the Department of Social Security, and
his sickness pay from Royal Mail was Pounds 5,000. Under the new rules his
award was reduced to Pounds 4,000, the union said.
Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary and chairman of the TUC's social,
health and environmental protection committee, said the 'vindictive system'
meant 'the government is benefiting financially from individuals'
suffering'. He said that as well as many claimants losing thousands of
pounds, others were being deterred from even making any claims.
The Benefits Agency said yesterday the scheme was 'underpinned by a simple
and fair set of rules which ensure that the negligent parties meet their
liabilities rather than passing on some of them to the taxpayer'.
The agency added: 'Ministers are satisfied that the scheme is working well
and there are no plans for major change.'

FT  05 FEB 92 / Three guilty on fraud charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S longest criminal trial ended yesterday after 17 months when three
men were found guilty at Nottingham Crown Court of charges relating to the
collapse of Britannia Theme Park in Derbyshire in 1985. The three are
expected to be sentenced this week.
The case centred on the activities of a group of companies over a five-year
period and alleged fraudulent trading, deception and theft.
Mr Peter Kellard, of Rosebery Road, Bournemouth, was convicted of 19 of 22
fraud charges against him and was acquitted of three charges. Mr Edward
Dwyer, of East Avenue, Bournemouth, was found guilty of all six charges
against him. Mr John Wright, 56, the park's former chairman, of Norwich, was
found guilty of five charges, and acquitted of the final charge he faced. Mr
Keith Emmett, 55, of Cosgrave, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was acquitted
last Friday of all three charges against him.
The theme park had been open less than three months and owed more than
Pounds 8m when it collapsed.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Executive jailed for corruption
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR COLIN STUART, managing director of Dutton, the engineering company based
in Wrexham, north Wales, was yesterday sentenced to nine months'
imprisonment for corruption.
Mr Stuart, 57, of Chester, had pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court in
London to bribing an agent of Exxon Chemicals, the US chemicals producer, in
July 1990. The bribe was to end a dispute over payment for work by Dutton.
Judge Gerald Butler QC ordered Mr Stuart to pay Pounds 5,000 towards
prosecution costs.
Mr David Turner-Samuels QC, defending, said Mr Stuart had been put under
extreme pressure by his company's financial difficulties during a dispute
with Exxon.
He wrongly gained the impression that Exxon's agent was seeking a 'kick-back
for himself'. He had paid Pounds 7,000 as an inducement to 'get out of the
impasse' as that was cheaper than litigation.
The judge stressed that there was no corrupt conduct by Exxon or any of its
employees.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Currency and gold reserves fall Dollars 336m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNDERLYING level of Britain's gold and foreign currency reserves fell by
Dollars 336m in January, indicating some intervention by the Bank of England
to support sterling over the month, Emma Tucker writes.
Most City economists expected a Dollars 150m fall. Remaining reserves were a
healthy Dollars 44.6bn at the end of the month, compared with Dollars 44.1bn
at the end of December.
The underlying figure, which is net of borrowings and payments, is a rough
indicator of the level of intervention by the Bank in foreign currency
markets in supporting the pound.
Sterling came under pressure early last month amid fears it would dip below
its effective floor in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
The currency's weakness gave rise to speculation that the Bank would have to
intervene heavily to support it and that the government would be forced to
raise interest rates.
The Treasury figures show, however, that Bank intervention was limited even
during the tough trading period.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Electricity customers warned on bills row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL electricity users may face legal action if they go ahead with
their threat of refusing to pay the nuclear element in their annual power
bills when contracts are renewed in April.
Large consumers say they will not pay the nuclear part of their bills -
which amounts to 11 per cent of the total power charge - in protest at
electricity price increases. The UK generators and regional electricity
suppliers must pass on the levy to the government and may sue the users to
recoup their money.
Mr Jim Keohane, director of energy contracts at East Midlands Electricity,
said, 'We won't do anything precipitate, but if they don't pay the levy,
then we can start charging interest on any part of the bill that is unpaid
or we might institute legal proceedings to recover our money.'
Mr Keohane said he was sympathetic to the concerns of the main users, since
they will be facing large price increases in April, largely arising from the
price rise for wholesale electricity in the so-called 'pool'.
The UK generating companies, National Power and PowerGen, say pool prices
must rise to reflect their costs. In a recent speech to big users, Mr John
Baker, chairman of National Power, urged them to be extremely vigilant about
the additional costs such as the nuclear levy which are included in their
bills. He refused to comment yesterday.
PowerGen called the Pounds 1.2bn nuclear levy 'unjustifiable'. It said:
'It's unfair that customers and taxpayers should pay for keeping open old
nuclear plant.'
Industrial users' electricity bills are made up of four main components, but
charges for power make up more than 70 per cent of the total. The other
elements include charges for using regional companies' wires and the
transmission cost of using the national grid, as well as the nuclear levy.
National Grid, the company that runs the UK's transmission system, said
yesterday it would keep the cost of using the grid the same - on average -
this year as last year. A protest about delays in granting licences to
National Power and PowerGen to operate under the Environmental Protection
Act was sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, by Friends of
the Earth yesterday, John Hunt writes.
The two generating companies should have been given authorisations by the
Pollution Inspectorate by the end of August. The authorizations wouold have
limited power-station emissions.
The act requires details of the companies' applications to be placed on a
public register. The companies appealed against that on grounds of
commercial confidentiality.
The Department of the Environment yesterday said a report on the appeals had
been written and was with Mr Heseltine.
Ms Fiona Weir, FoE air pollution campaigner, said Mr Heseltine was allowing
the power generators to hold up implementation of 'vital new pollution
laws'.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): EC job opportunities surveyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS and technical staff will be the categories of people with most
opportunities to work in other European countries next year, according to a
survey of more than 200 Scottish employers.
The research, part of a project on the implications of the single European
market for vocational education and training, found that 40 per cent of
staff recruited from other EC countries filled either management or
technical posts.
The report, to be published shortly in the Industrial Relations Journal,
found that 50 per cent of employers surveyed believed the completion of the
single market next year would make no difference to recruitment and that
they were satisfied with local labour.
A substantial minority, 45 per cent, believed recruitment would be affected.
That view is widely held by larger companies, those with more than 100
employees. Researchers say larger companies are likely to have a better
understanding of the European labour market.
A third of companies had employed staff from other EC countries. The largest
companies (those with more than 500 employees) and those with EC links are
most likely to recruit staff from other EC countries.
Expanding business with the country concerned was cited by 20 per cent of
employers as the reason for recruiting staff from other EC countries.
More than 50 per cent of companies in service industries expected to recruit
staff from other EC countries, compared with 40 per cent in manufacturing
and construction.

Peace demand: protesters make their message plain at a trade union-organised
rally in Belfast yesterday.
Thousands of Roman Catholics and Protestants gathered to demand an end to
terrorist murder and intimidation of workers. It was the biggest gather-ing
of its kind since the Peace Movement marches of the late 1970s.
The IRA murders last month of eight Protestant construction workers in
County Tyrone prompted the rally. Mr Terry Carlin of the Irish Congress of
Trade Unions, which organised the rally, said earlier: 'This platform will
represent a unique coming together of the trade union movement throughout
the whole of these islands to affirm the right of workers in Northern
Ireland to go to their work free from threats of murder and destruction of
workplaces.'
Among the speakers was Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades
Union Congress.

FT  05 FEB 92 / More debt centre cash urged from societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies were asked yesterday by Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs
minister, to provide more cash for money advice centres to help people with
debt difficulties.
Mr Leigh met six of the largest societies on Monday together with
representatives of the Money Advice Trust in an attempt to improve
co-operation between societies and the trust, which was set up to raise
money for debt counselling.
Building societies have been criticised for being less generous in
contributing to money advice centres than banks and other lenders, even
though many building society customers have suffered severely with debts.
The largest donation to the trust by a building society has come from
Nationwide, the second-biggest society. It announced last week that it was
giving Pounds 345,000 to fund a money advice support unit in London.
Mr Leigh said yesterday that although obtaining money advice funding from
societies had been slower than expected, he was hopeful about progress.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Interest on late debts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN in favour of giving businesses an automatic legal right to
charge interest on overdue debts will make the difficulties of late payment
worse, the Credit Protection Association warned yesterday.
Businesses charging interest would be lending money where the banks would
not, according to Mr David Lee, sales manager of Credit Protection
Association, a company providing credit management advice and debt chasing
services.
Pressure for a change in the law has been led by the Forum of Private
Business, which has 18,000 members.
British businesses normally expect to be paid within 30 days of making a
delivery or sending an invoice, but they have to wait, on average, 78 days
for their bills to be settled. German companies wait only 48 days.
The company said businesses were being led to believe that charging interest
would overcome the difficulty, but customers who had no intention of paying
would be only too delighted to get their hands on extended credit.
'By giving extended credit, companies are actually increasing their risk
with non-payers. The answer is not to add interest but to recover the money
that is rightfully yours.'
It advised companies to state terms of trade at the outset, to act as soon
as payment became due and to be firm in pursuing claims.

<TEXT>
COUNCILS are refusing to invoke a concessionary clause in local-authority
finance law that would allow them to waive or reduce rates bills for
businesses in difficulty, the Federation of Small Businesses said yesterday.
The federation, which has nearly 50,000 members, urged local authorities to
exercise a discretion available under section 49 of the Local Government
Finance Act of 1988 to help small businesses facing difficulty in paying
their rates.
According to the Department of the Environment, only Pounds 18,000 of relief
was granted in 1990-91, compared with income from the business rate of about
Pounds 15bn, the federation said.
Mr John Harris, policy chairman at the federation, said: 'Our survey shows
how little local authorities value their small business community. With over
200 businesses closing each day it is imperative that this little-known
relief is publicised and acted upon.'
The federation lobbied hard during the preparation of the local-authority
finance legislation for the term 'poverty', which was in the original
proposal, to be replaced by 'hardship' to make it easier for businesses to
gain relief.
'Now we find that all that was to no avail since nine times out of 10 local
authorities have pushed aside all thought of giving the relief,' Mr Harris
said.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Number of estate agency branches shows steep drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESTATE agency industry in Britain has contracted sharply because of the
housing market recession, a survey has found.
The total number of estate agency branches has fallen from a peak of 6,500
in 1988 to just over 5,000 at the end of last year, according to the
February edition of Estate Agency News, a trade magazine.
Only two agency chains, Royal Life and Halifax, now have more than 500
branches each, compared with seven chains in 1988. At that time, Royal Life
and Halifax had more than 800 branches each and were trying to reach a
target of 1,000 branches.
Most of the large chains are continuing to make heavy losses, and the
magazine describes the estate agency business as an industry in decline.
Prudential Property Services, then the largest agency in the market, has
since withdrawn altogether, shutting down 250 branches and selling more than
600.
However, some chains are still growing, usually by buying the branches of
the longer-established loss-making chains such as Prudential Property
Services.
One of the most impressive new entrants to the market is Woolwich Building
Society, which bought 210 offices from Prudential and re-established the
Chesterton brand name in central London. Woolwich, which had no chain at the
height of the housing boom, now has 400 offices - putting it ahead of
Nationwide, the second-largest building society, which has fallen back to
378 agencies from 400.
Connell, owned by Scottish Widows, the life assurance company, has added 68
branches, also bought from Prudential Property Services. A further 30
branches purchased from Prudential by Connell were closed.
A new chain, Arun Estates, has been set up to take over 108 branches from
Prudential. It is now the largest privately owned chain in the UK.
Altogether the top 20 agencies closed one in 10 of their branches last year,
and the contraction of the industry looks likely to continue for the
foreseeable future.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Sales of houses 'fell by 7% to 1.24m last year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of house sales in Britain fell 7 per cent to 1.24m last year,
compared with 1.34m in 1990, according to figures published yesterday by
James R. Adams, the independent research consultancy.
Transactions last year were 40 per cent fewer than in 1988, when the housing
market was at its peak.
The figures underline the depth of the recession in the market, which in the
past few weeks has seen renewed interest from prospective house purchasers.
The consultancy said sales in an average year would be about 1.5m, or 20 per
cent higher than in 1990 and last year.
The figures were calculated from a sample of 12,500 transactions involving
more than 20,500 individuals and submitted by a panel of more than 100
solicitors. They showed that house sales dipped sharply in October, November
and December after rallying in the previous three months.
Mr Jimmy Adams, chairman of the consultancy, said: 'It takes several months
to complete sales after purchasers have agreed to buy. It is therefore
likely to be early summer before we can be sure whether the current upsurge
in interest has resulted in higher sales.
'The rally which took place last autumn probably reflected increased
confidence following the end of the Gulf war,' he continued.
'This evaporated as people became more concerned about job prospects and the
state of the economy.'
According to the consultancy, sales fell 10 per cent to 301,581 in the final
three months of last year compared with the previous three months. Sales
were 12 per cent lower than in the final three months of 1990.
The cash value of sales last year was Pounds 77.27bn compared with Pounds
80.08bn in 1990 and Pounds 114.92bn in 1988. The percentage of properties
bought for cash has fallen from 19.1 per cent in 1988 to 14.2 per cent last
year. Loans accounted for 71.3 per cent of purchases last year compared with
66.8 per cent four years ago.
People moving to another region accounted for 17 per cent of house sales
last year. The largest group moving between regions was from greater London
to south-east England. The second-largest was those moving from the
south-east to the south-west.
The survey also showed that nearly three quarters of those moving paid more
for their new home than they had for their old one, in spite of lower prices
in London, southern England and in the Yorkshire area, said the consultancy.
Most builders and estate agents expect the number of house sales to increase
this year as buyers who have been staying out of the market take advantage
of lower prices. Few, however, expect prices to increase this year.
A survey of 27 house builders conducted by stockbrokers Barclay de Zoete
Wedd found that nearly two thirds of the companies had seen an increase in
activity since the new year. Seventy per cent of the builders expected sales
to increase this year, while 67 per cent said house prices were unlikely to
increase even if sales rose.
BZW said it expected a gentle upturn in the market this year.

<TEXT>
MOST travel agents are optimistic about business prospects this year,
according to a survey for Hertz, the car rental company.
The survey of 200 travel agents last month confirms reports from package
tour operators that the holiday market appears to be unaffected by the
recession.
The survey found that 72 per cent of travel agent chains were more
optimistic about business compared with three months previously. Nineteen
per cent were less optimistic and 9 per cent reported no change. Eighty per
cent of independent travel agents were more optimistic, with 10 per cent
less optimistic and 10 per cent saying they saw no change.
The travel agents said they thought business would improve further over the

OFFICIALS at Upjohn, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company, are facing
a shareholder lawsuit charging them with concealing information about
problems with Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed sleeping pill,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The company, which recently denied a report that it had concealed data about
the drug's side-effects from the Food and Drug Administration, said it
believed the shareholder claims had no merit and the company would
vigorously defend itself. Mr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman, and eight
directors were named in the suit filed in a federal court in New York.
News of the suit had little impact on Upjohn's share price. At the close in
New York yesterday it had fallen Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 1/2 .

THE FBI is examining tapes of conversations inside the executive offices of
Citicorp's Manhattan headquarters recorded by an outside security consultant
who claims he has evidence there was a bugging system in the building.
Citicorp yesterday strongly denied there had been any eavesdropping system
inside the bank, but confirmed that in mid-December of last year the
recordings were brought to the attention of Mr Richard Braddock, Citicorp's
president.
The bank said yesterday that it was approached in December by the New
York-based consultant, Mr Tony Gattilo, who said he had evidence of bugging.
Mr Gattilo said yesterday that last autumn he began picking up radio
transmissions of conversations at Citicorp concerning leveraged buy-outs,
venture capital and real estate loans. Mr Gattilo said he was conducting a
scan for another client for possible bugs at a building near Citicorp's Park
Avenue headquarters.
The incident highlights the security problems facing large corporate
institutions in an era of sophisticated electronic monitoring devices.
A former Citibank employee, acting as an intermediary for Mr Gattilo,
brought the matter to Mr Braddock's attention on December 11.
Two days later a meeting was arranged between Mr Gattilo and Mr John
Cosenza, the head of Citicorp security. Mr Gattilo said that some of the
transmissions came from a bug in the office of Mr William Comfort, a senior
vice-president of the bank who is chairman of the Citicorp venture capital
division. Other transmissions, concerning real estate and other subjects,
came from the bank's adjacent Citicorp Center building on Lexington Avenue.
Both Mr Gattilo and Citicorp agree that the transmissions from Mr Comfort's
office ended just before the December 13 meeting.
Citicorp said it had conducted an extensive investigation and had concluded
there was no bugging system at the bank.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Uneven share of riches fuelled Caracas revolt: An attempt by
Venezuelan rebels to tap intopopular discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILED coup in Venezuela yesterday took place in an economy that had
just recorded its highest growth rate in 27 years - at 9.2 per cent Latin
America's highest - but was still unable to feed nearly half its citizens
more than one meal a day.
It came with a balanced budget and foreign reserves of Dollars 14bn (Pounds
7.7bn). Inflation, which peaked at 89 per cent three years ago, has eased to
about 30 per cent.
But the coup attempt caps a crescendo of anger and frustration over the
economic reforms that have written such a macro-economic success story but
have failed to benefit the lives of most Venezuelans and have embittered
many.
The rebel troops who for several hours seized the Miraflores government
palace and the La Casona presidential residence early yesterday were
apparently seeking to take advantage of mounting unrest over price rises and
poor public services.
The rebels were no doubt emboldened by a poll published last week suggesting
81 per cent of Venezuelans had little or no confidence left in 69-year-old
President Carlos Andres Perez.
Mr Perez has taken pains to try to persuade his people stoically to bear the
short-term pain of rising prices that are drawing them to the streets in a
surging wave of strikes and protests.
About a dozen students and two policemen were killed in demonstrations last
year and more than 100 vehicles were burned. News of disturbances brings
fears of a repeat of 1989 riots over price hikes in which at least 300
people died.
The protests, observers say, stem from the government's failure to match the
pace of reforms with social programmes that would ease the impact of
economic adjustments.
President Perez, who as populist president in the 1970s implemented many of
the measures he is now trying to scrap, won full backing from international
lending agencies for abandoning state interference in the economy in favour
of a market-driven system.
After taking office on February 2 1989, he lifted many subsidies, slashed
import duties and opened the economy to foreign investment.
He also sought free trade pacts with Latin American nations and the US, and
started the slow task of restructuring the public sector through
deregulation and privatisation.
But the reforms have yet to improve the lives of most Venezuelans, almost
half of whom earn little more than Dollars 100 a month.
Food prices have, in many cases, doubled. An increase in petrol prices,
resulting in higher bus fares, has sparked student riots. Electricity rates
have risen tenfold.
'We think it's the right policy but the reforms don't seem to be helping the
lower classes,' one western diplomat said recently.
Among those who have seen their living standards plummet - albeit from a
relatively high level - are the officers and men in a military that long
prided itself on staying out of politics.
Drawn primarily from the poor and middle classes, in the past few years it
has seen its pay eroded by inflation and housing allowances and other
privileges trimmed as part of the overall belt-tightening.
The assault on the government, in which soldiers from at least six army
units participated, was aimed at assassinating President Perez, who only two
days earlier marked the third year of his five-year term.
Little is known about the rebels other than their intention to overthrow the
current administration and install a new regime.
One who was captured, identified as Army Comandante Chavez, sent a televised
message to the rebels who were still fighting at midday yesterday, calling
on them to give up to halt further bloodshed.
Their goal of seizing power in the capital 'for now, unfortunately, was not
achieved', he said. He did not say - or was not allowed to say - what
motivated his group's actions.
The coup attempt was violently crushed by units of the Venezuelan armed
forces who remained loyal to President Perez, their constitutional
commander-in-chief. These loyal units represented the bulk of Venezuela's
armed forces.
Since the last military dictator was ousted in 1958, the great majority of
Venezuela's officer corps has supported the constitutional system under
which the military are subject to civilian control and are not permitted to
participate in politics.
Venezuela's military often takes great pains publicly to assert its
allegiance to Venezuela's constitutional order, and to reject any suggestion
that military adventurers are interested in assuming power by arms.
The number of attempted coups, openly defiant officers and other
anti-constitutional incidents had steadily diminished since the 1960s.
For many years, Venezuelan officers were rewarded for their service via a
system that provided them with comfortable pay, government-subsidised plans
for acquiring homes, cars and furniture, as well as other benefits. Generals
and admirals are retired after times in their early fifties - with
substantial pensions and continued access to many benefits.
Since 1989, life in the armed forces has become considerably less
comfortable, especially for middle- and lower-level officers. Career
officers have suffered from the same economic problems - high inflation and
lower living standards - that struck most of Venezuela's civilian population
since the government initiated its economic reform programme.
The freshly-starched public image of the Venezuelan military has of late
become grimy. Over the last several years, the armed forces have become fair
game for media probes of corruption, and a number of high-ranking officers
(usually retired) have been implicated in scandals.

upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday he believed
recent interest rate cuts would turn the stagnant economy around by the
second quarter, but left the door open for further monetary easing if
needed, Reuter reports from Washington.
'We expect the amount of monetary ease in the pipeline is adequate to turn
the economy on to the path of sustained recovery,' Mr Greenspan said in
testimony to the House of Representatives' budget committee.
Mr Greenspan said he expected the economy to pick up in the second quarter
and gain steam as the year progressed. 'There should be a quickening in the
pace of activity as the year goes on,' he said, adding: 'We are, of course,
continuing to evaluate whether some additional insurance in the way of
further monetary ease would be appropriate.'
The US economy is beset by rising unemployment and overall lower industrial
activity, although economists say the recession has been relatively shallow
in most of the country.
President George Bush's prospects for re-election in November are closely
linked to the economy's performance.
The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday
afternoon to discuss the course of monetary policy. The committee will
report on its deliberations in a week's time.
The Fed startled financial markets on December 20 when it cut the discount
rate at which it lends money to banks by a full point. The cut was aimed at
stimulating spending.
Mr Greenspan told the budget committee it was apparent some 'strong forces'
had been working against a typical economic recovery in the US.
But he said it looked unlikely overall economic activity would slide into a
new morass of recession.
The economy is uneven, 'but it does not appear that we are tumbling into
another significant contraction in overall activity,' he said.

MR Terry Ramsden, the former City investor known for his lavish lifestyle,
yesterday waived extradition in a Los Angeles federal court and agreed to
return to the UK to face fraud charges in connection with dealings in
Japanese equity warrants through his investment company Glen International.
His lawyer declined to say what prompted Mr Ramsden's decision, but said his
waiver included an agreement with the Serious Fraud Office to recommend bail
of 'a reasonable amount' based on a financial statement Mr Ramsden will
submit on arrival in the UK.
Charges he faces in the UK include fraudulent trading, obtaining property by
deception, evading debts by deception and making false statements to
investigators.
Last month a federal judge denied bail to Mr Ramsden, who has been in
custody since his arrest on September 8 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Bush responds to Japanese work ethic jibe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Tokyo and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday defended the US work ethic against
disparaging Japanese comments and his economic recovery package against
domestic congressional criticisms, saying that growth and determination
would help propel the world into 'the next American century.'
He avoided a direct attack on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime
minister, who earlier in the day apologised for the 'misunderstanding' he
had caused by a parliamentary answer on Monday. Mr Miyazawa had told a Diet
committee that he had felt for a long time that Americans 'may have lacked
the work ethic'.
The remarks had been condemned by the White House in Washington as 'not
helpful'.
Mr Bush, addressing a convention of 5,000 food store executives in Orlando,
Florida, said: 'We'll combine our common sense, our work ethic and our
determination with pro-growth policies,' adding: 'Day-by-day and
step-by-step we're going to get ourselves moving' out of the recession.
Rejecting criticisms from Democrats and Mr Jack Kemp, his housing secretary,
that the plan outlined last week in his State of the Union message and
national budget was filled with 'gimmicks', the president said: 'I'm going
to just keep challenging the Congress to get this economy on the move. We've
got a good sound, stimulative package. And this is no time for political
carping.'
The exchanges between Tokyo and Washington highlighted the increase in
bilateral tension since Mr Bush visited Japan last month.
Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, called Mr Miyazawa's remarks an
'ignorant expression of Japanese racism'. He added: 'The Japanese prime
minister is wrong. Americans work hard every day, and our productivity is
higher than Japan's'
Yesterday Mr Miyazawa said he had intended to criticise an over-emphasis on
speculative financial activities in Japan as well as in the US, and not to
criticise Americans. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that the phrase
'work ethic' meant 'philosophy of work'. The elaborate explanations offered
indicate how sensitive Japanese officials are about antagonising the US.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Thomas Pickering, the highly regarded US envoy to the United Nations, is
to leave his post this summer to become ambassador to India  - a move which
has surprised observers in New York and Washington.
He will be replaced by Mr Ed Perkins, the 63-year-old director general of
the Foreign Service. Mr Perkins, who is black, will move into a
high-visibility post, one of the few top foreign policy jobs occupied by
minorities in the Bush administration.
Mr Pickering's three-year posting was due to end in the summer, but many
diplomats thought he might have been asked to stay on. The ambassador, a
former US envoy to Israel and El Salvador, played a key role in securing
passage of UN resolutions against Iraq.
It seems, however, that he had too high a profile for the taste of Mr James
Baker, US secretary of state, who jealously guards every inch of territory
in foreign policy.
Officials close to Mr Baker have suggested that Mr Pickering was too quick
to claim credit for administration successes and also discussed policy too
openly. But this view is dismissed by Mr Pickering's supporters.

<TEXT>
LAUDA AIR, the Austrian airline owned by Mr Niki Lauda, is expected to
announce this week it has chosen US General Electric GE90 engines to power
its new Boeing 777 widebody aircraft instead of the Rolls-Royce Trent and
the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, Paul Betts writes.
The deal is expected to be worth over Dollars 150m (Pounds 82m). Lauda Air
is the second airline after British Airways to opt for the new GE90 heavy
thrust engine for its new Boeing 777 fleet. The Austrian airline placed
orders last year for four Boeing 777s, with delivery between 1997 and 2000.
The three leading aero-engine makers are in fierce competition to win
customers for their new heavy thrust engines to power the new Boeing 777s.
The market for large engines is expected to account for an increasingly
important share of the commercial engine business over the next 10 years as
airlines expand their widebody fleets.
With the Lauda Air order going to GE, the field has levelled out, with
Rolls-Royce placing its Trent engine with two Boeing 777 customers (Thai
International and Emirates), and Pratt &amp; Whitney winning Boeing 777 engine
orders with United Airlines and All Nippon Airways.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPONENTS of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) yesterday
accused the administration of trying to limit 'negative coverage' of Nafta
negotiations by operating in an atmosphere of secrecy.
The US trade representative's office is refusing to disclose the venue of
the next Nafta ministerial talks. The meeting between the trade ministers of
the US, Canada and Mexico is believed to be scheduled for Sunday and Monday
somewhere in the Washington area. Previous Nafta negotiations in Seattle and
Mexico led to big protests. Opponents believe the administration is trying
to avoid a repetition this weekend.
Mr Craig Merrilees, co-director of the Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of
Nafta opponents, said: 'Citizen groups, even if they don't command much
respect in Washington, have a right to know what their government is doing.
The administration is trying to keep this out of the public eye by
controlling the media and providing as few details as possible.'
The Fair Trade Campaign represents consumer, environment, labour, church and
family farm groups opposing the trade pact out of concern about job losses
and possible environmental damage from new industrialisation in Mexico.
Congressman Jim Kolbe (Republican, Arizona), said the present negotiating
text contained hundreds of brackets, indicating disagreement among the
countries, which still must be reduced before presentation to Congress.
He described a negotiation with 'no deal-breakers' but still lacking
dramatic incentives to overcome the obstacles of recession and election-year
politics in Congress. Mexico would like changes in the US dumping and
countervailing duties laws which Congress will not grant. The US would like
concessions on energy, but will not push for anything requiring changes in
the Mexican constitution.
Congressman Robert Matsui (Democrat, California), who has supported Nafta,
is urging the administration not to send it to Congress this year.
'The president runs the risk of turning this into a partisan issue and
ultimately losing it,' he declared. 'The mood in Washington is more
protectionist than I've seen in my 13 years here.'

<TEXT>
MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, ended a two-day trip to Mexico
without offering any clear commitment that a North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) would be presented to Congress this year, only saying: 'If
we get a good agreement, I think it will be presented (before the US
elections).'
She would not comment on what constituted a good agreement, nor how likely
it was one would be reached. Repeating a familiar line, she claimed the
'content or the substance in the agreement will drive the deadline,' not
vice-versa.
The absence of anything more specific at this stage suggests US officials
are at best undecided whether to present Congress with an agreement before
the November presidential and Congressional elections.
Mr Albert Bustamente, a Texan congressman, stressed the uncertainty over
prospects of a Nafta when he said an accord might not be reached this year,
but could be wrapped up in two or three years. Mr Jim Kolbe, a congressman
from New Mexico, said the elections and weak state of the US economy could
delay signing of the treaty.
Despite uncertainty over when a treaty will be presented to Congress, the
trade negotiators are still working to resolve remaining differences,
currently meeting in Ottawa. Mexican officials, who earlier said a completed
draft could be ready by January, now say it will be ready by the end of this
month or in early March.
This raises the prospect that a completed treaty will be initialled in the
next few months. But speculation is growing that President Bush, citing lack
of time, would wait until after the elections before presenting the document
to Congress. Mrs Hills' remarks have not dispelled that speculation.
This would be thought acceptable by the Mexican authorities, who would have
something concrete to show for the enormous political and economic risk
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took in proposing a free trade agreement
in June 1990. Mrs Hills and members of her delegation met President Salinas
and the ministers of trade, finance, agriculture, ecology and labour.
She described her visit as 'not at all a negotiation, 'a very good 30
hours.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ YESTERDAY withdrew from negotiations with the United Nations aimed at
allowing the shipment of Dollars 1.6bn worth of Iraqi oil, mainly to pay for
food, medicines and other civilian needs.
A UN spokesman said last night Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's chief UN
delegate, had notified the secretariat of the decision on the eve of a
second round of talks in Vienna today.
The talks were due to last until Friday, with Mr Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian
senior secretariat official, representing the UN. Mr Al-Anbari and Mr Annan
held their first talks in the Austrian capital early last month in what UN
officials said was a bid to overcome obstacles raised by Iraq to conditions
imposed by the Security Council for a one-time, partial lifting of the oil
embargo.
Asked if the Iraqi decision meant only a postponement of negotiations, with
a later resumption possible, Mr Francois Guiliani, the UN spokesman, said
they were 'cancelled like in cancelled, not cancelled like in postponed'.
However, Mr Anbari was reported to have said privately that further talks
could not be excluded, although Iraq did not think these could be useful,
given the conditions imposed by the Security Council.
In agreeing last August that Iraq could sell some oil in a six-month period,
the council ordered that the proceeds must be paid into a UN escrow account.
The resolution expires next month.
Almost Dollars 1bn was to be released for purchases of food and medicines
and for humanitarian needs, with the remainder to be used to pay for Iraqi
war reparations and bills incurred by the UN as a result of council
decisions.
President Saddam Hussein denounced these conditions and refused to order a
resumption of oil shipments, despite his claim that Iraq was desperately in
need of funds to purchase essential supplies.
Iraq may still possess hundreds of Scud missiles, the US said yesterday,
Reuter adds from Washington. The State Department said Baghdad had
acknowledged purchasing 819 Scuds and, while many of these had been
destroyed in the Iran-Iraq and Gulf wars, 'we estimate that Iraq may still
be concealing a large number of these missiles, probably in the hundreds'.

THE NUMBER of foreigners living illegally in Japan increased by 50 per cent
to 159,828 last May compared with 10 months earlier, the Ministry of Justice
said yesterday,
No reasons were given for the rise but it is seen as a response to Japan's
labour shortage.
Many foreigners are working illegally in small manufacturing companies and
in transport. The ministry computed the figures by comparing immigration
entry and exit records.
The largest number of illegal aliens was from the Philippines, at 27,226.
The count from Korea rose by 86.3 per cent to 25,848, while illegal
immigration from Iran surged from 764 to 10,915.
Other countries contributing large numbers include Thailand, China, Malaysia
and Bangladesh.
Mr Sohei Miyashita, Japan's defence minister, said yesterday his ministry
would cut Y100bn (Pounds 450.45m) from its current five-year budget to help
compensate for Gulf war contributions, Reuter adds.
Japan gave Dollars 9bn to the US-led coalition forces fighting to oust Iraq
from Kuwait last year. Opposition parties had demanded a cut in the defence
budget as part of a parliamentary deal on the Gulf war funds.
The Defence Ministry said that it had earmarked Y22,750bn for defence in the
current five-year programme to run from April 1991 to March 1996.

NOT MUCH has gone right for New Zealand's conservative National Party
government since it swept to a landslide election victory over the former
Labour government 15 months ago.
The economy remains in recession, unemployment has reached 10 per cent and
National support has dropped to below 30 per cent in the opinion polls.
However, the government is congratulating itself on the implementation of
one of the most radical reforms of industrial relations law achieved in any
industrialised country.
The Employment Contracts Act (ECA), which became law in May last year, swept
away a century of state regulation of the labour market in favour of a
de-regulated system which in effect by-passes trade unions.
Under the old system, which dated from 1894, most wages and conditions were
set centrally in negotiations between unions and employers' representatives
and were then legally ratified as occupational 'awards'.
The awards covered all workers in each trade, most of whom were also legally
required to be union members. The effect was that bargaining was difficult
at company level and almost impossible at plant level.
The ECA scraps compulsory union membership and national awards in favour of
single contracts between employers and individuals or groups of workers,
which are enforceable under civil law.
Employees can negotiate their own contracts or appoint bargaining agents who
may or may not be trade unions. Strikes are legal only during contract
negotiations but the act sets minimum entitlements for wages, holidays and
sickness benefits.
Eight months since the act came into force, it is clear that New Zealand is
experiencing a significant shift to productivity bargaining at plant level,
combined with a big fall in the number of industrial disputes.
What is more surprising, real wages do not appear to have fallen although
reductions in shift premiums and the abolition of penalty payments for
evening and weekend work have cut unit labour costs by an estimated 20-25
per cent.
Mr Bill Birch, employment minister, says the first 90 contracts registered
with the government show that only 6 per cent of the employees involved
received cuts in nominal wages.
The rest received nominal increases of 0-3 per cent, against a background of
1 per cent inflation. That compares favourably with the previous five years
during which most workers have suffered falls in real income.
The number of working days lost in disputes fell to 1,404 in the first four
months after the act became law, compared with 220,950 in the comparable
period of the previous year.
Most observers agree that the reduction was caused by a combination of
recession, legal restrictions on strikes and faster resolution of disputes
at plant level, where managers and workers can now discuss problems face to
face.
The ECA is strongly opposed by the trade union movement, which has lost
about 20 per cent of its private sector membership but has been unable to
mount any significant industrial action.
The unions have been excluded from the bargaining process in about half the
contracts signed so far, many of which were negotiated by an emerging
industry of employment consultants - mostly lawyers and former union
officials.
Mr Ken Douglas, president of the Council of Trade Unions, describes the act
as the 'Pol Pot-isation' of industrial relations and accuses the government
of trying to re-create Victorian exploitation.
'The act is an attempt to use the pressures of unemployment to pull down
labour costs. But it is inequitable because it will hurt the weakest most
and it will not work because the supposed productivity gains are illusory,'
he says.
'They will disappear if the economy ever starts growing again because
employers will be unable to resist wage pressures without the co-operation
of the union movement. When that happens, the employers will be crying out
for a return to collective bargaining.'
Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader, says the act has weakened social justice
by removing the unions 'from the factory floor to the car park.' Labour says
it will seek an economic agreement with the unions if it wins the next
election, due in 1993.
On the employers' side, the ECA has been strongly welcomed by the Business
Round Table, a free market think-tank which provided much of the
intellectual justification for the act.
'The whole thing has been a real good-news story. All the huffing and
puffing was over in 24 hours and there has been a surprisingly quick move
towards individual contracts with very little industrial disruption,' says
Mr Roger Kerr, the Round Table director.
However, the act is viewed more cautiously by some employers, many of whom
were not prepared for the problems of negotiating directly with their
employees.
'It has been a nuisance that management time has had to be spent on the
issue,' says Mr Jon Hamilton, chairman of CWF Hamilton, a Christchurch
engineering company. 'Some employers have been using the Act to screw down
wages but we don't want to do that unless we are driven to it.'
New Zealand recorded a 1.3 per cent rise in real gross domestic product in
the three months to last September, spurring hopes that the protracted and
deep seated recession may have reached a turning point, writes Terry Hall in
Wellington.
The rise, the first since December 1989, appears to confirm statements from
manufacturers that exports are picking up, and follow other encouraging
statistics including a fall on annual inflation to 1 per cent, improving
overseas trade figures, and surveys showing rising business confidence.
However, a Statistics Department spokesman said that the rise was not enough
to offset declines in real GDP during the previous three quarters and the
index was down 2.4 per cent over the year to September.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Reynolds nears winning post in PM stakes / A report on the
political comeback of the man who was sacked by Haughey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish punter who in 1983 placed a IPounds 50 bet at 14-1 that Mr Albert
Reynolds, then a government parliamentary spokesman on industry, would
succeed Mr Charles Haughey as leader of the Fianna Fail party and become
prime minister should be a happy man tomorrow.
Ireland's biggest bookmaker, Paddy Power, which took that bet, yesterday
shortened the odds on Mr Reynolds to 20-1 on, 'and we still look as though
we are going to lose a lot of money,' a company manager said.
Ireland's next Taoiseach will be elected by the Fianna Fail parliamentary
group tomorrow after the formal resignation of Mr Haughey, who said last
week he would be stepping down 'to further advance the best interests of the
country.'
A 1982 telephone-tapping scandal resurfaced last month, culminating a series
of controversies in which Mr Haughey had become embroiled during the past
six months. He was presented by his government coalition partners with the
option of resigning or facing a general election.
Having widespread support in the parliamentary party in addition to that of
almost half the cabinet, including the finance minister, Mr Bertie Ahern, Mr
Reynolds can confidently expect to be sworn in as Taoiseach next Tuesday.
His only challengers are the health minister, Mrs Mary O'Rourke and the
agriculture minister, Mr Michael Woods, (25-1 and 40-1 respectively).
Born 56 years ago in Rooskey, a small village in the western county of
Roscommon, Mr Reynolds was educated in the local Catholic school and found
his first job as a wages clerk on the Irish railways.
Following a path trodden by many young men from the west of Ireland, he
emigrated to Canada, but returned in the early 1960s to join his brothers in
the running of the family dance hall business, established by his father in
Rooskey and expanded by the younger Reynolds to other towns. As a keen
amateur country and western singer, he would often appear on stage in jeans,
boots and cowboy hat crooning into a microphone.
He moved to Longford, where he and a partner in 1970 set up a petfood
factory to process previously exported trimmings and offal from the local
slaughterhouses. This provided the financial basis for his launch into
politics. The factory is now managed by his son and is set for a IPounds 4m
expansion through an acquisition in continental Europe.
He apparently first became involved in the Fianna Fail on his return from
Canada, working up through the party. He was a Longford county councillor
from 1975-79 and was first elected to parliament in 1977. On the election of
Mr Haughey as prime minister in 1979, he was brought into the cabinet as
transport and telecommunications minister. He was then given the industry
and energy portfolio until 1982, after which he spent spent five years as an
opposition parliamentary spokesman.
Back in government in 1987, he became industry and commerce minister and in
1988 became finance minister, the post from which both Mr Haughey and his
predecessor, Mr Jack Lynch, advanced to the premiership.
However, Mr Reynolds came close to ending his career last November, when he
was sacked by Mr Haughey for leading a party leadership challenge. He was
criticised by some for mounting the challenge prematurely.
A life-long teetotaller, devout Catholic, and a chainsmoker until he gave up
four years ago, Mr Reynolds is married with two sons and five daughters.
Speaking to businessmen last week he said that tackling unemployment must be
at the top of the political agenda in 1992 and that the Irish economy should
be 'an instrument in the creation of a society in which nobody feels left
out.'

POLAND, Czechoslovakia and Hungary should be made full members of the
European Community 'as soon as possible,' Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the
German foreign minister, said at the close of a one-day visit to Warsaw,
writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Mr Genscher explained that the recently signed association agreement between
Brussels and the three central European countries for a gradual removal of
trade barriers on non-farming goods by the end of the century, meant that
the path to full membership 'could be shortened.'
However, he added that the moment of full membership would depend on
'economic progress.'
Mr Genscher's visit was designed to establish contact with Poland's new
government, which met yesterday to give preliminary approval to economic
plans for this year.
Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the chief minister responsible for the economy, said
afterwards that the Polish budget deficit this year would reach 5 per cent
of gross domestic product (GDP), a slight increase on 1991, when the deficit
touched on 4 per cent of GDP.

THE French government will call a special session of parliament on Friday to
debate the Habash affair, President Francois Mitterrand said last night.
He made the announcement in an unscheduled television interview, in an
attempt to put an end to the political storm of protest precipitated by the
hospitalisation in Paris last week of the Palestinian leader, Mr George
Habash.
'There is no longer a Habash affair,' he said. He insisted it had never been
serious or dramatic, but merely an error of political judgment on the part
of the senior officials who authorised the admission of Mr Habash.
President Mitterrand said that Friday's debate would be preceded by a
government policy declaration, and concluded with a government confidence
motion. If the motion were defeated, or an opposition censure motion passed,
he indicated, the national assembly would be dissolved and early elections
held.
He ruled out the resignation of any government ministers, or a more general
reshuffle of the government of Mrs Edith Cresson, in response to the Habash
affair. He said if he had ever contemplated a government reshuffle, he
certainly would not carry it out now.
He also announced that US President George Bush had agreed to a meeting of
the powers with nuclear weapons in Europe to discuss the security of nuclear
systems in the former Soviet Union.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Hurd says nation state in good shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE powers of the nation state in 'hugely important areas of policy' had not
been significantly affected by last December's Maastricht treaty, Mr Douglas
Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said in London yesterday.
Mr Hurd told British MPs the separate 'pillar' system of the European Union,
as proposed by the UK, had been fully respected by the treaty.
The treaty was a compromise, but it had safeguarded British interests. Both
the new common foreign and security policy and most of justice and home
affairs remained essentially outside the European Community's competence and
were designated as matters for inter-governmental co-operation, he said .
That did not mean the UK, which takes over the EC presidency in July, was
not interested in making progress in these areas. Within the
inter-governmental context, it would ensure matters were taken forward
promptly and effectively.
Mr Hurd rejected suggestions that the European Monetary Union provisions of
the treaty represented 'the most enormous transfer of power from this (the
British) parliament to alien institutions.'
That could happen, Mr Hurd conceded, if all member countries moved on to
stage three of EMU, when a single currency and independent European central
bank would be created. But this UKwould be subject to the British
parliament.
Referring to German demands it was not realistic to create an EC central
bank without central political institutions to control it, Mr Hurd said he
did not believe it would be 'sensible' to centralise EC political
institutions.
He found it difficult to imagine an enlarged Community of some 18 members
with a centralised structure.

<TEXT>
THE group of northern industrialists backing Italy's new daily newspaper,
L'Indipendente, have forced a change of editorship less than three months
after its launch.
The backers, who include the Danieli, Falck and Levi families, have decided
to replace the paper's detached up-market style, modelled on the Anglo-Saxon
quality press, with an aggressive approach to try to prop up sagging sales
and lack of advertising.
Mr Ricardo Franco Levi, the founder editor, is to be replaced by Mr Vittorio
Feltri, formerly editor of the weekly magazine Europeo. Mr Arrigo Levi, the
former's uncle and one of Italy's foremost columnists, is also due to leave.
The paper was launched on November 14. Although the backers hoped sales
would stabilise around an 80,000 break-even point, they have fallen close to
35,000.
The new editor is thought to be close to the populist Lombard League, which
has broken the mould of traditional politics in northern Italy.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Fiat seeks state aid to shed 10,300 workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, yesterday announced plans for
10,300 redundancies this year in a further sign of the competitive pressures
now facing the country's big manufacturers, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The company has requested state aid for almost half the job cuts through a
government-assisted early retirement scheme, adding its name to a string of
big industrial groups currently seeking government help to cushion the blow
of redundancy programmes.
The company's announcement will come as unwelcome news to Italy's
politicians, who are facing a general election on April 5.
Last month Olivetti, the loss-making computers group, announced plans for
2,500 lay-offs this year.
Tripartite discussions between ministers, unions and company representatives
on the proposal have made little progress so far.
Last year Fiat asked for state-assisted early retirement for 3,700 workers,
but received provision for only 700, a company spokesman said. The latest
request includes some early retirement earmarked for last year.
Fiat's plan, which involves 3.7 per cent of its Italian workforce, partly
reflects the continuing fall in its share of the domestic car market, which
tumbled to 46.7 per cent last year from 52.8 per cent in 1990. Yesterday's
announcement follows several Fiat car plant closures. However, the latest
plan also envisages sizeable job cuts at its Iveco trucks and Geotech
earth-moving equipment subsidiaries, as well as of auto components
businesses.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Most Tory MPs want tax cuts in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs wants Mr Norman Lamont to give
priority to tax cuts in any pre-election boost to the economy in his Budget
on March 10.
An FT survey of opinion among the government's supporters at Westminster
shows that those favouring tax cuts outnumber by more than three to one
those who would prefer a stimulus to come from higher public spending.
The results - gathered from detailed questionnaires returned by 107, or
nearly a third, of Conservative MPs - come amid widespread acknowledgement
in Whitehall that the economy's emergence from recession has been further
delayed.
Senior officials acknowledged yesterday that the Treasury was revising down
its growth forecasts in the approach to the Budget as the recession provoked
another fierce House of Commons row between Mr John Major and Mr Neil
Kinnock.
Mr Kinnock accused Mr Major of being responsible for the longest recession
since the 1930s, while the prime minister hit back by accusing the Labour
leader of 'economic illiteracy'.
The officials acknowledged that slower growth would mean a higher public
sector borrowing requirement, but said it would also strengthen the case for
use of the 'fiscal stabilisers' which would allow a higher budget deficit.
That is the traditional Whitehall code to indicate there should still be
room for tax cuts.
The FT poll coincides with an intense debate among senior ministers on
whether the chancellor should make a cut from 25p to 24p in the basic rate
of income tax the centrepiece of next month's Budget. The growing number in
favour argue that since Labour is pledged to reverse such a reduction it
would provide the Conservatives an ideal platform for an April 9 election.
That argument will be strengthened by the majority of backbench MPs shown by
the survey to view lower income taxes as essential to secure the
government's re-election. Some 71 per cent of the MPs said they would prefer
income tax cuts over any increase in public spending. Last night the
backbenchers were putting that view to Mr Lamont and his Treasury team at a
Westminster meeting.
Of those saying tax cuts should be the priority, a small majority - 52 per
cent against 43 per cent - said they would prefer an increase in the
thresholds at which people begin to pay tax rather than a lower basic rate.
But that difference is small enough to ensure that whichever course Mr
Lamont adopted would win the strong backing of the Tory party at
Westminster.
A majority of respondents to the survey also want the chancellor to
introduce measures to increase investment.
In addition, there are strong lobbies urging the chancellor to boost their
chances in the election by extending tax relief for working mothers and by
announcing reductions in inheritance and capital gains taxes.
The survey shows that more than 60 per cent rate Mr Lamont's performance as
excellent or good.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Labour considers redefining PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party is consid-ering redefining the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) to exclude funds raised for some types of investment in
transport and housing.
The party is also exploring ways of improving public bodies' access to
private funding, including making it easier for local authorities to raise
finance directly from the capital markets.
The aim would be to allow an incoming Labour government to increase spending
on transport and housing without raising the PSBR, a key indicator of
government economic performance.
The Tories immediately accused the opposition of intending to 'cook the
books', and called the plan the latest Labour economic fiasco.
Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said: 'Yet again Labour's economic
policy has been seen to be full of holes . . . Labour would employ the
Arthur Daley approach to book-keeping.'
Labour's two-pronged approach may eventually have broader applications. One
senior Labour politician suggested yesterday that access to joint public and
private financing could be granted more freely without undermining the
prudential approach to public spending that the party is seeking to convey.
The party denied any link between its spending plans and proposals to make
the UK's public accounts more transparent, saying the two had 'no connection
whatsoever'.
Labour Treasury frontbenchers insist that the only new expenditure which
will be sanctioned immediately after an election would be on child benefit
and state pensions. But the party is keen to find ways of increasing
investment in public services which would not count as public expenditure in
many other European Community countries.
One potential source of finance would be local authorities' Pounds 8bn of
capital receipts from council house sales. Mr Clive Soley, Labour's housing
spokesman, repeated yesterday, during a debate organised by Roof magazine,
the party's promise to release more of these funds for housing.
Challenged by Sir George Young, housing minister, on whether this would
count as additional public expenditure, Mr Soley said the definition of
public sector borrowing would be changed to exclude certain types of
expenditure - including recycling of capital receipts into housing
investment.
Mr Soley was at pains to stress that Labour merely intended to bring
'restrictive' public accounts conventions in the UK broadly into line with
European practice.
Labour later disowned his remarks, saying Mr Soley had been wrong to suggest
that PSBR definitions would be changed to accommodate the release of capital
receipts.
The EC is expected to develop standard measures of performance - including
for government borrowing - under the rules for governing economic
convergence in the treaty for economic and monetary union.
Labour is also considering separating current spending from capital
investment in a further reform of traditional public accounts conventions.
Both forms of expenditure are currently lumped together within the PSBR.
On the spending side, Labour is contemplating extending the right of local
authorities to raise long-term finance by issuing municipal bonds. The party
stresses, however, that bonds would only be used to provide local authority
financing 'at the margin'.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Car sales freedom recommended: Monopolies report may result
in cheaper cars by extending choice for dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARS could be made cheaper in the UK by giving dealers more freedom to
choose which makes of car to sell and how to sell them, according to a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report to be published today.
But the long-awaited, 1,000-page report is likely to disappoint consumer
groups in giving only partial support to their persistent claims that car
prices overall in the UK are excessively high compared with the main EC
markets.
While accepting that private motorists are confused by UK pricing
structures, the report concludes that neither manufacturers nor their
distributors are guilty of price fixing or systematic profiteering. It also
concludes that the existing system of selling cars through exclusively
franchised dealers does not necessarily work to consumers' disadvantage.
It was to investigate these twin issues that the MMC report was first
commissioned two years ago.
It is understood largely to accept the arguments of the industry that the
franchised dealer system, with its dedicated service and repair facilities
and other after-sales support, is a beneficial way of dealing with complex
products with major safety implications.
In this respect the report is likely to be regarded as a partial 'whitewash'
by consumer groups critical of the retail motor trade's performance.
The report concentrates on freeing up areas of competition within the
industry's existing structure. If adopted they should help substantially to
increase marketplace competition. The five key recommendations are
understood to be:
Removal of restrictions on dealers advertising outside their
manufacturer-designated sales territories;
Ending of manufacturer-imposed restrictions on the number of outlets selling
their models that any one retailing group may own. Ford, the UK market
leader, limits it to eight, for example. The issue is important because some
manufacturers have become concerned at the bargaining power which can be
exerted by the large public groups which are increasingly involving
themselves in the motor trade;
An end to manufacturer restrictions on dealer groups owning rival franchises
within their designated sales territories, although the MMC does not go so
far as to say that multi-franchising should be allowed on a single site;
An end to restrictions on dealers setting up parts sales or fast-fit
operations within the franchised territories;
The forced removal of unit sales ceilings that some manufacturers impose on
individual dealers.
The industry's initial reactions to the report appeared to be that, while it
had not been given a wholly clean bill of health, the MMC's decision not to
recommend abolition of exclusive franchises or other fundamental changes had
exonerated the industry from the worst charges made against it.
While the detailed conclusions on price levels will not be known until later
today, they are expected to show a varied picture, in which private
motorists fare relatively badly compared with the fleet and other business
purchasers who account for more than half of the total UK new car sales.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Granada pledges to honour commitment to quality TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA GROUP gave a written commitment to the Independent Television
Commission last week that Granada Television would honour the terms of its
licence in spite of the forced resignation of Mr David Plowright as
executive chairman.
The pledge by Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman of the parent company, was
submitted in case Granada's undertakings on programme quality in its
successful application for a new 10-year licence were called into question.
Mr Plowright was told on January 27 by Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's new
group chief executive, he would have to resign. His effective dismissal was
announced on Monday.
Mr George Russell, ITC chairman, signalled the commission's concern over the
licence terms last week when he warned that the decision to remove Mr
Plowright was a mistake that could perhaps have serious commercial
implications for Granada.
The remark was made, it is believed, at a private meeting held at the ITC
between Mr Russell, Mr Plowright and Mr Andrew Quinn, who becomes chief
executive of Granada TV after Mr Plowright leaves at the end of this month.
Mr Plowright had led Granada's successful application for a new licence in
spite of being heavily outbid by Mr Phil Redmond's Northwest Television.
He is one of the most respected figures in British commercial television and
has worked for Granada for more than 30 years.
He was so devastated when told he would have to resign that he asked Mr
Quinn, who was not involved in the decision, to take over the post
immediately. Mr Quinn, who has worked at Granada for the past 27 years,
argued that the ITC had to be informed and a meeting with Mr Russell took
place on Thursday.
The ITC was clearly shocked by the move to oust Mr Plowright so soon after
the company was given its new licence. In spite of the ITC's misgivings, his
removal was accepted on the grounds that a broadcasting licence was awarded
to a management team and not to an individual.
The ITC last night declined to comment on what had been discussed.
On Monday, senior programme executives at Granada said that the peremptory
removal of their chairman had 'undermined the confidence of the senior
programme management in the intentions of Granada Group to honour the
licence commitments required by the ITC'.
Mr Bernstein, clearly irritated that Mr Plowright's removal was being
interpreted as a case of 'profits before quality', said yesterday: 'I am
surprised that people assume we are going to stop making quality television
and stop making a major contribution to the ITV network. We will continue to
do both.'

FT  05 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy volume in Racal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT bid target Racal Electronics saw its heaviest turnover since Williams
Holdings launched its offer for the company in September. The shares jumped
by 8.5 per cent as two securities houses took an enthusiastic stance on the
stock and rumours of stake changes filtered through the market. The shares
rose 4 to 51p with nearly 30m traded.
First, County NatWest's electronics team published an internal note advising
their sales pitch to recommend a switch out of GEC (slightly off at 207 1/2
p) into Racal. County analyst, Mr Patrick Wellington, said: 'Racal is cheap
on fundamentals, its demerger from Chubb in the summer will extricate value
and there is still every possibility that a bidder will emerge for the whole
or part of the group.' County was said to be responsible for almost a third
of the turnover.
Second, agency broker James Capel, was said to have shifted its stance on
the stock to a buy and purchased 6m shares in the market during early
trading.
Although no one from Capel was available for comment, the firm's alleged
move prompted widespread belief that a large stakeholder was changing tack.
Williams still holds almost 10 per cent - 139m shares - and on January 31 it
was announced that Guardian Royal Exchange had increased its stake from 4.5
per cent to 5.06 per cent.
Vodafone firm
Busy turnover was seen in Vodafone as a number of brokers decided that the
group's recent downgrades and underperformance was overdone. The spur to the
move was the release yesterday of the latest mobile phone industry
subscriber figures, which gave Vodafone a healthy 5,500 new users. The
shares added 8 to 342p in busy volume of 5.2m.
Re-affirming its positive stance, Mr Paul Ruddle at Charterhouse Tilney
said: 'The price has been off by about 10 per cent since the start of the
year, mainly because of the worries over Orbitel, and we feel it has been a
little overdone.' UBS Phillips &amp; Drew also reiterated its buy recommendation
on the stock.
Selected property stocks outperformed as one broker - believed to be S G
Warburg - turned buyer. MEPC gained 3 to 380p, while Land Securities gained
7 to 473p.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said it was likely to revise its NAV levels after the
latest gloomy statistics from the Investment Property Databank, which show
the acuteness of the downturn in the City office sector. According to UBS,
the figures indicate City office capital values falling 32.5 per cent in
1991, far more than the house had been expecting.
Positive stances on Rosehaugh were adopted by a couple of brokers as
optimism was shown over the group's medium-term financing being put in
place. The shares rose 1 3/4 to 7p. Good two-way business in Mountleigh saw
6.7m shares traded, the shares edging  1/4 to 6 1/2 p.
Buyers returned for British Aerospace, lifting the shares 17 to 296p. In
addition to bargain-hunting, sentiment was helped by news that the European
Court of Justice had overturned a European Commission ruling that would have
forced BAe to repay Pounds 44.4m of subsidies to the UK government.
Analysts had, however, expected the court ruling and said there would be no
change in profit forecasts.
Buyers were also encouraged by an announcement that Templeton, Galbraith and
Hansberger, the Bahamas-based fund management group, had taken a 3.01 per
cent stake in British Aerospace. Turnover had reached 3.5m by the close.
Water stocks were active and moved ahead as the market continued to assess
the political outlook in the UK. Among the major moves were Souuthwest Water
up 12 to 350p and Yorkshire Water ahead 9 at 388p.
Fuel distributor Calor Group rose 11 to 212p on a buy recommendation from
securities house Smith New Court. Mr Steve Turner of Smiths said: 'We see it
as a buy on valuation grounds. The yield of 8 per cent for 1991 is very
attractive and confidence in future prospects are enhanced by the sharp
falls in feed stocks.'
British Gas fell 4 1/2 to 244 1/2 p with 5.1m traded as the company's broker
Hoare Govett struck a note of caution on the stock as it published research
on the impact of the Office of Fair Tradings proposals.
Oil majors were flat with BP easing 2 to 284p and Shell drifting a penny to
476p. News that Iraq had pulled out of oil talks with the UN came after the
market closed. However, the news is expected to lift prices.
London &amp; Manchester recovered 8 to 258p following the recent shock of its
provisions for commercial mortgages.
SmithKline Beecham stood out in a firm pharmaceuticals sector with a rise of
10 to 955p in the 'A's as it bounced back after being oversold in the US.
One analyst pointed to a US Aids publication as boosting sentiment. The
journal apparently argued that SmithKline's Tagamet drug, the world's second
best-selling ulcer drug, could be useful as an Aids drug.
London International Group bounced back 6 to 305p as a stock shortage was
mopped up. Life Science was squeezed up 8 to 167p as dealers realised that
one investment bank was short of stock and squeezed it during early
business.
Brewers remained weak, with Allied Lyons falling another 9 to 630p on
confusion about the status of 734 pubs that the company intends to lease to
Brent Walker.
The Office of Fair Trading has warned it hopes to persuade the courts that
these pubs are still part of Allied's tied estate after the November
deadline when the company must free 2,380 pubs from exclusive agreements.
Warburg Securities has downgraded its profits forecast for Allied, partly as
a result of mediocre wine and spirit sales in the US and UK over Christmas.
Grand Metropolitan lost 11 to 926p, in sympathy with the sector in general,
despite a buy recommendation from Panmure Gordon. Nervousness about Wall
Street depressed the shares, with Grand Met seen as vulnerable through its
subsidiary IDV, the largest drinks group in North America.
Guinness fell 1 to 571p, but was stronger than several companies in the
sector following news that its subsidiary United Distillers intends to
streamline operations in the US, by cutting the number of its distributors,
re-organising scotch whisky sales and reducing staff levels.
Hotel talk continued to dominate the leisure sector yesterday, with
occupancy rates again the focus of attention. Vaux, the brewery and hotels
group, held a presentation and revealed a 7 per cent fall in occupancy
levels and a 4 per cent drop in room rates. It added that it was not
expecting an improvement until 1993. Today, analysts visit Forte where a
more bullish account is expected. Vaux dipped 9 to 201p, Forte lost 2 to
225p among a weak hotel sector.
Gambling machine group Kunick rose 3 to 11 1/2 p as the market took stock of
the 570,000 shares purchased by directors at 9p late on Monday.
The dust settled on Granada Group following the resignation of Mr David
Plowright on Monday, the shares slipping 4 to 219p, although the mood in the
market was still sombre.
Shares in TI Group which recently fell as the market focused on the
company's accounting practices bounced 19 to 599p after a recommendation
from County NatWest. The securities house said: 'TI's accounting policies
stand comparison with its peers' and the market should 'focus upon the
prospect of strong earnings growth in 1993 and beyond'.
A stock overhang left Siebe 8 lighter at 555p. GKN shed 3 to 317p after UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew took the stock off its buy list. Tiphook was believed to
have been the victim of a bear raid. The shares shed 15 to 400p.
Eurotunnel fell 15 to 445p on speculation that shares in the company may be
offered to the consortium of Anglo-French companies building the tunnel as
part settlement of their claim for excess costs.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Appointments: Electricity shops around
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The joint retailing venture between Eastern Electricity and Southern
Electric which opens its doors on April 1 has hired 43-year-old Eamon
Bradley, managing director of Swan National Motors, as its new chief
executive.
His finance director will be Neal Gossage, 36, formerly chief accountant at
Argos, and Malcolm Byrne, until now retailing business manager at Eastern,
becomes director of marketing.
Byrne acknowledges the going will be tough - as underscored by Rumbelow's
recent exodus from high street retailing. But he believes that by sharpening
up the image, moving increasingly out of town and expanding in home leisure
products, the privatised companies' merged resources can appeal to a younger
and more up-market clientele. Speaking yesterday from a conference on
compact disc interactive systems, he suggested that tuning into the next
generation of consumer goods was one way to claim a leading position in
electrical retailing.
Eastern Electricity has moved Bill Watson, engineering director since 1986,
to the new position of business development director. Watson's old job goes
to David Mee, who was previously area general manager for Thameside.
Neil McCrossan is promoted to sales director of EURODOLLAR UK.
*****
TI has promoted Kenneth Templeton to the new position of finance director of
Bundy International and Miles Vere-Hodge to the new position of finance
director of John Crane International.
*****
Nick Cannar, who specialised in intellectual property licensing while head
of the legal department and company secretary of BAT, is moving to become a
partner of Phillips &amp; Buck, a member of the Eversheds national practice.
*****
David Newcombe, formerly finance director, is appointed to chief executive
of PHILIP HARRIS HOLDINGS.
*****
Manfred Herwig has been appointed md of THERMOFIL POLYMERS (UK).
*****
Christopher Smart is promoted to president and md of JETSAVE, in place of
Ronald Blakey who becomes chairman.
*****
Kevin Prichard is appointed md of LAB M, a subsidiary of Amersham
International.
*****
Stephen Greenwood, formerly finance director of TURRIFF, is appointed
finance director of BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
*****
Richard Case will become md of WESTLAND HELICOPTERS in May following the
retirement of John Varde at the end of April. Case joined Westland as an
apprentice in 1961.
*****
Karen Thomas is appointed property development director of the WELSH
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY.
*****
Kembrey, the Slough-based electrical components manufacturer plagued by
months of boardroom acrimony, has looked outside its immediate circle of
troubles by appointing David Burnet as the new non-executive chairman.
Burnet's name came up from the 3i panel for the promotion of independent
directors. 3i, which has a considerable call for nominee directors in the
course of its activities, is a shareholder in Kembrey.
Michael Cleary, back in the chief executive's seat after being ousted last
December, says that an independent chairman acting as a cohesive force was
necessary to convince institutional shareholders that Kembrey was back on
course. Former chairman Bob Burns, who with Cleary owns 26 per cent of the
company, remains a director.
Burnet, 64, an Australian, currently chairs two management buy-out
companies, Test-link and CMR. He has had a fair amount of experience
reorganising companies in difficulties, including Bardsey, the hand-tool
distributor, of which he was non-executive chairman until 1990, the year in
which it was acquired by the Beckenham Group.

FT  05 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares struggle in a nervous market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER nervous session in the UK equity market yesterday saw share prices
struggling to hold on to their current levels as investors focused
increasingly on the investment climate on the other side of the Atlantic.
Once again, the London market bounced successfully after testing the FT-SE
2,550 area, but shares were drifting lower again at the close. Trading
volume remained disappointingly low and there were fewer special situations
to provide highlights.
London's nervousness regarding Wall Street increased when the Dow Average
reacted cautiously in early trading yesterday to Congressional testimony on
the economy from Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board. The Dow remained five points higher when London closed for the day
but the Standard &amp; Poor's futures came under pressure.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull pointed out that the US market is facing
a serious testing point, as both the Dow itself and its near term moving
average challenge the longer term (21 day) moving average. The testing time
could come on Friday when the latest US labour statistics are due.
It was against this general background that the London market refused to
respond to the 10.73 gain in the Dow Average overnight. After moving ahead
only very briefly, the UK stock market turned off as the stock index futures
market again provided little support.
The FT-SE Index was soon down by 11.6 at 2,548.6 and traders waited
nervously to see if the 2,500 mark could be regained. The big institutions
continued to play a wary game, picking up some stock where it suited them
but not showing their hands across the range of the market.
However, selected demand for a handful of Footsie stocks enabled the market
to rally and to move into positive territory again, but only for a short
time. Investors backed away in London as the time for Wall Street's opening
drew near.
With the early 12 point gain on the Dow cut back sharply by the time London
closed, UK stocks turned down in later trading, brushing off an upward
squeeze in the stock index futures. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at
2,556.8 for a net loss on the day of 3.4 points.
Among the international blue chips, which are traditionally vulnerable to
Wall Street's influence, activity in the pharmaceutical stocks died down.
BAT Industries remained firm, with London traders reporting that potential
buyers were still attracted by the prospect of increased tobacco sales in
eastern Europe.
Trading volume, as traded through the Seaq system, totalled 468.8m shares,
compared with 414.8m in the previous session. But statistics from the Stock
Exchange showed that retail, or customer, equity business on Monday fell to
only Pounds 744.6m, more than 20 per cent down on some recent trading
sessions. Traders were convinced that retail business had remained
relatively thin in yesterday's session.
Currency uncertainty also acted as a brake on UK equities, with UK analysts
unsure how to react to the wage agreement struck by some German
steelworkers. While a further cut in UK base rates is still widely expected
before the general election now expected this spring, over-optimism was
discouraged yesterday by a dip in the sterling/DM rates.

<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight range with dealers reporting a dull
session enlivened by a squeeze towards the close, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract started reasonably with a premium of 26 reached soon
after the opening. With little in the way of features, the market ran out of
steam mid-morning and began to drift. Then, a rally was seen with the firm
opening on Wall Street and the contract advanced steadily, leaving the
underlying cash market behind.
An attempt by locals to close short positions in the last half hour of
trading generated a squeeze in March but the retreat on Wall Street as
London closed led to selling of the contract at the finish.
March closed at 2,583, down 6 on the previous day, and some 10 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Volume, at 4,382, was poor.
Options traders reported a dull session on LTOM, where turnover reached
23,864 contracts. The FTSE-100 index option was busy, trading 5,830 lots.
BP was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,339 contracts with the July 280
puts the busiest series. This was followed by BT with a day's total of 1,842
lots.

FT  05 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Travel rescue fund must be paid back to banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIROZENTRALE UND BANK DER OESTERREICHISCHEN SPARKASSEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT &amp;
OTHERS v THE TOSG TRUST FUND LTD
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Mustill and Lord Justice
McCowan): January 28 1992
A TRUST fund incorporated by an association of tour operators to assist
customers of failed members must repay bonded sums obtained from banks on
the undertaking that monies not spent in exercise of the fund's powers would
be returned, in so far as they are used outside those powers to assist
customers of non- members, including a member's subsidiaries, in respect of
which no bond monies were received.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiffs,
Girozentrale und Bank der Oesterreichischen Sparkassen Atkiengelsellschaft
and eight other banks, from a decision of Judge Diamond QC sitting as a
deputy High Court judge, that the defendant, the Tosg Trust Fund Ltd, was
entitled to use money advanced by the banks for purposes other than in
connection with claims against members of the Tour Operators' Study Group.
LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that on March 8 1991 administrators were appointed
of a company called ILG Travel, a subsidiary of International Leisure Group
(ILG).
Travel had a subsidiary, Quest Leisure Group, which had a subsidiary,
Skiscope Direct.
ILG, which was a holding company, had a further subsidiary, ILG Leisure.
Travel and the other companies all carried on business as tour operators.
The result of appointing administrators for Travel was that Pounds 63.2m
became payable to Tosg Trust Fund under a bond dated September 28 1989 as
amended by a deed dated March 26 1990. The money was duly paid on March 11
1991.
The bond was made between the Fund and 14 banks or financial institutions.
The plaintiffs were nine of the 14.
Tosg Trust Fund was incorporated in 1970 by members of an unincorporated
association known as the Tour Operators Study Group (Tosg), the affairs of
which were regulated by a set of rules. It was formed in 1967 by 24 of the
largest tour operators.
The bond was obtained under a facility agreement dated September 29 1986
between Travel (then known as Intasun Holidays) and ILG and the banks and
financial institutions.
Recital (B) of the bond stated that it covered 'the following companies, . .
. all of which are tour operators and are members of the same group'.
It set out one company only, namely Travel, followed by 33 names, none of
which were legal entities but, save three, were names under which Travel
traded. Three were names under which ILG Leisure traded but Travel did not.
Clause 6 of the bond provided that in consideration of issue of the bond,
'the Fund hereby covenants . . . that upon payment of the bonded sum by the
obligors to the Fund, the Fund will undertake in writing . . . that the Fund
will repay . . . on demand, such part of the bonded sum as shall not be
expended . . . in the performance and the execution of the rights, duties,
powers and discretions set out in the Fund's memorandum and articles of
association . . . '
On March 13 1991 the Fund gave the undertaking required by that clause.
Thereafter the banks became aware that the Fund was using the amount paid
under the bond to assist customers not only of Travel but also of ILG
Leisure, Quest and Skiscope, all three of which had, like Travel, suffered
financial failure.
The banks considered that that was not a permissible use of bond monies.
They issued a writ on July 12, claiming inter alia an injunction to restrain
the Fund from expending the bonded sum other than in connection with claims
by Travel customers, and a declaration that it was not entitled to do so.
Judge Diamond QC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge held that the Fund was
entitled to make payments in respect of the challenged claims. As a result
the banks' claim failed and the action was dismissed.
The banks now appealed.
In Barclays Bank Ltd v TOSG Trust Fund (1984) BCLC 153 the issues were
different, but Lord Justice Slade said the banks had a contractual right to
prevent the Fund from expending bond moneys other than in performance and
execution of its rights, duties, powers and discretion.
However, he said, subject to that limitation it was the Fund's choice as to
how it should spend the bond moneys, and the banks could not complain about
such expenditure, though it would prejudice their rights of obtaining
recoupment of unexpended bond moneys.
That passage was relied upon by the judge.
Barclays went on appeal to the House of Lords ((1984) BCLC 259). At page 265
Lord Templeman said that on the terms of the bond and the memorandum of
association, if the Fund did not employ the whole sum for authorised
purposes, the balance was to be refunded to the bank.
In the objects clause in the Fund's memorandum of association, the paragraph
A object was 'to manage, utilise, employ and expend funds and monies paid
and/or to be paid to the company under or by virtue of bonds . . . generally
alleviating the consequences to each member's customers of the business
failure of the Tosg member in respect of whom such funds are received by the
company'.
The paragraph K object was 'to make donations to such persons and in such
cases as the company may think directly or indirectly conducive to any of
its objects or otherwise expedient'.
Paragraph A clearly confined the Fund to paying out to customers of the
failed Tosg member in respect of whom bond monies were received.
In the present case only Travel was a Tosg member.
In so far as monies were expended in alleviating the consequences of failure
to customers of Leisure, Quest or Skiscope they were not expended in the
performance of the Fund's rights, duties, powers or discretions set out in
the memorandum of association.
As to paragraph K, the payments clearly could not be regarded as 'conducive'
to the paragraph A object. Nor could they be regarded as 'otherwise
expedient'. The words, although apparently unlimited, could not be construed
to enable the company to use monies received for one clear purpose, to make
donations to customers of other tour operators with no bond.
The facility agreement, which came years after the latest amendments to
paragraph A of the objects clause, could not influence or control the
meaning of the memorandum of association.
So far as the Tosg rules were concerned, rule 4 provided that members were
to be companies or firms whose names were included in lists appended to the
copy of the rules. Rule 8 provided that 'each member shall arrange for a
bond . . . or similar arrangement in favour of the Tosg Trust Fund in
respect of such member and/or its tour operator subsidiaries'.
It was clear that Travel was, as a member, to arrange for a bond or to make
a similar arrangement, not only in respect of itself but also in respect of
its subsidiaries. It did not in fact do so because the Fund accepted that
the bond in existence in respect of Travel was adequate for the protection
of Quest and Skiscope.
The fact that the rules imposed an obligation could not affect or extend the
banks' exposure. When the banks issued a bond, they exposed themselves to
the risk of failure of the Tosg member and, at least apparently, to the
failure of any other company in the member's group as therein defined. That
was specified and could not be altered by something of which the banks knew
nothing.
The Fund was not entitled to make payments to or for the benefit of
customers of Quest, Skiscope and ILG Leisure. It was entitled to make
payments so far as concerned names under which Travel was trading as a tour
operator.
The appeal was allowed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For the banks: Peter Leaver QC and George Leggatt (Clifford Chance).
For the Fund: Alan Steinfeld QC and Christopher Moger (Norton Rose).

FT  05 FEB 92 / Appointments: Helping to heal BUPA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The management renewal process at Bupa, Britain's biggest private health
care organisation, has taken another step forward with the appointment of
Roger Hymas as group marketing director.
Hymas was previously GE Capital Corporation's executive director retail
financial services - Europe, and earlier in his career held posts with
Burton Group, Welbeck Financial Services and American Express. As we
reported earlier, David Stonehouse has been appointed to the job Hymas has
vacated.
Britain's private health sector is currently under heavy financial and
competitive pressures and marketing will play a central part in the strategy
of Peter Jacobs, Bupa's chief executive, to strengthen the association's
position. Bupa is widely-regarded as a generic term for private medicine in
Britain, and Hymas will be responsible for extracting full benefit from the
brand name.
In November, Jacobs announced a shake-up involving the departure of three
senior executives. Since then, together with Edward Lea, group finance
director, he has been building a new team which he hopes will give Bupa a
sharper commercial edge.

FT  05 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses concentrate on
individual issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND THOUGHTS on the German steel pay settlement were no more bullish
yesterday than Monday's reaction, and senior bourses tended to concentrate
on individual issues, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw a big rise in Continental, the tyremaker, and an even bigger
fall in Lufthansa, the state-controlled airline whose shares had been one of
the bourse's star performers in 1991, and early 1992.
Conti rose DM5.80 to DM230.50, against the trend in the market which
registered a 4.96 decline to 683.73 in the FAZ index at midsession, and a
12.61 fall to 1,676.40 in the DAX at the close. Volume fell from DM7bn to
DM5bn.
The UK broker, BZW, said that it was recommending Conti as a 'buy' after a
meeting with the company, noting that the tyremaker expected to halve losses
in the US to Dollars 50m this year and eradicate them in 1993. The company
raised replacement tyre prices by 12 per cent last October and saw 2 to 3
per cent growth in global tyre sales in 1992.
Lufthansa reacted a day late to Monday's story in the German newspaper,
Augsburg Allgemeine, that the airline would report a DM400m loss for 1991
after earlier hopes of breakeven. After hitting a new 1992 high of DM181.50
on Monday, the shares dropped DM8.50 to DM172.50 in yesterday's official
session, and were quoted DM4 lower after hours.
Mr Mark Simpson, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said that poor results at Lufthansa
were usually offset by second half aircraft sales, and write-backs from
reserves. Last year, disposal revenue was small and there seems to have been
a conscious decision not to write back reserves. However, he said, the
company was still cheap, trading on a prospective 1992 cash earnings
multiple of 2.9, compared with 6 times two years ago at the start of the
recession in the industry.
PARIS recovered from the day's lows but failed to move into positive
territory. The CAC-40 index ended 0.50 lower at 1,856.48 after a low of
1,840.30 in thin volume of Fr1.8bn.
Elf depressed the market at the start as its fall in 1991 net attributable
profit of FFr9.8bn from FFr10.6bn disappointed the market's most optimistic
forecasters who had expected FFr11bn. The stock fell FFr2.80 to FFr363.50 on
410,700 shares.
Eurotunnel was the day's most active share, falling FFr2.80 or 1.3 per cent
to FFr44.50 with 904,500 shares traded, on a report in a French newspaper
that the company would offer shares to the TML, the consortium building the
tunnel, to settle their dispute over costs. After the close, Eurotunnel
called the report speculative.
Alcatel weakened for the second day, closing down FFr8 at FFr566 in
unexceptional volume of 312,040 shares as some brokers downgraded their
forecasts. County NatWest has reduced its 1992 net profit estimate from
FFr6.4bn to FFr6.1bn, citing the company's high exposure to the European
public switching market which is expected to see a decline in spending.
MILAN opened weak but saw a burst of domestic demand late in the session.
The Comit index rose 0.57 to 545.26 in turnover estimated at L110bn after
L92bn.
Renewed speculation that Olivetti was about to merge with another company
lifted the share price by L81 or 2.9 per cent to L2,813. Another riser was
the insurer Fondiaria which added L1,150 or 2.9 per cent to L40,130 but
dealers could find no reason for the move.
Fiat, which after the close announced plans to reduce its workforce by
10,300 this year, dropped L64 to L5,037.
Among smaller, cyclical stocks, Cogefar and Falck were in demand, rising
L100 and L170 respectively to L3,551 and L6,100.
AMSTERDAM fell on afternoon profit-taking as the CBS Tendency Index edged up
0.1 to 122.4.
Tulip Computers rose Fl 0.10 to Fl 24.70 after reaching a high of Fl 25.40.
The group reported that 1991 first half sales fell 8 per cent but expected
growth of 15 per cent in the second half. Philips shed Fl 0.70 to Fl 30.8 on
worries over fourth quarter figures, due on February 27. Profit-taking hit
Elsevier after hitting a new high on Monday: it fell Fl 0.70 to Fl 108.40.
STOCKHOLM was relieved that Electrolux was holding its dividend in spite of
a 27 per cent drop in profits.
Electrolux B climbed SKr11 to SKr247 in turnover of about SKr40m as the
Affarsvarlden General index closed 6.9 better at 969.6. Volume was moderate,
although it nearly doubled from SKr220m to SKr420m.
MADRID rallied with the general index up 1.73 to 257.15. Turnover improved
to Pta14bn from Monday's low of Pta8.5bn. Shares in Cofir, the holding
company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo De Benedetti, and Macosa, in
which Cofir has a 25 per cent stake, were suspended on merger rumours.
OSLO steadied after Monday's 2 per cent fall: the all-share index rose 1.91
to 440.48 in turnover of NKr207.18m. Norsk Hydro gained NKr2 to NKr146.5.
BRUSSELS closed lower: the Bel-20 index ended 7.25 down at 1,170.57.

FT  05 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Continentals join real estate casualty
list - But property shares have registered varied rates of decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property shares subsided across the globe in the final quarter of 1991.
According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the sector fell 4.3 per cent in
local currency terms, while the World Index itself was flat; but for some
positive national performances, particularly in Singapore, Australia and the
US, the October/December result would have been worse.
The rate of decline varied. In Canada, property shares fell by an average of
5 per cent; in Italy by 15 per cent; in Spain by 30 per cent; in France by 2
per cent; in Sweden by 22 per cent; in the UK by 18 per cent; in Japan by 5
per cent; and in New Zealand by 20 per cent, according to the stockbrokers
County NatWest.
The Continental European markets are the most recent casualties. 'Even those
markets which had remained relatively unaffected are now facing a
significant downturn in activity with rental and capital growth rates
rapidly falling towards nil,' says Mr Ray Jones of Paribas Capital Markets.
Most European property shares are now trading at the bottom of their normal
range, when considered in terms of their discount to net assets.
The downturn in the economy has paralysed tenants and investors, who are
unwilling to commit themselves in such an uncertain climate. That said,
these property markets may escape the worst of the downturn because they are
less affected by over-lending and overbuilding than the English-speaking
economies. Few risk as steep a fall in property shares as the UK, where the
sector has dropped by 41 per cent over the last three years.
After the UK, France has proved the most vulnerable direct property market
in Europe, thanks to a high level of speculative bank loans to developers.
Paris has seen a wave of new developments and decreased activity which has
pushed rents down by some 10 per cent and capital values down by 20 to 25
per cent over the last year. However, French property shares have been
relatively stable as they have offered large discounts to net assets and
high yields after falling by 25 per cent in 1990.
In Germany, the real estate market slowed sharply in the last quarter of
1991, thanks to static or falling rental levels and higher interest rates.
However, vacancy rates are just 1-3 per cent, which should prevent any
significant fall in rents.
The fundamental changes affecting Germany - re-unification, changes in
eastern Europe and expectations of a post-1992 Europe - have sustained
interest in the few quoted property companies (too few, indeed, to have a
place in the FT-Actuaries World Indices). Concordia, a thinly-traded stock
with few sellers and a high degree of foreign interest, ended the year on a
20 per cent premium to net assets.
Spanish property fell in value in the latter part of last year as a result
of an increased supply of offices in Madrid and a withdrawal of foreign
investors. With relatively high interest rates, a slowing economy and
disappointment over the absence of lease law reform, the performance of
shares like Metrovacesa has been very weak.
The Dutch property market has performed dully, with low levels of investment
activity. But its large property companies are not representative of the
market as they have an international spread of investments.
The performance of Rodamco, which is by far the largest Dutch property
investment vehicle, has also been affected by some momentous corporate
decisions. Its share price fell heavily in late 1990 when it changed, in
effect, from an open-ended to a close-ended company. In December, ABP, the
Dutch civil servants pension fund, said it would invest Pounds 770m in
Rodamco at net asset value. Late last month Wereldhave and VIB, the
Netherlands' second and third largest property investment companies,
announced plans to look into the possibility of entering into a
'far-reaching form of co-operation'.
Looking beyond the current trough, a case can be argued for investing in
continental property companies. Mr David Harris of Carnegie International,
the UK-based broker, believes that the Maastricht summit has huge
implications. He thinks that monetary union will foster the economic
conditions conducive for growth in property values. Moreover, investment may
be stimulated by unhindered capital flows across EC boundaries.
But recovery is likely to be a slow process. Mr Jones of Paribas is
generally cautious about property equities on fundamental grounds. In his
view, the continental property markets are likely to remain quiet in the
first half of 1992, before stabilising towards the end of the year.

FT  05 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below
22,000 on arbitrage unwinding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in futures led market professionals to unwind arbitrage positions
with the cash market in equities yesterday, and the Nikkei average declined
for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell through the 22,000 level to close 139.99 down at
21,999.60, after a low of 21,831.16 in the morning session and a high of
22,116.54 in the afternoon.
The index fluctuated amid low activity led by dealers, and volume fell to
180m shares from 200m. Declining shares led those advancing by 550 to 380,
with 180m shares remaining unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 3.76 to 1,628.86 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.29 to 1,247.10.
Enthusiasm waned for last Friday's political initiative to rescue the
market, which had driven the index up 2.7 per cent during the previous two
days. Traders said that buying activity, prompted by hopes of a government
support package for the stock market, had been dealer-led and investors had
failed to follow the activity.
Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said that a scenario
involving politicians proposing support for the market before the elections
was viewed with some caution by investors.
Selling pressure in the futures market mounted as investment trusts
liquidated holdings in anticipation of meeting redemptions. Traders said
that the decline in futures prices prompted arbitrage-related selling. In
the afternoon session, the Nikkei briefly regained the 22,000 level
following the rebound in the futures market. But as futures lost momentum
towards the close, the index also lost ground.
Speculative activity pushed up Nippon Television, which gained Y600 to
Y20,100. Some dealers and individuals looking for quick profits were seen
trading the stock, which is known for its illiquidity.
However, profit-taking pushed other high-priced issues lower. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone fell Y7,000 to Y706,000 after a three-day advance.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, fell Y100 to Y13,700 while Nintendo
lost Y300 to Y11,400.
Electronic companies were bought on bargain-hunting. Hitachi gained Y7 to
Y931 and Sony added Y20 to Y4,360.
CSK, the computer software company, rose Y140 to Y4,290 thanks to the
reduction of the stock's minimum trading unit from 1,000 shares to 100
shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 91.76 to 23,622.59 in volume of 84.5m shares.
The index fell for the first time in six trading days due to increased
profit-taking and stop-loss selling.
Roundup
MOST of the Pacific Rim celebrated the Chinese new year: Hong Kong,
Singapore, Seoul, Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur were closed.
AUSTRALIA was weaker, with a ADollars 25m portfolio sale pushing the All
Ordinaries index as low as 1,593.0 in morning trade before it recovered to
close 11.0 lower at 1,600.3.
The economic statement from Prime Minister Mr Paul Keating, due on February
26, and some earnings downgradings were making the market nervous.
News Corp declined 36 cents to ADollars 14.40 and BHP shed 14 cents to
ADollars 13.48. Coles Myer, the retailer, declined a further 16 cents to
ADollars 11.54 following Monday's poor half-year sales figures.
Elsewhere, the all-gold index was off 5.9 at 1209.7 while on the Sydney
futures market the March Share Price Index contract fell 12.2 to 1613.8.
NEW ZEALAND rose in active trading helped by government data which showed a
1.3 per cent increase in third quarter GDP. The NZSE-40 index put on 2.47 to
1,461.54. Fletcher Challenge gained 5 cents to NZDollars 3.47, while Lion
Nathan declined 4 cents to NZDollars 3.48.
BOMBAY ended mixed in thin trading, weighed down by trading restrictions.
The BSE index rose 5.91 to 2,278.72. On Monday the BSE authorities banned
forward deals in specified stocks, raised purchase margins on cash stocks
and imposed daily trading limits to deter excessive speculation.
BANGKOK remained cautious awaiting today's market debut of Bangkok Land. The
SET index was up 2.53 at 769.72 in turnover of Bt4bn.
MANILA closed mixed with the composite index down 5.34 to 1,261.94 in
turnover of 155m pesos, down from 200m pesos.
JAKARTA saw active trading in local stocks: the index fell 1.14 to 286.05 in
volume of 14m shares (18.6m).

FT  05 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Overnight rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHTER conditions returned to the UK money markets yesterday, forcing
overnight rates as high as 12.5 per cent at one stage.
'There's not much to invest in at the short end of the market,' said one
senior dealer.
The overnight rate drifted back down by the end of the day to finish at 10
3/4-5/8. One-month and two-month interbank rates were unchanged at 10
11/16-5/8, while the key three-month rate was a touch lower at 10
11/16-9/16. March short sterling fell to 89.59, from Monday's close of
89.63.
The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn, which
was twice revised to finish as high as Pounds 1.25bn.
The main drain on liquidity was exchequer transactions which took Pounds
560m out of the market. Treasury bills and maturing assistance drained a
further Pounds 538m and bankers' balances below target called for Pounds
65m. The decline in note circulation added back Pounds 100m.
In an early round of assistance, the Bank offered a bills totalling Pounds
201m, for resale to the market on February 21 at a rate of 10 7/16 per cent.
Further operations saw another repurchase for the same date totalling Pounds
101m, also at 10 7/16 per cent.
The bank stepped in during the afternoon with an injection of Pounds 395m,
through the purchase of Band One and Band Two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Late assistance provided Pounds 345m.
The German money market was also tight yesterday in advance of the
Bundesbank's expected repurchase today. The central bank may increase the
one-month repo rate to lodge a protest against this week's 6.4 per cent pay
settlement with German steel workers. Recent one month repos have been about
9.4 per cent.
German overnight rates were little changed on Monday, trading at 9.65/70 per
cent.
Economists in the UK said that the German wage settlement dampened hopes for
a rate cut in the UK. However, a rate cut was not seen to be as politically
crucial as it had been, following the reduction in mortgage rates.
'Politically it would not gain them that much,' said Dr Mark Austin, an
economist with the HongKong Bank, 'and it contains the risk that sterling
might fall.'
In the US, federal funds traded at 3 7/8 per cent during the day, compared
with 4 per cent on Monday.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian jute mill workers settle
in for long strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN JUTE mill workers appear to be settling in for a long strike in
support of demands for a pay rise. Neither the trade unions nor the Indian
Jute Mills Association believe that the dispute - now affecting 54 mills in
West Bengal, where the industry is largely concentrated - will be settled
quickly. And the Marxist government of West Bengal seems to be in no hurry
to bring about a settlement.
In the past two decades the highly unionised jute workers have gone on
indefinite strike on six occasions. The 1984 stoppage, the longest in the
industry's history, lasted nearly three months. This time the mill owners,
who claim the wages they pay compare favourably with those in other
industries, are determined to resist the workers' demands, insisting that
pay rises must be linked to improved productivity.
Some mill owners suspect that the state government will use the present
strike to register its protest against the federal government's appeal to
avoid any kind of industrial action for at least two years.
According to Mr Bharat Jalan, chairman of the Jute Mills Association, the
strike will affect India's export of jute goods badly, particularly to the
hard currency areas. Whenever there has been a long strike in the past,
either in jute mills or at Calcutta port, which handles jute cargoes, India
has been forced to concede a portion of its share of the world jute goods
market, mainly to Bangladesh but also partly to Thailand and China.
Mr RN De, the jute commissioner, agrees with the IJMA chief that the dispute
will be sending out disturbing signals to overseas buyers who, after
watching the situation for a while longer, are likely to cancel orders
placed earlier with Indian mills and merchant shippers and cover their
position elsewhere. Bangladesh, however, will not be in a position to reap
full benefit from India's predicament as it has shut down some unprofitable
mills, according to Mr De.
In keeping with India's new trade policy, he said, the industry had gone
all-out to increase exports of jute goods to hard currency areas and reduce
dependence on rupee trade countries during 1991-92. In the eight months to
November 1992 the country's jute goods export to hard currency countries
increased to 94,000 tonnes, worth Rs1.44bn (Pounds 31m) from 65,000 tonnes,
valued at Rs830m in the corresponding period of the previous year. Exports
to the rupee payment countries, on the other hand, declined from 77,300
tonnes valued at Rs1.03bn, to 49,200 tonnes, worth Rs790m.
As the indications are for a long drawn-out strike, there appears no way
India can achieve the export target of 250,000 tonnes during 1991-92.
Following sustained market development efforts and devaluation of its
currency, India seemed set to win many new buyers for its high value
hessian, carpet-backing cloth, yarn and speciality items in the UK, Germany,
France, Italy, The Netherlands and Japan. But, according to the merchant
shippers, the country is now likely to lose the new customers.
Exporting has not come to a stop, however. The five jute mills owned by the
federal government and a mill run by the workers' co-operative have been
able to keep on producing and despatching jute goods as the trade unions
have exempted them from the strike.
Domestic sales of jute goods will also shrink as a result of the strike. The
synthetic bag industry is well developed in the country and it is going to
take full advantage of the suspension of production in jute mills. As long
as the jute mills were in operation, the synthetic bag producers could not
utilise their full capacity because jute was enjoying protection. They are
certain to ask for the removal of that protection, at least while the strike
lasts. And the government, which is in the process of liberalising the
economy, will find it difficult to turn down the synthetic bag industry's
demand.
The strike will also have an impact on the next jute crop. In Assam, North
Bengal and Bihar, the preparation of land for jute cultivation will begin by
the end of this month and in South Bengal in the middle of March. Even
though the growers have by now disposed of 90 per cent of the 1991-92 crop,
they are likely to switch some land from jute to paddy and oilseeds in view
of the reaction in fibre prices, according to Mr Shankar Ladia, spokesman
for jute trade. Raw jute prices started falling when the strike began late
last month.
The switch could remove between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of land now
under jute.
For two consecutive years India has harvested bumper jute crops in excess of
9m bales (180 kg each). But the mill strike has raised serious doubts about
the prospects for the 1992-93 crop.

SOUTH AFRICA'S second biggest ferrochrome producer, Consolidated
Metallurgical Industries, says it has shut down 40 per cent of its installed
capacity in what it hopes is a short-term move, reports Reuter from
Johannesburg.
Mr David Kovarsky, the chairman, said rise in the South African industry's
selling price for the last quarter of 1991 and first quarter 1992 - to 52 US
cents a lb from 49 cents - was 'devastating to our ability to sell'.
The company, part of Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, has a
total production capacity of 330,000 tonnes a year.
CMI did not say what actual production was before the cuts.

A RISE in commodity prices is likely to be delayed by extension of the world
recession into the year to end-June 1993, according to the Australian Bureau
of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Reuters reports from Canberra.
'Abare's latest estimate is that, as a result of a weaker outlook than
previously assumed for the world economy, the current slump will continue
into 1992-93, delaying the anticipated recovery in commodity prices,' said
Mr Brian Fisher, executive director of the bureau.
But he told a major commodity conference that Australia's commodity exports
were likely to grow strongly in the medium term, with solid volume growth
reinforcing improved prices. Abare expects a 5 per cent drop in Australia's
commodity export earnings to ADollars 39.9bn (USDollars 29.8bn) in the year
to the end of June, the biggest fall in a decade.

THE IVORY Coast's coffee bushes have produced a big crop this year, but low
prices and a delayed buying season mean much of it will probably go
unpicked, trade and government sources say, reports Reuter from Abidjan.
'It's a big harvest. . . from what was on the bushes we know there was 20
per cent more than last year,' one trader said. 'But a lot of it might just
stay there'.
Several observers put the potential maximum 1991-92 crop at 300,000 tonnes
of robusta compared with trade and government estimates of between 250,000
and 270,000 tonnes in 1990-91. Government officials said they expected an
actual harvest of about 250,000 tonnes or less.

level for 11 years'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OPEC CRUDE oil production in January rose to levels unseen for about 11
years despite promised cutbacks in the latter half of the month, according
to a Reuter survey of industry executives and analysts.
Estimated January production was 24.2m barrels a day, about 70,000 b/d above
the December level.
Voluntary cutbacks agreed by nine members in the latter half of the month
totalled around 410,000 b/d. But some countries never mentioned what level
they were cutting from, so it was difficult to determine who did what
exactly.
Opec oil output in the last few months has matched levels of 1980-81. Crude
output averaged about 25m b/d in 1980 and 23m in 1981.
But a drop is anticipated this month as Opec talks in Geneva on February 12
are expected to decide to cut output further. Opec's big two, Saudi Arabia
and Iran, stepped up output last month, but there were wide variations and
less certainty about the estimates for both.
Some analysts said Saudi output was as high as 8.7m b/d excluding neutral
zone, while others put it as low as 8.4m b/d.
Reuters judged that a fair figure was 8.5m b/d, partly based on comments
from observers in Dhahran, home of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco,
and from tanker trackers.
'It doesn't ring true with what I've seen. There were the usual weekly
swings but no big jumps in production last month,' a Dhahran trader said of
the higher estimates.
Including the neutral zone share the Saudi total is put at 8.65m b/d. But
whether excluding or including the neutral zone Saudi output is about
150,000 b/d higher than for December.
TWO TRADE houses, Sucres et Denrees (Sucden) of France and Switzerland-based
Marc Rich, are negotiating to barter about 1m tonnes of raw sugar for oil
with sugar buying agency Prodintorg on behalf of Russia, a Sucden trader
said, reports Reuters from Paris.
But he said no deal had yet been signed and that former Soviet agency
Prodintorg was studying Sucden's offer in Moscow.
Traders in London said on Monday that a major deal could be concluded
shortly between Prodintorg and international traders.
The Sucden trader said he did not think the deal involved commodities other
than oil, such as metals, as some London traders had said.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eastern bloc metal shipments
'to remain high'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET EXPORTS of aluminium, copper, lead and zinc from the former eastern bloc
countries to the west are forecast to remain high by the Economist
Intelligence Unit.
In its latest World Commodity Outlook report it says western metals
producers are unlikely to get much relief from the turmoil and low prices
caused by eastern bloc exports. 'There is a case for arguing that over the
next few years Soviet exports are more likely to rise than to subside,' it
adds.
The report suggests that the fall in production in the former Soviet Union,
which has released more metal for export at a time when the republics are
desperate for foreign currency, has nothing to do with market mechanisms. It
is taken to be the effect of 'growing dislocation, both political and
economic'.
It adds: 'The influences that pushed up Soviet metal exports in 1991 are
likely to lift them further in 1992, which is seen as another year of sharp
economic decline'.
Looking farther ahead than it usually does, the report predicts that net
exports of copper from the former Soviet Union are expected to rise to
325,000 tonnes in 1994, those of lead to 130,000 tonnes and those of zinc to
144,000 tonnes.
It says: 'This conclusion might seem out of place in a volume of short-term
forecasts, but the question of whether Soviet exports rise from their
disruptive 1991 levels or fall back to something more digestible is surely
germane to the decisions producers have to take now about whether to cut
production or not. We do not believe that relief is just around the corner'.
In the circumstances, the EIU does not see the London Metal Exchange
three-month price for copper averaging more than 97 cents a lb in 1992,
compared with 106.6 cents last year, though it should rise towards the end
of the year as a sustained recovery in prices gets under way.
Aluminium's price is predicted to average Dollars 1,100 a tonne, down from
Dollars 1,333 last year. 'In real terms, Dollars 1,100 would be the lowest
annual average aluminium price in recent history and possibly of all time,
well below the level reached in 1986,' the report points out.
Other LME-traded metals are forecast to show higher average prices this year
compared with 1991: lead at 26.3 cents a lb (25.3 cents); nickel Dollars
4.20 a lb (Dollars 3.90); tin Dollars 3.66 a lb (Dollars 2.54) and zinc 52.5
cents a lb (50.7 cents).
The report also argues that prospects for traded metals should not be judged
solely in the light of the dim outlook for economic growth in the OECD
countries. The much better growth prospects in the leading developing
countries need to be taken into account too.
Between 1973 and 1990 these countries lifted their share of consumption
outside the eastern bloc from 8 to 18 per cent for aluminium, from 7 to 18
per cent for copper, from 12 to 22 per cent for lead, from 12 to 25 per cent
for zinc and from 11 to 24 per cent for primary tin. Even for nickel their
share rose from 2 to 12 per cent.
The EIU suggests the developing countries will continue to outpace the OECD
countries this year and predicts the combined growth of South Korea, Taiwan,
India, Turkey, Mexico and Brazil will be 4.9 per cent compared with 2.6 per
cent for the developed countries.
Russia's Norilsk nickel production consortium is cutting exports, but denies
reports that it is planning to close one of its three smelters, reports
Reuter from Moscow.
'We are not satisfied with world prices for nickel, so we decided to bring
down the volume of nickel exports from our consortium,' said Mr Boris
Kazakov, Norilsk's first deputy chairman.
The consortium is responsible for about 80 per cent of nickel production in
the former Soviet Union.
'We are not actually planning to shut down the whole complex but we decided
now was the moment to modernise and re-equip some of our smelting
facilities. This will of course result in a decrease of our production
levels,' he said.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian gold deposit written
off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLACER DOME, the Vancouver-based gold producer, has decided to write off the
Mt Milligan deposit and take other write-downs totalling CDollars 397m
(Pounds 190m), thus acknowledging that it greatly overpaid for its interests
in some of Canada's most highly publicised mineral discoveries.
Two-thirds of the charge, or CDollars 266m, reflects the Mt Milligan
write-off. Placer has also halved the CDollars 106m carrying value of its 22
per cent stake in the Eskay Creek gold property, also in British Columbia.
The company now appears to be putting its faith in a new discovery in
Nevada. Mr Fraser Fell, Placer's chairman, said yesterday that the company
hopes to build an open-pit mine on the Nevada deposit, known as the Pipeline
project, 'within a few years.' The deposit, which is part of the Cortez
joint venture in north-central Nevada, contains an estimated 2.7m troy
ounces of gold at an average grade of 0.237 ounces per tonne. Placer has a
60 per cent stake in the project.
Placer has affirmed its intention to maintain or increase its gold output,
which reached a record 1.68m ounces last year. But Mr John Lydall, analyst
at First Marathon Securities, said yesterday that 'management has a huge job
to do to continue to replace ore reserves'.
Placer bought the Mt Milligan property just over a year ago. It has now
shelved plans to build a mine there, saying that returns would be
insufficient to justify the CDollars 500m to Dollars 600m capital
investment. It would require a gold price above USDollars 400 a troy ounce
to make the project viable. Last night gold closed in London at Dollars
356.30.
Recent drilling at the site has led the company to cut its estimate of gold
grades from 0.017 to 0.013 ounces a tonne. Its estimate of the copper grade
has risen from 20 per cent to 22 per cent. Placer said that, should Mt
Milligan be developed in the future, its annual output would average 100m lb
of copper and 250,000 ounces of gold over a 12-year life.
Placer said the Eskay Creek writedown reflects a cut in the estimate of
mineable reserves of gold and silver since it acquired its interest in
mid-1990. The estimate has been lowered from 4.5m to 3.1m ounces of gold
equivalent, and the mine is now expected to be an underground rather than
open pit operation.
Placer has taken smaller writedowns on its 64 per cent interest in the
Paymaster gold property near Timmins, Ontario; its Dona Lake mine in
Ontario; and its wholly-owned Sigma mine in Quebec.

Platinum opened up a premium of more than Dollars 5 a troy ounce over gold
on the London bullion market yesterday. US chartists said Nymex platinum
futures prices were lingering near a key chart area that would either result
in a Dollars 20 rise or a resumption of the recent downtrend. New York
analysts said rumours continued to circulate about cash market buying by
South African producers, as well as news that Russia's Norilsk nickel plant
was cutting exports. Traders are concerned that reductions in nickel exports
and output could spill over to platinum, a by-product at Norilsk. Silver and
gold closed steady. 'It's a Dollars 354 to Dollars 358 range on gold and a
412 to 422 cent range in silver,' said one dealer. 'Client business is low
and you acknowledge those ranges as they get narrower and narrower
indicating a break-out will be quite a good move.' London May cocoa closed
at a five-month low of Pounds 724 a tonne. 'Earlier fund selling seems to
have dried up, which is allowing the market to consolidate to a certain
extent, but it is not oversold so there is no reason for a technical
bounce,' said one dealer. Market expectation of origin selling by the Ivory
Coast is a major factor in the pressure on prices.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Denmark set to launch first domestic
Ecu paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK is expected to launch its first domestic offering of Ecu bonds
today. The Ecu1bn issue of 10-year bonds is being arranged by two Danish
banks, Den Danske Bank and Unibank. A non-Danish European bank is also
believed to be involved at a senior level.
The bonds will be listed in Copenhagen in order to encourage some domestic
trading and some participation by Danish investors.
However, the bonds will be mainly placed and traded internationally and will
be treated like other Eurobond issues.
The deal will be priced to offer a yield pick-up of 7 to 10 basis points
above the 10-year Ecu OAT.
Yesterday, new issue activity in the Eurobond market again followed no clear
pattern. Despite an overhang of paper, a broad range of new issues emerged
in a variety of currencies, including lira, Australian dollars, Swedish
kronor and Ecu.
Swiss Bank Corporation identified an unusual business opportunity in the
dollar sector, which is still failing to excite any investor interest.
By stripping Dollars 500m of a Dollars 2bn bond issue for Italy into its
component parts, the Swiss bank was able to create a range of zero-coupon
bonds. No other banks are involved in the transaction.
The original issue of 9 5/8 per cent bonds due 1999, launched in 1989, has
recently been underperforming the market.
It has been trading at a price of around 110, a substantial premium to its
par value, which deters investors from buying paper. (Bonds priced at a
premium have a built-in capital loss since they will be redeemed at par). By
stripping the issue into its component parts (coupons and principal), the
disadvantage of a premium pricing is removed.
Since the transaction, the spread of the remaining Dollars 1.5bn of 9 5/8
per cent bonds has tightened by about 10 basis points to 48 basis points
above the relevant US Treasury, SBC said.
However, the lack of demand for dollar securities led to some scepticism
from other traders about the level of demand for such paper.
But SBC said the paper was sold-out, following broad-based sales across the
maturity spectrum, as a result of a dearth of zero-coupon paper.
Elsewhere, attractive swap opportunities continue to attract borrowers to
the Swedish kronor market.
Yesterday's SKr500m deal for the International Finance Corporation, the arm
of the World Bank, met firm demand from German retail investors, who were
also the mainstay of last week's three deals in the habitually slow sector.
Eurofima added ADollars 135m to its ADollars 200m global offering of 15-year
bonds.
The deal, arranged by Fay Richwhite and Merrill Lynch, was considered
attractively priced to yield 10.51 per cent, 25 basis points above the
10-year Commonwealth of Australia bond.
Eurofima is the third borrower to use a global structure in this market,
following Swedish Export Credit and the European Investment Bank. Although
other borrowers, such as SBAB, the Swedish mortgage agency, and Credit
Local, the French regional financing agency, are said to be considering the
market.
However, traders said the market was limited to the very top borrowers.
In the matador bond market, Ireland raised Pta10bn of 10-year bonds, via
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. The deal met mainly retail demand from German and
Benelux investors. From an issue price of 101 1/4 , it was bid at 99.90,
within fees of 1 7/8 points.
In the D-Mark sector, Norway added DM500m to its recent DM1bn issue of
five-year bonds via Deutsche Bank.

other regions

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets out-performed the other regions in January,
with UK gilt-edged securities showing the strongest gains, according to JP
Morgan's Bond Index, writes Sara Webb.
UK gilt prices rose 2.62 per cent in January in local currency terms, which
JP Morgan attributed to 'the increased likelihood of a Conservative (party)
victory in the next general election and the perception that the UK will
soon join the ERM (exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system)
narrow band'.
The European markets which showed the strongest gains in local currency
terms after the UK were Belgium (2.12 per cent), the Netherlands (2.08 per
cent) and Germany (2.01 per cent).
All three markets have been boosted by hopes of a cut in German interest
rates.
The worst-performing government bond market was Australia, which fell 2.89
per cent in local currency terms on news that the government will increase
its borrowing.
For US dollar-based investors, the appreciation in the dollar wiped out
gains from the European bond markets.

NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals conglomerate, suffered a
sharp fall in operating profit last year to FM2.7bn (Dollars 619.3m) from
the FIM4.1bn in 1990, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The company blamed the decline on the performance of its chemicals business,
which had been hit by a drop in world prices in the plastics and
petrochemical industries.
Net sales, however, rose by 11 per cent to FM51.9bn, with the biggest
increase coming in the group's oil trading activities and sales of crude oil
produced by the group.
The corporation's investments in capital assets last year was FM5.2bn,
compared with FM4.6bn.
Neste also announced a Dollars 670m upgrading of the power generation
capacity at its main Porvoo refinery.

PROFITS for the year to March at Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest car
producer, are under pressure from high wages and falling demand, according
to Mr Yutaka Kume, president, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'We had enjoyed robust domestic demand, and along with that, wages
increased. We made huge investments that put a depreciation burden on the
company, and recently domestic demand has suffered a decline,' he said.
'In this environment, our profits have been squeezed a lot,' Mr Kume added.
Nissan's net profit in the year ended March 31 1991 was Y164.75bn (Dollars
1.31bn).

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Hungarian fund permits
foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Hungarian, forint-denominated fund will for the first time give
foreigners the right to invest in debt instruments issued by the Hungarian
government
The fund, which will be launched later this month by Creditanstalt
Securities, Budapest, and which will last five years, offers 100,000 units
of 10,000 shares worth Ft1bn (Dollars 13.5m)
Mr Csaba von Csiky, a senior member of Creditanstalt Securities in Budapest,
yesterday said he expected country funds, high-yield funds and private
investors to subscribe.
'I think we can expect a 35 per cent return on this investment. Hungarian
government debt instruments yielded between 31 per cent and 37 per cent in
1991,' he added.
The launch of the fund follows a change in Hungarian legislation last
November, which came into effect on January 1. Although foreign investors
will continue to be prevented from buying Hungarian government debt
securities directly, they can invest indirectly through an investment fund.
Investors will be allowed to transfer dividends and any proceeds, or dispose
of units in the fund in the currency in which they originally invested, Mr
von Csiky said. The fund, which will consist of government Treasury bonds,
notes or bills, is expected to be listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange and
the third tier of the Vienna and Stuggart exchanges.
The launch of the fund coincides with attempts by the Hungarian government
to reduce the annual rate of inflation from 35 per cent in 1991 to 20 per
cent this year. Mr von Csiky pointed to the government's consistent policy
of not seeking rescheduling, or any debt relief on its net hard currency
debt of Dollars 20bn.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Coca-Cola Amatil advances 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCA-COLA Amatil, Australia's largest soft drink and snack food group, has
lent weight to the recession-proof reputation of its operations with a solid
sales and earnings performance for 1991.
The company yesterday announced an 8.2 per cent rise in net profits to
ADollars 68.9m (USDollars 51.8m) for the year to December against ADollars
63.7m a year earlier. Sales advanced 16.6 per cent to ADollars 1.79bn from
ADollars 1.54bn. The annual dividend is up to 15.5 cents a share from 14.5
cents.
Coca-Cola Amatil, which dominates Coke bottling and distribution in the
Pacific Basin, completed a divestment programme during the year to limit its
operations to the core businesses of beverages and snack food.
The biggest divestment was the company's packaging division which helped
reduce net interest payments from ADollars 92.9m to ADollars 82.3m.
Depreciation charges also dropped from ADollars 58.7m to ADollars 54.0 m.
The directors said one of the keys to the company's performance, despite
depressed economic conditions, had been the eighth consecutive annual market
share gain for the Coke brand. Coke-trademarked brands lifted their market
share by 0.5 per cent to a record 48.9 per cent in an industry where 1
percentage point means ADollars 30m in revenue.
'The beverages operation recorded strong growth in sales and significant
increases in trading profits, as a result of the combined effects of organic
growth and acquisitions,' the company said.

WOOLWORTHS, Australia's second largest retailer, has announced earnings and
sales figures which suggest its performance is continuing to outstrip its
larger rival, Coles Myer.
Mr Paul Simons, Woolworths chairman, said yesterday that earnings before
interest and tax had risen 9.4 per cent in the 28 weeks to January 5, while
sales were up 10.8 per cent to ADollars 4.9bn (ADollars 3.68bn) in the
period.
'Both sales and profit are in line with budget at this stage and we expect
to achieve year-end target profit before tax of ADollars 240m, assuming
economic conditions do not deteriorate further,' Mr Simons said.
'In all respects, the company is in good shape to survive the current
recession and emerge strongly when the recovery comes, which we expect to be
modestly evident by mid-1993.'
He added: 'Woolworths' future growth will be steadier as we have passed
through the rebuilding period of the last four years when significant policy
changes yielded quick results on the bottom line.'
The Woolworths' figures easily shaded Coles Myer which posted a 2.1 per cent
sales rise for the January half.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: CMI hit by weak steel market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLOWDOWN in world stainless steel production and weak prices caused
Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), the world's second largest
ferrochrome producer, to record a small loss in the six months to the end of
December.
CMI, a member of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, made
an attributable loss of R180,000 (Dollars 64,000). This was a considerable
improvement over the R14.7m loss the group made in the same period in 1990.
Turnover rose by 41 per cent to R143.7m and operating profit improved to
R10.4m from a R5.1m loss previously. Interest payments were down, following
a R102m rights issue last year, but payment of a R4.3m preference dividend
drove the company into loss.
Mr David Kovarsky, chairman, said the results were worse than expected
because volumes had been down and the group had hoped for a higher price. He
added, however, that the group was happy to be keeping its head above water,
given the difficult state of the ferrochrome market.
Mr Allan Kuhnert, marketing director, said world stainless steel production
had dropped 6.6 per cent in the second half of 1991 compared with 1990
levels. For the year as a whole, however, he estimated world production for
1991 as being virtually constant at 10.66m tonnes.
He anticipated continued weakness of demand in all the key markets during
the first half of 1992.
With about 80 per cent of ferrochrome consumed in the stainless steel
industry, the market was weak.
Mr Kuhnert estimated that world ferrochrome production was currently running
at an annual rate of about 2.6m to 2.7m tonnes, compared with capacity of
3.4m tonnes. CMI is producing at 60 per cent of its capacity of 330,000
tonnes a year.
Mr Kovarsky said the reporting period had been 'very eventful', notably for
the merger between Samancor and Middelburg Steel and Alloys, the world's two
largest producers, and because South Africa had increased the price from 49
cents to 52 cents a pound in December.
No interim dividend was declared.

THE provisional liquidator of Compass Holdings, the failed Australian
airline operator, has been granted an extension to hold talks with three
interested investors, AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
The liquidator, Mr Ian Ferrier of chartered accountancy firm Ferrier
Hodgson, was due to begin winding-up procedures yesterday if he could not
present a rescue plan to the Federal Court. However, the court extended that
deadline until March 10.
Compass was placed in provisional liquidation on December 20.
Legal counsel for the liquidator told the court that negotiations were
continuing with three unnamed parties interested in investing in the
airline. Any proposal emerging from the talks would involve a scheme of
arrangement which requires court approval.
Existing members of the Compass board will be excluded in any proposed
rescue of the airline.
The Australian Securities Commission previously told the court that it was
investigating Compass, and on present information it would have 'serious
concern' if any of the airline's directors retained a role in the company.

MITSUI Engineering and Shipbuilding, the leading Japanese shipbuilder and
part of the Mitsui group, plans to double capital spending in its
shipbuilding business to Y6bn (Dollars 47.5m) in fiscal 1992, Kyodo reports
from Tokyo.
It initially planned to invest Y10bn in plant and shipbuilding equipment
during a five-year period beginning in fiscal year 1989.
The shipbuilding business has since come out of a slump, and with many new
orders on its books, Mitsui Engineering has decided to boost investment in
1992.
The company plans to improve the efficiency of its shipbuilding operations
by spending about Y2bn to modernise a painting plant.
The improvements are aimed at expanding the facility's capacity, allowing
construction of more double-hull tankers, which are in greater demand due to
increasing concerns about marine pollution from oil spills.

PT INTERNATIONAL Nickel Indonesia (PT Inco), which was floated on the
Jakarta stock market in April 1990, has posted net earnings for 1991 down
16.6 per cent at USDollars 57m, or 23 cents a share, compared with Dollars
68.4m, or 28 cents, in 1990.
PT Inco, 58 per cent owned by Inco of Canada, said the downturn was mainly
caused by lower realised nickel prices - Dollars 2.91 a pound compared with
Dollars 3.12 - and a higher provision for deferred taxes at Dollars 16.55m,
against Dollars 2.36m a year earlier. This was only partly offset by
increased nickel deliveries, up to 75.7m lb from 60.2m lb.
The company's production of nickel in matte, an intermediate product,
reached a record 75.9m lb, against 59.6m lb in 1990 and 64m lbs in 1989.
PT Inco's stocks of nickel in matte at the end of the year were 1.3m lb,
compared with 1.2m at the end of 1990.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 8m people have subscribed to participate in Czechoslovakia's massive
privatisation of state-owned enterprises, baffling authorities which
expected only half the response.
Queues at local registration offices started to grow earlier this year after
private investment funds offered would-be customers a 10-fold return in a
year's time.
Right-wing parties pushing for the mass privatisation scheme have rejoiced
at the rising number of subscribers, which now represent two-thirds of the
electorate. The success of the scheme is expected to boost their popularity
ahead of next June's elections.
Under Czechoslovakia's large-scale privatisation programme, an estimated
Kcs250bn (Dollars 8bn) of state-enterprises' equity will be distributed this
spring in the form of vouchers. These vouchers will become shares once the
privatisation process is completed.
The government hopes to privatise half of the country's state-owned
enterprises in this manner, by the summer. A further distribution is planned
for the autumn.
More than 450 private investment funds have mushroomed across the country,
offering to invest the vouchers of Czechoslovak citizens who are often
confused by the privatisation process and lacking basic information on many
state-owned enterprises.
If on schedule, the first round of bidding for shares will take place next
month.
Moreover, less assets than predicted may be available. Officials at the
Czech ministry of privatisation said many state-owned companies were
entangled in restitution claims and would not be available for distribution
by March.

<TEXT>
VOGUE, the French record company, has submitted a rescue bid for La Cinq,
the ailing French television station.
This morning, Mr Hubert Lafont, who was this year appointed as La Cinq's
administrator after the station filed for bankruptcy, will announce whether
he has found an acceptable buyer for the channel.
Vogue's chief competitor as La Cinq's saviour is Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
Italian media mogul who already owns 25 per cent of the shares and on Monday
announced a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270bn) recapitalisation plan for the channel.
Mr Berlusconi claims to have already found enough potential investors for
his package. He also intends to increase his investment, maintaining his
holding at 25 per cent, the maximum allowed under French law. If other
existing shareholders, whoh include the Hachette media group and Credit
Lyonnais, the French bank, did not reinvest, their holdings would be so
diluted that Mr Berlusconi and his partners would be in a very powerful
position.
Vogue said yesterday that it saw its bid as a means of 'preserving the
French character' of La Cinq. Vogue, which is owned and run by Mr Jean-Louis
Detry, is one of a handful of French record companies in an industry
dominated by the US and Japan. It employs 110 people and turned over around
FFr200m in 1991.
Any rescuer for La Cinq must conform to the French criteria for the
ownership and management of TV stations. If Mr Lafont decides that none of
the mooted rescues is suitable, La Cinq will close.

DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, has signed a letter of intent on
transferring its computer services and software department to Raet, a Dutch
automation group, as part of its policy of 'outsourcing' non-core staff and
service activities to other companies.
The computer department, which is called Computer Centrum Nederland, employs
300 people. It has an annual turnover of about Fl 90m (Dollars 50m), of
which 15 per cent is generated outside DSM.
The divestment, if completed, would involve the second biggest transfer of a
DSM staff department to another company since the chemicals group
transferred its 460-employee maintenance department to Stork, the Dutch
engineering group, in Jan-uary.
As in the case of maintenance, the computer department will continue to work
for DSM after ownership is transferred to Raet.
As part of its long-term strategy, DSM is seeking to focus on core
businesses as well as carrying out a policy of further decentralisation. A
decision on the computer services sale is expected later this year.

<TEXT>
BULL, the French state-owned computer-maker which last week sealed a
wide-ranging alliance with IBM, the US computer giant, is working with the
Finance Ministry on how to raise substantial new equity capital.
Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chairman, told Les Echos newspaper yesterday that
neither IBM's arrival nor the recent equity capital injections solved Bull's
long-term financial problems. IBM is expected to pay around Dollars 100m for
a 5.7 per cent stake in the French group, although the final details have
yet to be settled.
'IBM's contribution is not useless, but it is not up to the size of our
recapitalisation problem. It is significant and constitutes a mark of
confidence,' Mr Lorentz said.
He would give no details of how much Bull needed, beyond adding: 'We are
reflecting on complementary measures of two types: firstly, a transitional
arrangement for the two years ahead, awaiting a real recovery; secondly,
something more durable.'
Bull had long term debts of FFr9bn (Dollars 1.66bn) in its last balance
sheet, for 1990. It is due to publish 1991 results towards the end of this
month, which are expected to show operating losses half the FFr2.4bn
operating deficit in 1990. A similar reduction can be expected from the
FFr6.8bn net loss shown in the same period.
Bull received FFr2bn in fresh capital from the French government last July
and expects another FFr2bn this year, said an official. Both equity
injections are being investigated by the European Commission, but officials
feel that Brussels is unlikely to declare that they amount to unfair state
aid now that IBM has agreed to invest in Bull on commercial terms.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Elf expects 7.5% fall in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF AQUITAINE, the larger of France's two state-controlled oil groups,
yesterday estimated that 1991 net profits would show a 7.5 per cent decline.
It attributed the setback to the decline in oil prices over the period, a
depressed chemicals market, and steep growth in acquisitions and
investments. Given the pressure on margins, the results were satisfactory,
said Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, the chairman.
According to Elf's estimate, net income fell to FFr9.8bn (Dollars 1.81bn)
from FFr10.6bn in 1990, on sales up to FFr190bn from FFr175bn. This
contrasts with the 41 per cent net profits increase expected for 1991 by
Total, Elf's smaller state-controlled rival. Total depends more heavily on
refining and has a lower exposure to oil price changes.
The French government was due to sell just over 2 per cent of Elf's shares,
worth about FFr2bn, before Christmas, but the plan has been shelved awaiting
a fuller stock market recovery. Mr Le Floch-Prigent said it was up to his
state shareholder to decide when to sell and he had no information on its
plans.
Elf's capital spending rose by 35 per cent last year to FFr42.5bn, including
the acquisitions of a Norwegian oil group, refineries and filling stations
in the UK, Spain and Germany, and Occidental Petroleum's North Sea acreage.
Acquisitions of 48m tonnes of proven reserves and discoveries of 41m tonnes
helped lift total reserves by 13.6 per cent to 475m tonnes. This was well on
track for the group's ultimate target of 600m tonnes, said Mr Le
Floch-Prigent.
Elf was successfully continuing with its policy of getting a balance between
its upstream and downstream businesses, so that half of last year's FFr19bn
operating profits came from exploration and production, with the rest from
refining, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Overall operating profits were
FFr20.5bn in 1990. Three years ago, Elf drew nearly two-thirds of its
operating earnings from upstream activities.
By sector, operating profits in exploration and production fell to FFr9.5bn
from FFr11.8bn, while earnings from refining and marketing rose to FFr4.6bn
from FFr1.4bn, helped by an exceptional gain.

MR Lars Erik Ottosson, chief executive and president for the past 10 years
of Stena Line, the Swedish shipping group, is to resign, it was announced
unexpectedly yesterday.
Mr Ottosson, aged 45, was the driving force behind Stena's rapid expansion
during the late 1980s. The group acquired Sealink, the UK ferry business, in
1990.
'It is time to do something new,' he said yesterday. 'The company is going
into a period of consolidation and I am more interested in expansive and
strategic managerial duties.'
The company said that operations in Scandinavia were 'going better than
ever' and its savings programme at Sealink had been implemented.
Stena made a pre-tax loss of SKr300m (Dollars 51.5m) last year. A spokesman
said the company would make a profit this year 'on all its operations'.
There were strong denials that Mr Ottosson's departure was due to any
difference of opinion inside the group over its future strategy. He will
leave the company in May. A successor has yet to be appointed.

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest oil company, yesterday unveiled a
reorganisation which includes the closure of about 1,000 retail outlets,
unspecified cuts in refining capacity, and a 12 per cent reduction in its
14,000-strong workforce.
The restructuring, hastened by severe pressure on all sectors of the oil and
gas industry, includes turning business operations which operate as
free-standing units into divisions of the parent company.
Imperial is 70 per cent owned by Exxon of New York. It suffered the first
operating loss in its history last year.
Mr Arden Haynes, chairman, said yesterday that 'these are tough times and
they call for tough but sensible actions.'
The company said that it would cut its refining capacity in Ontario, and
said that prospects for its Ioco refinery in British Columbia were 'very
difficult'.
Mr Haynes said 'while decisions on specific refineries will be made later in
the year, there is no doubt some rationalisation is required.'
Imperial's refining capacity is about 510,000 barrels a day (b/d). Its
Nanticoke and Sarnia refineries in Ontario have a combined capacity of
218,000 b/d. The Ioco plant has a 43,000 b/d capacity.
The company is also considering divestment of non-core chemicals businesses.

LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, expects a loss of around DM400m
(Dollars 250m) for 1991.
Two months ago, when reporting a pre-tax loss of DM159m for the first nine
months, the company said it would offset its operating loss through aircraft
sales and transfers from reserves.
Yesterday, however, it said the market for second-hand airliners was so weak
that it had 14 unsold aircraft.
Lufthansa had also experienced a final quarter worse than hoped because of
the continued weak state of the world economy. Full results will be
announced in May.
The airline, just over half of whose equity is state-owned, began the year
poorly with a loss of DM475m in the first quarter, a period which suffered
from the impact on business of the Gulf war. But it made a profit of DM145m
in the second quarter and DM172m in the third.
Lufthansa's 1991 loss comes despite higher traffic volumes and turnover.

GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday reported a 10
per cent increase in fourth-quarter net income, in spite of the slowdown in
the US economy.
Net income totalled Dollars 515m, or 57 cents a share, compared with Dollars
467m, or 52 cents, in the same period of 1990. Revenues and sales rose 7 per
cent to Dollars 5.2bn.
Income from continuing operations, excluding GTE's electrical products
business, which is being divested, totalled Dollars 481m, or 53 cents, up
from Dollars 435m, or 48 cents.
The company said the results reflected the continuing weakness of the
economy, offset partly by lower interest rates. Excluding an accounting
change, earnings per share from continuing operations rose 6 per cent.
GTE's telephone operations produced a 3 per cent rise in fourth-quarter
operating income to Dollars 1bn, against 5 per cent for the year; the
company blamed the slowdown of the economy. Telecommunications products and
services produced income of Dollars 35m, compared with a loss of Dollars 18m
in 1990.
GTE, which acquired Contel, a large local and cellular telephone company
last year, said customer growth in the cellular area had continued at a high
level in 1991.
Some 84,000 customers had been added during the fourth quarter, bringing the
total served to 811,000, compared with 594,000 at the end of 1990.
For the full year, consolidated net income totalled Dollars 1.8bn, or
Dollars 1.98 a share, compared with Dollars 1.85 earned on a pro forma basis
in 1990, including Contel's results for the full year. The 1991 figures
excludes a Dollars 204m one-time special charge.
MCI Communications, the second-largest long distance telephone company in
the US, reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 137m, or 52 cents,
against Dollars 120m, or 47 cents.
Revenues rose 7.9 per cent to Dollars 2.16bn. Full-year earnings were
Dollars 522m, or Dollars 2.01, compared with Dollars 270m, or Dollars 1.06
in 1990, when it took Dollars 550m of one-time charges.

KROGER, one of the large US supermarket chains, has reported a fall in
full-year profits from Dollars 82.4m in 1990 to Dollars 79.9m last year,
writes Nikki Tait.
However, the 1991 figure is scored after a Dollars 20.8m extraordinary loss
relating to the early retirement of debt, compared with a Dollars 910,000
deficit in the previous year.
Sales during the 12 months increased by a modest 5.4 per cent to Dollars
21.3bn, with same-store sales rising 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter and
3 per cent in the year.
The company, like others in its sector, warned that the highly competitive
conditions seen last year were spilling into 1992.
Kroger, which operates over 1,250 stores in 25 states and geared itself up
in a defensive restructuring in 1988, opened or expanded 42 stores last
year.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: UBS takes over assets of
regional Swiss bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the largest Swiss bank, has taken over the
SFr2bn (Dollars 1.40bn) in assets of one of the country's largest regional
banks, Bank EvK, Ersparniskasse von Konolfingen.
The takeover is the second in the Swiss banking sector this week, and part
of the long-expected consolidation of Switzerland's more than 600 banks.
The process appears now to be accelerating because many smaller banks,
including Bank EvK, are being squeezed by the recession and especially by
the slump in the Swiss property market.
On Monday, Banque de l'Etat de Fribourg said it was taking over Banque de la
Glane et de la Gruyere, a bank with SFr250m in assets.
UBS said EvK was, on the whole, a good bank without fundamental problems,
but it had to make special provisions on bad loans last year of about SFr70m
and that left it with insufficient capital and reserves to comply with the
Swiss Federal Banking Commission's stiff requirements.
Bank EvK, based in Grosshochstetten, near Bern, first got into trouble last
October following the sudden closure by the Banking Commission of another
local bank in the Bern region, Spar und Leihkasse Thun.
Shock over this unprecedented step by the authorities drove many people to
withdraw their savings from other regional banks, including Bank EvK.
At the time, UBS provided a liquidity guarantee and both banks hoped that
would enable it to overcome its problems.
UBS will integrate Bank EvK's head office, nine branches and 140 employees
into its own domestic network immediately. Some branches could be closed
following a review of their operations.
It is the third regional bank that UBS has taken over in the past two years,
and the bank expects to absorb others in the future.

<TEXT>
LAIDLAW, the Canadian waste services and school bus operator, is raising
CDollars 242m (USDollars 206m) through a common share issue which it will
use to reduce debt and provide for possible acquisitions.
The Ontario-based company has agreed to sell 22.75m non-voting Class B
shares to a group of Canadian underwriters at a price of CDollars 11 a
share. The shares were trading at CDollars 11.63.
Canadian Pacific, which has a 47 per cent voting interest in Laidlaw, will
take up its proportionate share of the issue.
CP earlier this week wrote down its investment in Laidlaw by CDollars 291m.
In addition, it took a writedown of CDollars 101m, reflecting its share of
Laidlaw's writedown last year of its 28 per cent interest in ADT, the
Bermuda-based security services and vehicle auction company.
The CDollars 291m writedown reflects the steep decline in Laidlaw's shares
since CP bought its interest at roughly double the present price three years
ago. The share price has recently recovered from a low of CDollars 8.25,
reached last autumn.
Laidlaw said yesterday that the issue would reduce the debt-equity ratio
from 87 per cent to 68 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUMMINS Engine, the loss-making US maker of diesel engines, improved its
financial performance in the fourth quarter and said it expected to return
to profit in the first quarter of this year.
The company, hit hard by weakness in the North American heavy truck market,
reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 2.3m, or 29 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 59m, excluding a Dollars 65.3m restructuring
charge, and a Dollars 5.3m extraordinary credit in the same period last
year. Sales fell from Dollars 899m to Dollars 865m.
Cummins said the figures reflected a continued improvement in operating
results, helped by a cost-reduction programme and strong demand for its B
and C series mid-range engines. Its successful 1991 product launch had meant
lower product coverage expenses.
For 1991 as a whole, it lost Dollars 14.1m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, on
sales of Dollars 3.4bn, including a Dollars 51.5m gain because of an
accounting change.
In 1990, it lost Dollars 137.7m, including unusual charges, or Dollars 12.25
a share, on sales of Dollars 3.5bn.
Cummins expected to be profitable in the first quarter even though no
economic improvement was foreseen in most of its markets.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sears prepares Dollars 1bn
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and financial services group, intends to make
a preferred stock offering of 25m depository shares, worth around Dollars
1bn.
Mr Edward Liddy, Sears' chief financial officer, said the aim was to reduce
debt and strengthen its balance sheet.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said
each share would represent one-fourth of a share of mandatorily exchangeable
shares, known as Percs.
The announcement came as Sears reported improved results for the fourth
quarter and the whole of 1991. In the quarter, net income rose to Dollars
523.1m, or Dollars 1.48 a share, against Dollars 378.8m, or Dollars 1.10, a
year ago.
Cost-cutting in the Merchandise Group helped boost fourth-quarter
performance. The retail group posted income of Dollars 289.1m, against
Dollars 95.6m in the year-ago period, which included a restructuring charge
of Dollars 155.2m. Without the charge, fourth-quarter 1991 income rose 15
per cent.
The profit was, however, squeezed from a small increase in retail revenues
in the fourth quarter - Dollars 9.5bn compared with Dollars 9.44bn last
year.
'It's too early to say Sears has turned a corner,' said analyst Mr Richard
Nelson at Duff &amp; Phelps. 'We'd like to see sustainable sales growth.'
Sears' overall net income for 1991 increased by 41.8 per cent to Dollars
1.28bn, or Dollars 3.71 a share, from Dollars 902.2m, or Dollars 2.63, in
1990.
The 1991 results reflect a change in US accounting standards that will
eliminate deferred tax charges taken by Sears in 1991.
The charges totalled Dollars 185.5m for the first three quarters and were
reduced by a credit of Dollars 35.5m. Prior to the accounting change,
fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 552.6m, or Dollars 1.60 a share, and
for the full year Dollars 1.14bn, or Dollars 3.32.
Allstate Insurance income increased to Dollars 722.5m, compared with Dollars
551.8m from continuing operations in 1990 before a one-time tax benefit.
Sears was also buoyed by a good year at its securities trading and credit
card group, Dean Witter, which reported income of Dollars 344.6m, up from
Dollars 232.9m in 1990.
Even the real estate division, Coldwell Banker, managed a significant
improvement in income, which rose to Dollars 60.6m from Dollars 25.5m in
1990.

FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Electrolux down sharply despite
better last quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTROLUX, the world's largest white goods manufacturer, yesterday reported
steeply lower profits for 1991 despite a substantial final-quarter
improvement.
Fourth-quarter profits (after adjustment for capital gains and restructuring
costs) rose 18 per cent to SKr335m (Dollars 57.9m) from SKr284m for the same
period of 1990.
The company said operating income after depreciation increased slightly in
the quarter to SKr482m from SKr386m.
For 1991 as a whole, profits (after financial items) tumbled by 27 per cent
to SKr1.025bn. The result was better than many analysts expected. Group
income benefited from SKr250m in capital gains from divestments.
Sales fell by 1 per cent in 1991 to SKr79.1bn. Earnings per share after full
tax declined to SKr5.50 from SKr10.10, while return on equity after full tax
fell to 2.4 per cent from 4.3 per cent. The dividend is being held at
SKr12.50 a share.
Electrolux said the dividend decision should be seen against the background
of the good long-term prospects for core operations and the substantial
investments that have been made in recent years in terms of production
facilities and new generations of products.
Electrolux added that lower capital expenditure and efficient capital
management had generated a positive cash-flow last year and additional
improvement was expected during 1992 as a result of the SKr901m
restructuring programme.
This has involved the closure of 10 large plants and around 15,000 job
losses since it began in the second half of 1990. It is estimated that the
company has saved SKr3bn through rationalisation.
The improvement in the fourth-quarter results stemmed from a slight increase
in sales in household goods and outdoor products. But Electrolux said there
had been a substantial decline in operating income for industrial products,
mainly due to the performance of the Granges aluminium product subsidiary.
Commercial services showed a downturn in the final three months.
Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals group Neste has formed a joint venture
with Conoco and Catalytica, both of the US.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Attempt to end delay on sale of Israeli
interests
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, admin-istrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies,
has arranged a bid of Dollars 18m (Pounds 10m) for the late publisher's
majority stake in Ma'ariv Modi'in by another Maxwell Media Trust company in
an unorthodox attempt to end the delay of the sale of the Israeli media
group.
The move appeared chiefly designed to draw out the holders of the remaining
15 per cent of Ma'ariv Modi'in, which publishes Ma'ariv, the country's
second biggest daily newspaper, whose right to first refusal on the sale of
the Maxwell holdings has been largely responsible for a delay in the bidding
process.
The three main potential bidders, including Hollinger, the Canadian media
group, have been reluctant to reveal their plans while the intentions of Mr
Shimon Cheifetz, the Ma'ariv managing director, who holds a 10 per cent
stake and first refusal rights, were unclear.
The potential buyers have also set a value on the Maxwell stake which is
well below the Dollars 18m being offered yesterday by the administrators.
Ma'ariv Modi'in is understood to carry debt of about Dollars 30m and is said
to require a capital injection in addition to the buying price.
The main potential Israeli buyers are a group led by Mr Dov Judkovsky,
Ma'ariv editor, and Mr Aharon Dovrat, a director, both of whom were close
associates of Mr Maxwell, and Mr Ya'acov Nimrodi, a businessman.
The administrators said the offer for the Maxwell stake was being made by
Marnline, a wholly-owned Maxwell Media subsidiary to enable the sale process
to proceed. It gave the shareholders who have rights of first refusal 15
days to offer at least the same price, or the stake would go to Marn-line.
'Thereafter, the administrators will be in a position to sell the shares in
Marnline Limited free of pre-emption rights for either Dollars 18m or any
higher figure that they agree,' a statement said.
Israeli sources associated with the rival bidders, who are competing with
each other to do a deal with Mr Cheifetz, attacked the move by the
administrators.
'It is not a genuine bid. Their problem is that no-one is bidding. The sole
purpose of this is to get Cheifetz out of the way. It is a sign of
desperation,' said one.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Unauthorised decisions on pensions by
Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT MAXWELL made the investment decisions for the Mirror Group
Newspaper Pension Fund, even though he was not authorised to conduct
investment business, a former trustee told the House of Commons yesterday.
Capt Peter Jackson, who became a Mirror Group pension fund trustee early in
1987 after the Maxwell Group acquired British Airways' helicopter division,
told the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social Security that Mr Maxwell
controlled the other trustees. Among other things, trustee votes and
discussions counter to Mr Maxwell's interests were omitted from minutes of
meetings.
Capt Jackson added that pension funds' cash was held in a Maxwell bank
account at Coutts &amp; Company. If trustees questioned the custody they were
reassured that the interest rate paid to the pension fund was higher than
that which would have been available anywhere else, he said.
Capt Jackson produced a letter from the MGN pension fund solicitors, dated
August 5 1987, telling the trustees that the requirements of the new
Financial Services Act, under which Mr Maxwell would have had to obtain
authorisation to conduct investment business from a self-regulatory
organisation, were expensive and time consuming.
Thus, the letter said, it was advisable that Bishopsgate Investment
Management, which was already authorised by the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation should take on managing the MGN pension funds.
However, Capt Jackson said that up until he left the fund in April 1989, he
believed that Mr Maxwell was making the investment decisions.
He said that trustees did question some investments obviously related to Mr
Maxwell. However, trustees were never told that Mr Maxwell had connections
to many of the fund's largest investments.
Sir Jeremy Rowe, chairman of the Occupational Pensions Board, defended his
organisation's role in safeguarding Maxwell company pensions.

Publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of US and UK publishers have bid for Macdonald Publishing, Maxwell
Communication Corporation's loss-making UK publishing company.
The list is believed to include Little Brown, the Boston publishing group,
Simon &amp; Shuster, Random Century, and Headline and Orion, the company
recently set up by Mr Anthony Cheetham, who was forced out of Random last
November.
Mr Anthony Lomas of Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, is hoping to
complete a sale within the next two weeks.
Macdonald, whose list includes literary biographies, Catherine Cookson
novels and Enid Blyton's Noddy books, was in a particularly vulnerable
position because it owed its parent Pounds 33m and had been incurring losses
of more than Pounds 1m a year.
The company said it was trading normally and was virtually up to date with
its February printing schedule in spite of the disruption caused by the
collapse of the Maxwell empire.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: European expansion holds back growth at
Fyffes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FYFFES, the Dublin-based fresh fruit and vegetable wholesaling group,
recorded a pre-tax profit of IPounds 27.1m (Pounds 25m) for the year to
October 31 1991 compared with IPounds 26.3m.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 6.73p and a final dividend of 0.8162p
(0.742p) is proposed for a total of 1.1388p (1.0353p).
The results were marginally lower than market expectations of about IPounds
30m, with earnings closer to 7p. The dilution of earnings by last year's
IPounds 61m rights issue was offset by the lower tax charge of IPounds 6.03m
(IPounds 6.78m).
Tough trading conditions in the UK market, and the ongoing costs of Fyffes'
expansion into the European market were blamed for a set of results which
one Dublin-based analyst described as 'slightly disappointing'.
Mr Carl McCann, finance director, said that the main factor affecting
profitability in the past year 'has been the setting up of our international
banana operation, sourcing bananas from Central America for the continental
European market'.
He said the company had lost volume in the first half of the year, due to a
settlement agreement with Chiquita International to end the commercial war
that broke out in 1990 when Fyffes began buying bananas in Honduras.
Seasonally weaker prices in the second half of the year, when volumes picked
up, then kept margins low for the year as a whole.
'Operationally though we have made huge progress. We have extended our
source of supply in Central America, with a major new source in Guatemala
and we have opened a new office in Florida to manage the tropical end of the
business' said Mr McCann.
'While the timing of the return on our investment in this division is not
easy to predict, we are building an important new business which we believe
will make a positive contribution in the future', the company said.
Turnover advanced by 9 per cent to IPounds 608m (IPounds 557m).
COMMENT
Fyffes can reasonably argue that a tough recessionary year in the UK, its
main market, and the ongoing costs of its nascent expansion strategy into
continental Europe with Central American-sourced bananas, has held back
earnings to levels lower than market expectations. To establish itself
firmly in the highly-competitive continental market, the group will need to
move downstream by acquiring ripening and distribution assets there, which
has been the key to its success in the UK and Ireland. However, it does not
seem to be much closer to negotiating an acquisition than it was in June
last year when the rights issue was made. Its IPounds 100m cash hoard makes
the company a financially solid business, but the market may get impatient
if the continental expansion does not bring the expected rewards in terms of
higher earnings. The company, however, shows no signs of being rushed into a
hasty decision.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Elga to pay Pounds 4.94m for furnace maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK

<TEXT>
Elga, the laboratory equip- ment and water purification company, is buying
Carbolite, a manufacturer of laboratory furnaces, for Pounds 4.94m.
The company, which is changing its name to Protean, will issue 6.5m new
shares to help fund the acquisition, and has offered shareholders the chance
to buy one share for every 2.6 held on January 28 at 95p apiece. The shares
closed at 99p yesterday. The placing is fully underwritten.
The purchase will be funded by Pounds 683,000 in loan notes and 4.1m shares.
The remaining 2.4m shares will be used to redeem loan notes and reduce
Carbolite's Pounds 1.7m borrowings.
'This is an exciting development of the group,' said Mr Alasdair Culshaw,
finance director. 'We are very pleased about the acquisition.'
Carbolite employs 141 people in Bamford, Thetford and Market Harborough. Its
managing director will join the Elga board.
The acquisition and change of name must both receive the approval of
shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting at the end of this month.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pressing ahead with an inherited strategy -
The future of Wace without John Clegg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRISIS of Mr John Clegg's departure last Friday as managing director has
raised questions about Wace Group's underlying commercial health. How secure
is the printing company's immediate future, and what kind of long-term
business have Mr Clegg's colleagues on the board inherited?
Despite the past week's speculation over the sources of Wace's funding and
the consequent fall in its share price from about 260p to 132p last night,
it declined to put out a trading statement ahead of its full year figures in
April.
Shareholders, understandably, have been pressing for urgent clarification on
the reasons for Mr Clegg's departure.
However, the closest City followers of the company have not cited worries
about the March figures when searching for explanations. At this stage, at
least, they are not expecting his departure to herald a plunge in trading
fortunes.
Throughout the past week's swirling rumours, analysts have stuck by their
estimates of between Pounds 17m and Pounds 18m pre-tax profits for the year
to December 1991, compared with Pounds 26.5m last year.
The expected slump in profits is no worse than that indicated in the
half-year figures. Those showed that demand for pre-press services, the
preparation and amendment of text and pictures before printing, has slumped
sharply with the downturn in the economy and in advertising.
It is the company's longer-term future which attracts more debate and it is
these questions the company will need to answer if it is to succeed in its
efforts to rehabilitate itself in the City.
It may find it is lecturing to a difficult audience. The company's past
dependence on acquisitions for its growth - some 40 in the past five years -
and its image as a one-man band, over-reliant on Mr Clegg, had made sceptics
of many City investors.
A more difficult issue for the company to address, because answers are not
clear cut and views differ widely, is whether a technological revolution
will undermine the future of the pre-press business.
Mr Clegg's unambiguous view, expressed vigorously to City institutions at
each of the four rights issues between 1987 and 1990, was that pre-press,
formerly a fragmented cottage industry, had a brilliant future.
Advertising agencies and publishers, he argued, would put an increasing
amount of their pre-press business out to specialist houses, not wanting to
invest in the expensive new capital equipment.
Mr Clegg believed the recession simply strengthened Wace's hand, allowing it
to 'mop up' its smaller competitors, invest in the expensive
state-of-the-art electronics that they could not afford, and take over their
clients.
Some in the printing industry disagree vigorously with that view. The core
of their argument, which in a simplified version could be christened 'the
Apple Mac threat', is that the price of some pre-press equipment is
plummeting because of technological changes.
Greater microprocessing power makes it possible to run more powerful
software on a single machine such as an Apple Macintosh. The result is that
some of the main clients, such as advertising agencies and glossy magazine
houses, may begin doing more of their own work in-house.
On this view, Wace has expensively positioned itself as the leader of a
rapidly-shrinking market and this trend could deprive it of long-term growth
even when the advertising recession ends.
One senior executive of a leading advertising agency, which has made some
investment in its own in-house pre-press facilities, said: 'There has been a
real revolution. There used to be only expensive equipment, incompatible
with other brand of equipment. But then the smaller manufacturers began to
develop open systems that would talk to each other.
'Now you can buy one machine, and load extra software on it - buying extra
typesetting fonts for a few thousand pounds each, for example, instead of
lots of different machines costing several hundred thousand pounds each.'
However, even the most fervent believers in this 'revolution' agree it is
only partial. Small machines cannot yet properly handle high resolution in
digital graphics, and other crucial jobs such as the retouching of
transparencies are generally done by specialists.
Unsurprisingly, some manufacturers of pre-press technology believe the
capabilities of small machines have been overstated.
Mr Jim Salmon, managing director of Crosfield Electronics, one of the
world's leading manufacturers of electronic printing technology, said: 'It
is true that the world is now an open systems marketplace of compatible
machines, and that is a fundamental change. But without dismissing the
technological trends, which are real, by far the greatest impact on the
business at the moment is the advertising recession.'
Wace itself does not dismiss the changes but emphasises that the company has
many types of customer.
Mr Brian Dudley, Wace's new managing director, said: 'Although the Mac
technology, for instance, has advanced enormously, from Wace's perspective
that is not a threat.'
He gives as an example Wace's magazine design work. A year ago only 5 per
cent of the raw designs and text were sent to Wace in digital form. Now it
is 50 per cent.
But in Mr Dudley's view 'Wace still has the job of putting it into high
resolution' and that is enough to protect its hold on its clients.
'Buying the best machines for that highest quality work is still a very
significant investment - you need a critical mass of customers', he argues.
The strategy he inherited from Mr Clegg, in particular the company's past
heavy investment, relies on those economies of scale being achievable. It is
an argument he may have to rehearse many times with City investors if he is
to win them back.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Ryanair on the upturn as profits emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RYANAIR, the Irish carrier owned by the sons of Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and
founder of GPA, the world's leading aircraft leasing group, made a small
profit last year - the first since its launch in 1986.
After accumulating losses of nearly IPounds 19m (Pounds 17.7m) since 1986,
last year's pre-tax surplus of IPounds 300,000 marks a significant turnround
for the airline, which has challenged Aer Lingus on the busy London-Dublin
route and helped bring down fares between the two countries during the past
six years. It lost IPounds 9m in 1990.
The profit reflects substantial restructuring and a clampdown on costs
during the past 18 months. The workforce has been cut by 15 per cent to
about 500 and Ryanair has dropped out of some unprofitable routes to
concentrate on its Dublin to London Stansted services.
Mr Conor Hayes, Ryanair's new chief executive, said the airline had been
boosted by its move last year from Luton to Stansted and it now intended to
expand its flights to Stansted this year.
It has also reached an agreement with American Airlines to tie in its
services from Stansted to Dublin with the US carrier's new Chicago to
Stansted flights this summer.
Mr Hayes said he expected Ryanair to show higher profits this year. 'If we
managed to make a small profit in a year when the industry lost money
because of the Gulf war and the recession, we should do even better this
year,' he said.
British Airways' decision to withdraw its services to Ireland last year had
a relatively modest impact on Ryanair's operations. 'Everybody got a piece
of the BA cake, but we got the smallest part of it,' Mr Hayes said.
Ryanair is to increase its fleet to 11 aircraft this spring by adding two
BAC 1-11 jets to its operations. It has also started a review of a fleet
renewal and replacement programme, but it only expects to take a decision
next year.
The airline, with revenues of IPounds 50m in 1991, carried 700,000
passengers last year, including 50,000 on charters, about the same as in
1990. However, Mr Hayes expected numbers to increase to 850,000 on scheduled
routes this year and to 125,000 on charter services.

FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Heiton declines 36% but curbs losses from
UK operations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCTION of 36 per cent in pre-tax profits was announced by Heiton
Holdings, the Dublin-based steel stockholding and buil-ders' merchant group,
for the half year to October 31 1991.
The fall to IPounds 820,000 (Pounds 762,000) compared with IPounds 1.28m
last time and was struck on turnover down 13 per cent, from IPounds 34m to
IPounds 29.7m.
Mr Richard Hewat, chairman, said the lower turnover 'was largely due to the
major rationalisation implemented in our UK operations' where sales dropped
to just IPounds 128,000 (IPounds 4.51m).
He added that the second half would be difficult but that losses in the UK
had been eliminated.
Last year Mr Leo Martin, the group's financial dir-ector, said that the
group planned to wind down its UK operations as 'we see no upturn in demand
in the UK for the next 18 months or two years'.
The company's focus was now to concentrate on ex-panding Atlantic Homecare,
its DIY retail division, which had continued to increase turnover in spite
of the recession.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.75p (2.54p) and the interim dividend
is maintained at 0.65p.
An extraordinary IPounds 200,000 charge represented additional costs for the
implementation of the rationalisation plan in the UK.
Heiton also announced the merger of four companies involved in solid fuel
distribution, including its 41.5 per cent owned Consolidated Holdings.
Heiton will receive a 22 per cent stake in Jubilata, the new company.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: Time to tune the machinery - The UN
Security Council summit has called attention to imbalances in membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's UN Security Council meeting at summit level had a largely
symbolic character. It was, in its own words, 'a timely recognition of the
fact that there are new, favourable international circumstances under which
the Security Council has begun to fulfil more effectively its primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security'. In
short, an act of collective self-congratulation.
That does not make it necessarily a bad thing. The Security Council is a
useful institution. It is good that its members should be publicly
associated with it at the highest level, so that political leaders have a
personal stake in its success. It is good that it be seen to be giving a
lead to the UN as a whole, and it was especially appropriate that it shone
the spotlight on the new secretary-general, giving him a firm mandate, with
a deadline of July 1, to report back with specific recommendations for
'strengthening and making more efficient . . . the capacity of the United
Nations for preventive diplomacy, for peacemaking and peacekeeping'. The
preventive side has definitely been the UN's weak point up to now, while
peacekeeping is a growth industry whose financial and logistical
requirements urgently need to be re-thought.
But the meeting shone the spotlight even more blindingly on the Security
Council itself, and some of those on stage to take the bow could be seen to
blink. Of none was this truer than the man chiefly responsible for switching
on the spotlight, the British prime minister.
The meeting was above all Mr John Major's idea, which means that it was by
no means unconnected with the approaching British general election. (Nothing
in Mr Major's mind at this moment could possibly be.) Nobody involved in
preparations for the meeting was unaware of the British government's
determination to hold it on or before January 31, while Britain still held
the Security Council presidency.
Another purpose of the summit was, of course, to enthrone Mr Boris Yeltsin's
Russian Federation in the seat formerly labelled 'Soviet Union'. Mr Yeltsin
performed well, by all accounts, but his physical presence cannot change the
transparent sleight of hand which has been perpetrated. The five permanent
members of the Security Council are listed by name in the UN Charter. One of
them is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Russia is not mentioned.
One might think that the disappearance of one of the five permanent members
made it necessary as well as opportune to review the Charter in general, and
the permanent membership of the Security Council in particular.
But that was not what the present permanent members wanted, and especially
not Britain and France. For if the General Assembly were to embark on the
procedure for amending the Charter, many of its members would certainly
insist on a much more radical restructuring of the Security Council. The
'change of name' approach was much more convenient, not least because it was
much less conspicuous.
Or at least it would have been, had not the Security Council called
attention to it by holding last week's summit. A specially awkward fact was
the presence of the Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. Japan is
currently serving a term as one of the 10 non-permanent members, but
considers, with good reason, that it has at least as good a claim as Britain
and France to permanent membership. Mr Miyazawa pointedly called for a
change in the Security Council's composition to reflect 'the realities of
the new era', and just in case anyone failed to get the message, his
spokesman told reporters that Japan contributed more to the UN budget than
Britain and France combined, and aimed to achieve permanent membership by
1995.
Mr Major was thus thrown on to the defensive in what was supposed to be his
hour of triumph. He fell back on the old argument, 'if it ain't broke, don't
fix it'. The Security Council was working well, he said in a BBC World
Service interview. Now was not the time to tinker with its composition.
That argument will not convince many people. When the Security Council was
not working, its composition was low on the list of most government's
priorities. But the better it works, the more power it wields, the more
people are going to care who is on it and whether they have a veto or not.
Indeed, the whole rationale for last week's meeting was that now is the time
to improve the UN's machinery, since the end of the Cold War has provided an
opportunity. Mr Major may think the composition of the Security Council is
not one of the aspects that needs improving, but many others disagree. Even
within the British and US governments it is almost a cliche to say that
Japan and Germany must somehow be induced to take on global political
responsibilities more commensurate with their economic strength. This is
hardly consistent with denying them the most responsible position in the UN
system.
It is sometimes suggested that there is a connection between permanent
membership and nuclear power status. This is historically quite inaccurate
(the existence of nuclear weapons was not yet known when the Charter was
drafted), and politically very dangerous. The last message that should be
given to Germany, Japan or any other state is that only by becoming nuclear
powers can they hope to acquire a top-table role in global security.
Germany is not pressing its claims to permanent membership with the same
vigour as Japan, and there is one strong argument against it: Europe is
already heavily over-represented on the Council, both among permanent and
non-permanent members (the latter because there is still a separate east
European voting group). The logical solution, as the Germans are well aware,
is to have a single west European permanent member - the European Union -
rather than two. It will be surprising if that argument is not pressed more
and more firmly on Britain and France by their European partners in the next
few years.
Third World countries will also put forward claims. In so far as these are
based purely on claims to represent their regions they should be resisted.
It is the function of the non-permanent members to represent their regions,
and there is no reason to suppose that other African states wish to be
permanently represented by Nigeria rather than take their own turns in
rotation. The reason for having permanent members was, and is, that certain
states by virtue of their size or power play such an important part in the
international system that it would be foolish to attempt any major
initiative without their support.
The requirement of nine affirmative votes does, in any case, give the Third
World a collective veto on any issue on which it is united. This could be
strengthened by a requirement that all regions of the world be represented
in the majority; alternatively the existing veto could be weakened by
requiring two permanent members to cast it rather than one - though China
would certainly object to this even if the US did not.
What seems certain is that the present structure will not survive any
detailed scrutiny. By organising last week's meeting and so inviting such
scrutiny, Mr Major scored something of an own goal.

Sir, I was delighted to read Mr Tomlinson's letter ('Wasting time on

FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Electoral hurdle not designed to exclude extremist
parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof PETER PULZER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is rather misleading of John Willman and Andrew Adonis to suggest in
their otherwise admirable guide to electoral systems ('Ballot box
conundrum', February 3) that 5-per-cent hurdles, as in Germany, and similar
entrance barriers under proportional representation are primarily designed
to exclude extremist parties.
There is no relationship between the size of a party and its place in the
ideological spectrum. A minor party can be centrist (as in Italy or Denmark)
and an extremist party can be large.
The purpose of such barriers is solely to reduce the number of parties in a
parliament. No 5-per-cent clause would have kept the National Socialists out
of the parliaments of the Weimar Republic. But it might have helped to
stabilise parliamentary government and thereby made extremist parties less
attractive.

<TEXT>
Sir, Anthony Harris's contribution ('Beware of an absence of hindsight',
February 3) raises an interesting investment opportunity. If the long run is
assumed to be a series of short runs, then 'active' or short-term investors
outperform all the time. Furthermore, the superbly profitable short-termists
must be winning at the expense of someone, presumably the lazy
fundamentalists, who, Mr Harris claims to the contrary, often do better in
the long run. What we are not told is, how often?
Nor can we ignore the importance of transaction costs. In the real world
these will always work against the short-termists while increasing the
performance of the lazy fundamentalists. If all this is too confusing,
remember - we are all dead in the long run.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Personal View: Ministers must get a grip on reality of
British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something about railways that brings out the worst in British
politics. The current debate about privatising British Rail has proceeded in
the privacy of a Cabinet committee, with the public informed only through
leaks by ministers to the lobby correspondents. Their reports are
disturbing. The ambitions of different ministers appear incompatible - to
recreate the four pre-war companies; to separate ownership of tracks and
trains to permit competition; to franchise operators of commuter services;
and to privatise the Inter-City network as a single unit, while keeping the
rest of BR in public ownership. They suggest that ministers are out of touch
with reality.
If this debate had taken place in public, perhaps on the basis of a green
paper, ministers would not have been limited to the advice of their own
staff - who, outside the Department of Transport, have little knowledge of
railways - and the weaknesses of some of the proposals being discussed could
have been exposed.
Four facts should be in ministers' minds when discussing the privatisation
of BR:
the railway system ranges from the modestly profitable Inter-City services,
through the modestly unprofitable London commuter services, to the regional
services which cover about a third of their costs;
their management is weak, and there is no obvious surplus of talent in other
transport industries with which to strengthen it;
operating a railway involves a lot of people, many with specialised skills;
British railways cannot use foreign rolling stock, so their equipment has to
be specially made, and there is no effective second-hand market.
Any entrant would have to take over some of BR's employees, and ensure their
co-operation if trains were to be run efficiently and safely. It would also
have to use BR's existing rolling stock if it was to operate services soon.
Once new equipment had been delivered, the buyer would have to reckon that
its life was at least 25 years, and that it could be sold only to another UK
operator of similar services. The cost of entering the railway business is
high, therefore, partly because leaving it would entail heavy losses. The
cost and potential losses would be even higher if the entrant had to buy and
maintain the track, which also has no other uses.
Railways are unlike the bus and airline industries, in which equipment can
be bought and sold in the second-hand market. Rolling stock, therefore, does
not provide adequate security for borrowing; nor can it support commercial
leasing operations, which are now common for aircraft.
The high cost of entering the railway business implies that the option of
separating ownership of track and trains could fail for lack of entrants.
Potential operators might want a monopoly on a route before committing
themselves; and be unwilling to pay the full cost of the tracks they would
use.
Potential buyers of the infrastructure would in turn be uncertain about the
income from the track. And, because only BR runs train services at present,
potential entrants to the railway business - unlike entrants to the bus or
airline industries - are likely to be managed by newcomers to the industry.
The risk of misjudgment leading to failure is therefore increased.
Similar problems would arise if the government sought to franchise the
operation of unprofitable services, while retaining ownership of the track
they used. There would be few if any bidders for such franchises unless the
subsidy guaranteed a commercial return, the existing trains could be leased
from the government, or the franchises were long enough to permit
investments in new rolling stock to be depreciated. In one case, the
franchisee could not improve services significantly; in the other, the
franchise system would create little competitive pressure. In all cases, the
subsidy is liable to rise. It would be a remarkable act of faith to expect
this scenario to improve the quality of commuter services.
Splitting BR into four regional companies would also create difficulties,
whether or not a separate company was to operate Inter-City services and to
own its tracks. The profitability of the four would vary with the proportion
of commuter or regional services provided; if Inter-City was sold
separately, they would all be unprofitable. There would also be conflicts
between companies where services crossed regional boundaries.
If ministers were realists, they would accept that British Rail can best be
privatised as a single unit. The efficiency of the subsidised and Inter-City
services could be improved by a change of ownership that reduced direct
political intervention and removed investment from the constraint of the
public sector borrowing requirement. Efficiency could be further improved if
local authorities provided the subsidy, and regulated fares and quality:
they could then strike a contract with the privatised railway company that
specified services, fares and subsidy, which should give some of the
benefits claimed for franchising such services. Privatising Inter-City alone
would imply that the subsidised services would remain in public ownership
indefinitely, if efforts to franchise them are unsuccessful, as seems
likely.
The possibility of competition should be regarded as a subject for
experiment. European Community rules will ensure that other companies can in
future run trains on BR's tracks if they so desire; and the possibility of
franchising subsidised services could be tried on a small scale. But the
main competition for rail services will always come from cars, buses and
aircraft. In their pursuit of the will-o'-the-wisp of direct competition
between railway operators, ministers seem to have forgotten that politics is
the art of the possible. They should return to the simple solution of
privatising BR as one unit.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: UK regulatory practice a poor example
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW GROSSMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The past year has seen a number of regulatory disasters in the
financial sector that do not speak well of British regulatory policy: BCCI,
Lloyd's, and the Maxwell pension funds, to name but three. It makes a
striking contrast that, in the US, regulatory systems intervened (or, in the
case of Lloyd's, are in the process of intervening through legal and
administrative action in New York and in Washington) to prevent and to
remedy the worst of the abuses.
One has to recall the Thalidomide tragedy, where, in its rush for profits,
Distillers was allowed to market in the UK an unsafe drug while, in the US,
sale of the drug remained blocked due to safety concerns on the part of the
regulators.
BCCI's directors, of course, did evade controls to the degree that they
succeeded in buying control of two American banks. Yet American deposits
were not put at risk; and, had they been lost, Federal deposit insurance
would have protected depositors up to the realistic level of Dollars
100,000. If Maxwell tried to get at the Daily News pension fund he did not
succeed; and even if he had, the Federal pension guaranty fund would have
protected pension holders.
Is America a less competitive nation because of these regulatory controls
and investor and consumer protection? I doubt it. It is simply that in
Britain there is a clubby atmosphere in which certain arrogant individuals
and groups have influence in government and in parliament and are left do
pretty much what they want. The problem is compounded by libel laws that
stifle investigative journalism. Due diligence on the part of individuals
could not reveal the risks and misdeeds: it must be the role of the state to
level the playing field and in so doing to try to prevent ruined lives and
personal tragedy on such a scale.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: 'Free' energy market is in reality controlled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN STERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'A single EC energy market' (January 31), notes that only
the UK remotely approaches the kind of free-market regime envisaged in
Brussels, yet misses an important point about the British experience in
creating 'free markets' for energy, particularly natural gas.
The manner of last week's decision to allow gas imports makes it abundantly
clear that the government has determined, and will continue to determine,
the parties allowed to import, the volumes they are allowed to import, and
the means by which they are allowed to import.
As Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, noted in your columns (Monday
Interview, December 16 1991): 'The thing I want to dispel is that we believe
you can just leave these things to the free market. You can't. You have to
create a free market if you want one.'
Holding the UK up as a shining example simply reinforces energy industry
suspicions that the single energy market is a means by which Brussels
politicians and bureaucrats hope to gain control of important commercial
decisions in the name of creating free markets.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Yeltsin's perilous balancing act: Russia's economic reforms
face near-certain failure if the west refuses to provide massive financial
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has spent three days in his ravaged
country between returning from a visit to the US, Canada and the UK on
Sunday and leaving for a state visit to France today. This is not a jaunt:
he has the most urgent need to convince the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries that he must get financial support, and very soon, if
his government's economic reform is not to fail.
It is close to it. Already, a month after the price liberalisation which was
the dramatic overture to reform, it is being written off by parliament,
industrial barons, distinguished economists and, of course, a suffering
people whom polls show to be losing faith in the success of any change.
The 'patriotic', or hard-line nationalist, forces are having a convention in
Moscow this weekend to drum up reaction - and are likely to be addressed by
Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president. Neo-communists plan a
march on the White House, the Russian parliament, on Sunday: democrats plan
a counter-march. It is reminiscent of the scenes a year ago, when the
streets of Moscow were the arena for the competing partisans of the Soviet
and the Russian governments: now, it is the Russian government on the
defensive.
Can the government keep reform going? More, can the states of the former
Soviet Union both institute radical change and find their way to a new
nationhood - without so increasing tensions that they are driven to find a
release for them in violent disputes, even wars? All are now faced with what
has emerged as the post-communist dilemma: that of making long-overdue, but
unpopular, shifts in the pattern of their economies while seeking to retain
a democratic legitimacy which distinguishes them most sharply from their
communist predecessors.
In a speech in Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Lech Walesa, the Polish president,
told the west it had given him insufficient help and Polish democracy was
now in danger: the former Soviet Union faces the west, now, with a much more
urgent plea.
This is only in part because these states are more numerous, impoverished
and ruined even than Poland was. More seriously, it is because there are two
crises intersecting here: the economic collapse from which all the states
are suffering: and the national crises in which they are all struggling to
assert individuality and consciousness within the shattered framework of a
common economic space from which they all want to escape but which they are
still doomed to share.
The resources for reform are almost completely lacking. All the republics
are running deficit budgets, and none has hard currency in any significant
quantities - while that which there is, is held by enterprises, often
abroad, to keep it out of the voracious hands of the desperate states. The
Russian Bank for Foreign Affairs, for example, appropriated all its Soviet
customers' hard currency to pay back debts - a striking example of the
authorities' reflex belief that there is no such thing as private property.
Apart from oil, gas, timber, diamonds and gold, they produce little that
anyone else wants. Production and productivity are both falling fast - the
former by 20 per cent over the year, and continuing. Mr Yegor Gaidar,
Russia's deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, has cut the
budget allocation for military hardware to 15 per cent of its last year's
level, which saves billions. But the budget gives only Rbs10bn to military
conversion which, as Mr Vitaly Vitebsky, a Russian parliamentary deputy and
member of the commission on the budget, said, 'is not enough to pay off
those made redundant by the closure of defence plants'. Ominously, this will
mean that these plants are now scavenging abroad for military orders - from
anywhere, for anything.
The other republics fare no better: most will do worse, even if their food
situation is presently easier. The poorer republics, with a primitive
financial infrastructure, will have as many difficulties in collecting
budget and hard currency revenues as Russia has. No enterprise which can
avoid them pays taxes, nor sells the obligatory 40 per cent of hard currency
earnings to the state for half the normal rate (at 110 roubles to the
dollar, itself now well below the market rate). Everyone who can asks for
hard currency payment to be made into foreign bank accounts (illegal, but
quite openly practised).
There are no, or very few, resources: there may also be insufficient will.
To be sure, almost every leader, every budding entrepreneur, every
re-painted communist, now talks of the need for radical, pro-market,
pro-democratic reform, and of his commitment to it. But much of this is
rhetoric: the expression of a desire for a better life without the
determination to achieve it by leaving the familiar, if threadbare, folds of
the old.
Among the constellation of top Russian leaders - Mr Yeltsin, Mr Rutskoi, and
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the parliament - not one is other
than, on his own account, passionately committed to the most radical reform.
Yet in the past few days, both Mr Rutskoi and Mr Khasbulatov have called not
just for an immediate cessation of the present version of reform but for a
return to some elements of the state system.
In this they have been joined by a legion of economists - Dr Nikolai
Petrakov, Mr Abel Aganbegyan, Mr Pavel Bunich and others - who have gravely
criticised the Russian team of 'young (read: naive) economists'. These men
have all in the past formulated reform plans, for the then Soviet
government, none of which were carried out: they now see a Russian
government carry out reform without any plan and are calling a halt.
But the problem of political will lies deeper. Reform engages only one
element of the overall political project of Russia and the other states, and
often the less important one. The more important element is the building of
the nation. It is this which engages the real passion and energies: this
which is the force which fires up the pulse of the politicians and makes
their otherwise terrible job attractive.
Nationalism is already firing up the Caucasus, where the Azerbaijanis and
the Armenians struggle over Nagorno Karabakh and the Georgians have taken
only a temporary lull in fighting with the minorities on their territories.
Nationalism is setting Russians and other minorities against the
Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians in the Baltics, and is even driving the
Russian autonomous republics - Chechen-Ingushetia, Tatarstan and Yakutia -
towards declarations of an independence quite impossible to contemplate if
Russia is to be the unified state Mr Yeltsin has said it will be.
At a recent session of the Russian Constitutional Commission, charged with
producing Russia's first democratic constitution, Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, its
secretary, said there was now a 'spiral of confrontation in the form of a
war of constitutions' between Russia and some of its subordinate units.
But the most serious issue is that between the Ukraine and Russia, the two
great Slav states which were the fulcrum of the Soviet Union and before
that, of the Tsarist empire. By tomorrow, the Russian parliament should
decide whether or not to endorse the view of its Committee on International
Affairs of January 14, that the assignment of the Crimea from Russian to
Ukrainian jurisdiction in 1954 was illegal, and is thus void: it if does so,
it ratchets up the developing quarrel between the two states to critical
levels.
Last month, Mr Vladimir Lukin, just now appointed the Russian ambassador to
the US and then chairman of the International Affairs Committee, suggested
in a memo to Mr Yeltsin that if the Ukraine did not agree to Russian control
of the disputed Black Sea fleet (whose bases are in the Crimea), then Russia
should use the expected parliamentary decision against the legality of the
Crimean transfer as a stick with which to beat the Ukrainians into line, and
to 'activate a Crimean independence movement' among the majority Russian
population there. In short, Mr Lukin, a noted liberal reformer, was
proposing the time-honoured and dangerous option of one state using 'its'
minority in another's territory to force it to submission.
Mr Lukin made clear that his aim was to guard the administration's flanks
against ultra-nationalists: he wrote that 'a submissive (to the Ukraine)
stand will play into the hands of the right-wing nationalist group in
Russia, whereas a firm one will raise a broad wave of support for the
Russian administration'.
This is no chimera. The ultra-nationalists gather this weekend, with Mr
Rutskoi in attendance: the streets of Moscow may become a battleground. If
even figures like Mr Lukin see the need to harden the democratic stance
against the nationalist threat, then reform is indeed in danger.
On one side, the Russian and the other states' economies face a collapse
from hyperinflation snd lack of support: on the other, the nations inside
and outside of Russia lock themselves into hostilities in which no
compromise is possible. Even an analysis done by economists friendly to the
government, from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs,
concludes that the most likely outcome is that 'macroeconomic stablisation
will fail in the coming months': a pessimistic outcome, though more likely
than the optimistic variant, sees the republics at war.
The rapidly developing and intersecting economic and national crises (added
to them the subsidiary but potentially more frightening matters of control
of civil and military nuclear resources) - leave foreign states, and
especially the Group of Seven, with a harsh set of options. One is, in
brief, to note what is happening, pray that the worsening flow of events
will not continue in the direction logic appears to dictate, and hope that
the IMF can stop collapse.
The other is to be drawn, ineluctably, further and deeper into the Former
Soviet Mess - an unattractive position for most foreign governments, but one
now being urged upon them by advisers, policy thinkers and at least some
within the IMF and the World Bank. The model, often mentioned, is the
Marshall Plan of 1947, under which US aid was channelled to the shattered
states of western Europe: but the model is only partly useful, since these
states were all market economies, all had experienced (in the market and
democracy) elites and a good deal of serviceable infrastructure.
Given the monetary tools, the Europeans could get on with the job of
reconstruction. This does not appear to be so for the former Soviet Union -
where, with the partial exception of Moscow, the layer of expertise, of
understanding and of efficiency at government and enterprise level is as
thin as tissue and as easily broken.
The issue is now, squarely, before the western states. The demand
articulated by Mr Yeltsin and his government is for immediate support: a
fund to stabilise the rouble, of about Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn: a further
amount, of about the same, to provide for imports of badly needed food and
medicine. And this to be provided in the next month or at most two - long
before the application Russia is now making to join the IMF will have been
processed. Beyond Russia's demands are those of the other states, smaller
but no less needy. It is the Demand - some would say the Hold-Up - of the
Century: the plea for huge sums, or the consequences will be disintegration,
conflict, a huge Yugoslavia. Mr Yeltsin flies off again today to discover if
the west will pay up.

The name of Mussolini has returned to Italian politics with the announcement
that Il Duce's 28-year-old granddaughter, Alessandra, is to stand for
parliament. She has been adopted as a candidate in the April elections for
the Naples-Caserta region by the neo-Fascist party, MSI.
When asked why she had chosen the MSI, which regards itself as the
torch-bearer of Mussolini's national socialist ideals, Alessandra replied:
'What else would you expect?'
A former medical student turned actress, she is the daughter of Mussolini's
jazz musician son, Romano, who married the actress Sophia Loren's sister,
Maria Scicolone. The combination of her grandfather's name and her mother's
strong Neapolitan connections has delighted the MSI. According to the
party's local branch, she has not been politically active before. 'But now
she wants to get involved seriously: like a real Mussolini.'

It's good to hear that Lord Shawcross - 90 yesterday - still regularly turns

desks. Hermann Abs (90) also checks in occasionally at Deutsche Bank.
Recent events at conglomerates like Hanson and Lonrho have highlighted
understandable institutional concerns about who is going to succeed some of
Britain's ageing captains of industry. Indeed, some big pension funds like
Postel now have a policy of opposing the re-election of any director who is
70 or over. However, this seems far too mechanistic, especially since some
of the world's best-run financial institutions feel the need to listen to
their elder statesmen.
Indeed, Observer hears that National Bank of Kuwait has a director - Khaled
Al-Hamad - who is in his 110th year. . . .

What price a woman's prerogative to change her mind? A Japanese court has
been asked to supply an answer in the case of an unnamed sewing-factory
worker, aged 50, who exercised the prerogative at an employees' party.
Offered a cup of sake by the chief of the company's closed-shop union, she
refused, saying she had a cold. Later he saw her accept a drink from another
man, and demanded an apology. When she refused he expelled her from the
union, which meant she lost her job.
'For the Japanese the offer of something like a drink is very important,'
says her lawyer in her unfair-dismissal claim filed with Fukuoka district
court. 'Nevertheless, this union leader was very unreasonable to women
workers, including this woman.'
Quite.

If Kung Fu movie king Sir Run Run Shaw can get an honorary degree from

Oxford University insists that its reason for conferring the honorary degree

he has pledged Pounds 10m for an Institute of Chinese Studies. Rather it is
rewarding him for his service to the community - mainly charitable - already

Quite so. But Observer wonders whether the university would rethink its

It seems Yassir Arafat, who had always claimed the Palestinian revolution
was 'my woman, my family, my life', has secretly wed his youthful secretary
Suha Tawil, in Tunis.
While Middle East capitals have been buzzing with rumours that the
62-year-old had succumbed to marriage at last, it was left to the bride's
mother, Raymonda, to speak first. 'I cannot deny it, but it is Chairman
Arafat's right to declare it officially,' she said. More Delphicly, one of
Arafat's top aides told Observer's man on the spot that it was not something
he had discussed with his boss, since he did not concern himself with
Arafat's internal affairs.
Nevertheless, Arafat's private life has long been the subject of all manner
of speculation - one recent rumour had him married to his Egyptian
biographer Rashida Mahran.
The bride is certainly well connected; she is 28 and comes from a prominent
Christian family on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Her journalist mum is a
well known Palestinian activist, and longstanding friend of Arafat's; her
brother headed the Palestine Information Office in Washington.
Suha Tawil is said to have converted to Islam. Arafat himself is a Sunni
Moslem. Palestinian friends are speculating that the peripatetic Arafat, who
has been spending more time in Tunis, may have decided to slow down.
In any case, fewer countries welcome his visits since he supported Iraq in
the Gulf war.

Richard Crane's Gulf War play mounts a very different offensive to Trevor
Griffiths' The Gulf Between Us at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. Whereas
Griffiths has forged metaphors from recognisable events, Crane launches an
all-out assault on that part of us that might still try to justify this, or
any war.
Baggage and Bombshells is crude in its language and and expressionistic in
its imagery, but it shares with Griffiths' play an urge to mythologise
history. Whereas Griffiths' does this ironically, through O'Toole, gilder,
story-teller and down-beat omniscient, Crane gives us a seething,
shaven-headed woman, naked beneath a sheathlike bandage, who introduces
herself as the 'abominable blood-drinking rich bitch whore of Babylon.'
Baggage and bombshells are the words used respectively by soldiers for wives
and prostitutes; the subject of war, in Crane's account, is polarised
between the two of them. Vera (Jacqueline Rudelle) is the simpering
romanticiser of battle heroism, who spouts dewy eyed cliches before being
rudely awakened by the accidental death of her husband; Joan (Kat Davison)
is the camp groupie, fast and faithless, who embodies the raw sexiness of
bloodshed.
Although this is a show performed by three women, it rather disconcertingly
seems not to be about women at all, except as projections of the warrior
mind: neither Vera nor Joan have much reality beyond the sort of fictions
created for the boys at the front by Vera Lynn or your average girlie
calendar.
Fielding her best toothpaste grin and a diction that seems to be trapped in
an inter-war time-warp, Vera talks of the stories she has constructed to
glamorise her husband for her children ('I tell them daddy might have to lay
down his life'). Donning a black mask, Joan becomes a precision bomber,
echoing those Vietnam posters of girl astride heavy artillery, while
presumably making a point about more recent warfare. The imagery is so
overloaded that it becomes confused and finally unhelpful.
Johanna Benyon's whore of Babylon makes a striking contrast both visually
and conceptually: she swears like a trooper, uncomfortably, even
offensively; she is contemptuously androgynous, and yet her face is hunted,
petrified. She is the most powerful element of a show that explodes in a
blinding flash of heat and dust, leaving one rubbing one's eyes and
wondering what on earth it was all about.

five per cent of boys and even fewer girls are doing enough exercise to
develop healthy hearts (9.00 C4).

THE MOSCOW ART THEATRE LETTERS edited by Jean Benedetti Methuen Drama Pounds
20, 377 pages
The idea to found the Moscow Art Theatre, for decades a legend, was
conceived a few years before the First World War by Konstantin Stanislavsky
and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko during a lunch-time meeting in a Moscow
restaurant which lasted for 18 hours.
The two men understood that the fate of the as yet unborn theatre depended
entirely on their unshakeable friendship. Whether they could maintain it
must have seemed an open question to both of them, although their faith in
the realisation of the dream did not wane. As for the deep differences
between Stanislavsky, the theatre man through and through, and
Nemirovich-Danchencko, the literary intellectual, both believed they would
avoid all dangers by a division of power: Nemirovich's view would decide all
literary questions, while disagreements on questions of production would be
decided by Stanislavsky.
During the next 40 odd years another Moscow Art Theatre followed the first,
and then a third one, RAPP. The language began to be dominated by such
bundles of capital letters (RAPP stood for 'Revolutionary Association of
Proletarian Writers), but Anton Chekhov, whose conversion to the theatre was
one of the new venture's first achievements, was still part of the
repertoire, next to his friends Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov, the author
of the White Guard. But Chekhov's plays The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and
The Cherry Orchard remained through all the changes of time and temper the
unforgettable, at any rate still vibrantly living, dramatic treasure of
those years.
What mattered most was the growing tension between Stanislavsky and
Nemirovich-Danchenko, the bond between them being rubbed thinner and thinner
until at last Nemirovich-Danchenko wrote to Stanislavsky in 1938 that 'a
historian, some theatrical Nestor, not without humour, will say 'Can you
imagine: These people, they themselves, destroyed this relationship, fought
over it, and history will find this a complete mystery.''
So massive a collection of letters chronicling this story could have been
dull; but of the applause the Moscow Art Theatre has achieved, some part
will be shared by Jean Benedetti's excellent book, which contains much of
the correspondence among those principally concerned.
From the beginning the Theatre broke with the then dominant style of
pedantic naturalism and tried anything and everything that promised good
theatre: Russian playwrights, of course, from Gogol to Maxim Gorky and
Bulgakov. But ever more foreign authors were performed: Ibsen (a political
satire like Pillars of Society was a very great success, but Ibsen's
dramatic poem Brand no less so) and, once the Theatre had moved so far from
naturalism, Shakespeare. In 1903 Nemirovich produced Julius Caesar, with
Stanislavsky as Brutus.
A few years later Stanislavsky set up a small company of young actors under
Vsevolod Meyerhold's leadership and began to try out new rehearsal
techniques, including improvisation. Under this new persuasion acting came
first, not literature. Nemirovich wrote to Stanislavsky: 'under the
influence of Meyerhold's absurd blabbering about the need to rehearse as the
spirit moves, you suddenly felt the desire to exploit a method you claim to
have been dreaming about for a long time. In fact, you want to get rid of
reason]'
That exchange of letters between the two was in 1905. This is a letter
written in the autumn of 1935 from Stanislavsky to Stalin: 'Our theatre can
and must be the most advanced theatre in the country in its representation
of the fullness of the inner spiritual life of working people who have been
made masters of the soil. The struggle is hard and help is needed if the two
chiefs, despite our declining age and the tangled state of our 40 years old
relationship are to lead the theatre out of its present condition . . .
Knowing your affection for the theatre I hope you will help'.
Indeed, Stalin 'helped.'
For Party fanatics, Stalin's 'help' meant that somebody like Meyerhold, whom
Stanislavsky had called his artistic successor, could at long last be hunted
down. He was accused of the heresy of 'formalism,' the most damnable sin
under the sacred doctrine of Socialist Realism. On January 8 1938
Meyerhold's theatre was closed down, while Stanislavsky, very close to the
end of his life, continued to work with Meyerhold in his own home. But
Meyerhold was arrested and sent to a punishment camp in Siberia where he
died; to this day it has never been made public exactly how. A few weeks
after his disappearance his wife, the actress Sinaida Raich, was murdered in
their flat.
In 1974, a major exhibition in Moscow celebrated Meyerhold's achievements:
it showed in countless photographs Moscow's theatre world of the 1920s and
brought out Meyerhold's revolutionary influence, above all in his great
Agit-prop productions. It was, in fact, Meyerhold who put himself
immediately at the disposal of the government after the October revolution.
He played a leading role from 1920 to 1938, going well beyond what
Stanislavsky had taught him. Bertold Brecht's writings are to some extent
inspired by his admiration of Meyerhold.
No doubt, the exhibition was meant to be a kind of rehabilitation. If so it
lacked the essential admission. Not one word referred to how Meyerhold had
been dispatched in Siberia, nor why and how his wife was killed a few weeks
later.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Arts: Othello - Everyman, Liverpool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Everyman, Liverpool has taken a bold course with Shakespeare's Othello.
It has been pared down to the basics, the text cut to just under two and a
half hours on stage. The result is a fine, swift, muscular production which
brings out the play's essentials at surprisingly little discount to the full
(three and half hour) version.
The set and design are apt for this incisive performance: just bare boards,
white curtains, and a few effects to feed the orderliness of Iago's mind and
the bedlam of Othello's. Warm pools of light in the blue gloom, and a
wonderful improvised storm are the extent of the technical additions. The
setting is the Italo-Turkish war of 1911-12, the costumes militaire, and the
ethos martial.
The danger with cutting Othello, a play which Dr Johnson thought 'a drama of
the most exact and scrupulous regularity', is that Othello's credulousness
scarcely has time to meet Iago's guile before the conclusion. At times here
the action skims the surface of Shakespeare's text, uprooting the characters
from their own language: so Othello's 'The pity of it' or Iago's 'put money
in thy purse' are discoveries rather than reminders.
However, at the price of removing the suspense, John Doyle's stern direction
follows a single path of energy into the play; the Iago-Othello
relationship. The whole action turns on the words, 'Ha, I like not that' as
Iago casually traps Othello (he speaks of Cassio's leaving Desdemona). All
the elements of the play fuse around that moment, and it is brilliantly
delivered and pursued.
Ray Fearon's Othello is welter-weight rather than heavyweight, ardent in
affection and obdurate in revenge, but never calamitously in love with
Desdemona. Opposite him, Gillian Kearney plays a sweet, biddable Desdemona.
Between them, Tony Turner as Iago conjures a pasty-faced and gimlet-eyed
malice which takes him to the final scene as a believable villain. His
interchanges with Fearon and his frank soliloquies fuel the production's
energies; his treatment of Emilia (well played by Joanne Stoner), her virtue
loosely worn but not yet cast aside, is all cruelty.
As Trevor Nunn's rigorous 1990 RSC production showed, Shakespeare offers few
compensations in Othello. The intellectual satisfactions of the two equally
exhausting plays he wrote before and after (Troilus &amp; Cressida and Timon of
Athens) redeem the violence of their worlds. In Othello however, Iago
removes all palliatives, and this Everyman production leaves one thinking,
of Othello's jealousy, 'All this the world well knows, yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Management: Sun sets on share scandal - Stefan Wagstyl
reports on Nomura's efforts to regain its reputation / Japanese securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In New York or London, the combination of the worst stock market scandal in
memory and a long bear market might drive even a strong securities company
into bankruptcy.
But in Tokyo, neither last year's scandals involving links with gangsters
and secret compensation payments to clients, nor a 90 per cent decline in
stock exchange turnover, is likely to remove Nomura Securities from its top
position in the securities industry.
The mood at the company's headquarters has changed since last summer when
Nomura staff witnessed in horror the resignations of Yoshihisa Tabuchi and
Setsuya Tabuchi - the two men who had headed the group for 12 years. They
quit over links with a gangster organisation, over compensation payments
made to favoured clients and allegations of stock manipulation.
Today there is a quiet determination to make sure the company pulls through
the bear market and recovers its reputation. As Atsushi Saito, an executive
managing director, says: 'We have no intention of making money at the
expense of other brokers but Nomura will be the least damaged by the bear
market'.
The company is going through a management reform designed to increase
efficiency, improve contact with customers and erase the memory of the
scandal. Executives want to rid the company of the reputation for arrogance
which dogged it through the 1980s. Nomura used to move like a bulldozer in
the market, with headquarters instructing salesmen across Japan which stock
to promote and the salesmen pushing the shares on to their hapless clients.
Saito and his colleagues want the new Nomura to be more responsive to
customers' needs.
There is little doubting the commitment to reform at the top. But it is a
moot point how fast the company can remould the attitudes of staff in its
domestic branch network. As one foreign broker in Tokyo says: 'What
internationally-minded people like Saito think is one thing. What the branch
managers think is another'.
The root of the company's self-confidence is its formidable financial power.
In the year to the end of March 1991, it made Y142bn (Pounds 639.63m) net
from interest and dividends on its own cash and securities holdings -
equivalent to half the pre-tax profit and enough to cover the wages bill for
10 months. In the six months to September, the period when last year's
scandal was at its height, Nomura made a pre-tax profit of Y39.7bn - down 64
per cent compared with the same period in 1990 but still almost twice as
much as second-ranked Daiwa Securities.
Certainly Nomura is hurt by the fall in business on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, where turnover last month was less than one tenth of the average
in 1988. Like other brokers, Nomura is cutting costs, including its lavish
entertainment budget. More significantly, Nomura is reducing the number of
new graduates it hires from 1,525 in 1991 to 1,000 this year and probably
fewer still in 1993.
But cutting the intake is different from dismissing existing staff - a last
resort for any large Japanese company. As a result, Nomura and other big
brokers are able to rely on the loyalty of the workforce, even in times of
crisis. Under the regime of lifetime employment, from other groups. So the
managers of a troubled group have no choice but to redouble their efforts to
avoid disaster.
Moreover, tight regulation has saved Japanese brokers from the worst effects
of the bear market. The finance ministry frowns on brokers trading on their
own accounts, which has partly shielded them from big investment losses.
The finance ministry is as much a guardian of financial companies as their
regulator. So even though officials handed out penalties to Nomura for its
involvement in the scandals, there was no possibility that the punishments
would break the company.
Nevertheless, the scandal has forced Nomura to acknowledge a need for
reform. Top of the list is winning back the trust of private investors who
account for some 50 per cent of brokerage income.
The most important departure is training staff to tailor products to
clients' needs. The risks of securities investments will be clearly
explained to clients: 'health warnings' have already been printed on
promotional pamphlets.
This is a tacit acknowledgement that the company's bull market tactics of
foisting high-risk instruments, such as equity warrants, onto private
investors have back-fired.
At the same time, branches are being given more freedom to decide which
products to sell. Yasuyuki Idotsuji, the manager of the Ginza branch in
central Tokyo, says: 'In the past, head office told us which products to
sell. Now we decide.'
Idotsuji says company training sessions once consisted only of lessons in
'how to sell more'. Now sales staff are being taught how to collate and
interpret information. Nomura has also reformed its staff assessment system
to put success in reaching sales targets and more on their knowledge of
products and ability to train staff.
Greater freedom for branches is being coupled to a transformation of the
Nomura's Research Institute. According to Saito, NRI researchers have in the
past produced work which is overly academic - long analyses of issues with
little relevance to picking stocks.
Nomura is anxious to show that it is already handling investment information
more openly than before. For example, the company's forecasts, once famous
for their permanent optimism, are this year notably pessimistic. Officials
are free to voice the most damning opinions.
Cynics say these reforms are superficial: it suits Nomura to trumpet their
importance to create an impression of change.
But, say critics, the moment share prices recover and the customers return,
the temptation to return to the old ways will be strong.
The company's transformation is certainly incomplete. Hideo Sakamaki, the
new president, was the close lieutenant of the disgraced Yoshihisa Tabuchi.
Also, even though both Tabuchis have lost their board seats, they still have
honorary posts and their own offices.
Moreover, Nomura, along with other Japanese brokers, has announced reforms
in the past which achieved less than had been promised. For example, in
1988, the group said it was building Chinese walls - internal barriers - to
divide its underwriting business from broking, in order to prevent brokers
using inside information gained from the underwriters. But last year's
scandal showed close co-operation between the two areas.
Similarly, finance ministry officials have said that the brokers are
dragging their feet over the elimination of discretionary accounts which
they manage on clients' behalf. Such accounts are open to abuse by brokers
who might want to generate commission rather than maximise a client's
returns.
Nevertheless, it would be wrong to minimise the extent of change at Nomura,
not least because reform is in the company's own interest. The old system of
generating commission by promoting a small selection of stocks very
intensely worked in a bull market. In a bear market, it is in the broker's
own interest to market other products more aggressively, even if these
generate less commission.
Moreover, the steady advance of financial deregulation in Tokyo will
gradually give retail investors, as well as institutions, more choice. The
finance ministry is planning to introduce next year legal reforms which will
greatly increase the range of products which can be sold as securities.
At the same time, the ministry is considering the reduction of stock
exchange commission charges and their possible elimination. Even if the
securities industry succeeded in postponing cuts for a while, it accepts
that equity broking will never be as lucrative as it was in the 1980s.
Diversification is essential.
Executives at all the larger brokerages acknowledge the force of these
arguments. But Nomura alone has the resources to meet the challenge head on.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: The hiccs come out of the
sticks - A new breed of consumer is forcing retailers to produce less
packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers can play a decisive role in the environmental debate, standing as
they do between the consumer and the supplier. Shops are often the first
port of call for enraged environmentalists wishing to challenge industrial
practices such as unsound tuna fishing, pulp bleaching or excess packaging.
And retailers in turn exercise enormous influence over their suppliers by
translating these consumer pressures into buying orders.
Last week, several hundred food retailers and their suppliers gathered in
Dusseldorf at a conference organised by CIES, an international trade
association for the food industry, to discuss such concerns and to fathom
the impulses of the green consumer.
The choice of Germany for the venue was significant since the country's
stringent packaging regulations and strident environmental groups have given
the green debate impetus. What concerns Germany today will doubtless affect
other countries tomorrow.
The most pressing concern for many retailers was the introduction last June
of Germany's contentious ordinance on the avoidance of packaging waste, the
Verpackungsverordnung or VerpackVo, which some have suggested could become
the blueprint for the European Commission packaging directive due to be
published this year.
The VerpackVo's architect, Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister,
attended the conference and artfully defended the thrust of his legislation
which was based on the premise: 'Do not let packaging go to waste'.
German industry has, however, largely forestalled the threat of a
'take-back' provision for packaging - outlined in the VerpackVo - by
promising to assume responsibility for the management of packaging waste.
More than 400 companies are creating a mechanism, known as the Duales System
Deutschland, to recover waste from households and reuse the raw materials.
Consumers are encouraged to return glass bottles and waste paper to
recycling bins but are also asked to separate other recyclable materials,
such as plastics, composite packaging and metals, and place them outside
their houses in yellow bins and bags provided by the DSD. These are
collected every month.
The DSD aims to find markets for these materials and recycle increasing
proportions of packaging waste. It finances the scheme by licensing a green
dot which manufacturers can attach to their goods.
The scheme attracted criticism at the conference from European companies
which feared the DSD could act as a form of protectionism by excluding
foreign products which did not carry the green dot.
Although Topfer distanced himself from responsibility for the DSD, he did
accept that it had thrown up problems. 'We have 600,000 tonnes of plastic
packaging in Germany with the recycling quota at about 50,000 tonnes. The
remainder is going into dumps or going to incineration plants,' he said.
But Topfer stressed that the DSD was an experimental system that would
encourage further innovations and improvements. 'It is a system that is less
dirigiste than others and leaves the rules of a free market economy in
place,' he said.
Many retailers remained less than convinced by his arguments but the message
was nevertheless driven home that unless industry acted to reduce, recover
and re-use packaging governments would move to do so for them.
'We must prevent politicians coming up with solutions faster than we do
because they will always be worse than market solutions,' said Hans
Christian Bremme, managing director of Tengelmann, the giant German
retailing group.
The DSD will perhaps ultimately succeed or fail on the commitment of
consumers and it was the mysterious workings of the shopper's mind that
pre-occupied many retailers for much of the conference.
Patrick Carson, vice president of Loblaws supermarkets in Canada, argued
that after the hippies and yuppies, retailers now had to deal with a new
social phenomenon: the hiccs, or higher inner-conscience consumers. Such
consumers have different priorities from previous generations of shoppers
and are concerned about the consequences of their consumption. 'They will
leave the tin of tuna - that has been caught by means of a drift net which
kills dolphins - on the shelves and they will not come back to your store,'
he said.
The hicc appears to be a global phenomenon, especially among the younger
generations. According to Toshifumi Yamashita, assistant chief executive of
the Tokyo Consumers Co-operative, 75 per cent of Japanese consumers said
they were interested in environmental activities and an astonishing 27 per
cent claimed to be involved in some form of voluntary activity to protect
the environment.
Although this new breed of consumer poses a challenge to retailers'
practices, it also represents a great business opportunity for those who can
tap the groundswell. One constant theme reiterated throughout the conference
was that good environmental practice was invariably synonymous with good
business practice.
J. Sainsbury, the UK grocery chain, for example, claimed to save 100 tonnes
of plastic and Pounds 150,000 a year simply by removing the polystyrene base
from its pizza boxes. While CMB Packaging, the Anglo- French group, said
that lighter packaging now meant that 30,000 cans could be produced from one
tonne of tinplate compared with 24,000 in 1985. 'You can do the right thing
for the right reason and still make money,' said Carson.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Sweden's main energy taxes
affecting industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM JANUARY 1991 a tax was imposed on sulphur dioxide in coal, peat-based
fuels and oil. This tax amounts to SKr30 (Pounds 3) for every kilogram of
sulphur in coal and peat and SKr27 per cubic metre of oil.
At the same time a carbon dioxide tax was introduced and levied at a rate of
25 ore per kilogram on natural gas, oil, coal, liquified petroleum, gas,
petrol and kerosene emitted.
Last month a nitrogen oxide tax was introduced on furnaces and gas turbines
used for electricity and heat production. Here actual emissions will be
measured with a levy imposed of SKr40 per kilogram.
Sweden also charges a 25 per cent value added tax to energy use on
industrial and domestic consumers.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Swedish industry says enough
is enough - Robert Taylor explains how proposals to reduce energy taxes
threaten to break up the government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The future level of Sweden's energy taxes on industry, currently the highest
in the world, is threatening to provoke a political crisis this spring and
the possible break-up of the country's non-Socialist coalition government
elected last October.
Olof Johansson, the environment minister and Centre party leader, is
threatening to resign from the cabinet if his colleagues decide to push
ahead with proposals to make drastic cuts of up to SKr4bn (Pounds 385m) in
Sweden's energy taxes on industry.
The sudden outburst from Johansson has focused national attention on
Sweden's use of energy taxes both as an instrument of economic policy to
raise revenue and an incentive for manufacturers to reduce the pollution
they cause.
The non-Socialist coalition is coming under enormous pressure from
industrialists who argue the current level of energy taxes is pushing up
their costs at a time when they are in deep recession.
A government-commissioned inquiry into the taxation of energy use in
industry published two months ago has added weight to industry's argument.
Under the chairmanship of Professor Lennart Hjalmarsson from Gothenburg's
national economy institute, the inquiry's conclusions make unpalatable
reading for those who believe high taxes are a powerful weapon to encourage
industry to deal more rigorously with pollution.
'Energy taxation policy must be seen as part of a long-run growth policy and
should not contribute to a further worsening of Sweden's long-run
productivity problems,' the report argues.
It suggested that the total abolition of energy taxes on Swedish industry
would increase industrial production especially in the basic industries to
the tune of SKr20bn and create 10,000 more jobs.
The study drew particular attention to the harmful impact of energy taxes on
the country's cost-sensitive export industries. It estimated energy costs
account for 8 per cent of the value-added sales in pulp and paper and 9 per
cent in mines and quarries. The total energy tax bill for Swedish industry
totalled Skr6bn in 1990.
The Swedish government is sympathetic to the proposals despite the attitude
of its environment minister. Those who oppose such a sweeping change,
however, are unlikely to give up their cause without a struggle. The
country's powerful environmental lobby is determined to uphold the current
energy tax levels on industry.
'Any step to cut the government's energy taxes would be interpreted in no
other way than to suggest we don't care about environmental problems,'
argues Stefan Edman, vice president of Naturskyddsforeningen, Sweden's
society for nature conservation.
The inquiry recommended an 80 per cent cut in energy taxes on industry with
a uniform increase in general taxes on electrical energy and heating oil to
meet the annual SKr4bn gross tax revenue loss that would be incurred.
It also calculated that the energy tax per tonne of steel manufactured in
Sweden adds SKr140 to its cost and SKr360 for special steel compared with a
mere SKr4 in Germany, SKr9 in Britain and no charge at all in France.
The Swedish forestry industry estimated earlier this week that it is paying
as much as SKr1.2bn a year in energy taxes, which accounts for half of its
current profits.
The Swedish farmers organisation LRF is also critical of any move to
implement Hjalmarsson's recommendations. 'Sweden's role as a trendsetter on
environmental issues would be weakened and the risk is that on-going work to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions would lose momentum with Sweden setting a
bad example,' it argues.
The environmentalists are worried that many companies might abandon any
attempt to introduce anti-pollution measures if their energy costs fell. 'It
would mean the most obsolete and inefficient companies would be able to
compete more easily against their modern, cost effective competitors,'
argues Edman.
There is also a fear that the recommendations would deal a heavy blow to
current attempts to promote biomass technology - energy generated from the
burning of wood shavings - which is expensive at the moment. Many Swedish
environmentalists hope biomass will become an important source of industrial
and domestic energy and enable the country to start phasing out its nuclear
power industry. They argue that employers would have less incentive to
switch to biomass if alternative energy sources were cheaper than at
present.
In addition, the report warned that the high level of Swedish energy
taxation threatens to lead to the relocation of industry outside the country
and discourages inward industrial investment.
Many opponents of cutting industry's energy taxes also dislike the idea of
creating a wide price differential between the industrial and domestic uses
of energy as individuals paid higher energy bills and industry enjoyed lower
ones. Strong consumer resistance could be expected if industry is seen to be
enjoying exemption from the burdens of paying more for their energy.
At present the Swedish authorities accept that the current level of energy
taxes is impossible to sustain for the whole of industry. An array of
exemptions and modifications has been introduced to protect companies in
areas of Sweden where unemployment is high or industry is vulnerable.
As a result, in 1990 alone 103 companies were allowed energy tax reductions
totalling SKr693.7m with nearly half that figure being accounted for by 37
plants in the pulp and paper sector.
Nevertheless, employers argues that the industrial pollution problem must be
tackled through co-ordinated international action. As the country's
employers federation pointed out yesterday in its latest study of the impact
of energy taxes on industry, Sweden accounts for only 10 per cent of the
total sulphur pollution and 15 per cent of the nitrogen emissions falling on
the country. The rest comes mainly over the Baltic sea from heavily polluted
Poland, the former Soviet Union and eastern Germany.
It is only through harmonising industry's energy tax levels across national
frontiers that resolute action is possible to reduce industrial pollution
and encourage companies to invest in cleaner production processes. This is
why the Swedish government - notwithstanding Johansson's resignation threat
 -remains keen to bring down levels of energy taxation on industry to
harmonise with those planned for the EC which Sweden hopes to join in 1995.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Management: Little bit of sauce on the side - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many business executives look on eating as a 'pit stop' in a race. Others
see it as a part of an antiquated reward system where sugar and alcohol are
dished out as prizes and comforts. Few executives view nutrition as part of
a strategy to help keep them sharp throughout their career. I suspect that
few would treat their cars as badly.
Nutrition is central to your life. Your cells are constantly regenerating
themselves, using what you eat as building blocks. What passes your lips
will determine your overall energy level, your weight, your risk of heart
disease and cancer, diabetes, hypertension and mental lucidity. The goal is
to provide the right amount of energy for your body in a pleasurable way
without making you tired or ill.
The first tip is to go back in time. Our bodies have not evolved as quickly
as our lifestyles; as we move towards the 21st century, we expect the body
to convert new, synthetic fuels into high performance. What we forget is
that the body - and genetic code - is still coping with the changes wrought
by the introduction of agriculture 10,000 years ago.
As our technology makes us more sedentary, our food is becoming more
processed, more laden with fats and sugars, with the result that heart
disease, cancers, chronic fatigue and obesity have all become commonplace.
The solution is to take a step back and eat more like our predecessors.
The second tip is to remember that not all fuels are equal in terms of
storing energy. Suppose you had to cross the desert with only one of the
following: 1 kg of protein, 1 kg of starches (complex carbohydrates), 1 kg
of sugar or 1 kg of fat. Which do you choose?
The first three store only 4 calories per gram so you wouldn't get too far.
To ensure survival, you should choose fat, as it is the most efficient form
of stored energy, able to yield 9 calories per gram.
For the desk-bound manager the equation is different: it is less a matter of
physical survival, but of avoiding the diseases of affluence and chronic
fatigue. Of the three building blocks - fats, starches, and proteins - the
one that is the most help in keeping your stamina up and the safest for your
sedentary lifestyle is starches. You can power the body with refined sugars,
such as soft drinks or sweets, natural sugars like fruits, vegetables and
juices, or complete grains - cereals, rice, pasta, potato, legumes, beans or
whole breads.
But the best choices for the long- and short-term, are natural sugars and
complete grains as they provide clean energy that is slowly released
efficiently without clogging your arteries. Moreover, refined sugars, would
give you a burst of energy for which you would pay almost immediately with
sluggishness, irritability and hunger. Insulin shuttles the rapidly-absorbed
sugar in the cells to where it can be used, creating a hot-running engine on
a rollercoaster, destined for burn-out. Coffee, with or without added sugar,
will have the same effect.
So go easy on the fats, load up on starches and lean proteins - fish and
poultry - and develop a healthy fear of sugar. Most importantly, there is no
reason why going for both pleasure and success for every meal should be
drudgery.
But don't make the classic mistake of ordering a plate of pasta, smothered
with a fatty sauce. That is one step forward and five steps back. Order the
sauce on the side and add judiciously. Cut all the visible fat and skin off
meat. Don't drink alcohol on an empty stomach - 25per cent will be absorbed
directly through the stomach wall. And leave enough time at the end of the
meal to walk it off. This is the way to go until you have re-programmed your
reward system and have felt the real benefits of eating for success and
pleasure.

Mortgage Tax Relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE interest tax relief should be phased out and replaced with a new
housing cost allowance, targeted at the lower paid, and covering both rents
and mortgages, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday.
The party's 'Manifesto for Housing' said mortgage tax relief had created
'enormous economic and social problems without actually being of benefit to
home owners'.
The proposals reflect the determination of Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader,
to set a radical agenda, distinct from both Labour and the Tories.
However, tax relief would continue to be available for existing mortgage
holders, even if they moved house.
For those entering the housing market, relief would be available at a level
equivalent to a proportion of housing costs - perhaps 50 per cent - between
regionally-determined lower and upper limits.
Household incomes would also be taken into account while housing benefit
would be retained for those on very low incomes.
Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign director, said polling by the party
showing housing rising on the list of voters' concerns. Mr Ronnie Fearn,
party spokesman on housing, called also for short term measures to
ameliorate the mortgage repossessions crisis and for tackling homelessness
through investment in social housing - including the release of capital
receipts from council house sales.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Government accused of shirking 'green test'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was criticised yesterday for its reluctance to accept
proposals that its policies - including agriculture, energy and transport -
should be subjected to a 'green test' of their impact on the environment.
The proposal is in the initial stages of discussion in the European
Commission but no early decision is expected. It would entail governments of
member states carrying out environmental impact assessments on their
national policies. At present such assessments apply only to big
construction schemes.
A political row was sparked off when an early Commission draft, which was
circulating round Whitehall, was shown to members of the opposition parties.
The Department of the Environment said the proposals were too convoluted,
not flexible enough and would need big resources to put into effect.
It emphasised that Britain did not want to be obstructive and was prepared
to try to improve the draft.
Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, said it was proof that the
Conservatives had abandoned the 'green' agenda. 'The environment is not safe
in the grey hands of Mr Major,' he said.
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said it showed the
government's environment policy as a 'spurious sham'.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Protest at pollution curbs delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROTEST about delays in granting licences to National Power and PowerGen
to operate under the Environmental Protection Act was sent to Mr Michael
Heseltine, environment secretary, by Friends of the Earth yesterday.
The two companies should have been given authorisations by the Pollution
Inspectorate by the end of August. They would put limits on power-station
emissions.
The act requires details of the companies' applications to be placed on a
public register. The companies appealed against that on grounds of
commercial confidentiality.
The Department of the Environment yesterday said a report on the appeals had
been written and was with Mr Heseltine.
FoE said because of the delay the companies had been operating without
authorisation for nearly five months.
The environmental group leaked a letter from National Power to the Pollution
Inspectorate in which the company said it was concerned that the information
in its application 'will enable competitors and suppliers to analyse and
assess National Power's operating regime and calculate the effect on
National Power's costs.'
It said: 'We must protect National Power's commercial position against both
potential competitors and suppliers.'
Ms Fiona Weir, FoE air pollution campaigner, said Mr Heseltine was allowing
the power generators to hold up implementation of 'vital new pollution laws'
as they applied to power stations.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Corruption dogs Menem reforms: Slush funds and payoffs are
still part of political life in Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA may be changing for the better as it enters its 10th year of
civilian rule and its economic reforms continue to bear fruit. But an old
problem remains; corruption.
Last month, President Carlos Menem suffered a personal and political reverse
when he sacked Mr Miguel Angel Vicco, his private secretary. Mr Vicco is a
close friend whom the president had defended against accusations that his
dairy company sold putrid powdered milk to the government at inflated
prices. In the end, the media outcry became too great and Mr Vicco had to
go.
Over the past year Mr Menem has sacked 20 other top officials - including
half his cabinet - as seven big corruption scandals rocked the government.
Each case was uncovered by an increasingly aggressive press; hardly a day
goes by without one of Argentina's four main newspapers publishing a report
on government corruption.
It is impossible to tell if corruption is worse than it was under previous
governments, but it is certainly discussed more openly than before.
Argentines have lost their fear of the state, and the press, which faces few
controls, has found that investigative reporting boosts circulation.
Most allegations involve officials who had demanded bribes or awarded
suspiciously generous government contracts to favoured companies.
Recent scandals have been particularly damaging as they harm the poor -
ostensibly Mr Menem's political base. The powdered milk allegedly sold by Mr
Vicco was meant for poor children, while another senior official was
dismissed following accusations of corruption at a government health scheme
for pensioners.
Corruption is the government's main political weakness; opinion polls
regularly find that it is among the main concerns of the people. Mr Menem
invariably worsens the problem by first defending compromised officials only
to sack them shortly after, giving the impression that he is more interested
in limiting political damage than punishing offenders.
He has been accused of surrounded himself with cronies steeped in the
politics of intrigue, intimidation and patronage. Slush funds and payoffs
have always played an important role in the underworld of Argentine
politics, but the government has done nothing to crack down on political
'foundations' used to channel illicit funds to politicians.
To his credit, however, Mr Menem does acknowledge that corruption exists -
his predecessors merely turned a blind eye to the problem - and is attacking
its roots by privatising state companies, slashing red tape and cutting back
the civil service.
A year ago Mr Menem announced a 'crusade' to rid the government of
corruption. But his proposals languish in Congress, while others have proved
ineffective or stillborn. And instead of spurning purged officials, some
remain close to the president.
Mr Menem has always said corruption should be investigated by the judiciary.
However, it is riddled with political appointees, beginning with the Supreme
Court where Mr Menem added five new justices in 1990, guaranteeing a
government majority.
Other nominally independent control agencies are also headed by sympathetic
appointees. It often seems the press is Argentina's only active and
independent watchdog.
Mr Menem remains surprisingly immune to scandal. This is largely because Mr
Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister, has delivered low inflation and
economic growth, which has buoyed the government's popularity.
But corruption could yet undermine the government's political standing.
Mr Menem is gearing up to reform the constitution to allow re-election when
his term ends in 1995. Voters support economic reform despite misgivings
about corruption. However, as one western diplomat warned: 'If Menem does
not fix corruption, it is going to drag him down.'

<TEXT>
OFFICIALS at Upjohn, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company, are facing
a shareholder lawsuit charging them with concealing information about
problems with Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed sleeping pill,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The company, which recently denied a report that it had concealed data about
the drug's side-effects from the Food and Drug Administration, said it
believed the shareholder claims had no merit and the company would
vigorously defend itself. Mr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman, and eight
directors were named in the suit filed in a federal court in New York.
Upjohn has faced a steady stream of criticism over Halcion since August,
when a Salt Lake City woman sued the company claiming she had killed her
mother in a fit of Halcion-induced violence. The case was settled out or
court for an undisclosed amount.
The latest suit charges the Upjohn officials with mismanagement, proxy fraud
and 'self-dealing'. The suit accuses them of exposing Upjohn to liability
from civil lawsuits, regulatory fines and penalties, possible criminal
liability, and the loss of goodwill, reputation and standing.
News of the suit had little impact on Upjohn's share price by midday in New
York yesterday. Mr Sam Isaly, an analyst at Mehta and Isaly, which
specialises in pharmaceutical stock, said: 'Usually the plaintiffs get some
nuisance money but the potential damage is minimal.'
Consumer activists in the US have pressed for the FDA to ban Halcion. In
November the agency approved sales of the drug in smaller quantities, with
inserts advising patients of side-effects.
Upjohn has aggressively defended itself against critics and plans to bring a
lawsuit against a Scottish psychiatrist who alleged the company failed to
report adequately all of Halcion's side-effects. The UK banned sales of
Halcion in October.

<TEXT>
THE international trading community had a 'window of opportunity' until
Easter to reach a basic agreement on a final package in the long-delayed
negotiations of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt), Mr Frans Andriessen, vice-president of the European
Commission, said yesterday.
Addressing a two-day conference in Rome on Italy's foreign trade, Mr
Andriessen said that if an agreement could not be reached by Easter, the US
presidential campaign 'with its announced heavy stress on isolationism and
protectionism, will thereafter probably close that window for the remainder
of 1992'.
He insisted it was essential for the EC to make a final effort 'to reach the
best possible consensus across the board'.
But he warned that the EC's final efforts to compromise had to be matched by
parallel engagements and concessions by all the main trading partners in the
Gatt.
'There are no chances of a negotiated deal without the Community; but even
lesser chances of a deal negotiated against the Community,' he added.
The proposals put forward by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, had
required 'substantial improvements, notably in the field of agriculture'.
The EC, he claimed, was being asked 'what we cannot deliver; and what we can
deliver is not accepted by our partners'.
Contrary to a number of 'misleading' reports, the Commission was not eager
to get a deal at any price and Brussels did not accept deadlines ' as blind
dates'.
Although he recognised the need for mutual compromise, there was no way he
could recommend a deal to the Council of Ministers which did not seem
'suitable and profitable to the Community's long-term economic interests'.

FILTECO, an Italian specialist producer of textile machinery, has won a
Dollars 125m (Pounds 69m) contract to build a turnkey plant for nylon fibres
and carpets in Belarus, part of the former Soviet Union.
The contract will raise by 50 per cent the output of nylon fibres at P O
Chimvolokno Grodno, the biggest nylon fibres producer in the ex-Soviet
Union. The company makes about 40,000 tonnes of nylon fibres a year, for
carpets, tyres and other industrial products.
Output involved in the first Dollars 26m tranche of the deal is already
under way, with payment under a combination of cash and goods. A downpayment
has already been made in hard currency, while the balance is to be covered
by supplies of Belarus products, to be sold by Filteco.
According to Filteco, the goods concerned, principally fertilisers and
polymers, have been pre-sold, allowing production for the entire contract to
go ahead, and avoiding the need for export credit guarantees from the
Italian authorities. Completion of the first tranche is due by July 1993,
with the whole project expected to be completed within five years.

FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad aims to be more flexible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 2,000 delegates from over 150 countries gather this weekend in the
Colombian resort of Cartagena de Indias for the eighth United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). While the agenda of the
meeting, which runs from February 8-25, is stuffed with worthy development
issues, the key topic of discussion will be Unctad's future role.
Mr Kenneth Dadzie, Unctad's Ghanaian secretary-general, said yesterday he
expected Unctad VIII to pave the way for a more effective, relevant and
flexible organisation. Industrialised countries, notably the US, have been
highly critical of Unctad in recent years, regarding it along with much of
the UN system as anti-western and unproductive.
Created in the mid-1960s, Unctad's grand themes strike few chords today.
International commodity agreements and price stabilisation provisions have
bitten the dust (only that on rubber is still functioning as designed, with
doubts whether it will be renewed). The buzz-words now are 'dialogue' and
'study group', one grouping producers and consumer of copper was approved
last month.
Unctad's major achievement in shipping, the cargo-sharing accord designed to
boost developing countries' share of world shipping, applies to 1.5 per cent
of world cargo traffic. Developing countries have done better by competing
in the market.
On trade, the initiative has switched to Gatt, where over 70 developing
countries are negotiating in the Uruguay Round of trade talks covering
services, intellectual property protection and goods. Suggestions that Gatt
might expand its role to police global competition rules could lead to
annexation of another Unctad responsibility, restrictive business practices.
Finally, Unctad's one-time stress on development through government
intervention and import substitution at home and huge transfer of resources
from rich to poor internationally finds no echo in the current US-dominated
'new world order'.
Thus, for the first time, an Unctad conference will be discussing the
crucial development role of domestic policies, 'good management' (including
honest government) and political freedoms, with the fashionable theme of
sustainable development though environment-friendly growth.
Yet neither rich nor poor countries want to see Unctad disappear. It remains
the primary UN forum for debate on development in an international context,
and a useful umbrella body for the more modest accords on commodities,
shipping, insurance and south-south trade now emerging.
But to survive, the agency must undergo a radical shake-up in its objectives
and working methods. All countries agree that in the past, Unctad has
squandered much energy, resources and goodwill in fruitless wrangling over
issues of little importance, partly because its confrontational 'block'
system obliged industrialised nations and developing countries to speak as
distinct groups. In the run-up to the Cartagena meeting, both groups have
announced their own demise in favour of forming flexible alliances
reflecting diverse country interests.
The US and other rich countries favour Unctad turning into an OECD-type
organisation concentrating on analysis of development issues, with the
emphasis on promulgating lessons from successful developing-country
experience. Consensus-building, not just negotiation, should be the aim.
Developing countries want a bigger role for negotiations in Unctad and an
analytical focus on providing an alternative development perspective to that
of the western-dominated IMF and the World Bank. But the basis of agreement
at Cartagena exists.
For that to be translated into a vigorous future role, Unctad may need
changes in style as well as substance. Other UN agencies have, for example,
been more outspoken on democratisation and respect for human rights as basic
conditions for development. The IMF has weighed in more strongly on the
scope for military spending cuts.
Mr Dadzie, a career diplomat, has picked cautiously through the ideological
minefields since becoming Unctad's head in 1986. Whether he will be rewarded
with another stint in office when his current term expires in March will no
doubt be the gossip at Cartagena.

WESTERN trade officials meet today and tomorrow to discuss how their plans
to cut red tape for exports of sensitive high technology to the former
Soviet bloc should respond to collapse of the Soviet Union, William Dawkins
reports from Paris.
The debate will take place at the twice-yearly executive committee of Cocom
(the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls), set up in
1949 to stop sales of militarily useful technology to the former Soviet
Union. Cocom members, Nato minus Iceland plus Japan and Australia, agreed to
cut the number of controlled goods substantially last spring, following the
political changes across eastern Europe.
A special class of even lighter controls were also accorded to the three
European countries considered to have made the biggest steps towards
democracy; Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Exports to them benefit from
faster licensing procedures.
But security worries caused by last August's Soviet coup attempt and the
break-up of the Soviet Union have caused several Cocom members to delay
reducing their own national technology export curbs to the former Soviet
territories, officials say.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Vasco Rocha Vieira, Macao's Portuguese governor, said after talks
with Chinese premier Li Peng yesterday the enclave would maintain 'great
autonomy' after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1999, agencies report from
Lisbon.
'Macao will have its own laws, its market economy, with all the rights that
are guaranteed today,' Gen Rocha Vieira told Portuguese journalists.
In a 1987 accord Portugal agreed to hand over the tiny territory on the
south China coast after almost 500 years of rule from Lisbon. Under the
agreement Beijing agreed to maintain the capitalist economy and give a 'high
degree of autonomy' to Macao for 50 years after the transfer. 'The
sovereignty of China will only show in defence and foreign affairs,' Gen
Rocha Vieira said.
Known as the Las Vegas of the east, the 16 sq km Macao has grown rich as a
gambling and tourism haven, mainly for visitors from nearby Hong Kong, which
Britain has agreed to return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Li was on the final day of a three-day visit to Portugal, after visiting
Italy, Switzerland and the United Nations. He was due to fly to Spain last
night.
Sidestepping the sensitive issue of human rights, Li said on Monday night
that ideological differences should not prevent western Europe normalising
relations with China.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, which is the current
president of the European Community, told Li that China would have to
guarantee respect for human rights before relations with the EC could
improve,
Li is one of the leaders widely held responsible for the killing of hundreds
of pro-democracy protestors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Israelis rely on diaspora bond buyers for Dollars 1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FETING AND flattering wealthy Jews from the Americas and Europe is a
familiar routine for Israeli leaders. Last week there was a keener than
usual note of exhortation from those addressing a visiting delegation of
leading buyers of Israel Bonds - with good reason.
Israel's politically sensitive request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in US
loan guarantees to help it finance Jewish immigration from the former Soviet
Union may attract most of the headlines. But the government is also banking
on a big increase in its overseas bonds operation to help it meet foreign
funding needs of more than Dollars 20bn that immigration is expected to
create over the next five years.
This year alone, the Finance Ministry has set a target of Dollars 1.5bn to
be raised by the sale of Israel Bonds - a 50 per cent increase on the
Dollars 990m sold in 1991 and twice the value sold in 1990. A fall in
immigration figures lately has raised some doubts over the projection of 1m
newcomers by 1995. But for the moment the government's demand curve for
overseas bond sales is set to go on rising well into the decade.
The pressure to raise more money has forced the Development Corporation for
Israel, the New York-based bonds organisation, to look for new sources of
investment and tighten its own administrative belt.
Israel has been selling government bonds chiefly to the North American
Jewish community since 1951.
To date, a total of some Dollars 12bn has been raised through a variety of
instruments ranging from a few hundred dollars in value to promissory notes
worth up to Dollars 1m. The organisation has 40 offices in the US, six in
Canada and 22 elsewhere, mainly in South America and Europe. Traditionally
the bonds have been sold to and through the diaspora Jewish communities -
1,300 synagogues in North America have served to spread the word - as a
means of giving material support to Israel.
However, Mr Meir Rosenne, a veteran Israeli diplomat who heads the bonds
operation, says it is now time to change the image of the bonds 'from a
charity to an investment'. He notes that Dollars 200m in mature bonds have
never been redeemed by their holders, so accustomed have investors become to
regarding the bonds as a 'gift' to Israel.
Already about 30 per cent of Israel Bonds are sold to non-Jewish investors,
including regular financial institutions, pension funds and municipalities.
Mr Rosenne aims to increase this and has taken the unprecedented - and
expensive - step of advertising in the media. He has also cut his staff from
700 to 540, paring administrative costs to about 4 per cent of sales.
Interest rates, set by the Treasury in Jerusalem, have been kept up, with
the zero coupon and variable rate issue bonds, at 7.20 per cent and 7.5 per
cent respectively, both well above the current US prime rate of 6.5 per
cent.
Jewish communities will remain the key target for sales. To sharpen the
appeal, the Israeli government has pledged that all bonds money will be
spent exclusively on immigration absorption, and not go into the general
budget as before. Still, says Mr Rosenne, the 1992 target is 'very
ambitious'.
Israel's example of selling government bonds overseas has not gone unnoticed
by other countries in need of foreign funds.
Egypt, Poland, Hungary and the Ukraine are understood to have studied the
operation with a view to launching something similar of their own.

A SOUTH African judge charged with investigating public violence yesterday
cast doubt on allegations that the country's military is involved in fanning
township unrest.
The anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper and the African National Congress
yesterday presented a memorandum to the commission of inquiry chaired by Mr
Justice Richard Goldstone, arguing that South African military intelligence
set up front companies and used them to train agents to foment township
violence.
In recent weeks, the Weekly Mail has published several articles quoting
individuals who claim to have been involved in such activities, including a
former senior official of the Inkatha Freedom party, the ANC's main black
political rival. The ANC views the Weekly Mail revelations as proof that a
so-called 'third force' exists within the security forces to provoke
violence aimed at ANC supporters.
The Weekly Mail's lawyer, Mr David Soggot, told a hearing of the commission
yesterday: 'There is general evidence ..which authorises the inference
 .that military intelligence has set out on a strategic policy of funding
violence and is still bent on that strategy.'
However, Mr Justice Goldstone said evidence provided so far did not support
charges that the military was continuing to fund violence at present -
though he said he would examine all military activities that could have a
bearing on current violence. His commission, set up by President F W de
Klerk last October, is charged with investigating the causes of violence
since July last year.

<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday apologised for
the 'misunderstanding' he caused by a disparaging reference to the 'work
ethic' of Americans.
Mr Miyazawa's apology was intended to undo the damage done by remarks he
made before the Japanese Diet on Tuesday which were later condemned by the
White House in Washington as 'not helpful'.
The verbal exchanges between Tokyo and Washington highlight the increase in
bilateral tensions since US President George Bush visited Japan last month.
Mr Miyazawa said on Monday he had felt for a long time Americans 'may have
lacked the work ethic'. So many university graduates had gone into Wall
Street that the number of engineers had declined. He added: 'I think a
similar case was found in Japan's bubble (economy). It is important to have
the sweat on one's brow to produce added value.'
Yesterday the prime minister said he had intended to criticise an
over-emphasis on speculative financial activities in Japan as well as the
US, and not to criticise Americans. The ministry of foreign affairs added
that the phrase 'work ethic' meant 'philosophy of work'.
The elaborate explanations indicate how sensitive Japanese officials are
about antagonising the US. They are concerned that, with a presidential
election campaign about to start in the US, Japan could come under severe
political attacks.
Japanese politicians have periodically criticised the US, sometimes
inadvertently and sometimes not. Most recently Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, the
speaker of the lower house of the Japanese Diet, said US workers could not
understand written instructions because 30 per cent were illiterate.
Mr Sohei Miyashita, defence minister, said yesterday his ministry would cut
Y100bn (Pounds 450m) from its current five-year budget to help compensate
for Gulf war contributions, Reuter adds.
Japan gave Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.9bn) to US-led coalition forces fighting
the Gulf war last year. Opposition parties had demanded a cut in the defence
budget as part of a parliamentary deal on the Gulf war funds.
The Defence Ministry has earmarked Y22,750bn for defence in the current five
year programme.

THE INDIAN government yesterday announced the establishment of a Rs2bn
(Pounds 43.4m) national renewal fund to provide a social security net for
workers made redundant by the closure of loss-making factories.
The fund is intended to retrain and redeploy up to 48,000 workers affected
by such closures which are mostly in the public sector. So far 58 industrial
units have been identified. They have cumulative losses of Rs100bn and the
government estimates it would take Rs150bn to make them profitable.
Formulation of a policy which would enable loss-making public and private
sector factories to be closed, however, has been delayed by trade union
opposition.
The unions want to be allowed to run the units as worker co-operatives and
they have some support from the Finance Ministry.

NORWAY has obtained fresh evidence that 12.5 tonnes of heavy water destined
for Romania in 1986 was illegally re-routed to India, a senior public
prosecutor said in Olso yesterday.
Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used to produce plutonium which in turn
is used in nuclear weapons and atom bombs.
'We have documentation which shows that the heavy water was shipped to the
Directorate of Purchase and Stores in Bombay,' Mr Anstein Gjengedal, the
public prosecutor said. The Bombay address has been linked by Norway to a
branch of the Indian atomic programme.
Norway has for several years suspected that India's nuclear programme has
been developed with the help of its heavy water which was illegally
acquired, according to the terms of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).
The 1986 heavy water shipment was destined for Romania. According to Mr
Gjengedal, in 1985 Romania signed an 'end-user' statement that the heavy
water would be used in a power plant and guaranteed that it would not be
re-exported outside Romania. These assurances allowed the Norwegian
government to approve the deal and issue the necessary export documentation
for its shipment.
'When we investigated the case in Romania we accessed documents which told
us that the heavy water shipment left Oslo on West African Airlines bound
for Bucharest where it stopped for a crew change, without unloading, before
going on to Bombay,' Mr Gjengedal explained.
The Norwegian government has unsuccessfully sought India's co-operation in
investigating the matter.
Mr Bjoern Blokhus, a Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday
that Norway had informed the Indian government of its findings. 'We are
giving them reasonable time to respond,' Mr Blokhus said.
But he indicated that if the government had not been contacted by Indian
authorities by February 13, it would be forced to pursue a tougher strategy
in order to substantiate Mr Gjengedal's findings.
He would not indicate what options the government would examine.
In 1988, Norway banned exports of heavy water because of a series of
embarrassing scandals which underscored how lax controls over its export and
sales had become. But by that time it had already made its way to at least
35 nations.

It was able to draw Dollars 71m from a Dollars 80m tranche of a World Bank

September, Mr Kasonde said.
The International Monetary Fund and donor nations also suspended aid because
of the default and the failure of former president Kenneth Kaunda's

'We are on track and the other donors are coming up with their share of the

Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Israeli parties which advocate acceptance of a Palestinian state in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have agreed to form a pact in the
coming general election which will almost certainly make them the third
largest group of MPs after Likud and Labour, the main parties.
As legislation to call an election on June 23 passed smoothly through the
Knesset yesterday, the three small parties predicted their alliance would
increase their joint representation from 10 at present to at least 15 seats
in the 120-seat parliament thanks to the country's extreme form of
proportional representation.
The alliance was confirmed when Mapam, a democratic socialist party with
three Knesset seats, voted on Monday night to form a combined list of
election candidates with the Citizens Rights Movement, with five seats, and
Shinui, which has two seats.
Although Mapam's socialist ideology is at odds with the free market beliefs
of the other two, their virtually identical views on the overriding
political issue of the occupied territories makes them natural partners.
They hope to increase the chances of a 'dovish' coalition emerging to
succeed the hardline government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir.
However, their alliance will more likely damage Labour's already slim
chances of defeating the Likud in the race to be the biggest Knesset party.
Their acceptance of Palestinian independence, still officially rejected by
Labour, poses no threat to Likud's support but could attract more 'dovish'
Labour voters.
If the more uncompromising Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the former premier and defence
minister, ousts Mr Shimon Peres from the Labour leadership later this month,
the new alliance of the doves may ultimately make a revived Likud-Labour
coalition the likeliest election outcome.

TWO economic groups in eastern and southern Africa appear locked on a
collision course, Reuter reports from Harare.
The 18-nation Preferential Trade Area (PTA) of eastern and southern Africa
called last week for a merger with the 10-state Southern African Development
Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). But the latter shows no intention of
accepting this idea despite a nine-nation overlap in membership.
'Ministers don't talk to each other within the same government, let alone
communicating adequately with other governments,' one diplomat observed.
SADCC, comprising Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia.
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, was formed in 1980 to lessen
economic dependence on an apartheid South Africa.
Almost two years later the PTA - which includes the SADCC members except
Botswana, but with the addition of Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia and Uganda - was set up to promote trade
and lead to an eventual common market.
Diplomats say relations between the two groups have been rancorous at times,
particularly on the part of the PTA which appears to resent SADCC's ability
to raise development funds.
In an embarrassing clash of dates, the PTA held its annual summit in Lusaka
and SADCC its important annual donors' conference in Maputo on the same days
last week.
PTA members pledged to seek a quick merger with SADCC. Officials of the
SADCC agree there must be greater co-operation between the two groups, but
say there is no suggestion SADCC will disappear.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATION by the European Commission into the sale of prime-site
property near the former Berlin Wall to Daimler-Benz has been extended to
Sony, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, which bought a nearby property
from city authorities.
The investigation will determine whether the companies received an illegal
subsidy from the city to buy the real estate on Potsdamer Platz. The area
was the pre-war heart of Berlin, but is now a vast barren square populated
mainly by rabbits. The bunker where Adolf Hitler committed suicide in May
1945 lies under a mound on the site.
The Commission could declare both contracts invalid or agree to the
companies making hefty additional payments.
An independent valuation ordered by the Commission last year and carried out
by the Berlin authorities said the sale to Daimler-Benz in mid-1990 of a
61,710 square metre property for DM92.8m (Pounds 32m) was well below the
market value of DM179.7m. Daimler-Benz is understood to have offered an
additional sum which is under study in Brussels.
Mr Steffen Kammradt, spokesman for the Berlin Finance Ministry, said the
city was notified yesterday by Bonn that the Commission will also look into
the property sale to Sony to determine whether it received illegal
subsidies.
Sony bought the 30,000 square metre property for its German headquarters for
DM97.2m in June 1991.
The price per square metre was much higher than in the Daimler-Benz sale as
German unification had taken place and Berlin was again the capital. Both of
the prestigious investors were regarded by the city as vital for Berlin's
future.
Mr Eberhard Diepgen, the governing mayor, was also anxious to assure that
Daimler-Benz suffered no 'loss of face' if the Commission ruled the
cut-price sale amounted to illegal state aid.
Daimler-Benz said the Commission's inquiry would not hold up the building
plans for the headquarters of its service operations but that it wanted a
decision from Brussels soon.

FT  05 FEB 92 / German business slow to follow state on Croatia: Ex-Yugoslav
republic shows few signs of economic loosening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S business community is reluctant to invest in Croatia, not just
because the newly-independent republic remains unstable, but because its
government has been reluctant to introduce reforms to attract foreign
capital.
'It is difficult to find one private hairdresser in Zagreb,' a German
diplomat said. 'The economy remains highly centralised. There is no movement
whatsoever in economic reforms,' he added.
The war against the Croatian army by the Yugoslav federal army and Serb
nationalists has played a large part in diverting the government's attention
from decentralising the economy to building up a strong army.
'Although we are aware we must privatise the economy, it is difficult to
talk about reforms when the war has cost at least the equivalent of one
year's GDP, or Dollars 15bn (Pounds 8.3bn),' said Mr Jurica Pavelic,
Croatia's deputy prime minister who is responsible for the economy.
Since June 25, when the war started, more than 200,000 apartments and houses
have been destroyed, 145,000 people have lost their jobs because factories
have been bombed, and Croatia is taking care of 322,000 refugees.
Many officials say the priority remains regaining that third of the
republic's territory under the control of the federal army and Serb
militants.
The mood among German diplomats and economists is one of growing frustration
with the slow pace of change, particularly since Germany was the first of
the European Community countries to recognise Croatia.
Germany is Croatia's largest single trading partner. Between January and
June 1991, total trade amounted to Dollars 1.07bn. In 1988, total trade
exceeded Dollars 2.2bn.
Bonn's contribution to Croatia has so far focused on humanitarian and
technical assistance. An office set up by the German foreign ministry
recently opened in Zagreb to co-ordinate all the international aid agencies.
Mr Michael Steiner, its director, said this centralised system of
distributing aid has cut out duplication and waste.
'Mr Genscher earmarked DM10m (Pounds 3.4m) for humanitarian aid last
December provided all aid was co-ordinated by Bonn,' said Mr Steiner. 'In
addition, the German lander (states) have already contributed DM4bn worth of
aid to Croatia.'
Mr Darko Bekic, a former adviser to Mr Tudjman, and now lecturer at Zagreb
university, said Bonn faces a difficult task in influencing the pace of
economic change and strengthening the republic's fragile democratic
traditions.
'Croatian enterprise managers are rooted in the old communist tradition.
They still believe the state should bail them out. They want the state to do
all their marketing. There is little initiative. The etatist tradition is
very strong here,' he explained.
But German diplomats believe the Tudjman government has not only inherited
the tradition of a strong state which preceded the communist era. 'Even
before the war, Tudjman refused to decentralise the economy, and instead
created his own nomenklatura,' said a German diplomat and specialist in
Yugoslavia.
This direction of the economy is all the more exasperating for the large
Croat diaspora in Germany which has swelled from 270,000 to more than
600,000 since June.
'The refugees want to return, so do some of the Croatian diaspora who came
to Germany in the 1960s and who now want to invest in tourism or small
businesses in their homeland. They are waiting for stability, and for new
legislation on investment and privatisation,' the diplomat said.
'Bonn can do little. The pressure for change must come from within. Only
then, will credits, and investments start flowing in,' he added.
LORD Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace conference on
Yugoslavia, returns to Belgrade today to try to overcome obstacles to the
United Nations plan to deploypeacekeepers in Croatia and reconvene the
conference, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
The visit is the first since the EC recognised Croatia and Slovenia last
January, a move which promted many Serb officials to call for an end to EC
mediation in the conflict.
Lord Carrington is expected to meet Serb leaders before travelling tomorrow
to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and later to Zagreb, the
capital of Croatia.

Ms Alessandra Mussolini (above), a medical student, actress and the

neo-fascist candidate in April parliamentary elections.
Ms Mussolini, 28, was quoted by the Milan daily Corriere della Sera as
saying she would run for the neo-fascist MSI party 'because it is the party
that is closest to the ideas of my grandfather'.
'I feel very close to him,' said Ms Mussolini, who is also the niece of
filmstar Sophia Loren. 'It is a family tie of which I have always been very
proud.'
'Until recently the word fascist was considered shameful. Fortunately that
period has passed. In fact, there is now a reassessment of how much grandpa
Benito did for Italy.'
She will run in the election on April 5 in Naples, the home city of her
mother Maria Scicolone.
Benito Mussolini was dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943 and was shot dead
in 1945.

<TEXT>
THE CHIEF of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States said
yesterday that, since the CIS had no enemies, it would defend itself against
everyone.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov heads forces technically those of the
Commonwealth but wholly paid for and increasingly disposed of by Russia  -
as when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, proposed swingeing arms
cuts last week without apparent reference to fellow CIS presidents.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, in a statement to the mass circulation Komsomolskaya
Pravda, defended Mr Yeltsin's proposals against charges of 'unilateralism,'
saying hard bargaining on disarmament would start when Mr James Baker, US
secretary of state, arrives in Moscow next week.
'As to potential enemies,' he said, 'we simply do not have them. Our
(military) doctrine might be described as an all-round defence.' Before and
during his trip to the US, Britain and Canada last week, Mr Yeltsin said
these states had ceased to be seen as hostile.
Nevertheless economic pressures facing Russia and other former Soviet states
coupled with deep cuts in defence procurement are forcing arms manufacturers
into the world market to try to sell what they can to keep production going.
Mr Mikhail Malei, an adviser to President Yeltsin on military conversion,
said in an interview with the Interfax news agency yesterday that the small
Russian autonomous republic of Udmurtia, where defence enterprises make up
82 per cent of all production, would be a test bed for a new 'concept' which
would downgrade conversion in favour of finding new markets for arms.
He said Mr Yeltsin had approved a scheme under which the republic would
retain 70 per cent of all hard currency receipts for weapons. Udmurtia
production included chemical weapons as well as Kalashnikov rifles and other
small arms, he said.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister for economic reform, said
on Monday that Russia would continue sales of weapons abroad.
The state of the defence industries was highlighted yesterday by Lieut Gen
Vasili Vorobyev, head of the armed forces central finance department. In an
interview with the armed forces newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Gen Vorobyev said
that expenditure on defence equipment of Rbs6.5bn in the first quarter of
the year from a total defence allocation of Rbs50.4bn would leave defence
industries 'in a grave financial situation.'
Withdrawing the former Soviet army from the Baltic republics will cost an
estimated Rbs6bn (Dollars 60m at the market rate) and no timetable will be
set for the completion of the troop pullout, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a Russian
deputy prime minister, said yesterday, reports Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
Mr Shakhrai announced at the weekend that troops would begin pulling out of
Lithuania this month and out of Latvia in March. But details had yet to be
negotiated, he said yesterday. There wasno date for the start of the pullout
from Estonia.
The speed of the withdrawals will partly depend on the availability of
housing and social benefits to officers back in Russia. He declined to say
which and how many troops will be withdrawn to begin with, lending credence
to speculation the start may be a purely token gesture in a process which
could take years.
He declined to give figures for the size of the military presence in the
three republics, but said there were 40,000 officers there.

POLAND, Czechoslovakia and Hungary should be made full members of the

German foreign minister, said at the close of a one-day visit to Warsaw.
Mr Genscher explained that the recently signed association agreement between
Brussels and the three central European countries, for a gradual removal of
trade barriers on non-farming goods by the end of the century, meant that
the path to full membership 'could be shortened'. He added, however, that
the moment of full membership would depend on 'economic progress'.
Mr Genscher's visit was designed to establish contact with Poland's new
government, which met yesterday to give preliminary approval to economic
plans for this year.
Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the chief minister responsible for the economy, said
afterwards that the Polish budget deficit this year would reach 5 per cent
of gross domestic product (GDP), a slight increase on 1991, when the deficit
touched on 4 per cent of GDP.
The deficit, he said, would not be eliminated before 1994, while tax
incentives would be introduced this year to boost exports.
He did not expect growth to resume until 1993, but did expect that
single-digit inflation could come within reach in 1994. Retail prices rose
by 60 per cent last year, but by only 7 per cent last month.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine yesterday proposed convening an
international conference to arrange payment of its share of former Soviet
debt, and hiring a western bank to act as debt manager.
At the end of a 24-hour official visit to Germany, the Ukrainian leader
failed to give the Bonn government the assurances it was seeking that he
would sign the international memorandum of understanding on servicing
outstanding Soviet debt. The memorandum was negotiated by the Group of Seven
(G7) industrialised states, with eight of the former Soviet republics.
He insisted that he did not trust any former Soviet bank, such as
Vnesheconombank, which is being used by the other republics to service the
old debts, last estimated at more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 33.1bn). 'The
Soviet Union no longer exists, and Vnesheconombank is bankrupt,' he said.
German government sources indicated last night that they were disappointed
at the failure to reach any agreement on the debt question.
Without such a deal Germany is not prepared to back Ukraine's membership of
the International Monetary Fund, nor guarantee any new export credits.
On the other hand, Mr Kravchuk did give Chancellor Helmut Kohl two
assurances designed to put his relations with Germany on a firmer footing.
He spelt out in some detail how he intended to make Ukraine a nuclear-weapon
free nation, and he promised to resettle up to 400,000 so-called Soviet
Germans, descended from families expelled from the republic by Stalin during
the Second World War.
He confirmed that Ukraine's planned national army would have a maximum
strength of 220,000, 'only half that of France', and that all tactical
nuclear missiles would be withdrawn by July. All strategic weapons would be
removed by 1994, he said.
However it is debt which remains the main bone of contention. Mr Kravchuk
does not dispute Ukraine's responsibility for just over 16 per cent of the
former Soviet Union's debts, but he is not prepared to go along with the
rest of the republics with a common solution to deal with it.
He said he would call a conference early in the year where 'corrections' in
servicing the debt could be agreed with creditors. 'I can say I have no
trust in the former Soviet banks, and therefore we would propose that for
example these debts should be paid back through a west European bank, which
would manage them,' he said.
However, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, made it clear he would
rather Ukraine sign the common memorandum of understanding. 'It would be
much easier for the process if the successor republics had a common line,' a
German official said later. 'Signing the memorandum of understanding is
important for further contacts.'
Mr Waigel and Mr Kravchuk agreed that experts from both sides would meet in
the near future to discuss the debt problem further.

charges
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Data, the US computer systems and services company, suffered a net
loss for 1991 after restructuring charges. Revenues declined as sales of
computer products and automated lottery equipment slowed, the company said.
Net losses for the year were Dollars 9.8m, or 24 cents a share, on revenues
of Dollars 1.5bn. In 1990, Control Data reported net earnings of Dollars
2.7m, or 5 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.7bn. Excluding pre-tax
restructuring charges of Dollars 12.1m, the company was modestly profitable
for the year.
It reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 15.2m, or 36 cents, after a
restructuring charge of Dollars 17.5m as the company realigned its computer
products operations. Last year, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 23.8m, or
56 cents.
Revenues for the fourth quarter declined to Dollars 402.9m from Dollars
429.7m.
'Satisfactory results in most of the information services businesses and
government systems were more than offset by the effect that the
deteriorating economy and industry issues had on the automated wagering and
computer products businesses, and by restructuring charges,' said Mr
Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive.
Restructuring plans, announced last September, have reduced costs and
expenses, the company said.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Russia's basic foods 'will last 19 days'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASIC food supplies in Russia will be exhausted within 19 days despite new
programmes for radical reform designed to replenish store shelves, a
newspaper reported yesterday, AP reports from Moscow.
Another newspaper accused Russian leaders of 'committing planned genocide'
against the Russian people because salaries, pensions, and student grants
have risen insignificantly compared with soaring food prices.
The reports, two of many such pessimistic items that have appeared in the
Russian press since President Boris Yeltsin freed most prices on January 2,
came one day after an official forecast two more years of economic
hardships.
'Market prices are absolutely out of reach for 85 per cent of the
population,' the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya reported.
'Thus, the transition. . . to a 'market-led' economy has resulted in a
shortage of protein in people's daily diets, which (as has been proven on
numerous occasions) will soon lead to health disorders,' it said.
Although President Boris Yeltsin's reforms have increased the availability
of some products in state stores, many staples such as milk remain hard to
find. Privately run shops and farmers' markets still sell a variety of
different products, but their inflated prices are beyond the reach of most
Russians.
Sovietskaya Rossiya said the government's policies would lead to genocide,
predicting that the Russian population will drop by 10m within 10 years
because of insufficient vitamins and other essential nutrients in people's
diets.
The Russian State Statistics Committee, or Goskomstat, has predicted that
Russia's stocks of beef and poultry will run out in 19 days and vegetable
oil in 20 days, the newspaper Pravitelstvennyi Vestnik (Government
Chronicle) reported. It said butter supplies are expected to disappear in 30
days, and sugar in 41 days.
Trade Ministry spokesman Mr Vasily Tikhonov blamed the pending crisis on
other former Soviet republics
He accused them of refusing to honour contracts to sell food to Russia
because they needed to feed their own residents.
Mr Tikhonov said Ukraine has provided only 1,000 tons of beef to Moscow and
St Petersburg so far this year, a tiny portion of the 30,000 tons promised
for the first three months. Belarus has supplied only 4,000 tons of meat
products out of an agreed 46,000 tons, he said.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Chilean 'miracle-makers' for hire: Santiago's economic gurus
are in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEET Chile's latest non-traditional export: the globe-trotting economic
consultant.
With much of Latin America and eastern Europe seeking to emulate Chile's
export-driven success, Chilean economists have never been in such wide
demand. Confident, multi-lingual, generally US-trained and with a record of
public service, they are advising countries which are beginning to tackle
economic reforms on everything from debt management to how to set up private
pension funds.
Most, but not all, are former luminaries of the 1973-1990 military regime.
They include Mr Hernan Buchi, finance minister between 1985 and 1989 and
acknowledged architect of the Chilean 'economic miracle'; Mr Hernan
Somerville, chief debt negotiator during the difficult years following the
1982 debt crisis; and Mr Jose Pinera, a former mining and labour minister
who reformed the country's social security system.
Chile boasts an impressive record of firsts: it was ahead of Mrs Margaret
Thatcher in the privatisation crusade; it pioneered debt-for-equity swaps as
a way of retiring part of its Dollars 19bn foreign debt; its private pension
fund system, now 10 years old, manages more than Dollars 9bn-worth of assets
and has been a key factor in the development of Chile's capital markets.
Chile is also the only country in the developing world that has an
independent central bank. 'Chile has amassed a huge store of knowledge,'
says Mr Somerville. At a time when other Latin American debtors were using
confrontational tactics against their creditor banks, Mr Somerville was
bitterly criticised for sticking to International Monetary Fund targets and
religiously servicing Chile's debt.
'Ours was a very lonely position,' he recalls, 'but by 1988 pragmatism had
begun to reign. The old rhetoric was dead.'
The privatisation of Chile's steel, electricity, telecommunications,
airlines, nitrates, sugar, and banking sectors have attracted streams of
interested parties from around the globe. The Chilean experience is seen as
more relevant to developing countries than the sale of state companies in
Britain, which already had institutional investors and a sophisticated
capital market.
What Mr Somerville emphasises when he talks about privatisations abroad is
that Chile sold well-run companies, with proper balance sheets and real
investment plans. 'Before privatisation, Chile redefined the whole concept
of how you run public sector companies. They learned to compete in an open
market without subsidies,' he says. In many countries, it is not a company
that is being sold, just assets.
Mr Buchi's services are in such wide demand that he only spends two weeks a
month in Chile. He has advised Czechoslovakia on privatisation, Paraguay on
tax reform, Brazil on pension systems, Mexico on the planned sell-off of the
electricity sector and Poland on bankrupt state banks. He writes a column in
the Buenos Aires financial daily El Cronista Comercial. His think-tank, the
Institute for Liberty and Development, recently invited 25 Soviet economists
for a seminar on the Chilean economic model.
During his brief sojourns in Chile, Mr Buchi never loses an opportunity to
criticise the present government's economic policies. Some say this is sour
grapes, for Mr Buchi has never quite recovered from the blow of losing the
1989 presidential election to Mr Patricio Aylwin. Others believe Mr Buchi,
who jogs 10km a day, is in training for the next presidential marathon in
1993.
Mr Buchi this year joined the extreme-right Union of Independent Democrats,
which is carefully grooming his new public image. His latest political stunt
was to leap up the 12 flights of stairs to his former offices in the Finance
Ministry for a press conference in which he blamed the present incumbent, Mr
Alejandro Foxley, of mismanaging public spending and causing a 'loss of
dynamism' in the Chilean economy. Mr Foxley dismissed this as political
agit-prop. The government accounts are balanced, inflation is falling and
the economy is on target to grow by 5 per cent this year, he said.
The toughest question these former technocrats of the military regime must
answer when abroad is whether the strategies they pursued can be implemented
in a democracy. Most elected governments would be unable to withstand a 15
per cent contraction of GDP and unemployment rates of more than 30 per cent
that afflicted Chile in the early 1980s.
Critics of the Chilean model also argue that it has been unsuccessful in
redistributing wealth. An estimated 5m Chileans, almost 40 per cent of the
population, live below the poverty line.
Mr Pinera says: 'What happened in Chile was not essentially the product of
an authoritarian regime. What we had was a cohesive team of economists who
sold the free-market model to the military.'
Unlike other technocrats, Mr Pinera does not shy away from publicity or
television cameras. Rather, he used television extensively to popularise his
plans to privatise the Chilean pension fund system.
Drawing on his advice, Peru and Argentina recently announced plans to
introduce private pension schemes of their own.
Mr Pinera believes the Chilean experience was the key to the change in
economic thinking in Latin America.

<TEXT>
Greece and Turkey are restarting talks on bilateral disputes after a gap of
several years, with the aim of signing a friendship treaty this summer,
Kerin Hope writes from Athens.
The move follows a weekend meeting between Prime Ministers Constantine
Mitsotakis of Greece and Suleyman Demirel of Turkey, both attending the
world economic forum at Davos in Switzerland.
Greek officials said the agreement could be signed during a visit to Ankara
by Mr Mitsotakis. He would be the first Greek premier to make an official
trip to Turkey in almost 40 years.
However, the agreement could cause a rift in relations between Athens and
Nicosia. Mr George Vassiliou, president of Cyprus, wanted Mr Mitsotakis to
avoid committing himself to the treaty signing until the Cyprus problem had
been solved.
Mr Mitsotakis conceded that Cyprus was an important issue but said it would
be easier to reunite the island if Greece and Turkey were on better terms.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY and eight former socialist states around the Black Sea initialled a
broad framework for economic co-operation yesterday, in a bid to revive
stalled trade relations following dissolution of the former Soviet Union,
writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul.
The accord, unveiled by Turkish President Turgut Ozal in Istanbul, groups
Turkey with Russia, Ukraine, Moldavia, Georgia, Romania and Bulgaria, as
well as the neighbouring states of Armenia and Azerbaijan which are without
direct access to the Black Sea.
The formal agreement is expected to be signed in June, allowing Turkey and
former Comecon members to revive trade links and to co-ordinate policy on
issues from the environment and transport to telecommunications,
infrastructure and fisheries.
Turkish companies are supplying digital switches to Azerbaijan, power to
Bulgaria and are involved in construction work in Russia and Ukraine.
Turkish officials are also examining the possibility of a freeport at
Trabzon to provide Armenia and possibly Azerbaijan with access to the Black
Sea. 'We live around the same sea. It will be to our interest to develop the
infrastructure,' Mr Ozal said.
Turkey had extended more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 560m) of export credits to
the Soviet Union, but officials say all new loans are frozen while
arrangements with republics are worked out.
The former Soviet Union represented a growing market for Turkey, with
two-way trade worth about Dollars 1bn for the first eight months of 1991  -
much of it underpinned by Soviet gas sales.
Turkey's total trade with the world exceeds Dollars 20bn.
Turkey plans to buy 4.5bn cubic metres of gas in 1992 from Soyuzgaz. But
officials in Ankara are keen to conclude deals with Iran and Qatar in case
of uncertain Russian supply.
A Russian official said Black Sea co-operation would help 'regulate a
situation which could otherwise become very messy'.

Wall Street
A QUIET day on Wall Street saw US equities trading in a narrow range as
investors waited for details of the Treasury's refunding next week, writes
Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 10.73 higher at 3,234.12 on
unexceptional volume of 182.1m shares. Advancing issues had a very slim edge
on those declining.
Among broader market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.74 higher to
close at 409.53. On Friday, the Dow closed 21.47 lower at 3,223.39.
There was little reaction to the release of the purchasing managers report
for January or to a decline in US construction spending in December, both of
which painted a picture of a contracting economy.
Drug companies dominated big board trading. Glaxo eased Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 30 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb held steady at Dollars 79 7/8 and
Upjohn added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 43 on the back of a positive analysts'
comments about preliminary studies of the company's lazaroid drug.
Digital Equipment advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 1/8 after Merrill
Lynch highlighted the buying opportunity of the stock and raised its rating.
Ashland Coal rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 31 1/4 after the company said it
would buy Dal-Tex Coal for Dollars 250m. Up to Dollars 50m can be paid in
stock.
Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco was one of the most heavily-traded issues
on the New York Stock Exchange, adding Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 . The
company turned in fourth quarter net earnings of Dollars 368m or 22 cents a
share compared with a net loss of Dollars 429m or Dollars 1.11 a year
earlier.
Safeway edged Dollars  5/8 lower to Dollars 18 after turning in
disappointing fourth quarter results. Among actively-traded blue chip
issues, IBM advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 91 3/8 , Mobil added Dollars
1/4 to Dollars 64 1/8 and Pepsico lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 1/2 .
Dow Chemical edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 54 1/8 while Corning
advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 63 7/8 after Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint
venture, turned in fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 28.9m including a
Dollars 25m pre-tax charge for costs associated with the company's silicone
breast implants.
US Biosciences was one of the biggest losers of the day on the American
Stock Exchange, plunging Dollars 13 1/2 to Dollars 17 3/4 after its ethyol
drug for use in chemotherapy failed to get Food &amp; Drug Administration
approval.
In the secondary market, the Nasdaq composite rose 3.22 to 623.43 in late
trading. Alliance Pharmaceutical was one of the most active over-the-counter
stocks, jumping Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 following favourable
comments on the stock on a television programme.
Microsoft climbed Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 125 on news of a corporate
restructuring. Among other active over-the-counter issues, Apple Computer
rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 3/4 and Intel eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 59
3/4 .
Advanced Interventional jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 19. The stock was halted
on Friday ahead of news that the FDA had approved its angioplasty laser
system.
Canada
TORONTO ended a lacklustre session showing little change. The TSE-300 was
down 1.72 to 3594.40. Declines led advances by 291 to 269. At 24.9m shares,
volume was similar to Friday's 24.7m, while trading value was CDollars
272.7m, up from CDollars 296.7m.
Canadian Pacific, which announced a fourth quarter loss of CDollars 887.6m,
closed up CDollars  1/8 , at CDollars 18 1/8 .
Renaissance Energy fell CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 13 1/4 after reporting
lower fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.

FT  04 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German steel pay settlement
fails to inspire bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS OF a settlement in the German steel pay dispute failed to inspire
continental bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT ended mixed. After a burst of enthusiasm on news that a steel
strike had been avoided, with the FAZ index rising 5.52 to 688.69 at
midsession, the DAX closed just 1.52 higher at 1,689.01, well below its high
of 1,698.74. Volume rose from DM6.5bn to DM7bn.
Some traders said that the 6.4 per cent pay rise for steelworkers was likely
to be seen as a benchmark for forthcoming settlements, others that steel was
effectively the last of the 1991 pay round and did not set a pattern for
1992. Steel shares put in a mixed performance, with Mannesmann rising DM3 to
DM354 and Thyssen, which has gained on a series of analysts' meetings
recently, up by only 50 pfg to DM220.50.
Meanwhile, the lifting of the strike threat helped some car shares as fears
evaporated that automotive output might be hurt by stoppages at key
suppliers. BMW gained DM5.50 at DM541.50; but Daimler Benz, which had
earlier risen by DM5.80 to DM755, ended 30 pfg up at DM749.50 and Volkswagen
rose 50 pfg to DM338, off its high of DM341.
The progressive ebbing of enthusiasm seemed to continue in London, where
Daimler had lost DM3 of its DM5.50 gain by the late afternoon close. Most of
the other German blue chips were given similar treatment.
PARIS had a generally unexciting day. Volume fell back sharply to FFr1.7bn
after Friday's FFr4.8bn, which was bloated by month-end option expiries.
After opening marginally weaker, an afternoon fall in the bond market pushed
the CAC-40 index down by 18.27 to close at 1,856.98. Among large-capital
shares, Alcatel fell FFr14 to FFr574 and UAP dropped FFr19 to FFr529, but
dealers attributed the declines to position-squaring after Friday's
options-related activity.
One of the day's biggest fallers was the media company Hachette which slid
FFr7.80 or 4.8 per cent to FFr170, as the market waited to see who would
rescue the bankrupt television company La Cinq, in which Hachette has a 25
per cent stake.
Also on the downtrend was L'Oreal which fell FFr8 to FFr720 in relatively
high volume of 62,390 shares. Dealers said the share had been hit recently
by a decision by investors to sell stocks on a high rating. News of
disappointing French perfume sales in 1991 prompted further selling.
MILAN lost its early highs as last week's approval of legislation on
takeovers failed to have much consequence.
The Comit index rose 3.32 to 544.69 in turnover estimated at around L80bn
after Friday's L103.7bn. Trading was dominated by domestic operators.
Dealers were generally disappointed by the details of Ferruzzi's planned
merger of its subsidiaries Eridania and Beghin Say. Their main complaint was
that the way the merger was presented made it impossible to make any
earnings valuations. Shares in Montedison, which is seen as the main
beneficiary of the restructuring, gained L20 to L1,365 but Eridania tumbled
L120 to L7,090.
Pirelli rose L55 to L1,230 ahead of its capital-raising operation. Also in
industrials, Fiat was unchanged at L5,101 in spite of the growing collection
of 'sell' notes issued by UK brokers in the wake of its poor 1991 results.
Kleinwort Benson said yesterday that the results did not allow a change of
its negative fundamental stance on the car company.
STOCKHOLM fell in thin trade ahead of the 1991 results season, led off today
by Electrolux, whose profits could be down by a quarter, or more.
Electrolux B were flat on the day at SKr236 but the Affarsvarlden General
index fell 7.4 to 962.7.
Volvo B fell SKr5 to SKr376; it said that its car sales, in unit terms, fell
by 14 per cent last year.
The worst performing sector was insurance, down 2.3 per cent with Skandia
down another SKr1 at SKr153. Skandia said yesterday that falling property
prices and insurance losses had reduced its net assets from SKr210 to about
SKr188 a share.
AMSTERDAM looked towards Germany for most of the day: the CBS Tendency Index
rose just 0.6 to 122.3 with gains evenly spread. Turnover was Fl 524.7m.
The software group, Volmac, was the most active stock, putting on Fl 1.50 or
5.5 per cent to Fl 29 on turnround prospects.
Royal Dutch slipped Fl 0.10 to Fl 145.40, recovering from a low of Fl 144.20
following Friday's news of losses at US subsidiary Shell Oil. Grolsch gave
details of its acquisition of a UK brewer: it declined Fl 2.90 to Fl 180.
Elsevier continued its strong advance, gaining Fl 1.10 to Fl 109.10, a new
high.
OSLO weakened almost 2 per cent as the all-share index fell 8.31 to 438.57.
Elkem, the metals producer, continued to fall in spite of a settlement in
the German steel dispute: its A shares fell NKr6.5 to NKr57.
VIENNA firmed to its highest level in four months. The all-share Vienna
Bourse Index rose 4.61 to 460.44 and the 18-share ATX index added 11.19 to
1,014.01.
ISTANBUL fell for the fifth consecutive day: the 75-share index was down
198.16, or 4 per cent, at 4,728.03.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: German bunds slide after early gains on
pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and KAREN ZAGOR

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS yesterday of a pay deal for German steelworkers pushed German
government bonds down and out of their recent trading range yesterday in
heavy volume. At the opening, news that a compromise had been reached,
averting the threat of a strike after the uncertainty of recent weeks,
pushed up bunds, with the March contract on Liffe opening higher at 88.18.
But details of the deal, when they emerged, quickly changed sentiment. Some
aspects seemed to suggest that the deal will have little application to the
current German pay round: the full 6.4 per cent pay rise does not take
effect until this autumn, and applies only to 130,000 workers.
However, the market was not slow to grasp the underlying message, that the
Bundesbank's upper limit for pay rises of 6 per cent could well prove to be
a floor for future deals. That pushed back hopes of an interest rate cut
this spring.
Bunds held up well in early trading, hardly testing the floor of 88.03 above
which the Liffe futures contract has been trading recently. At one stage,
the futures had risen to 88.32. However, in early afternoon trade the market
moved swiftly down to breach its technical support level. It eventually fell
to 87.87.
FEARS of supply in the coming weeks haunted the UK government bond market
yesterday, though gilts remained generally firm. After recent issuance,
traders were left guessing whether the Bank of England would choose to fund
next year's needs in advance, and if so, at what maturity.
Guesses were split between issuance at the short end on the one hand, and a
smattering of issues across short, medium and long maturities on the other.
Only the ten-year level, where there has been a recent issue, is clear of
the threat of immediate supply. In light trading, the benchmark gilt
maturing in 2003/07 moved up  1/32 at 115 27/32 , for a yield of 9.395 per
cent.
IN THIN trading, Japanese government bonds closed marginally down on the
day. With the next interest rate cut already fully discounted by the market,
traders said little new economic news was likely to set a new direction for
the market until the next Tankan survey of industrial expectations, due a
month from now.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance announced measures aimed at supporting
the flagging Japanese stock markets, leading to some switching into
equities. The benchmark no 129, which opened at a yield of 5.33 per cent,
closed at its low of the day of 5.37 per cent.
US Treasuries were weighed by concern about Wednesday's Treasury refund ing
announcement and failed to post gains yesterday morning in spite of signs of
continued weakness in the manufacturing sector.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was  5/16 lower at
102 5/32 yielding 7.81 per cent, while shorter-dated maturities posted
slimmer losses.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange three-day matched
sales when Fed funds were trading at 3 15/16 per cent. Although the move was
unexpected, it was seen as a technical measure to address a daily drain
need.
Treasuries firmed briefly yesterday morning on news that US construction
spending had fallen 0.2 per cent in December when most economists expected
an increase of 0.5 per cent. Also, the purchasing managers report for
January provided further evidence of an eroding economy.
But the overriding concern of the bond market remains the amount of
financing required by the government, to be announced on Wednesday.
In the high-yield junk bond market, Macy was one of the few active issues
yesterday morning. The company's 14.5 per cent subordinated debentures rose
about  3/4 point on rumours that Mr Laurence Tisch, CBS chairman, might make
a second takeover bid for the retailer.
Macy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week after a bid by Mr
Tisch failed.

FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Nissan to close Australian
assembly plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER and BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN MOTOR, the Japanese carmaker, said yesterday that it would close its
unprofitable Australian assembly plant at Clayton, Victoria, with a loss of
1,800 jobs by October.
The decision, while not entirely a surprise, is unusual for Nissan and
extremely unusual for any Japanese company, where lifetime employment is
common.
The company plans to become a car importer in Australia, but will maintain
manufacture of components and castings from a plant in the Melbourne suburb
of Dandenong, mainly for export.
Nissan said its hand was forced by the policy changes of the Australian
government last year, which brought down import tariffs to improve the
competitiveness of the Australian car industry.
Mr Yoshikazu Hanawa, executive vice-president, said in Tokyo that the
Australian government's plan to reduce tariffs from 35 per cent to 15 per
cent by the year 2000 made the operation no longer viable. The Australian
manufacturing operation had been plagued by cost and quality problems.
Nissan has been hit by the prolonged Australian recession. Nissan's
Australian production declined from 53,000 vehicles in fiscal 1990 to an
expected 33,000 vehicles in fiscal 1991, which ends in March. The Australian
subsidiary posted a Y12.5bn (Dollars 101.62m) loss last year and is expected
to post a similar loss in the current fiscal year.
The Japanese company's withdrawal from Australia will leave US-owned Ford
and General Motors and Japanese-controlled Toyota and Mitsubishi as
Australian car manufacturers. But many industry analysts believe at least
one of these will also be forced to quit this decade.
Toyota has cut Australian employment by 900 workers in the past two years
through voluntary redundancies. It is currently building a new manufacturing
facility which will largely replace existing outmoded plant and lead to
further job losses.
Ford let some 1,600 workers go at the end of 1990.
Nissan said it would incur a Y40bn extraordinary loss as a result of the
plant closure but that this would be offset by asset sales elsewhere in the
group.

</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S telecommunications company, BCE, is near its goal of winning
control of Teleglobe, the overseas telephone and data monopoly.
BCE cannot, by law, own more than one-third of Teleglobe, a regulated
utility. It now has four directors in Teleglobe's boardroom, and for two
years has tried to arrange alliances with other large shareholders to oust
Teleglobe's management.
It fears Teleglobe in non-friendly hands could divert heavy overseas voice
and data traffic to competitive systems, including US companies.
BCE owns the largest telecommunications utility, Bell Canada, and, with
several other telephone companies, effectively runs the domestic system.
The battle came to a head yesterday at a Teleglobe board meeting. Following
an alliance with directors representing other big Teleglobe share-holders,
BCE succeeded in getting Mr Charles Sirois appointed Teleglobe chief
executive. He is thought to be friendly to BCE.
Mr Sirois will head a president's office at Teleglobe, and a new board of
directors will be proposed at Teleglobe's annual meeting this spring.

<TEXT>
SEVERAL significant Japanese companies are expressing interest in a
revolutionary new system of delivering feature films direct to homes.
Electronic video hire could turn out to be a powerful rival to both
satellite subscription film channels and shops.
Mr William Kraven, an American entrepreneur and founder of EMC2 -
Entertainment Made Convenient - is hoping to get his business off the ground
in Japan and then move to joint ventures in the UK and other European
countries.
Under the EMC2 proposal, a customer would be able to order a film and have
it downloaded to a special receiver in five minutes. Using the capacity of
six satellite channels, 200 different feature films could be delivered
electronically to customers across a continent.
'We don't see ourselves as being in the movie rental business. We are in the
digital distribution business,' said Mr Kraven, who emphasised that the
technology - digital compression - already exists to turn his venture into a
reality.
Mr Kraven, who has been working on the idea for more than three years, is
currently in negotiations with Bandi, the large Japanese toy company; NTT,
the national telecommunications organisation; and several leading Japanese
consumer electronics manufacturers. Sanwa Bank has also expressed interest
and has introduced Mr Kraven to other potential investors in Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT drop in operating earnings from the ABC Television Network
contributed to a 34.5 per cent decline in fourth-quarter 1991 net profits at
Capital Cities/ABC, the US television and newspapers group.
Profits were Dollars 103.2m, or Dollars 6.17 a share, on revenues 1 per cent
higher at Dollars 1.56bn. Operating income in the quarter fell to Dollars
260.2m from Dollars 297.4m in the same period of 1990.
Mr Daniel Burke, chief executive, said the company's advertiser-supported
businesses continue to be affected by the recession. Net revenues for ABC
and other television operations declined in the quarter, while ABC's drop in
operating income was described as 'substantial.'
The fourth-quarter net would have been Dollars 31.2m but for charges related
to the redemption of subordinated debentures. The net, however, would have
still been 14.7 per cent lower.
For the whole of 1991, net income fell by 28.1 per cent to Dollars 343.5m,
or Dollars 20.47 a share, and group revenues were down marginally at Dollars
5.38bn. Operating income for 1991 was Dollars 761.2m, down from Dollars
923.2m in 1990.
McGraw-Hill, the US publishing and information services group that owns
Business Week magazine, yesterday reported a 14.2 per cent decline in 1991
full-year net income to Dollars 148m, or Dollars 3.03 a share, on unchanged
revenues of Dollars 1.9bn.
For the last quarter, net profit fell by 11.8 per cent to Dollars 45.4m, or
93 cents, on revenues 1.8 per cent up at Dollars 568.1m.

CHUBB, the US property-casualty insurer, made a Dollars 552m profit after

Underwriting profits in the property-casualty business eased from Dollars
20.7m to Dollars 18.6m, but the previous year's results were boosted by a

after charges

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, the California supermarket chain which was subject to a Dollars
4.2bn leveraged buy-out bid in 1986, yesterday reported a fall in profits
last year to Dollars 54.9m after a series of special items cost the company
Dollars 78.2m.
Last year, the group made a profit of Dollars 87.1m
The most significant of these was Dollars 71m reserve, taken because of
liabilities related to its former Houston division. Safeway sold this
operation to AppleTree Markets, which last month filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
The Californian company had assigned certain leases to AppleTree but may be
liable if AppleTree fails to make rental payments on these.
Safeway also saw a Dollars 24.1m extraordinary loss from the early
retirement of certain debt, partly offset by a Dollars 16.9m gain taken
following the sale of shares by Vons Companies, another supermarket group in
which Safeway has a 35 per cent stake.
Safeway neither bought nor sold shares during the offering.
However, even at the operating profit level and with the AppleTree charge
added back, Safeway made Dollars 548.3m in 1991, only modestly increased
from the Dollars 535.3m seen in 1990.
Sales for the year were Dollars 15.1bn, up by 1.7 per cent on 1990, but
same-store sales were virtually flat, and actually declined by 1.2 per cent
in the final quarter.
Mr Peter Magowan, chairman, said the recession had 'run deeper and longer
than most experts forecast' and that it had been increasingly difficult to
generate sales growth.
The company, which operates 1,100 stores and counts as one of the largest
food retailers in the US and Canada, spent Dollars 635m on capital
expenditure during the year, opening 32 new stores and completing 77
remodels. Net earnings were helped by a fall in the interest charge, from
Dollars 384.1m to Dollars 355.4m.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the US tobacco and food group which was subject to a Dollars
25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, has posted full-year profits of Dollars 368m
after tax, compared with a net loss of Dollars 462m in 1990.
But the bulk of the improvement came from the company's successful debt
reduction programme, with net interest expenses for the year down to Dollars
2.11bn from Dollars 3bn. The group's 'business unit contribution' -
operating profits before the amortisation of trademarks and goodwill - rose
more modestly, from Dollars 3.43bn to Dollars 3.54bn, and in the final
quarter actually declined slightly to Dollars 904m from Dollars 928m.
During the past 12 months, the company has undertaken various refinancings
aimed at replacing debt either by equity or cheaper loan capital. The steady
improvement of the balance sheet since the buy-out has allowed RJR Nabisco
to shed its 'highly leveraged transaction' status, winning access to cheaper
bank finance. Yesterday, RJR shares gained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 .
Domestic tobacco operations remained under competitive pressure, with lower
volumes and higher marketing costs outstripping the benefit of price
increases and favourable raw material costs. Net sales for the full year
rose 1 per cent, but business unit contribution fell 4 per cent.
The international tobacco side, however, fared much better, adding volume in
Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Net sales there increased by 19 per cent
in 1991, while business unit contribution was up by 21 per cent. Overall,
tobacco's business unit contribution for the year was static at Dollars
2.73bn.
On the food front, net sales for the year increased by 11 per cent to
Dollars 6.45bn, while business unit contribution totalled Dollars 920m,
against Dollars 802m. However, this is partially distorted by disposals and
by the contrasting consolidation of Latin American operations in 1991. The
company said that, after allowing for this, net sales rose 2 per cent and
business unit contribution was up 8 per cent.
The food side, said RJR, saw the benefit of lower commodity costs and
productivity gains, but this was offset in part by lower volumes.

<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the US pharmaceutical company whose best-selling Halcion sleeping
pill has stirred up an international debate over the drug's safety,
yesterday reported record sales and earnings for 1991.
Sales of Halcion, banned in the UK in the autumn on concern about drug's
side-effects, dropped 23 per cent in the quarter and 1 per cent in the year.
Before the controversy, Halcion, Upjohn's second best selling product, had
estimated annual sales of Dollars 240m.
Upjohn's fourth-quarter net income rose 13 per cent to Dollars 136.4m, or 73
cents a share, from Dollars 121m, or 64 cents, a year ago. Sales rose 14 per
cent to Dollars 911.4m from Dollars 798.7m.
For the year, net earnings advanced 18 per cent to Dollars 537.4m, or
Dollars 2.87 a share, on sales up 13 per cent at Dollars 3.4bn.
On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 42 3/4 in
fairly heavy trading. The stock was bolstered by positive comments from
analysts about preliminary studies on the company's lazaroid drug.
There remains concern, however, about declining Halcion sales and the lack
of new drugs in Upjohn's pipeline. Many of Upjohn's most important drugs
will lose their patents by the end of 1994. 'They have a difficult time in
front of them unless they can get some new products,' said Mr Sam Isaly, an
analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly.

Lockheed and Marietta

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LTV, the steel group which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since 1986, has
agreed in principle to sell its aircraft and missiles businesses to a
newly-formed company jointly owned by defence contractors Lockheed and
Martin Marietta.
LTV put its defence businesses up for auction in May last year as part of
its plan to reorganise its finances and emerge from bankruptcy.
A joint venture bid by rival aerospace companies is unusual and some
analysts argue it could form a precedent others could follow as the US
defence industry enters a period of consolidation.
The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but the joint venture is
believed to have offered over Dollars 350m for the business, which employs
16,000 people and has sales of Dollars 2bn. Other companies believed to have
been interested in all or parts of the group include Thomson of France.
The deal is still subject to bankruptcy court approval and it is possible
rival bidders could put in a fresh offer. The LTV business makes missiles
for the Pentagon's strategic defence initiative and is also involved in the
fabrication of large parts for the C-17 military transport and Boeing
civilian aircraft.
Lockheed yesterday reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 103m, or
Dollars 1.63 a share, up 4 per cent from the Dollars 99m, or Dollars 1.57,
in the same period of 1990. Sales dipped 7 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn.
Operating profits from the missiles and space sector dipped from Dollars
110m to Dollars 88m, while technological services fell from Dollars 15m to
Dollars 9m and electronic systems from Dollars 15m to Dollars 13. But
aeronautical systems profits rose from Dollars 41m to Dollars 75m.
Full-year net earnings were Dollars 308m, or Dollars 4.86 a share, on sales
of Dollars 9.8bn, compared with Dollars 335m, or Dollars 5.30, on sales of
Dollars 9.9bn. Mr Dan Tellep, chairman, noted that non-Department of Defence
revenues rose from 26 to 30 per cent of the total and he expected this trend
to continue.

PATHE Communications, the parent company of the financially crippled MGM
Hollywood studio, yesterday named new executives, including Mr Alan Ladd,
Jr, as a co-chairman, writes Alan Friedman.
The board meeting was the first since a Delaware court gave Credit Lyonnais,
the French state bank, the right to expand the board and suspend members who
had been appointed by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier who
bought MGM in 1990.

<TEXT>
CBS, the loss-making US television network, is believed to be offering deep
discounts to US advertisers in an effort to fill advertising slots for the
winter Olympic games, which begin next weekend in Albertville, France,
writes Alan Friedman.
Mr George Schweitzer, senior vice-president of marketing, said he would not
comment on pricing policies, nor on a report in Advertising Age, the US
trade publication, that yesterday quoted buyers who estimated that CBS was
offering prime time advertising slots for as much as 40 per cent below
normal Olympic rates.

An agreement was meant to have been reached by mid-January.

DOW CORNING, the US maker of silicon breast implants and at the centre of a
controversy over their safety, yesterday reported a 35.3 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter 1991 net profit, to Dollars 28.9m, writes Alan Friedman.
The Michigan-based company, which is jointly owned by Dow Chemical, the
large chemicals group, and Corning, the glass products maker, said the
fourth-quarter results included a previously announced Dollars 25m pre-tax
charge related to the breast implant business.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 472.3m, compared with Dollars 449.2m in
the last quarter of 1990.
For the whole of 1991,Dow Corning's net income declined to Dollars 152.9m
from Dollars 171.1m the previous year. Revenues in 1991 were Dollars 1.85bn,
compared with Dollars 1.72bn in 1990.

CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resource and industrial holding company,
yesterday unveiled a record final loss of CDollars 913.8m (USDollars
780.9m), or CDollars 2.87 a share, for 1991 after heavy special charges. The
group turned in a profit of CDollars 355.3m, or CDollars 1.11, a year
earlier.
The 1991 loss included about CDollars 900m in special charges, including a
CDollars 290.8m writedown on an investment in Laidlaw, the waste management
group, and its CDollars 101m share of Laidlaw's writedown of an investment
in ADT.
The group's total revenues for 1991 were CDollars 10bn, against CDollars
10.4bn a year earlier.
In the fourth quarter, the final net loss was CDollars 887.6m, or CDollars
2.79, including the special charges. In 1990, there was a profit of CDollars
103.2m, or 32 cents.
The company said the special charges had arisen from 'decisions to
rationalise operations and reassess asset values'. The group was hard hit
across the board by the North American recession.
The special charges also included amounts to cover plant shutdowns,
workforce reductions and severance agreements in the group's rail, pulp and
paper, and property operations, and also in its oil and gas subsidiary.
The only offsetting factor was CDollars 64.4m in gains from the sale of
assets. Before the special items, the year showed a loss of CDollars 16.2m
overall.
The railway was hit by lower commodity movements, except for export grain.
Property, waste management, hotels, ships, trucks and manufacturing all bore
the brunt of the recession, but telecommunications did slightly better.

FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Famous face of fashion wears
well in tough times - The house of Yves St Laurent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to avoid Mr Yves St Laurent in Paris these days. The face of
France's most famous fashion designer is splashed across magazines and
television screens following yesterday's party to celebrate the 30th
anniversary of his fashion house, a 'fete de famille' for 2,800 guests at
the glossy new Opera Bastille.
The 30th birthday comes at a critical time for St Laurent. It, like the rest
of the global luxury goods industry, has spent the past year struggling
against the parallel problems of economic recession and the backlash against
the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s.
'Life has been difficult, but not disastrous,' said Mr Pierre Berge,
president of YSL. 'The first half of this year will be tough, but there are
already signs of recovery. The second half should not be too bad at all.'
Mr Berge has worked with Mr St Laurent since the very beginning. They met in
the late 1950s, when Mr St Laurent was a precociously gifted young designer
at Christian Dior, one of the most prestigious houses in Paris. In 1960, Mr
St Laurent was drafted into the French army to fight in the Algerian war. He
broke down, unable to cope with army life. Mr Berge rescued him from a
military hospital outside Paris. In the meantime, Dior had found a new
designer. Mr St Laurent sued and used his Pounds 48,000 (Dollars 86,880)
damages to found his own house.
Mr Yves St Laurent is now an institution in French fashion. He is cast in
the role of the tortured genius, so shy and so sensitive that he sometimes
does not even attend his own shows. Rarely a season goes by without rumours
running around that he is too ill or too depressed to work. Mr Berge once
described him as being 'born with a nervous breakdown'.
Mr Berge, or 'Pierre the Panther', as the French press call him, is seen as
the business brains, the efficient eminence grise behind the scenes.
Recently, he has become more prominent through his role as head of the three
Paris opera houses and his friendship with President Francois Mitterrand.
The mere mention of his name is an anathema to right wing industrialists, to
whom 'Pierre the Panther' is a prime mover in 'La Gauche Caviar', France's
sybaritic socialists.
Even his critics concede that Mr Berge has turned St Laurent into a
financial success. He was one of the first in the fashion industry to forge
links with the mainstream business community. In 1986, he did a deal with Mr
Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, which enabled St Laurent to
buy back its perfumes. Three years later, St Laurent became the first
publicly-quoted fashion house when it floated on the Paris stock market.
Today, at a time when so many fashion designers have been subsumed into
luxury goods conglomerates such as Mr Bernard Arnault's LVMH and Mr Henri
Racamier's Orcofi, St Laurent is not only independent, but one of the very
few houses to own its own perfumes.
The company now generates annual sales of more than FFr3bn. Four-fifths of
its turnover comes from perfume and cosmetics. Haute couture, the business
with which it began 30 years ago, musters little more than 1 per cent of
overall sales.
Last year, St Laurent suffered a slight fall in profits when the disruption
of the Gulf war aggravated the depressive effects of the recession.
Cholet-Dupont, the Paris stockbroker, forecasts a fall in net profits from
FFr252m (Dollars 46.6m) in 1990 to FFr236m in 1991, with a modest recovery
this year to FFr258m as the luxury goods market moves out of the doldrums.
Once the recession is over, St Laurent will face a new set of challenges in
the increasingly competitive luxury goods industry. Just as groups like LVMH
have invested in high fashion, so the giant consumer goods companies, such
as Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, have expanded in its other areas of
activity, perfume and cosmetics.
These companies have deployed their huge research resources and hefty
marketing budgets to raise the cost of competing in St Laurent's main
markets. This means that its future expansion projects will not only be more
difficult, but also more expensive.
St Laurent's recent foray into skin care involved a significant investment
in research facilities. The proposed launch of a new perfume next year will
be accompanied by heavy advertising, although Mr Berge insists St Laurent
will 'not spend crazy sums - Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m - like our
competitors'.
In the long term, the increasingly competitive state of the luxury good
industry may make it difficult for St Laurent to retain its independence.
This, coupled with the inevitable questions as to who will succeed Mr St
Laurent and Mr Berge could prompt the company to forge links with other
groups so it can share their resources.
'Eventually we may have to find an ally,' said Mr Berge. 'But we would have
to be careful, very careful in choosing the right one.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Peter Black drops to Pounds 4.52m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ILL effects of recession on the footwear and accessories business of
Peter Black Holdings showed through in a 15 per cent fall to Pounds 4.52m
pre-tax profit in the six months to November 30.
The reduction, from Pounds 5.31m, came on turnover of Pounds 60.5m (Pounds
77m). About Pounds 14m of the sales fall was accounted for by shedding the
home furnishings and rubber-soled slipper activities.
Mr Stephen Lister, finance director of the Keighley-based company, said that
turnover on a like-for-like basis was down 5 per cent. Sales to Marks and
Spencer, which accounted for about 60 per cent of last year's total, had
been less badly affected than those to other retailers.
Net debt had been reduced by a further Pounds 4m to Pounds 10.5m, which
meant it had virtually halved since November 1990. Gearing had come down to
29 per cent. Stocks had been reduced from Pounds 23m to Pounds 16m.
A little more than half the turnover lay in the footwear and accessories
division. Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman with his brother Thomas, said
accessories had been the worst affected by recession.
The group's share of the footwear market had been maintained and he was
optimistic about demand from Marks and Spencer, which was increasing its
presence in women's shoes.
The division's operating margin was below the group average of 9.5 per cent.
A better return was made by personal care, including toiletries, cosmetics
and dietary supplements, accounting for 35 per cent of sales. Its half-year
result was, however, affected by the Pounds 200,000 cost of closing a
factory and transferring production to Trowbridge.
At English Grains, the private label business was being developed alongside
such brands as Natracalm and Red Kooga Ginseng.
Mr Black said no improvement in trading was expected until well into this
year, leaving profit prospects flat for the second half.
Earnings per share fell to 5.56p (6.63p). The interim dividend is held at
0.77p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Embassy Property Group said it was close to agreement with its main banks on
reducing its debt burden. Directors said broad principles of agreement had
been reached which could only be completed with a capital injection.
The main terms include a forgiveness of the breach of covenants and a
'waiver of interest on the majority of debt for a substantial period'
together with a significant debt write-off and conversion into shares. It is
hoped that discussions with potential investors and existing shareholders to
raise new capital should be completed shortly.
At the same time the USM-quoted group announced pre-tax losses for the year
to March 31 of Pounds 9.49m (profits of Pounds 1.26m) after making a Pounds
6.64m provision against work in progress and investment properties.
There is no dividend for the year with the final being passed. Last year
payments totalled 5p.
Turnover was Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 21.8m). Losses per share were 121.9p
compared with earnings of 10.1p.

<TEXT>
SIR Edward du Cann, who last August stepped down as chairman of Lonrho,
yesterday resigned as a director of the international trading group.
A former chairman of the Conservative party, Sir Edward was forced to step
down as chairman last year after the Department of Trade and Industry said
it was applying to have him disqualified as a company director.
It is understood that Sir Edward, aged 67, decided to resign as a director
because he was not as fully occupied in his post as he was when he was
chairman.
There was also little possibility of him holding the Lonrho chair again.
The DTI yesterday said the move to have Sir Edward disqualified - because of
his involvement in Homes Assured, a mortgage broker which collapsed in
September 1989 - was unlikely to come to fruition within the year.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon targets James Wilkes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETROCON, the engineering and surveying group, yesterday launched a hostile
Pounds 36.6m paper bid for James Wilkes, the acquisitive engineer which is
also the world's largest manufacturer of beer mats.
The offer of 13 new Petrocon shares for every three of Wilkes' values the
target's stock at 199.3p. Petrocon's shares held steady after the
announcement to close at 46p. Wilkes's shares rose 5p to 182p.
Mr Stephen Hinchliffe, Wilkes chairman, attacked the offer as an 'unwelcome
and damaging intrusion to James Wilkes' development'. It 'significantly
undervalues (its) present profits and performance', he said.
Mr Colin Robinson, Petrocon chairman, said, however, that Wilkes' gearing
and overheads had been allowed to reach 'excessive levels'. Petrocon, which
has a 2.84 per cent stake in Wilkes, claimed to have received the support of
investors holding 29.1 per cent of the target.
Mr Robinson said there were synergies in the companies' engineering
divisions. One of Wilkes' main subsidiaries is Floform, the spark plug
electrode maker, bought from Hollis Industries in 1989 when Mr Robinson was
chief executive there. Petrocon makes and distributes valves and pipe
fittings.
Mr Hinchliffe dismissed the synergy claim, saying: 'To put these businesses
together is basically having just James Wilkes.' The company had embarked on
a programme in December to 'substantially cut gearing', he added.
Petrocon also yesterday announced an agreed Pounds 2.68m offer for Beverley,
an engineering, software and management services company controlled by Mr
Robinson and three other Petrocon directors.
Mr Robinson, who set up Beverley in 1989, holds 70 per cent of the smaller
company and will earn about Pounds 2m in cash and Petrocon shares through
the deal. The directors have agreed to retain the Petrocon shares until
1993.
If both offers are accepted, the new stock issued would represent 69.1 per
cent of Petrocon's share capital.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merlin International Properties, the troubled Isle of Man-based company,
announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.3m for the year to June 30, against
Pounds 25.9m previously.
The company is dependent upon the support of its bankers. Its auditors have
prepared the accounts on a going concern basis, saying the company's
continued trading relies on the successful implementation of its corporate
plan.
'There is no prospect of our shares being relisted until we can show that
the company has achieved financial stability and secured a viable future,'
the company said.
Merlin made exceptional and extraordinary provisions of Pounds 15.3m against
Australian and US interests. In particular, it put Pounds 4.9m for
non-payment of a debt from the Hayson Group, Pounds 3m against the
investment in the Enterprise Development Company in the US, and a Pounds
3.2m extraordinary charge for a debt from a former subsidiary now in
liquidation.
Losses per share were 84.4p (105.6p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a 54 per cent rise in operating profits, Kelt Energy, the
restructured independent UK and US oil and gas company, fell steeply into
the red in the six months to September 30 after an even more sharp turnround
in exchange rate differences.
Pre-tax losses emerged at Pounds 4.13m (profits Pounds 6.9m) and were struck
on increased turnover of Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 16.8m).
Operating profits of Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.33m) were turned into losses at
the pre-tax level by a deficit of Pounds 4.28m (credit of Pounds 12.3m) from
exchange rate differences, although net interest payable was reduced to
Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 6.75m).
In the year to March 31 1991, taxable losses amounted to Pounds 154.3m after
a Pounds 150.8m exceptional charge.
Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman, said that during the six months Kelt had
completed the repayment of is debt via the disposal of its 7.5 per cent
interest in Wytch Farm, the Dorset oilfield, and its non-US international
assets. These resulted in an extraordinary profit of Pounds 120.1m.

Abbey National, the retail banking group, is setting up its own retail

The operation, which will be based at Sheffield, marks a departure by Abbey
National from its traditional core business areas.
The share registration services will be introduced in the late summer of
1993 when Taurus, the electronic share record system, is introduced by the
Stock Exchange.
Its introduction will bring to an end Abbey National's link with Lloyds Bank
registrars which at present looks after the certification of its 3.5m
shareholders.
The bank will phase out its existing business with Sharelink by the end of
the year.
Mr Geoffrey Osbaldeston, commercial services director, said that the share
dealing service would operate by post and on an execution-only basis. Abbey
National branches will not handle the share dealing.

</HEADLINE>

In a difficult year, which took in the Gulf war and the deepening recession,
Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted transport and freight group, raised pre-tax
profits by 5 per cent, from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 1.66m.
Mr Chris Roth, chairman and chief executive, said the result for the 12
months to September 30 was achieved from an increased share of a falling and
more difficult market, as well as higher interest receivable (Pounds 788,000
net against Pounds 547,000) on cash resources.
Turnover showed little change at Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 17.3m) but operating
profit fell to Pounds 847,000 (Pounds 1.04m). Earnings were 12.05p (13.91p)
and the final dividend is 2.7p for a total of 4.2p (3.5p).
Mr Roth said in the first quarter of the current year profits were
marginally ahead. But he did not expect any marked improvement in results
for the rest of the year.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Franchises lift Harry Ramsden's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPANSION OF its franchise activities enabled Harry Ramsden's to increase
profits for the year to September 30 from Pounds 548,595 to Pounds 561,491.
Revenues from the franchises more than made up for a downturn at the
company's original restaurant in West Yorkshire.
The USM-quoted fish and chip restaurant company said that the brand had been
successfully established at Glasgow, Blackpool and Heathrow airport. Further
expansion is planned for this year with the possibility of openings in Hong
Kong and the Middle East.
It is also buying Merryweather's, a small chain of fish and chip shops.
Turnover, relating totally to the West Yorkshire restaurant. fell to Pounds
1.85m (Pounds 1.93m). Net interest received declined to Pounds 115,960
(Pounds 216,254) and there was a share of associates' losses of Pounds
5,971.
Earnings per share were 6.8p (6.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 3.5p
leaves an unchanged total of 4.5p. There was an extraordinary charge of
Pounds 34,275 covering the costs of moving from the Third Market to the USM.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Personal insurers close to settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS who underwrote a Pounds 20m personal accident policy for Mr Robert
Maxwell could reach a settlement within the next few days.
Representatives of Lloyd's syndicate 782 and the Continental insurance
company - representing insurers who underwrote the policy - met with Willis
Wrightson, the brokers acting on behalf of the Maxwell companies named on
the policy last week.
The insurers stand to pay out the full Pounds 20m only if it can be proved
that the publisher's death was due to an accident.
'I believe they have not been able to do so positively at this date,' Mr
John Fisher, claims manager of syndicate 782, told Reuters yesterday.
A report, prepared by Dr Iain West, an independent pathologist, and
commissioned by the insurers, has not determined conclusively how the media
magnate died when he went overboard from his yacht last November.
If the beneficiaries fail to prove their case the insurers are likely to
seek a negotiated settlement for a smaller sum.
'Although it would be wrong to prejudge what will happen it is not
necessarily pay or don't pay,' Mr Roger Rich, of Rich Wheeler, the loss
adjusters, which is acting on behalf of the insurers, said yesterday.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Union Intl nears deal on 3-year funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION INTERNATIONAL, the financially troubled trading arm of the Vestey
Group, one of the UK's largest private companies, said it has reached
agreement in principle with its bankers on the terms of a three-year funding
facility.
Union, which includes the Dewhurst butchers chain among its subsidiaries,
had been faced with the possibility of administration if it failed to agree
a rescheduling of loans totalling about Pounds 350m.
The group has been in discussion for several months with more than 70
international bankers. They have agreed to continue existing facilities as
an interim measure while details of the short-term financing arrangement are
being finalised.
'A lot of the spade work on that has been established. The fundamentals of
it have been agreed,' said Mr Tim Vestey, general manager of Vestey.
Mr Vestey last month handed over as Union's chief executive to Mr Terry
Robinson, formerly an executive director of Lonrho. The group had earlier
appointed Schroders as financial advisers as part of a set of proposals to
satisfy the banks that it had a viable business plan.
In return for the banks' support, the group has had forego dividend payments
on three of Union's cumulative preference stock units.
Based on the last dividend paid on the 10m shares, payment would have
amounted to about Pounds 500,000 per year, Mr Vestey said. The Vestey family
and associated trusts own about 10 per cent of the preference stocks.
Union is unlikely to publish its 1991 results until the three-year funding
facility has been agreed. Without agreement it is likely that its accounts
would be qualified.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Law Lords turn down Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN Maxwell has lost the final round of his legal battle to remain
silent about the whereabouts of Pounds 450m missing from Maxwell pension
funds.
Three Law Lords, sitting in private, yesterday unanimously dismissed Mr
Maxwell's written petition for leave to challenge last week's Appeal Court
ruling he must answer investigators' questions.
Mr Maxwell now has until 'close of business' on Wednesday to comply with a
High Court order made before Christmas requiring him to swear an affidavit
giving information about transactions involving pension fund money to Mr
Neil Cooper, provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management
(BIM), which managed Maxwell pension funds.
The order requires Mr Maxwell to tell Mr Cooper all he knows of any
transaction involving property funds or assets of BIM or of the common
investment fund managed by BIM from October 1989 to date. Mr Maxwell had
argued that he had the right to remain silent because of the risk that he
might incriminate himself in the face of possible criminal charges.
The Appeal Court ruled that, as a director of BIM, he was not entitled to
rely on the privilege against self incrimination when facing a reasonable
request for information under the terms of the 1986 Insolvency Act. It was
clear that Parliament had by implication intended that the privilege against
self incrimination should not be available to people facing questioning
under the act, which greatly extended the investigative powers available to
liquidators and expressly placed company directors and others under a duty
to assist them.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Cork Gully appointed as receivers at Astra Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA Holdings, the munitions and fireworks company, was put into
receivership yesterday.
Astra, which is being investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry
and had a brush with the Iraqi supergun affair via a disastrous Belgian
acquisition, owes Pounds 50m to five banks.
They could not agree on a restructuring of that debt and receivers from Cork
Gully were appointed yesterday to the parent company, but not to the main
operating companies in the US and UK.
The Pounds 50m facility was supposed to have been extended until June. It is
understood that the banks, led by First National Bank of Boston, initially
disagreed about calling in receivers, but all signed the document.
Mr Roy Barber, chairman, and Mr Tony McCann, chief executive, have spent
nearly two years sorting through the wreckage of a company which had accrued
Pounds 80m losses. Its annual sales are little more than that.
Mr McCann said: 'The five operating companies had all been brought back into
profit before interest payments. The pain of restructuring in bringing the
debt down to a realistic level would have been less than through this type
of action.'
The Pounds 50m syndicated loan dates back to 1988. It was organised by the
Bank of Boston and also involved Midland Bank and Hill Samuel. It followed
Astra's purchase of a British company called BMARC for Pounds 60m, twice the
amount raised in an associated rights issue.
Although Astra defaulted on the loan early in 1989, no mention of this was
made in a rights issue document that summer.
The main reason for the Pounds 36m issue was to fund the purchase of PRB, a
Belgian munitions company, but about a third of the proceeds went towards
reducing bank borrowing and strengthening Astra's assets. PRB has since
collapsed and has never been included in Astra's profit and loss account.
Another problem with the 1989 rights issue, which has been the focus of the
DTI inquiry, was that the forecast profit increase failed to materialise.
Indeed money was lost during the period of the issue in which the money was
raised. Five directors resigned from the board after the troubles emerged.
As a separate matter, Mr Christopher Gumbly, the former managing director,
was convicted of corruptly giving a car to a Ministry of Defence official.
Its share price was suspended at 3 1/4 p yesterday, giving the company a
market value of about Pounds 3m.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Courage sells Ruddles to Grolsch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURAGE, the UK arm of Foster's Brewing of Australia, has agreed to sell its
Ruddles real ale brewery and brands to Grolsch, the Dutch lager brewer.
Grolsch will fund the estimated Pounds 40m acquisition out of its own cash
resources.
Mr Michael Foster, Courage managing director, said yesterday that the deal,
which is subject to approval by the Office of Fair Trading, offered
'compelling benefits' to all three parties.
The acquisition is another step in Grolsch's strategy of building a strong
portfolio of premium beer brands in north-west Europe. It bought the
Wickuler group in Germany just over a year ago.
UK sales of Grolsch lager rose 20 per cent last year to about 165,000
barrels. The addition of Ruddles, which had a turnover last year of Pounds
30m, will give the group a foothold in the growing real ale market and a
platform for expansion.
The UK's premium lager and ale markets are together bigger than the total
Dutch beer market of 8m barrels.
Grolsch will retain the Ruddles staff of 127 but has no plans to brew its
lager at the Langham brewery in Leicestershire.
The Dutch brewer will take over responsibility for sales and marketing of
the Ruddles brands in the take-home trade but under a five-year,
non-exclusive agreement, Courage will continue to sell the beer to pubs and
clubs, which account for 70 per cent of volume sales.
The agreement with Grolsch allows Courage to sort out its extensive ales
portfolio. The group has been reviewing its brands - which include Courage,
John Smith's, Webster's and Wilson - and was expected to stop brewing one or
two of them.
Courage is also discussing with Grolsch possible arrangements for
distributing Foster's lager in the Netherlands. Grolsch has little
experience in handling imports into the Netherlands and has shown reluctance
to get involved, but Courage said yesterday that the Dutch brewer's
distribution network could be 'a valuable bonus' for Foster's growth in
Europe.
Foster's main European markets are Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and Italy.

FT  04 FEB 92 / A new Liffe together: Prospects for UK stock options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flood of young men and women in brightly coloured jackets who yesterday
poured on to the recently-opened London International Financial Futures
Exchange trading floor for the first time looked just like the futures
traders who have been dealing there since late last year.
But there was an important difference: yesterday's arrivals were the
stock-option traders of the London Traded Options Market, sharing premises
with the futures exchange ahead of the two organisations' merger, under the
Liffe banner, on March 20.
For the options traders, the move - and the merger - do not come a moment
too soon. The UK stock options market, under the wing of the stock exchange,
has been dying a slow death. Only the option on the FT-SE 100 index is
consistently heavily traded; the 67 options on individual stocks have been
dogged by low volume.
Retail investors have been virtually absent from the market since the stock
market crash of 1987. But the woes of the UK options market cannot be blamed
solely on stock market weakness. The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German
exchange, OM, the Swedish exchange and Holland's European Options Exchange
all traded more stock and stock index contracts than the LTOM last year.
Individual stock options are caught in a nasty bind: without enough demand
from UK financial institutions to create steady volume, investment banks are
unwilling to commit the resources to making liquid markets. Yet without such
liquidity, institutions are unlikely to be tempted in.
The merger with Liffe and the move to share premises mark the options
market's best hope of breaking out of this vicious circle. It will have an
immediate impact on the one part of the market that is already doing well:
the FT-SE index contract.
Many traders predict that volume in the FT-SE 100 stock index option could
double after the merger, partly because it will bring in Liffe members who
had not previously been involved in the options market.
'At the point of merger, with the influx of new members, the initial impact
will be on the FT-SE contract,' says Mr Tony de Guingand, chief executive of
LTOM, who will be finance director of the merged exchange.
The FT-SE options pit is situated about 20 yards from the pit where the
index futures are traded - a distance designed to make it tricky for futures
traders to work out the exact positions, and hence hedging needs, of options
traders, yet to allow the two products to feed each other.
'The juxtaposition of the two products (the FT-SE option and future) will
have a dramatic effect in boosting volume,' says Mr David Heron, head of
derivatives at James Capel.
There is less confidence about the future of individual stock option
trading. To bolster the market, a number of changes will come into force
when the merger takes place next month. The moves include concessions for
marketmakers which allow them to avoid stamp duty and to finance their
positions through the stock borrowing system, as well as other ways of
making the market work more smoothly.
In spite of these undoubted improvements, the merger almost failed because
it was hard to find enough firms willing to act as marketmakers in
individual stock options. In the end, six marketmakers came forward, but
dealers say that may not be enough to provide adequate liquidity.
The leading UK investment banks with large trading operations in the
underlying stock market will not be making markets on individual options.
They benefit from the tax and regulatory concessions offered to
marketmakers, since they make markets in the underlying stocks.
The larger houses had tried to shift trading of individual options on to a
screen-based system, which they believed would have reduced costs. But this
was vehemently opposed by trading firms such as City of London Options and
Hills Independent Traders. These firms won the battle to keep trading on the
exchange floor and have agreed to act as marketmakers, partly because of the
associated privileges.
But the threat of a move to a screen-based system has not gone away. If
trading volume in options fails to pick up, it will certainly be
reconsidered.
In the meantime, the new relationship is off to a stumbling start, as the
two markets live together but are not yet officially married. Until the
merger takes place, the shares which entitle holders to trade equity options
will not be issued, so some of the firms which subscribed are not yet
eligible to trade. In the meantime, only LTOM members can participate,
depriving the market of some new blood, including specialised derivatives
firms which have made their mark on Liffe, such as Kyte Futures.
Once the merged market is working fully, much depends on the participation
of UK fund managers, the logical mainstay of the market given the heavy
concentration of UK equities in their portfolios. They are focusing
increasing attention on derivative products, since the government's recent
clarification of legal and tax uncertainties, but have so far concentrated
their attention on index products.
Liffe expects about 50 new traders to become active in the market over the
next 12-18 months. Even if many of these are focusing on index options, the
influx of new participants will provide a fillip.
'I think we will see a substantial increase in index option trading, but
also a core of active stock options,' said Mr David Kyte, managing director
of Kyte Futures.
The move to the new floor, at Cannonbridge, a development close to Cannon
Street station in the City, removes the last vestiges of securities trading
from the floor of the London Stock Exchange, deserted by dealers in
underlying shares since Big Bang. Futures and stock index options traders
have successfully retained the face-to-face dealing that the stock market
has abandoned. For traders in individual stock options, the move and the
merger it heralds offer a last chance to match that success.

FT  04 FEB 92 / O &amp; Y seeks Pounds 215m from Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA and York, the Canadian property company, is considering raising
Pounds 215m from small investors for its Canary Wharf development, it
emerged last night.
The developers plan to do this by using a syndicated deal or enterprise zone
property trust. O &amp; Y will sell number 10 Cabot Square to the specially
created trust. Investors will then be offered the chance to buy units in the
property. They would eventually receive a proportionate share of the sale
price.
Mr Robert John, a director of Olympia &amp; York, said that the final decision
on whether to go ahead with the deal would be made in the next couple of
days. 'We are looking at a number of financing options,' he said.
O &amp; Y, which has invested about Pounds 1.4bn in Canary Wharf, is trying to
raise Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m on the tower at Canary Wharf. In previous
financing rounds in 1990 and 1991, it raised Pounds 547m.
O &amp; Y is keen to explore new ways of exploiting the tax breaks in the
enterprise zone, since it cannot set them against its own tax bill as it
makes no UK profits.
Other methods of exploiting tax allowances, such as leasing finance, have
become more difficult as the recession has reduced companies' need for tax
shelters.
Because the properties are based in a designated enterprise zone, full tax
relief is available to individual investors. This acts as a powerful
incentive to richer individuals who might otherwise avoid the property
market.
The deal will come with put options for trust holders, allowing them to sell
their share of the building back to the developers after 10 years.
Property investment, particularly in the Docklands, is speculative, and it
is thought that this might be necessary to entice small investors.
The deal would not remove all control from O &amp; Y. The developers, it is
understood, will have call options, exercisable from the 12th year onwards.
These will allow them to buy back the property at a pre-agreed price, which
would increase each year.
This would be by far the biggest enterprise zone trust which has yet been
launched.
Several large office blocks in Salford, Docklands and Telford have been
funded using this route.

FT  04 FEB 92 / American Express plans Dollars 1bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN EXPRESS, the large US financial services company that has been
buffeted by credit card losses, is hoping to raise up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds
564m) by means of a public share offering of as much as 45 per cent of First
Data Corporation (FDC), its renamed credit card processing subsidiary.
The share offer, which would leave American Express owning 55 per cent to 65
per cent of the business, would represent the largest fund-raising exercise
in years for American Express.
It would represent the sale of shares in one of its five strategic core
businesses; the others are the Shearson Lehman investment bank, the travel
related services business, the American Express bank and the IDS financial
services business.
FDC, formerly known as American Express's Information Services Corporation,
is the largest third-party processor of credit cards in the US and in
Britain.
The company's revenues rose 20 per cent in 1991, to Dollars 994.5m, thanks
mainly to a first-time five-month contribution from Signet, the
Basildon-based UK credit card processor that American Express bought last
year from a consortium made up of Midland Bank, National Westminster Bank,
Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank.
American Express paid Pounds 146m for Signet, which is the largest
third-party credit card processor in Europe.
FDC had net profits of Dollars 118m in 1991, but Signet's contribution to
the bottom line is understood to have been marginal.
FDC has 17,000 employees and last year represented about 15 per cent of the
Dollars 789m in group net earnings at American Express.
Mr Jim Robinson, chairman of American Express, said the share offer, which
has yet to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), would
raise substantial funds that would be available 'at a time when a strong
capital base is especially important for financial services compan-ies'.
Last autumn American Express shocked Wall Street when it took a Dollars 265m
charge against earnings, including Dollars 155m to cover credit losses that
were mainly at its Optima credit card division.
American Express's total long-term debt is Dollars 13.1bn, or nearly twice
its shareholders' equity of Dollars 7.4bn.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Bank governor's warning on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING against dramatic measures to stimulate growth in the UK and world
economies was given last night by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the
Bank of England.
Speaking at the annual banquet of the Overseas Bankers Club in London, Mr
Leigh-Pemberton said governments should keep their nerve and react
cautiously to calls for further substantial reductions in interest rates,
concerted fiscal stimulus or changes in rules governing bank lending.
The industrial countries 'should not lose faith' in the underlying strategy
they had pursued since the early 1980s.
The best recipe for a durable recovery was 'based on the restoration of
price stability and the pursuit of stable budgetary policies as the
preconditions for sustainable growth', he said.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton did not rule out 'selective, well-designed measures' to
improve the responsiveness of economies to the basic strategy or in response
to changing circumstances. But he underlined that policymakers must aim for
lasting expansion rather than rapid short-term recovery.
The governor expressed his support for the German central bank's
counter-inflation policy that has included a sharp rise in interest rates.
Britain's long-term interest lay 'in matching, or even exceeding the
standard of price stability set in Germany'. Only in that way could the UK
pave the way for sustainably lower interest rates and durable
non-inflationary growth.
Britain and the US had suffered long-running recessions because of the
large-scale financial imbalances built up during the 1980s. Another negative
factor had been falling confidence.
But the governor said he expected growth in the industrialised countries
would be close to the underlying growth rate of their productive potential
by the end of this year.
'I am quite convinced that once companies and individuals have brought their
borrowing back into a more comfortable relationship with incomes and
profits, confidence will begin to revive and they will once more turn to
expenditure deferred during the recession,' Mr Leigh-Pemberton said.
He warned against moves to accelerate this trend. 'To short-circuit this
process would, I believe, be of dubious effectiveness and ultimately
unwise.'
The Treasury is reconciled to a weaker economic performance this year than
had been expected after recent industrial production and retail sales
figures have pointed to virtually no growth in the final quarter of 1991.
The next forecast of the economy will be given by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, in his Budget on March 10. Last night Treasury officials
dismissed as 'complete and utter nonsense' suggestions that they were
releasing details of the economy ahead of the Budget to pave the way for tax
cuts.
But they admitted that the economy could have contracted by around 2.5 per
cent last year, compared with the Autumn Statement forecast of a 2 per cent
fall in gross domestic product. This, combined with the delay in the
recovery, would mean growth this year would be lower than the 2.25 per cent
forecast by the government last November.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Abu Dhabi prepares for father of all funfairs: Sheikh
Zayed's Dollars 2.5bn plans for the Gulf's rival to Disneyland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Saddam Hussein launched the mother of all battles, Sheikh Zayed bin
Sultan al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi looks set to become the father of all
funfairs.
The Gulf emirate, putting behind the trauma of war and the BCCI scandal, is
soon to have its own version of Disneyland.
Abu Dhabi has solicited plans from five competing bidders for a giant
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) leisure complex to be built on a 10 sq km
man-made island off the city's seafront.
It is, says Mr Peter Black, senior partner of Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner, the
architects leading the British bid, an 'absolutely mammoth scheme'.
The complex will be called Lulu Island - after the Arabic word for pearl -
and is the brainchild of Sheikh Zayed, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, who decided
two years ago that his city state should offer leisure facilities on a par
with Disneyland.
In its presentation video, Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner describes Lulu Island as
'a land of fantasy which began as the dream of a prince'. Its design centres
on a vast oyster-shaped palace with a latticed dome - the architects claim
it would be the world's largest dome - surrounded by a park containing
replica buildings from Islamic states worldwide. There would also be an
18-hole golf course, ornamental gardens and a coastline studded with
spiralled lighthouses.
The island would be ringed by a monorail, fringed with beaches and dotted
with luxury hotels. The whole project is expected to take 10 years to
complete.
Five companies, one each from the UK, the US, Canada, France and Germany,
have prepared extravagant plans for the project in an extraordinary
competitive tender under which Abu Dhabi paid each group Dollars 400,000 to
prepare their bids.
As a result, the bidders' packages, now on display in Abu Dhabi pending a
final decision on the project from Sheikh Zayed, rival in scale those made
to stage the Olympics.
Societe Francaise d'Etudes de Realisation et de Gestion, leading the French
bid, has created a Pounds 100,000 model, spectacularly swept by laser beams.
The other bidders include Forrec Attractions of Canada, Edaw of the US and a
German group.
Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner, which designed Heathrow airport's Terminal 4 among
other buildings, said it approached several British groups as potential
operators of the leisure complex.
These included Pearson (owner of the Financial Times) and British Aerospace.
However, none was willing to take on a project of Lulu Island's scale,
prompting the architects to join forces with California-based Landmark
Entertainment Group.
Mr Black said yesterday that Sheikh Zayed would review the competing
packages next week and is expected to make his decision soon.
Although Kuwait has its own Entertainment City funpark and Qatar is planning
a similar venture, Lulu Island would be far and away the Gulf's most lavish
entertainment complex.
Many of Abu Dhabi's conservative neighbours already consider that the
emirate, as well as Dubai - its exuberant neighbour and rival in the United
Arab Emirates - are akin to Disneyland even as things stand.
Dubai, in particular, has long been the traditional escape for Gulf
expatriates and Arabs seeking sun, alcohol and relief from the more
restrictive social world of Saudi Arabia.
Abu Dhabi's scheme would further its already intense rivalry with Dubai by
vying with its neighbour for such custom.
Touche Ross, which is advising Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner, estimates that the
park could attract 2m visitors a year, both from the Middle East and those
who use Abu Dhabi as a transit point between Europe and Asia.
What the mullahs of Iran, a short hop across the Gulf, will think is another
matter, let alone puritanical Islamic leaders in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.
But given the UAE's more laid-back attitude to most things, Minnie Mouse
would be unlikely to have to wear a veil.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Big power users fight electricity price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG industrial users of energy such as GKN and Blue Circle Cement will
refuse to pay part of their electricity bills in April, when annual supply
contracts are renewed, in protest at price increases.
The companies say they will not pay the element in their bills that goes
towards the annual subsidy for the UK's nuclear generation sector. This
subsidy represents 11 per cent of an industrial user's payment, amounting to
some Pounds 350m for industry as a whole.
At a recent meeting of large electricity users, companies expressed anger at
the prospect of rises of 25 per cent to 30 per cent in their electricity
bills this year.
The Major Energy Users' Council will meet Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary,
on February 12 to discuss the issue and to express members' concern about
rising electricity prices.
Large users have complained for some time that rising prices in the
electricity wholesale market - on which annual contracts are based - are
affecting their ability to compete with continental rivals.
'In the UK, major users are paying the same prices as domestic customers,'
said Mr Tom Lowes, chief energy buyer for Blue Circle. The users' group says
regular customers using large amounts of electricity should get a discount.
Mr Lowes said the UK cement industry needs electricity prices of 1.9p to 2p
per kilowatt hour - or the equivalent of other fuels  - in order to compete
with continental rivals. This year he expects to have to pay about 2.6p.
'There is no way to pass electricity price costs on to consumers in the
current recession - if the price of cement is put up, the UK will just get
more imports,' he said.
Most industrial companies are squeezing their own suppliers to bring costs
below the rate of inflation. 'I am buying some things where the price has
gone down,' said one member of the energy users' council, 'and I am
certainly not paying more than a 3 per cent increase for most supplies.'
The UK's electricity suppliers have argued that prices in the wholesale
market must rise to reflect the true cost of power.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Lang calls on Scots to oppose plan for their own parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday called on Scottish businesses
to declare their opposition to Labour's plan for a tax-raising Scottish
parliament.
Mr Lang has also written to 50,000 Scottish businessmen and women warning
them that, in addition to Labour's plan for higher UK taxes, the proposed
Scottish parliament would be able to raise the basic rate of income tax in
Scotland by a further 3p in the pound.
A Labour government, he told the Institute of Directors at a lunch in
Glasgow, would result in higher business rates by abolishing the uniform
business rate and allowing councils to set their own non-domestic rate. The
effect would be 'catastrophic' for business, he said.
The constitutional debate in Scotland has been galvanised since an ICM
opinion poll last week showed that a record 50 per cent of Scots wanted
independence.
Another poll showed a drop of 9 percentage points in Labour's standing in
Scotland, a sharp rise for the Scottish National Party and a modest increase
for the Conservatives.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, blames Mr Lang for the growth in
support for independence, attributing it to his repeated attacks on a
Scottish parliament within the UK. Mr Dewar says these attacks have
polarised the constitutional debate into a choice between the status quo and
independence.
Mr Lang said after his speech, in which he made no reference to the SNP or
independence, that Labour's plans would lead to the separation of Scotland
from the UK, which was the SNP's aim. He was not attacking the SNP because
'Labour's bad enough'.
Some observers argue that Mr Lang is running risks by concentrating his fire
on Labour. While a rise in support for the SNP may help the Tories in some
constituencies by taking votes away from Labour, it makes the SNP more
likely to win Conservative seats such as Mr Lang's own Galloway
constituency.
Some Scottish Conservatives are urging the government to promise Scotland an
assembly after the general election, or at least a referendum on Scotland's
constitutional future.
Mr Lang indirectly acknowledged there were differences among the Scottish
Tories. He said: 'Every party has one or two people with their views. My
stand is on the maintenance of the union and I think you will find that
everyone in our party is agreed on that.'
Meanwhile, the SNP, delighted that independence is at the top of the
political agenda in Scotland, yesterday launched a campaign with a party
political broadcast featuring the actor Sean Connery and backed by posters.
The national poster campaign, in a play on a Scottish lager commercial,
carries the phrase: 'They've got yours'. The campaign is in line with the
SNP's strategy of persuading Scots to find the self-confidence to vote for
independence and convincing them that they would benefit economically.

FT  04 FEB 92 / More at stake than mere machismo: The likely effects of the
engineering workers' and electricians' merger plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a three-week tour around Britain to win support for a union merger,
leaders of the AEU engineering workers and the EETPU electricians have left
little doubt about the significance they attach to their mission.
'It is the biggest and most important merger in trade union history,' Mr
Bill Jordan, AEU president, has told numerous meetings of shop stewards and
union members. 'It will change the face of British trade unionism,' implying
that it will become a model for other unions to follow.
Rival unions will contest Mr Jordan's claims, but there is no doubting that
a merger - which has eluded previous leaders of the AEU and EEPTU for more
than a century - would have a significant impact both on other unions and
thousands of workplaces in the public and private sectors. If approved by
the two unions' 1m members in a vote starting this week, it could be the
first in a series of trade union amalgamations which could result in four or
five large organisations dominating the labour movement by the end of the
century.
The merger would also probably take the electricians, whose union has long
been considered the most right-wing in Britain, back into the Trades Union
Congress after their expulsion three years ago for failing to implement
rulings on inter-union disputes.
More important for UK manufacturing, the AEU/EETPU would be the most likely
partner for employers seeking to introduce single-union deals; the two
unions have already taken the lion's share of such agreements in the UK, the
most recent being that with the AEU at the proposed plant of Toyota, the car
manufacturer, in Derbyshire.
Employers would also welcome the deal because it would simplify collective
bargaining arrangements, and help erode demarcation lines, which have held
back productivity improvements for years.
There are disadvantages. Some employers will have concerns about the
increased negotiating power that a merger would give the most skilled
members of their workforces. Most, however, believe that the risks are far
outweighed by the advantages.
Employers have long been frustrated by the proliferation of unions in the
UK. Those setting up plants prefer to deal with only one union, or none at
all. A small but growing number is seeking to simplify bargaining by setting
up 'single-table' systems, through which negotiating forums with separate
unions are replaced by one in which unions bargain 'with one voice'.
'This (single-table system) cuts down bargaining time and has the potential
of cutting down the amount of time shop stewards are diverted from
productive work and the number of full-time union officials we have to deal
with,' says one personnel director at an engineering plant. 'The merger
could also have that effect.'
The large number of unions has also fuelled demarcation disputes between
different groups of workers. 'The biggest source of friction has been
between electricians and engineers, even though it is less marked than it
was in the past,' says Mr Peter Ball, deputy director-general at the
Engineering Employers Federation. 'This has hindered the training of the
multi-skilled workers which more and more companies are seeking.'
Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, says that this distinction is over:
'The separation of mechanical and electrical skills is finished. The new
union would create an environment where multi-skilling could be controlled
in the interests of our members and employers.'
Such comments are consistent with the offer of the AEU and EEPTU leaderships
to forge a 'partnership of common interest' with employers. 'We have to
reassert trade unions' role of seeking better pay, working conditions and
job security but we have to do it in an equal partnership with employers,'
says Mr Jordan.
A merger could help promote that change. But the pressure on unions to
amalgamate began long before they started talking about transforming
relations with employers.
A union combining engineers and electricians was first mooted in 1889.
Numerous merger attempts followed, the latest ending in 1989 because of the
EETPU rift with the TUC and the difficulty of reconciling the two unions'
different structures. In particular, the AEU was anxious to retain its
tradition of electing its officials; the EETPU executive appoints all but
the most senior. The differences remain and, assuming that the merger vote
is positive, there will still be much argument over a new constitution, to
be formulated over the next four years.
What has increased the urgency of merger since 1989 is the severe effect of
the recession on union membership rolls, putting pressure on finances. In
the second half of 1991, AEU membership declined by 10 per cent, against 5
per cent a year in the 1980s. 'If we lose 5 per cent of our paying members
each year, we lose Pounds 1.5m-worth of income and by 2000 we would have
less than 300,000 paying members,' says Mr Laird.
As a result of similar developments at other unions, amalgamations that a
few years ago would have seemed impossible are being considered. One
possibility, although still far off, is the combination of traditional
rivals the Transport and General Workers Union and the GMB general union to
form a 2m-strong organisation.
That, together with the likely formation of a 1.5m-member organisation
comprising Nalgo, Nupe and public service unions, has concentrated the minds
of AEU leaders, who, as in all unions, are acutely conscious of the relative
size of their organisation. With 630,00 members, the AEU is the UK's fourth
largest union. Three years ago it was second only to the TGWU.
'It is much more than just machismo,' says the leader of one rival union.
'Numbers are votes and votes are influence on the Labour party and
government.'
Similar arguments have helped to convince EETPU sceptics. Since leaving the
TUC, the EETPU has drawn in some small unions, but its potential for
significant growth is limited. 'The AEU will merge with other unions if it
does not amalgamate with us,' says Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general
secretary elect.
But if Mr Gallagher has been converted to the merger cause, he remains
ambivalent about rejoining the TUC. The EETPU has long been regarded by some
as the unacceptable face of trade unionism, after its role in the
derecognition of print unions by News International, publisher of The Times
and The Sun, and its promotion of no-strike agreements.
Mr Gallagher shows no signs of regret. 'The sad thing is that we have not
missed being in the TUC. British workers do need a coherent voice to
represent their interests. But the question is whether it is worth Pounds
1.3m (the prospective annual TUC affiliation fees of the two unions) to be
in the TUC. I am open to persuasion.'
This stance and the animosity of some TUC-affiliated unions sets the scene
for protracted negotiations with the TUC, prior to a vote on affiliation
within a year by the two unions' members.
The difficulties will arise in part because some TUC-affiliated unions will
press for the EETPU to withdraw from the two single-union deals at Orion,
the Japanese electronics company, and distribution group Christian Salvesen,
which led to its expulsion. However, Mr Gallagher, and Mr Eric Hammond, from
whom he takes over as general secretary next month, say they will not
contemplate giving up either those members involved in the single-union
agreements, or the members of the breakaway unions that have joined the
EETPU since 1988. The unions which have lost members to the electricians -
including the Fire Brigade Union and the Prison Officers Association - will
be unhappy if the EETPU is not disciplined.
None the less the pressures on both sides to find a solution are
considerable. Unions have been able to live with the 360,000-strong EETPU
outside the TUC, but their strength would be severely undermined if the AEU
were also to leave. And Mr Gallagher will face strong pressure to show
flexibility in the TUC talks from Mr Jordan and Mr Laird, both of whom would
find life outside the TUC uncomfortable.
For these reasons, the EETPU will probably be back inside the TUC next year,
although there are no details yet of how this could happen.
Important though that would be to other unions, the reaffiliation to the TUC
matters less to employers than does its merger with the AEU.
'I could not care less whether the engineers or electricians are in the
TUC,' says one employer, 'but the merger is a different matter. It is a
shame they did not do it years ago. It will be a force for good and for
change.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / Newton's poor law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The poor are off the poli-tical agenda. In pre-That-cher elections at least
a few people argued about the homeless, elderly widows in freezing flats, or
families whose bread-winner was unemployed. Now Labour regards itself as too
respectable to allude to such inconveniences, while the Conservatives are
reluctant to acknowledge the problem.
Neither should get away with it. The other day Mr Frank Field, a Labour MP
who ploughs his own furrow, roughed up Mr Tony Newton, social security
secretary, in an illuminating exchange. It went unreported. This is partly
the fault of Labour's social security spokesman, Mr Michael Meacher. Mr
Meacher, whose ineptitude is one of the crosses Labour perversely chooses to
bear, attracted the headlines with some careless remarks about his party's
plans to lift the ceiling on national insurance contributions. Mr Field's
grilling of Mr Newton was lost.
It is time to retrieve it. Mr Field, who is chairman of the social security
committee, asked a devilish question. Did the right honourable gentleman
endorse the finding that those who had gained the smallest increase in
incomes since Mrs Margaret Thatcher first took office were the poorest?
'What I shall certainly endorse,' said Mr Newton, 'is that . . . we have
steadily - uprating by uprating - steered additional resources to poorer
pensioners and to others whom we had identified, as a result of our
research, as among those who were not doing as well as we should have
wished.'
Mr Field: 'I am grateful to the right honourable gentleman . . . but may I
ask him that question again . . . Does he endorse the whole of that report,
which shows that the very poorest have gained the smallest increase under
this government?'
Mr Newton: 'I accept that there are variations in the way in which incomes
have grown . . .' And he wriggled on, about whether the same people were in
the lowest decile throughout the 1980s. Some were, said Mr Field. Mr Newton,
an honest and capable minister, sought refuge in 'a whole range of extremely
complicated factors'. Mr Field asked, a third time, whether the minister
would acknowledge that 'under the stewardship of this government, the
poorest people in this country have had the smallest increase?' His victim
came out fighting. 'At all levels of the income distribution,' insisted Mr
Newton, 'people have been getting better off during the lifetime of this
government.'
Not quite. The numbers of long-term unemployed are rising again. The dole
has not kept pace with earnings. State benefits have, with important
exceptions such as payments to the disabled, risen by little more than the
retail price index. General incomes have risen much faster. The very poor
have hardly benefited from the growth of the 1980s
So the lower deciles have moved ahead slowly, if at all. For example, poorer
pensioners are about where they were in 1979; well-off pensioners are some
35 per cent better off, in real terms.
The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) tells us that poverty persists. The
CPAG has been rebutted by the government on the ground that if you define
poverty according to the numbers receiving income support then every time
the trigger point for payments is increased the number 'in poverty' rises.
True, but the CPAG also refers to two other definitions.
One is the number on below half average incomes after housing costs. The
other is 'breadline Britain', a survey of who can afford what are generally
regarded as basic necessities. This was used by London Weekend TV in 1983
and 1990. Each definition has defects. Yet all three tell the same story. We
also have our own eyes and ears. Even if the CPAG is only half-right there
is no way out. The very poor have hardly benefited, if at all, from the
growth that has made so many of us so comfortable.
The tragedy is that in political terms it hardly matters. Many of the worst
off are probably poll-tax dodgers who will not be on the electoral register.
This election campaign is governed by the rich and powerful, the affluent,
the moderately affluent, and aspirants to affluence. The other end is an
embarrassing nuisance.
That is why the Conservatives are hardly bothering to argue that only a
wealthy society can help its poor. It is a sound argument, and in good years
the Tories may prove its worth by a generous uprating of social security
benefits. Fear of the affluent also explains Labour's pusillanimity: the
extent of its redistributive urge is limited by a plan to put taxation back
to where the Conservatives had it in 1988, the money thus raised to go to
pensioners and higher child benefit.
What we really need is a proper analysis of the poor. Take pensioners. There
are two possibilities. Labour would rely on state pensions, with an
immediate uprating of the basic pension and subsequent increases in line
with earnings. It is still in a tangle about the relationship between its
proposals for national insurance payments and its promises to the retired.
The ultimate flaw in Labour's line is that future taxpayers may rebel
against paying decent pensions.
The Conservatives intend to press ahead with the privatisation of individual
pensions. Good. Occupational pensions promise better rewards. Social
security support should be concentrated on the rapidly-ageing pensioners who
are solely dependent on the state. But the Tories are wary of such talk.
When Mr Nigel Lawson was chancellor he was alleged to have floated the idea
of a narrowly-focused state pension. The ensuing row was about whether a
tape-recorder had been working when he said whatever he said.
We need that tape now. If the voters will not hear of redistributive
policies, politicians must start devising private insurance instruments to
minimise the damage to the potential poor of the future. Just be careful not
to become one of the left-overs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING IS rotten in the state of France.
As so often, the latest symptom has a farcical quality to it. In a country
which prides itself on le sens de l'etat, four top civil servants were made
to resign last week for taking a decision whose political character could
not possibly have escaped their notice: the admission to the country of a
senior Palestinian leader, well known for his hostility to the current
Middle East peace process and, in the past, for his association with
spectacular hijackings. Supposedly at death's door, the gentleman was seen
to walk into the hospital, and his wife claims he was there for nothing more
than a thorough check-up.
If there is any country in the world where a civil servant could safely be
expected to refer such a decision to his political masters, it is France.
Not surprisingly, public opinion is reluctant to accept that responsibility
goes no higher, and suspects that the luckless officials have been made
scapegoats for some piece of bungled skulduggery ordered by those very
political masters.
But the explanation given by Mr Hubert Vedrine, President Francois
Mitterrand's chief of staff, is perhaps more damaging to his master's
reputation than any conspiracy theory.
Implicit endorsement
The officials, he suggests, may have been endormis (put off their guard) by
the fact that the request reached them through Mrs Georgina Dufoix, a former
minister. She was acting in her capacity as head of the French Red Cross,
but was also a presidential adviser. (She has now resigned both jobs). So
the request appeared to come from the Elysee palace, with an implicit
presidential endorsement. That would be sufficient to convince civil
servants, Mr Vedrine implied. They would feel no need to check with their
immediate bosses, who are ministers in a government responsible to
parliament, according to the constitution.
If that explanation is correct it illustrates all too well what is wrong
with the French political system. Power is concentrated in one man's hands.
That man is famous for keeping his cards close to his chest. He makes policy
by a series of delphic utterances, which ministers and civil servants alike
try desperately to decode, and secures implementation of his wishes through
semi-official personal representatives. The legal government, headed by the
lamentable figure of Mrs Edith Cresson, is there only to act as a screen
between him and public opinion. 'Of course she's unpopular. She was
appointed to be unpopular,' Mr Mitterrand blandly told a group of
journalists last week, shortly before the 'Habash affair' hit the headlines.
Real problems
It would be funny if it were not so serious. France is a country struggling
to come to terms with some very real problems. It has to reconcile a strong
tradition of national independence with an assumed position of leadership in
the march to a federal Europe, based on alliance with a Germany economically
more powerful and politically no longer submissive. It has to adapt
dirigiste and nationalist economic traditions (represented by Mrs Cresson)
to the exigencies of an interdependent world (voiced by the finance
minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy). It has to absorb a large immigrant
population, and overcome the racist backlash represented by Mr Jean-Marie Le
Pen's National Front, in an economy whose record of job-creation in the last
15 years has been very poor.
Until two or three years ago, Mr Mitterrand could plausibly claim that he
was managing these problems with greater strategic vision and tactical sense
than any of his political rivals would be likely to bring to them. Now he is
floundering miserably. On one point at least he is right: two seven-year
terms in such an office is too long. He should make it clear quickly what
alternative he intends to propose to the electorate in a referendum later
this year, and promise unambiguously to apply the reduction to his own
current mandate. Meanwhile, he should appoint a prime minister capable of
running the government, and allow him (or her) to do so as the constitution
prescribes.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Competition and Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRAVELLER caught in a quagmire should, from time to time, look towards the
final destination. Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the Commission of the
European Communities is to be congratulated, therefore, for discussing the
agenda of the next Gatt round in his speech to the World Economic Forum. He
is to be congratulated still more for being right. International competition
must, indeed, be one of the items on that agenda. But first, the Uruguay
Round must be completed and the liberal competition policy of the EC
safeguarded.
The original design of the still-born International Trade Organisation did,
in fact, include a section on restrictive business practices. But two
subsequent developments have made global competition policy a still higher
priority than it was 40 years ago: because traditional trade barriers are
lower, international competition is increasingly important in determining
competition in domestic markets; in addition, regulatory trade measures
(anti-dumping duties, for example), though aimed at preventing harmful
competition, have themselves become barriers to trade.
The Gatt already allows countries to impose countervailing duties against
subsidies and anti-dumping duties on dumped exports. On subsidies,
therefore, Sir Leon argues that 'the most sensible thing to do would be to
improve the coverage and enforcement mechanisms which the Gatt system brings
to bear.' Anti-dumping is a more vexed issue. Sir Leon accepts that 'unfair
trade is a cancer'. But he also asserts that 'anti-dumping might be compared
to chemotherapy - a desperate and damaging remedy. Our aim - through
competition policy - must be to cure the cancer itself before it takes
hold.'
Common framework
How is this to be done when a fully fledged global competition authority is
inconceivable? The Gatt's normal approach is agreement on a common framework
for domestic legislation, alongside a right of appeal to the Gatt, appeals
being focused on whether a given government is enforcing the agreed
framework in good faith.
In the case of cartels, Sir Leon suggests that the international rule would
distinguish 'between acceptable industrial co-operation and unacceptable
restrictive practices . . . . A simple rule . . . that restrictive practices
and cartels thus defined are not enforceable at law would constitute
considerable progress.' Sir Leon also suggests 'common rules on the
appraisal of mergers' and international panels to 'provide firstly a forum
for discussion of merger cases which involve several jurisdictions and
secondly an impartial analysis of the merits of a particular case and which
authority is best placed to deal with it.'
Bold ideas
These ideas are both bold and visionary. But first those quagmires need to
be crossed. Without the Multilateral Trade Organisation's unified and
improved dispute settlement procedure - as proposed in the draft final act
of the Uruguay Round, put forward by the Gatt's director general, Mr Arthur
Dunkel - Sir Leon's ideas will find no fertile soil.
More fundamentally, all depends on a successful conclusion to the Uruguay
Round itself. This is not merely because new structures cannot be added to a
collapsed building. It is also that liberal trade is the foundation for
effective competition. Meanwhile, government-imposed or supported restraints
on trade, like 'voluntary export restraints', are themselves the main
distortion of global competition.
If the Uruguay Round quagmire is to be crossed, the entire EC needs to push
harder in that direction. Ways to reform the Common Agricultural Policy must
be found that are acceptable to the EC's main negotiating partners. Equally
important, however, is continuation of that 'strong commitment to
competition policy' which Sir Leon lauds. The recession has brought forth
renewed hopes of an active industrial policy and of greater protection
against competitive foreign enterprises. Those ideas from a failed past must
be resisted if what Sir Leon wants is to come to pass.

One clear signal crackled through the static on Germany's economic airwaves
yesterday: if the rest of this year's pay settlements follow the pattern of
the steel deal, the world could face an extended wait before the Bundesbank
broadcasts its message of goodwill to the world, and starts cutting interest
rates.
Recovery from recession in Britain, France and elsewhere is being hampered
by high borrowing rates in Germany. But pressure from these countries has
failed to shift the independent central bank in Frankfurt from its
insistence that the squeeze cannot be eased until there are clear signs that
domestic inflation is under control and, preferably, on the way down to 2
per cent from a current annual rate of 4.2 per cent. Instead, the Bundesbank
will be worried that yesterday's agreement will hamper attempts to curb
inflation and will lead to even higher settlements.
After last year's 6 per cent pay rise in the steel sector, in a year when
inflation averaged 3.5 per cent, this year's overall 6.35 per cent package
is inflationary. Even though the 5.9 per cent increase in basic pay looks
more acceptable when set against expected price inflation of 4.5 per cent,
it raises questions about the wisdom of employers who have made no bones
about the dire state of their industry, which incurred losses or drastically
reduced profits last year and which is expected to show only a 2 per cent
increase in productivity this year.
While relief that a strike had been averted prompted shares in steel
companies to rise by a few points, there were concerns about the longer term
implications for the steel industry and for its impact on other industries.
'The settlement was too high,' said one Frankfurt broker. 'It will send the
wrong message to other unions.'
German employers, however, were more optimistic. Mr Klaus Murmann, president
of the BDA employers' association, the largest employers association in
Germany, said the deal was the first sign that the giant IG Metall union,
which starts next month to negotiate on behalf of the 4m engineers which it
also represents, was prepared to compromise. But the agreement reached with
the steelworkers also reflects a reluctance on the part of management to
avoid poisoning relations with IG Metall before the negotiations with the
engineers.
The union itself was more cryptic. Mr Klaus Zwickel, deputy chairman, said
the basic figures in the agreement, 5.9 per cent and 6.35 per cent, formed
'an interesting corridor' which would be helpful to other unions in the
coming pay rounds.
If they stick to centre of the corridor, then there is every likelihood that
come the autumn, pay will no longer be a core concern in Frankfurt. But can
the steel settlement, affecting 130,000 workers, be seen as an indicator for
the millions of employees still waiting their turn to negotiate?
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the IG Metall union chairman, seemed yesterday to
suggest that it could. The deal was 'a reasonable basis for other pay
settleimportant aim of bringing steel workers' pay closer to parity with the
engineers. That suggests that the union will not press in the short term, at
least, to increase the differential. It is significant that IG Metall has
already warned its engineering negotiators not to put in claims for more
than 9.5 per cent, compared with the 10.5 per cent demand which launched the
steel workers on the road to the cliff's edge.
But there is still dissent, notably among public service unions, led by Mrs
Monika Wulf-Mathies at OTV, which represents the majority of public
officials and which starts talks shortly on its 9.5 per cent claim.
Yesterday's agreement, the union said, gave 'no grounds for us to rewrite
our demands'.
The OTV negotiations will provide the next great test of establishment
resolve. According to CDU officials at a meeting with Mr Helmut Kohl
yesterday, the chancellor made no comments on the steel settlement, but he
was anxious that the public servants should not 'get the wrong message' on
pay. According to Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, a settlement at 9.5 per
cent would cost Bonn and the state governments an extra DM38bn this year,
which they cannot afford. State governments have already been instructed by
Bonn to limit public spending growth in western Germany to 2 per cent this
year. The OTV talks are likely to be even more tense than those of the steel
industry since they bring a leading trade union into conflict with the
socialist governments that control most German states.
Although senior ministers have been careful not to become embroiled in the
pay round as a whole, Mr Kohl has warned several times recently that the
government takes its job as an employer seriously. Mrs Wulf-Mathies has on
each occasion countered with threats that her membership is prepared to
cripple the administration with stoppages if its pay - currently 14 per cent
below the industrial average - is not brought into line. Trade union
negotiators who have not yet settled have made much of the argument that
since the steel talks started last October they belonged properly to the
1991 pay round.
But there is little doubt that the steel agreement sets a pattern. Banking
employers, confronted with a strike ballot among workers refusing their 4.5
per cent offer, will now find it impossible to resist further and are likely
to make concessions.
While an average national 6 per cent increase may be just acceptable to the
board of the Bundesbank, which dictates monetary policy in Germany, it is
certain to increase the pressure for cost-cutting across industry. National
productivity is expected to increase just 2.5 per cent his year. Growth in
gross national product is forecast at 1.5 per cent, and average unemployment
in the west of Germany is estimated at about 1.8m compared with 1.1m last
year. The picture darkened further yesterday with publication of industrial
production figures which showed that the manufacturing index fell in
December to 117.6 from 121.3 in November.
Steel workers, already feeling the pressure of job cuts, will be hit
especially hard. Their employers, who are confronted by recession in all
world markets, a sharp downturn at home, and cheap steel from the former
Soviet Union and South Korea, will be unable to pass on extra wage costs,
according to Mr Rudiger Pohl, a leading independent economic adviser to the
government.
While a 'stone had fallen from his heart' with the news that the steel
strike had been called off, he, too, was concerned that the settlement would
set the pattern for the year. Capital investment would be depressed, he
said, and while he saw no danger of a full recession, economic expansion
would be lower than expected. And if expansion in the west is endangered,
then recovery in the east - still in a desperate economic condition - will
be compromised.
This worry was far from people's minds in the steel state of North Rhine
Westphalia yesterday. As one worker commented, he and virtually all his
colleagues had voted for the first stoppage in 13 years in defence of their
10.5 per cent pay claim. And now they were being asked by their leaders to
settle for 6.35 per cent. Approval is expected at a ballot next week, and
the steel workers will carry on, nursing their grievances.
But it was, in fact, the beleaguered steel workers who set a pattern for
this year's pay round. Their vote, with a 95 per cent turnout and an 87 per
cent majority of all members in favour of strikes, sent a clear signal to
employers throughout Germany. In proving their willingness to stop work with
so little to be gained in cash terms, and in proving that employers are
prepared to settle above 6 per cent, they will have encouraged union members
all over the country to adopt similar tactics and win for themselves
similar, and possibly greater short-term rewards.

Did you know, for example, that an elephant weighs as much as the frames of
339,286 pairs of sunglasses? Or that right-handed people use more deodorants
than the left-handed because they sweat more? Or that it takes 15 inflated

What price excellence in technology? The New York Conference Board's 1992
prize for same, sponsored jointly by the Gartner information-
services group, has gone to Donald Fites, the chairman of Caterpillar .
He won it, we're told, for his use of information technology to improve the
group's productivity and links with suppliers, dealers and customers. In the
meantime, however, he has led his company not only to a Dollars 404m loss
for 1991, but into a labour dispute threatening to bog down performance this
year. Perhaps that's why he won't be collecting the prize in person at the
Waldorf-Astoria tonight, sending vice-chairman James Wogsland instead.

The Rover's Return has lost a proud regular with the forced resignation of
David Plowright as executive chairman of Granada Television.
For all his company's Jewels in the Crown, he considered Coronation Street
the world's most important programme, and delighted in the thousands who
flocked to its local pub on Granada's studio tours, which he instituted.
Plowright, brother of actress Joan, stood for public service broadcasting -
but not at any price. He was emphatic that quality could not be detached
from economic realities and that under-funded television is 'not much fun
for viewers or programme-makers'.
He was also an unrepentant advocate of regional television - a belief that
verged on Manchester nationalism. 'Britain speaking to Britain is a better
prescription for a national broadcasting service than Britain listening to
London,' was how he put it.
Even so, there will be some in the investment community who won't mourn his
passing. When it came to TV, Granada often gave the impression of being run
far more for the benefit of its programme-makers than of the company's
shareholders.

Marmaduke, Lord Bunkerton ('Snooty' to his pals) would never have stood for

beset with not just new competition, but a sort that smacks - dash it all -
of democracy.
Owned by Dundee's clannish D C Thomson group, Beano is under attack by
debutant rival Triffik] whose stakeholders are numbered in tens of
thousands. The competitor is a joint venture between Newsforce Marketing, a
branch of the UK's 29,000-strong National Federation of Retail Newsagents,
and the sales
promotion company Business Development Partnership.
With an initial print-run of 400,000 against Beano's claimed circulation of
300,000, Triffik] sells at the same price of 28p. Its cartoon characters,
such as Harry Hacker and his magic computer, are meant to be more
switched-on than those of its forerunner.
Whether they'll catch on with enough little horrors is another question.
Beano says it continually tries to inject fresh features. But while it has
succeeded in sidelining the now 54-year-old Snooty, its popularity polls
show that no newcomer has come near shaking the grip of characters such as
Dennis the Menace, born in the 1950s.
Could that be why Triffik] includes a non-computerised youth called
Disastrous Dick?
'Weel . . . perhaps,' said the voice from Dundee. 'But we're no worried.
There's nothing Dennis likes more than a wee bit o' competition.'

Iraq, the glorious victor of the Gulf war in the eyes of its president at
least, has now turned its Baghdad logic on the recession in the west. Iraqi
leaders are arguing that General Motors' decision to lay off 74,000 of its
workers is the result of the economic embargo against Baghdad.
'The sanctions work both ways,' says trade minister Mohammed Mehdi Salegh.
'They have forced General Motors, for example, to lay off workers and lose
business.' His reasoning is that under a 1989 deal worth Dollars 500m, GM
was to set up a plant in Iraq to assemble 90,000 vehicles a year, which of
course hasn't happened. Hence GM's cuts.
Next: how western pressure against Iraq cost New Zealand's cricketers the
test series.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Observer: Old Lady's last choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changing a tried and trusted company chairman in advance of a stock market
flotation is not always the best way to reassure the punters. So Sir John
Cuckney's resignation as chairman of 3i may come as a surprise to the lay
public.
City onlookers, however, will note that his departure will give the Bank of
England a last chance to exercise one of its remaining droits de seigneurie
in its relations with British industry.
True, 3i has its own board. But in practice the chairman of the company,
hugely influential as the venture-
capital market leader, has been picked by the Old Lady, a shareholder from
the outset.
That prerogative will end when the Bank sells its 14.7 per cent stake in 3i
in the flotation, scheduled for the autumn. This is therefore its last
opportunity to make the choice, which will be done in consultation with
Barclays and National Westminster, two of 3i's shareholders planning to
retain holdings.
Sir David Walker, the former Bank director just resigned as chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board, is the obvious frontrunner. Indeed, there
is even a school of thought which suggests that the Bank feels it has to
find Walker a proper job following his own unexpected departure from the
SIB.
The snag, according to his friends, is that the soon-to-be vacated
chairmanship of Lloyds Bank is more to his liking.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Arts: Henry Threadgill's Very Very Circus - Queen Elizabeth
Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Circus was bound to be a challenging evening's entertainment with a
line-up like this. It turned out to be a challenge which much of the
audience was not willing to meet. They could have guessed it would not be
easy. American altoist Henry Threadgill has always been an experimentalist,
writing for 55 piece marching bands or a line-up of four woodwind, four
strings and voice, for example. A septet consisting of a french horn, two
electric guitars, two tubas and drums as well as his own raw alto is almost
conventional by Threadgill's terms. Nor should anyone have expected the Very
Very Circus to swing. Threadgill likes his music to have a morbid atmosphere
and will often purposely collapse his pieces into a jazz dirge.
The Circus started cheerfully enough, Gene Lake's drums beat a busy rhythm
to the trump, trump of the tubas. The guitars of Masujaa and Brandon Ross
provided angular and distorted background and the french horn of Markus
Taylor took a kind of detached classical tour. As the march continued, the
guitars made an interesting diversion into Western themes and Harry Lime
zither effects.
The urge to dirge soon took over, however, leavened only by the comic bounce
of the tubas, Threadgill set a flat and eerie soundscape for himself to solo
against, guitars clanking occasionally to either side of him. Perhaps in
reaction to his audience's response (heading for the bar), Threadgill next
whipped up the guitars and indefatigable tubas to a tune more suited to a
lively wake, the dignified horn keeping the lid on things.
But it was when Brandon Ross managed to disentangle himself from the others
for some grey and grotesque distortion that attention, and members of the
audience, began to wander. The surge in energy created by the eventual
return of quickstep tubas and drums came too late.
The first part of the Rolling Rock-sponsored, Contemporary Music Network
show was shades lighter but complementary. London vibraphonist Orphy
Robinson, whose group has a debut album on the racks this week, When
Tomorrow Comes (Blue Note 7985812), also keeps unusual company. In The
Annavas Project his vibes and reverberating marimba are augmented by Tunde
Jegede's kora and cello, and Rowland Sutherland's flutes (down to the
piccolo), as well as co-writer Joe Bashorun's keyboards and Dudley Phillip's
bass. Winston Clifford on drums completes the line-up.
As a preview to a promising new recording the poor quality of sound early on
was a distraction - especially as the music relies heavily on a crisp back
beat with dancing, repeating melodies from Robinson and Sutherland.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Catching the radio tails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since BT's privatisation in 1984, the government has been searching for ways
to crack the telecommunication group's local monopoly.
Providing telephone lines to people's homes has been the part of the market
most resistant to competition and also the biggest cause of irritation to
customers, since they have no alternative if their lines are faulty or there
is a dispute over bills. Mercury Communications has concentrated on
servicing business customers and providing a long-distance service to
residential customers over BT's lines.
Ministers now think they may have found the answer to BT's local
stranglehold in a new technology, known as radio tails, which makes the
final link to a customer's home by radio rather than the traditional cable.
Ionica, a start-up venture based in Cambridge, was licensed to provide such
a service last week.
Ionica plans to put aerials on people's roofs and transmit telephone
conversations to and from the exchange using radio spectrum at around the
3.5 GHz frequency. Inside people's homes, there will be a wire and a socket,
just like BT's service.
Nigel Playford, Ionica's managing director, who previously founded Cognito,
the two-way paging company, argues that his service will be a low-cost
alternative to BT's because there will be no need to dig up the roads and
put in cables. This will also benefit the environment - the aerials will not
be an eyesore as they will only stand six inches high, while traffic will
not be held up by roadworks.
If these claims are borne out - and Ionica's coyness about how precisely its
technology works makes this difficult to judge - there will be applications
elsewhere, particularly in developing countries which are having to put in
networks from scratch.
The technology could also have an impact on the balance of prices in the UK
as Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of telecommunications, has been
quick to grasp. As part of BT's latest price review, which began last week,
the company wishes to increase standing charges and make compensating cuts
in call charges.
Assuming current technology, Sir Bryan accepts that there is a case for such
're-balancing' of prices because BT is losing money on providing telephone
lines. But if Ionica's technology is successful, the value of BT's fixed
network will have to be written down or even written off.
Haven't we been here before? Isn't this what personal communications
networks (PCN) and telepoint are supposed to achieve?
The difference between radio tails and PCN is twofold. PCN is essentially a
cellular service, designed for people on the move, and therefore has the
high costs associated with such a sophisticated technology. Radio tails are
specifically designed for fixed locations.
Second, Playford argues that the quality of sound will be superior both
because the phone will not be moving around and because putting aerials on
people's roofs will give a better radio reception than with cellular
equipment.
As for telepoint, which has had a bad name since it flopped in the UK, the
difference is that radio tails are specifically focused on the home
environment. Telepoint was positioned as an alternative to a public call
box.
Lastly, should there be one radio tail operator or competing ones? There is
much to be said for competition but the problem will be to find the
necessary radio spectrum.
The only sensible way of allocating the spectrum - which is a scarce
national resource - is to auction it off to the highest bidders. It is about
time that ministers dusted down their dossiers on the subject.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Management: New law will curb fly boys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough legislation to control fly-tipping will place an intolerable burden of
red tape on small business, according to the Federation of Small Businesses
(FSB), writes Charles Batchelor.
An estimated 350,000 businesses, many of them small builders, will be
required to register under waste control laws which come into effect on
April 1.
The new rules apply to all businesses which carry waste 'for profit'.
Businesses are exempt if they are carrying only waste which they have
produced themselves but this exemption does not apply to businesses
transporting building or demolition waste.
The police will have powers to stop vehicles to check if they are registered
and there are fines of up to Pounds 2,000 for failure to comply.
At the same time, businesses which produce waste will be required to check
that the waste carrier is registered and must fill in a waste transfer note
describing the type and amount of waste involved.
Some very large businesses involved in waste disposal are unaware of the new
legislation while many small firms may also be ignorant, said Jeff Cooper,
waste reduction officer of the London Waste Regulation Authority.
'We support measures to protect the environment but it is unreasonable to
require a reputable plumber to pay a registration fee to take away an old
sink in his van,' said David Brown of the FSB.
The FSB objects to the Pounds 95 registration fee being applied to
businesses, regardless of size, and says the answer to fly-tipping is to
provide more rubbish disposal sites.
The federation wants David Trippier, environment department minister
responsible for waste, to delay implementation of the laws. Ironically, as
small firms' minister in the mid-1980s, Trippier lobbied hard to reduce the
burden of red tape on business.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Management: Budget lament to Lamont - Taxation / What the
lobby groups are demanding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses, one of the Conservative party's natural constituencies,
have had little to thank the government for in the past two years.
Many of the small firms that started up so hopefully in the late 1980s have
been swept away by the recession and the survivors have had to struggle hard
to weather the storm.
Next month's Budget, which may be only a matter of weeks before a general
election, will be an ideal opportunity for the chancellor of the exchequer
to make up for some of the damage which his government's policies have done.
Not all the business organisations lobbying for tax changes make this point
explicitly, but it is an assumption that underlies their budget submissions.
Norman Lamont showed himself to have a fine ear for the concerns of
Britain's small firms in his first budget last year. He met a number of
their complaints in a manner that was not too demanding on Treasury
revenues.
Business lobby groups are hopeful that the imminence of a general election
will make for even better treatment this time around.
Despite the fact that the different business pressure groups do not
co-ordinate their campaigns, there is a remarkable degree of unanimity about
the aspects of the tax system which they believe are due for a shake-up:
Inheritance tax is a popular target for lobbyists keen to establish a
climate more favourable to family-owned businesses. The Association of
British Chambers of Commerce calls for the abolition of inheritance tax
while several other organisations urge relief to be given on business
assets. The Forum of Private Business wants taxpayers to be able to defer
the tax on business assets, including shares in private companies.
The Institute of Directors (IOD) describes inheritance tax as 'a capricious
tax on misfortune' and 'a principal reason for the decline of family
business in Britain'. It calls for speedy government action, including an
increase in the tax threshold and a reduction in the rate to no more than 20
per cent.
Capital gains tax is a particular target of the British Venture Capital
Association, which believes it is preventing managers in large companies
from setting up in business on their own.
Pension funds, investment trusts and private investors who use the Business
Expansion Scheme, all escape capital gains, the association notes. 'The only
ones who will certainly have to pay CGT are the ones who make it happen -
the entrepreneur and his management team,' it says.
The association, which won some concessions from the chancellor last year,
wants more generous relief for entrepreneurs who sell their business, either
by abolishing the present age limit of 55 and raising the starting threshold
for the tax or by tapering the relief so that after seven years, gains would
be exempt.
Business Expansion Scheme investors may be better off in tax terms than the
managers they back, but all is not well with the BES. The IOD wants the
maximum amount that can be raised by trading companies (not involved in
property investments) to be doubled to Pounds 1.5m.
The present limit of Pounds 750,000 has practically killed off the BES for
non-property businesses because of the relatively high cost of raising
smaller amounts of capital.
An increase in depreciation allowances has been a regular feature of budget
submissions ever since 100 per cent first- year depreciation was abolished
in 1984.
Even the chambers of commerce, which believe that full, first-year relief
distorts investment decisions, have been persuaded by the fierceness of the
recession to call for an investment allowance to provide 'a one-off
kick-start to the economy'.
Corporation tax attracts a wealth of proposals. The Union of Independent
Companies (UIC) wants small companies to be given a Pounds 10,000 tax free
allowance, with the self-employed receiving similar relief from income tax.
The Forum makes a more modest plea for Pounds 5,000 of corporation tax
relief, but asks for companies to be allowed to defer payment.
The IOD wants the extension of loss relief announced last year - permitting
companies to carry back trading losses for three years instead of one year -
to be made available to unincorporated businesses.
It also calls for the removal of an anomaly in the tax system which means
that businesses pay 35 per cent corporation tax on profits of between Pounds
250,000 and Pounds 1.25m, instead of the 33 per cent general corporation tax
rate.
The introduction of the Uniform Business Rate has hit many small firms,
particularly retailers in the south-east. The IOD wants an immediate freeze
on the level of the rate.
Both the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Forum call for
businesses which should be paying lower rates - many of them manufacturing
companies in the north of England - to get the immediate benefit of any
reduction.
Because the rate is self-funding and the government has insisted on
increases being phased in to ease the burden, reductions are similarly being
brought in gradually.
Finally, the burden of coping with taxes and excise duty. Administering VAT
involves small businesses in a considerable amount of unpaid work on behalf
of the government, recent research has shown.
The Federation of Small Businesses wants the government to pay small
businesses for the work they do. The Forum wants an increase in the
threshold at which businesses start paying from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds
250,000.
Efforts to improve the climate for small businesses are hampered by the fact
that the ministers and officials responsible usually have no control over
matters such as tax and social security levies.
The annual budget therefore is the small business lobby's best opportunity
to influence policy where it really matters.
To judge by their detailed submissions, they could not be faulted for not
trying.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Management: How to bring the accounts to book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Explaining accountancy to the businessman or woman without a financial
background can be a thankless task. However motivated they are to make
profits, few are interested in the detail of how the numbers add up.
Despite the difficulty of the challenge, there appears to be no shortage of
writers, not all of them accountants, keen to penetrate the mysteries of the
accountancy trade for the benefit of the non-financial reader.
Accounting for Non-Accountants: A Manual for Managers and Students by Graham
Mott (Kogan Page, 230 pages, Pounds 8.99) takes, as its sub-title suggests,
a text book approach to the subject. Mott, a retired lecturer in financial
management, plunges his reader more quickly into the complexities of
financial records than the beginner would wish.
It is not immediately obvious why the non-accountant needs to be told about
cost codes as early as page 12 when other more fundamental features of
understanding accounts have yet to be tackled. Explanations are sometimes
laboured with double entry bookkeeping initially described, not particularly
helpfully, as having two aspects, a giving and a receiving aspect.
This heaviness of style and a tendency to present unduly lengthy sets of
specimen accounts make this manual more appropriate for a classroom setting
than for the manager struggling at home to improve on his accounting
knowledge. There are, however, helpful test questions at the end of each
chapter and a comprehensive glossary.
How to Master Finance: A No-Nonsense Guide to Understanding Business
Accounts by Terry Gasking (Business Books, 226 pages, Pounds 9.99) adopts a
brisker, more popular style. Gasking begins by drawing up a personal balance
sheet before moving on to business accounts. Some readers may find this
approach too simplistic; others may welcome a writer who really gets down to
basics.
This guide does, for the most part, live up to its claim to provide a
jargon-free explanation of how profit and loss accounts and balance sheets
are prepared. The chapter on cashflow management provides a clear
explanation of an area of considerable importance in a recession.
Understand Your Accounts: A Guide to Small Business Finance by A. St John
Price (Kogan Page, 260 pages, Pounds 9.99) devotes even more space to the
question of cash management alongside explanations of the profit and loss
account and the balance sheet.
As the title suggests, this book sets out to do more than just introduce the
layman to the complexities of drawing up accounts. It takes in a broad range
of financial issues relating to the management of the small business,
including how to persuade customers to pay their bills more quickly and how
to price products for sale.
The author provides a straightforward guide to the main financial and
accountancy issues that confront the small business owner, although the
reader who simply wants to understand accounts might find some of its
sections superfluous to his or her needs.
Understanding Company Accounts by Bob Rothenberg and John Newman (Kogan
Page, 162 pages, Pounds 9.99) wins no prizes for originality of presentation
but works methodically through the basic principles of accounting, profit
and loss accounts, balance sheets and funds flow statements.
Where this book excels is in the clarity of its style which succeeds in
opening up the conventions of the accountancy profession to the
non-specialist reader. It is particularly good at explaining the
implications of the numbers that appear in a business's accounts as well as
the formulas by which they are calculated. Rothenberg and Newman, both
accountants, manage to tread the fine line between patronising the
non-accountant and assuming too much knowledge.
The present recession has exposed the weakness of many companies, large and
small, in financial management. Too many small firms are content to leave
the details of their finances to their accountant - sometimes with
disastrous results. Business owners need to understand the numbers
themselves if they are to be in full control of their affairs. Even a fairly
basic understanding of the basis on which accounts are prepared will serve
to keep the accountant on his toes.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Sales growth cushions traders from impact of MetroCentre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of the Gateshead MetroCentre, Tyneside's out-of-town shopping
centre, on existing retail areas appears to have been softened by a general
growth in retail sales.
When the MetroCentre - Britain's first out-of-town shopping centre - opened
in 1986 there was concern that it would have a severe impact on established
shopping centres, say researchers from the Oxford Institute of Retail
Management.
Their report, monitoring the centre's first five years of operation,
indicates that although sales growth in nearby shopping centres was checked
in 1987, it generally resumed in the following two and a half years.
By June 1988, when the MetroCentre was estimated to have an annual turnover
of between Pounds 220m and Pounds 240m, it was attracting around 7 per cent
of the available retail expenditure within its 30-minute-drive catchment
area, say the researchers. By mid-1989 it employed almost 5,000 people with
46 per cent of that total full-time staff.
The report says: 'The evaluation did not show any kind of 'disaster' in
trade elsewhere, despite all the indications of changing trends.' It
estimates that between 1986 and 1989 regional retail sales increased by more
than a quarter.
However, the report cautions: 'The 1980s were exceptional in post-war times
in retail sales growth.' It also notes that the MetroCentre's impact was
more severe in weaker shopping areas.

Education Bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO defeats, over opportunities for religious education in sixth form
colleges and academic freedom, were inflicted on the government by the House
of Lords last night.
Dr George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury, was supported by prominent
Conservative backbenchers as well as opposition peers on the religious
issue.
By 17 votes (106-89) they carried an amendment to the Further and Higher
Education Bill designed to ensure that the syllabus of sixth form colleges
should provide for religious education and weekly collective worship.
The government was defeated by 14 votes (86-72) on an amendment moved by
Lord Beloff (C) which curbed the powers conferred on the Education Secretary
to intervene over the appointment of higher education staff and on other
matters.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Combative Tory growler strains at
the election leash - Campaign Profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives have dubbed him the 'rottweiler' of their general election
campaign. The label is consciously ambiguous: a tribute to the raw
aggression he directs against the Labour party, but a less flattering
judgment also on his pugnacious temperament.
Mr David Mellor has been much in evidence on our television screens in
recent weeks, frightening voters with dire warnings of Mr Neil Kinnock's tax
plans. His weekend comment that the Labour leader had been 'craven and
cringing' towards the former Soviet Union provided a flavour of the
combative style. We will see more of him as the campaign unfolds.
He is a close friend of Mr John Major and is guaranteed promotion from his
present post as chief secretary to the Treasury if the Conservatives win the
election. It is a curious friendship. Mr Mellor's abrasive self-confidence
is the antithesis of the prime minister's careful courtesy. Among others at
Westminster, he is not widely liked.
He is bright, politically astute and effective in the brawls that pass these
days for parliamentary debates. His political instincts are those of his
master - dry on economics, wet on social policy.
Like the prime minister he is a keen supporter of Chelsea football club.
Unlike Mr Major, he is fond of eating in very expensive restaurants. He is a
gutsy politician, whose career so far has marked him out as a man who
combines vaunting ambition with a reckless confidence in his own judgment.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, suspicious of his politics and irritated by his
imperious manner, froze him out of her cabinet.
Her demise in November 1990 provided his opportunity. He was a key figure in
Mr Major's campaign, lunching alone with the new prime minister on his first
day in No 10.
No one would describe him as one of politics' humbler souls. He can be as
publicly arrogant as he can be privately insecure. He is as rude to
officials as he is polite to a carefully cultivated coterie of journalists.
He has a keen sense of humour but finds it harder than most to laugh at
himself.
The Treasury establishment has a superiority complex, convinced that, with
occasional exceptions, mere politicians are not up to running the economy.
Mr Mellor, though, is a cherished target. Asked for an instant judgment, one
mandarin replied bluntly: 'Nigel Lawson without the intellect.'
That assessment of the 42-year-old MP for Putney is not entirely fair. He is
a clever man and a talented politician. Friends find his natural disrespect
for authority endearing.
But he cannot be surprised if a careless indifference towards those who work
for him and an ostentatious enjoyment of the trappings of ministerial office
do not attract wider admiration. As one Treasury insider comments: 'I have
never once heard him say 'thank you''.
A colleague who clashed with Mr Mellor during last year's public-spending
negotiations is more diplomatic: 'He was good, very sharp and in command of
the arguments. But he was deliberately confrontational. We wasted a lot of
time'. There were many such clashes. Mr Douglas Hurd is temperamentally as
mild as Mr Mellor is abrasive. But the foreign secretary was incensed by the
chief secretary's less than courteous negotiating style. Mr William
Waldegrave had a rougher time, storming out of one argument over his health
budget.
Nor has Mr Mellor won friends among Tory grandees. At a smart Belgravia
dinner last autumn, one of these Knights of the Shires startled the
assembled company into silence by voicing the hope that his party lost the
election. With delicious sarcasm, he explained: 'I want to see David Mellor
using the bus'.
Mr Mellor started in politics early. The son of a Wareham schoolmaster, he
was chairman of South Dorset young Conservatives at the age of 15. An
education at Cambridge and a spell at the Bar were interludes in a
determined ascent on the political escalator.
Within months of entering parliament in 1979 he was making friends among
journalists and deploying the political invective which has led Mr Major to
put him at the forefront of the Tory assault on Labour's tax plans.
By 1981 he was a junior minister at the department of energy. Subsequent
spells as a middle-ranking minister at the foreign office, the health
department, the home office (twice) and arts exposed his talents and his
flaws. Millions of television viewers saw a blistering confrontation with an
Israeli army officer over the treatment of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied
Gaza. It was an incident, a colleague says, that encapsulated neatly: 'his
personal guts and his love of the television lights'.
The brashness disguises a willingness to strike the deals essential in
politics. Skilful handling of the broadcasting bill won praise from
political opponents as well as colleagues, as he persuaded Mrs Thatcher that
quality as well as cash had a part to play in commercial television.
At the health department he fought alongside Mr Kenneth Clarke in a string
of battles with the medical professions. Others might have ducked below the
parapet.
So he has his admirers; and his unpopularity cannot be divorced from Tory
snobbery. Mr Mellor is a pushy grammar school boy in a party that does not
wholly share its leader's vision of a classless society. A sympathetic
cabinet colleague attributes the criticisms from civil servants to the
instinctive irritation of a public school establishment with ministers who
dare to set their own agenda.
He is not naturally telegenic. A chubby, gap-toothed grin and early 1970s
hairstyle are not the first choice of the image makers. He compensates with
aggression and ready wit. He intends to convince the voters that 'Dogs bark,
cats miaow and Labour puts up taxes.'
As long as he is coining phrases like that, there will be plaudits to
balance the brickbats. But Mr Mellor should be careful not to stumble. Few
colleagues will offer a hand to pull him to his feet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paddy Ashdown (above) yesterday further hardened his party's negotiating
stance if the Liberal Democrats hold the balance of power in a hung
parliament after the election.
He said his party was prepared to force another election almost immediately
if his terms for a coalition were not met.
Speaking on BBC's Panorama programme, Mr Ashdown said he was prepared to see
that the 'government is removed if they have ignored the view of the
electorate.' He has stressed that a commitment to electoral reform for the
House of Commons and an agreed legislative programme for a full parliament
would be preconditions of Liberal Democrat support.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: King move to defuse Trident issue -
Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN effort to deflect criticism that it is dragging its feet over nuclear
weapons, the government is set to spell out that it would not acquire the
maximum number of warheads for the Trident deterrent.
Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, is expected to make clear over the next
couple of weeks that the government would order fewer warheads than the
maximum 512 the Trident boats could carry.
In the wake of the disarmament talks between the United States and Russia,
ministers are sensitive to charges that the UK is getting left behind.
Mr Douglas Hogg, a foreign office minister, reminded MPs in a debate on
nuclear non-proliferation that 128 warheads was the maximum each of the four
Trident boats could carry.
'Trident is a minimum deterrent. We will employ the minimum that is
required. That may - in certain circumstances - be substantially less than
the 128 warheads that is the maximum,' he said.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, vigorously defended the government's
refusal to approve a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
In a statement to MPs on President Yeltsin's visit to London and the United
Nations summit he said: 'For as long as it is necessary for us to have
nuclear weapons, we require the ability to test, and we propose to keep the
ability to test.'
There was a welcome from Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, for the
government's enthusiasm for a rouble stabilisation fund.
He expressed concern, however, that the conditions for the proposed Pounds
280m export credit cover would be so strict as to make the cover unusable.
Mr Major said the export credit guarantee cover was dependent on Russian
membership of the International Monetary Fund, and an IMF programme being in
place, and also on the Russian republic continuing to meet its debt
obligations.
The prime minister faced concerted pressure from Labour MPs for the UK to
meet in full its commitments to UN funding - and some Tory concern lest the
UN might not have enough funds to carry out its enhanced peace-making and
peace-keeping role. Labour said the UK had cut its financial commitment to
the UN by 38 per cent since 1979.
Mr Major emphasised that he had drawn attention at the summit to the need to
ensure the UN had the funds it needed, and said that the UK was one of the
UN's foremost supporters.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Barclaycard claims market share victory over Access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first time in two decades Barclaycard, with 8m cardholders, says it
has overtaken Access, which has more than 10.04m cardholders, in its share
of turnover in the UK credit card market.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays central retail services
division, said yesterday: 'This is the first time since 1979 that we have
been able to nose ahead of the four Access banks. We are gaining market
share for the first time in 20 years.'
He said that Barclaycard had 34.1 per cent of turnover in the credit card
market in the last two months of 1991, while Access, a UK MasterCard
subsidiary brand name jointly owned by National Westminster, Midland, Lloyds
and Royal Bank of Scotland, slipped back to 33.3 per cent.
Barclays has been wooing Access customers for two years by offering a rival
Barclaycard MasterCard alongside its traditional Visa products.
Mr Reay-Smith said that the introduction of an annual fee by Barclaycard had
not affected its market share. 'Strangely enough, Barclaycard has been
gaining market share since it introduced annual charges,' he said.
Access yesterday declined to comment on the figures, saying: 'We don't
believe in discussing matters affecting Barclaycard.' It added: 'Our
turnover was Pounds 11.8bn last year.'
The number of Access cards in the market has shrunk since the introduction
of charges over the past two years. Lloyds, the first bank to introduce
credit card charges, is believed to have only 1.6m Access cards compared
with about 2.8m two years ago.
With credit card profitability sharply down, all the large banks are
focusing on developing their debit card operations, and some smaller credit
card issuers have been forced to withdraw from the market. Potential buyers
are being sought for the credit card business of Town &amp; Country Building
Society after its merger with Woolwich Building Society.
Access's card processing operations were sold to First Data Resources, an
offshoot of American Express, last year. However, the four Access banks
continue to own the brand name and so far have shown no signs of dropping it
in favour of their own individual MasterCard branding.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on Maxwell pensions - Social
Security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday pledged during blunt exchanges in Commons social
security questions to underwrite the guaranteed minimum pensions of Maxwell
company pensioners.
Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, said the pensioners would receive
the equivalent of their state earnings-related pension scheme entitlements,
even if the assets in the Maxwell funds were insufficient to secure their
guaranteed minimum payments.
It was 'not the case that pensioners in these schemes will get nothing or be
left penniless,' he said.
Mr Newton was responding to opposition charges that the government was to
blame for the Maxwell pensioners' misfortune since it had delayed enacting
regulations that would have protected them in the event of a company winding
up.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, charged the government
with 'culpable negligence in sitting on these regulations' and called for
all affected pensioners to receive compensation.
Thousands of pensioners stood to lose 'most or all of their pensions for
which they have contributed for up to 35 years' as a result of the
government's 'complacency and reprehensible laxity,' he said.
The Commons social security committee heard last night that the Press
Association news agency 'pillaged' its pension fund to aid its redundancy
programme.
Mr Alfred Browne, former weekend editor of the PA and now a pensioner, said
that last year an actuarial valuation found a deficit of Pounds 600,000 in
the fund, despite a surplus of Pounds 4.16m in December 1987.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Effort to revive a casualty of conflicting policies: The
archbishop's meeting on Apex in the light of voluntary-sector concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS representatives will meet the archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George
Carey, at Lambeth Palace tonight for what leaders of Britain's voluntary
sector fear may become a depressingly familiar type of gathering.
Dr Carey will ask the private sector to help rescue the Apex Trust, the
national ex-offenders' employment charity, after a crisis over government
funding that forced it to call in an administrator last month.
The battle to save the Apex Trust is not an isolated one. It has many
similarities with recent moves to rescue Fullemploy, Britain's only national
ethnic-minority training organisation, after government funding was lost.
Throughout the country, lesser-known local organisations have closed or
scaled down their activities over the past year as local authorities have
cut voluntary-sector budgets.
In the view of voluntary-sector leaders, the Apex Trust's survival battle
has brought to a head a conflict between government policy - which favours
an expanded role for voluntary organisations in delivering social services -
and an ultra-cautious approach to finance.
Mr Bill Mather, the Apex Trust's chief executive, said: 'What has happened
to us is a signal and a symbol for the entire voluntary sector. The
government says it wants the voluntary sector to take on more
responsibility, but narrow Treasury thinking gets in the way when we try to
do it.'
Mr Mather said Home Office officials have been exploring with a group of
voluntary organisations ways of extending their role in the criminal justice
field.
'Good, innovative ideas have been emerging. But they will come to nothing
while ministers allow themselves to be dominated by inflexible Treasury
attitudes which look only at the short-term figures and ignore the value of
the work other government departments are asking the voluntary sector to
do.'
One of Fullemploy's managers said Whitehall became an Alice in Wonderland
world when Fullemploy collapsed earlier this year.
A Pounds 250,000 Home Office grant had been withheld pending a Charity
Commissioners' inquiry. The commissioners found that, in spite of earlier
difficulties, Fullemploy was satisfactorily managed, and its relieved board
assumed that that would release the grant. It did not.
Fullemploy had reached the edge of insolvency while waiting for the Pounds
250,000, and the Home Office said it could not make a grant to an
organisation when its solvency depended on receiving it.
The Apex Trust's immediate crisis was also brought about by Pounds 250,000 -
this time a disputed overpayment which the charity had to start refunding to
the government.
At least as significant in the trust's financial troubles, however, was a
shift in the payment of training grants by Training and Enterprise Councils
(Tecs) from advance to arrears funding.
Like many voluntary organisations, the trust had negligible capital reserves
and was thrown into immediate financial turmoil by the new arrangements.
Mr Mather said: 'We have never had any working capital and have consequently
lacked the financial security any organisation needs to run efficiently.'
He is satisfied that almost all the charity's programmes are individually
profitable and says the appeal to the private sector will be for a one-off
infusion of capital to establish a secure base.
About Pounds 500,000 is likely to be needed to achieve that.
Many employers have first-hand experience of the Apex Trust's work with
ex-offenders and are concerned about its impending demise.
Since it went into administration last month, the trust has received
messages of support from a range of organisations including Marks and
Spencer, BP, WH Smith, the Post Office, British Gas, Whitbread, Boots, BAT
Industries and Barclays. Its reputation among employers, combined with
high-level support from the archbishop, one of the trust's sponsors, means
it has some chance of raising the money.
One of the lessons of the Apex Trust collapse is that voluntary
organisations must diversify their sources of funding and not become
over-reliant on public money.
That is more easily said than done. The private sector receives far more
appeals for support than it can handle, while individual donations to
charity are on a plateau. In any case, activities such as the employment of
offenders and ethnic minority training are not the easiest of causes to sell
to individual donors.
Voluntary-sector leaders emphasise the need for public-sector funding to
extend beyond the financing of specific projects and recognise the need for
administration, research and staff training to be adequately financed.
Many organisations lack any reserves and can be blown away by a single
financial demand or change of government policy.
Above all, the sector believes the government must take more account of the
social case for supporting voluntary organisations.
Dr Carey's meeting tonight coincides with one at which another group of
industrialists will discuss how the business community can assist the
government's crime prevention initiatives.
The Apex Trust's staff are in no doubt about the answer. Studies show that
people who leave prison without jobs - which the trust exists to help
provide - are three times more likely to offend again.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Vauxhall prices up by average of 2.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL is increasing car and van prices by an average 2.3 per cent, with
immediate effect. It is also increasing its standard delivery charge by
Pounds 10 to Pounds 360.
The rise follows increases averaging 3.7 per cent announced by market leader
Ford last month. Like Ford, Vauxhall attributed the increases to higher
costs and specification changes.
The industry appears not to have been daunted by the publication of a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on car pricing, which is expected
in the next few weeks.
The MMC has been investigating whether cars are overpriced in the UK
compared with other European markets and whether the system of exclusively
franchised dealers works against consumers' interests. In recent years the
vehicle industry has been encountered persistent criticism for increasing
prices by more than the rate of inflation.
The Vauxhall increases affect most models in the Nova, Astra, Cavalier and
Senator car ranges, as well as Nova and Astra vans.
They come within a few days of publication of a motoring survey concluding
that three out of five new car buyers would rather have a lower, fixed basic
price for a car than a higher price from which to negotiate their own
discount.
Ironically, the 1992 Lex Report on Motoring, based on a Mori survey of 1,300
drivers, appears to support a Vauxhall initiative last autumn, when it
lowered dealer margins and list prices of some models to reduce haggling.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEICESTER University and Loughborough University of Technology have agreed
the first steps of a collaboration that may lead to a merger later in the
decade.
Such a merger would be the first in the UK between two independent
universities, each with its own charter. A joint committee, set up by Mr Ken
Edwards of Leicester and Professor Den Davies of Loughborough, the
vice-chancellors of the universities, have decided to:
set up a joint research fund;
formulate joint research proposals;
undertake the joint teaching of undergraduates;
reconvene the joint committee in about 18 months to discuss merger.
The merger idea was floated last May and endorsed by the universities'
senates. Since then working parties have been examining the feasibility of
the idea.
The weekend decision to collaborate rather than work immediately towards
merger springs from concern about future funding of a joint institution. Mr
Edwards said: 'Never has higher education been in a state of such
uncertainty.'
The vice-chancellors believe that it will take at least 15 months before
results of the government's planned changes in the funding of higher
education and in the support given to research will become apparent.
Lack of clarity about future funding concerns indivi-dual departments at
both universities, strengthening internal opposition to merger.
The case for merger rests on the proximity of the two universities, which
are just 12 miles apart, and their similarity in size.
Each of the universities has about 6,000 students and about 270 full-time
academic staff, and they also each offer largely complementary courses.
Leicester was created as a university in 1957, Loughborough in 1966.
The main 37-acre Leicester campus is in the city and is fully developed.
Loughborough has 216 acres with room for expansion.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Broad support for innovation proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT and the Labour party yesterday welcomed proposals to
introduce an extra tier of research and technology institutions modelled on
German lines.
The suggestion has come in an interim report from the Working Group on
Innovation, an independent initiative set up last year.
The idea is to build a bridge between the academic world and industry. The
report is yet to be approved by the Prince of Wales, who commissioned it.
Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that the
proposals would 'be very helpful'.
The report suggested Germany's Fraunhofer Institutes as 'one of the
yardsticks against which to measure solutions for this country'. However,
the report added that they were not necessarily a 'complete model'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, welcomed the report
which he said was consistent with Labour's 'commitment for designating
innovation cities'.
The report says that independent research and technology companies should be
given a higher public profile and receive some public money.
The Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology - chaired by Sir John
Fairclough, former chief scientific adviser to the cabinet - which was
involved in the writing of the report, said last month that such
intermediate institutions would help 'national strategic thinking on
technology exploitation'.
The final report is due out this summer.

FT  04 FEB 92 / GrandMet charity to take over Fullemploy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan Community Services, the training arm of the food and
drinks group, yesterday agreed in principle to take over the operations of
Fullemploy, the voluntary training organisation which caters mainly for
ethnic minorities and which went into liquidation last month.
Mr Geoffrey Bush, GMCS director, said: 'Subject to contract, we are going to
be able to continue Fullemploy's operations as previously. We hope to keep
all their centres running, either separately or linked to our own.'
Mr Aftab Pirbhai, financial director of Fullemploy, said the advantage in
the move was that both organisations had charitable status.
The takeover, due to be formally announced tomorrow, will secure the future
of Fullemploy's operations after months of uncertainty caused by a funding
crisis.
GMCS is a charity which is backed by GrandMet and has a budget of about
Pounds 3m a year. Training experts say it has a sound track record in the
field.
Recently GMCS took over South East Training, a small, London-based
organisation, which would otherwise have had to cut its places on offer.
Britain is receiving Pounds 38.7m as part of a European Community initiative
to boost job prospects. The money will be used to promote job skills
connected with the single market, the support of equal opportunities for
women in employment and vocational training, and improved work opportunities
for the mentally and physically disabled.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Teaching attracts 92% more students
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLICATIONS for teacher training places this year are running at almost
double the rate of last year, and have far exceeded provisional forecasts,
according to figures released by the Universities Central Council on
Admissions (Ucca) yesterday.
By mid December the total number of applications to universities for
teacher-training courses from this September had reached 51,412 - 92 per
cent up on the year before.
Teacher-training applications to polytechnics have risen by a similar
proportion.
The surge in applications is particularly great for prospective teachers of
maths, physics, business studies and craft, design and technology - among
the most acute shortage subjects in the 1980s.
The effect of the recession on a larger graduate market is clearly a factor.
According to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, a year
ago unemployment was running at more than 6 per cent for recent university
graduates and 10 per cent among polytechnic graduates. It is unlikely to be
much lower this year.
The increase may also be partly because of government policies aimed at
making teaching more attractive. Bursaries of between Pounds 1,500 and
Pounds 2,000 are payable to trainee teachers in shortage subjects. The
independent review body for teachers' pay is expected to recommend an
increase well above the inflation rate - in spite of a similar increase last
year.
Applications for places on other courses in higher education are also
sharply up on last year. University applications from UK residents at
188,769 show a rise of 14 per cent on last year, with polytechnic
applications at 222,559 (about 22 per cent up).
The figures exaggerate the increase, since a larger proportion of applicants
than previously have applied to both sectors. However, the rise more than
matches the 8 per cent increase in student numbers which has projected by
the government for this year compared with last year to meet its target of
one in three 18-year-olds proceeding to higher education by 2000.
Teaching apart, courses in geography, media studies, social sciences,
psychology and engineering show the biggest increases in applications to
universities.
Overseas student applications to universities are slightly down on last
year, while overseas applications to polytechnics and higher education
colleges are up by more than a third.
THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers yesterday attacked Conservative support for
the widespread return of grammar schools. It said that any attempt to revive
the selection of pupils by academic ability was the 'road to disaster'.
The call came after Education Secretary Kenneth Clarke signalled that
grammar schools would play a leading role in a more diverse education system
if the Tories won the election.
The 180,000-strong NUT said: 'Selective education failed two thirds of
children in this country. It neglected those at secondary moderns and
condemned them to second-class treatment.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / Citizen's Charter schemes questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPENSATION schemes in the public services are failing to improve the
quality of those services, according to the Consumers' Association.
Commenting today on the schemes, an important part of the prime minister's
Citizen's Charter, the association says: 'A season ticket discount for
trains which do not turn up on time or cash in the consumer's pocket for a
day without a telephone is welcome, but it is no guarantee of significant
improvements in BR or BT services.'
It says more needs to be done to incorporate performance criteria into
decisions about levels of charges.
Ms Sue Bloomfield, a senior policy officer with the association, says in
Consumer Policy Review, one of its journals, that compensation schemes need
to be simple, flexible and accessible. They should cover a wide and
appropriate range of service aspects, set stretching standards and be well
publicised.
Existing schemes fail to meet these criteria, however:
BT's scheme covers only two aspects of telephone service - keeping
installation appointments and restoring service within certain deadlines.
The scheme introduced by the Office of Water Services for water companies
could leave customers unexpectedly without water for 72 hours.
Compensation from regional electricity companies normally offers a reduction
in bills rather than cash in hand, which many aggrieved consumers would
prefer.
Most schemes offer fixed compensation payments, irrespective of the level of
inconvenience suffered.
Many schemes - including those for the water companies and BT - require a
claim from the customer, sometimes in a set period and in writing.
Ms Bloomfield says there is no clear-cut evidence that schemes already in
operation have achieved anything in practice.
Meanwhile the association has criticised the practice of adding service
charges to restaurant bills as 'inappropriate and unjustified'.
It is to meet officials from the Department of Trade and Industry today to
argue for a ban on the practice.
The Restaurateurs' Association of Great Britain, representing about 500
leading establishments, is also expected to argue at the meeting for a move
to all-in prices.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Companies fail to follow accounting guideline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE COMPANIES are continuing to use extraordinary items in their accounts
in spite of recent efforts by the Accounting Standards Board to reduce their
use.
Extraordinary items, which measure profits or losses outside normal trading
activity, are likely to be all but outlawed under a draft financial
reporting standard due to be introduced later this year.
The February report from Company Reporting, a monthly monitoring service of
company accounts based in Edinburgh, shows that at least four large British
companies have used substantial extraordinary items in their most recent
annual reports and accounts.
A statement issued by the urgent issues task force of the Accounting
Standards Board (ASB) in October warned that all the restructuring and
reorganisation costs of a business should be treated as exceptional items -
which are included in the calculation of earnings - from November 23 1991,
unless they stemmed from an extraordinary event.
All the accounts identified in Company Reporting are for 1991 financial
years ending before the new pronouncement came into force, but may have to
be restated in the next set of accounts.
Trafalgar House, the construction and shipping conglomerate, wrote off
Pounds 26.5m as an extraordinary item against Brel, the privatised train
maker, which is an associated company.
Associated British Foods, the milling and baking group, reclassified its 22
per cent stake in Berisford International as a current asset and wrote down
its value as a Pounds 100m extraordinary item.
Burton, the retailer, made an extraordinary charge of Pounds 155m,
reflecting its withdrawal from property development, on top of a similar
Pounds 169m charge in the previous year. Raglan Property Trust, the
development and investment company, counted as extraordinaries losses on a
subsidiary placed in receivership and a provision against legal action
against lenders to the subsidiary.
Company Reporting also highlights two companies that have complied with the
ASB's draft standards. Both BOC, the chemicals group, and Vaux, the hotels
and brewing group, counted business disposals as exceptional items.
The definition of extraordinary items is still under intense debate and is
likely to cause the ASB some difficulty as it tries to impose and police the
new standard.
An official for Associated British Foods said last night: 'We think our
treatment would be correct under the new and the old rules. We are whiter
than white when it comes to extraordinary and exceptional items.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / Rise in demand for homes reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE house prices fell by 1.1 per cent last month compared with December,
according to figures published yesterday by Nationwide, the UK's
second-largest building society.
Demand from would-be purchasers, however, has increased since the new year,
in spite of the slide in prices, according to Mr John Hutchinson,
Nationwide's retail operations director.
'Concerns regarding unemployment and general election uncertainty still need
to be overcome before we can anticipate any long-term improvement in the
market which will, in turn, translate into house price rises,' he said.
The figures show the first signs of an increased level of interest and
activity in the housing market. Estate agents and house builders reported a
big upsurge in interest from prospective purchasers compared with January
last year.
They warned that there had been a high rate of failure between sale
agreements and completions, therefore it would be some time before the
industry would be able to determine whether a tentative recovery had begun.
Most agents and builders said they did not expect to see any increase in
prices until at least the end of the year, even if there was an increase in
volume.
Nationwide said yesterday that the average price of a house had fallen by
2.9 per cent since January 1990 from Pounds 57,670 to Pounds 56,004.

SIX HUNDRED jobs are to be shed by the VSEL shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness,
Cumbria, it was announced last night. The yard builds Trident nuclear
submarines and the cuts will bring the number employed to below 10,000.
The losses had been expected under the company's strategy to deal with the
government's defence cuts. VSEL expects the number of employees will fall to
between 7,000 and 9,000 by 1995, compared with about 13,000 two years ago.
The company said the announcement did not take into account the effects of
its failure last week to secure a Pounds 400m order for three Type 23 Navy
frigates, which went to the Yarrow yards on the Clyde.
Mr Alex Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said: 'We naturally welcome the peace dividend but the
government has no programme to try to counter the worst effects arising from
it.'

THE ANTIQUE collection that furnished the Californian home of the late John
A. McCone, who was called in by President John F. Kennedy to head the CIA
after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, fetched Dollars 1.4m (Pounds 784,000) at
Sotheby's in New York at the weekend. Proceeds will go to an educational
foundation.
A Queen Anne scarlet japanned bureau bookcase sold for Dollars 66,000 and a
German rococo mirror of around 1750 made Dollars 44,000. Reasonable reserve
prices ensured that virtually everything sold.
Later at Sotheby's English furniture brought in Dollars 2.5m, with 20 per
cent unsold. Once again vendors were prepared to accept quite modest prices,
especially for the most important lot, a pair of George III giltwood candle
stands with candelabra. They dated to about 1770 and may have been made by
Thomas Chippendale. They sold for Dollars 82,500, well below the estimate of
Dollars 180,000-Dollars 220,000. A pair of George III giltwood pier mirrors
of about 1765 also sold below forecast, for a similar sum.
Phillips's sale of silver in London did exceptionally well, suggesting that
demand has improved considerably since Christmas. It totalled Pounds 164,990
with only 8 per cent unsold. A pair of George III wine coolers by Paul Storr
were bought by the London dealer Shrubsole for Pounds 30,800. There was also
keen bidding for silver spoons. An apostle spoon made by James Birkby in
1651 was bought by Shrubsole for Pounds 1,870.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): TUC rules on NHS union row -
Recruitment dispute decision may rouse government anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress is likely to face criticism from the government
after a TUC committee advised the FDA Civil Service union against recruiting
senior managers in the health service.
The committee said it saw no reason why other unions - including Nalgo, the
public-services union, which complained about the FDA's recruitment
intentions - should accept requests from their members to transfer to the
FDA.
The incident is politically sensitive because the government plans to
legislate to weaken the TUC's adjudication role in inter-union disputes by
giving individuals a legal right to join the union of their choice. Both the
FDA and Nalgo claimed victory after the report of the disputes committee,
which said it was unable to accept Nalgo's contention that the FDA should be
instructed not to recruit any NHS managers.
Previously the FDA's membership had been restricted to the Civil Service and
Nalgo said it would be moving into its sphere of influence by recruiting NHS
managers.
However, the committee said the introduction of a further union into the NHS
would not be helpful. It hoped the FDA would reconsider its decision.
The dispute occurred after a group among 800 general managers, some of them
Nalgo members, approached the FDA for membership. The FDA says the managers
were attracted by its offer of services to people on individual contracts.
Mr Keith Sonnet, Nalgo assistant general secretary, said his union was
concerned that recruitment among the 800 would provide the FDA with a
foothold in the NHS to recruit among 9,000 other managers. The FDA always
denied that was its intention.
The disputes committee said the FDA should cease recruitment if the
government restored the collective bargaining agreements that were withdrawn
in 1986.
The TUC would make no official comment yesterday. One union leader said the
decision showed that the disputes committee contributed towards sound
industrial relations. The London region of the TGWU general union is holding
an inquiry into alleged ballot rigging in elections for the Ford regional
automotive committee. An inquiry into alleged ballot rigging in elections
for the TGWU construction trade group is also expected soon.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Warning over works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKS councils planned under European Community legislation constitute a
serious challenge to existing forms of union organisation in Britain,
according to an official of the International Metalworkers Federation.
The European Commission is proposing to set up works councils in larger
companies operating in more than one member state. Companies would have to
consult local works councils on matters affecting employees.
In a paper delivered yesterday at Warwick University, Mr Denis MacShane
warned: 'There is a serious dispute currently taking place about who
nominates British union representatives to Euro works councils and it is, as
yet, unresolved.'
Mr MacShane predicted that in spite of Britain's opt-out from the European
Social Chapter at the Maastricht summit, more works councils would be set up
in Britain.
Some British unions dislike the German model for works councils, under which
employees elect representatives. Those unions would prefer the appointment
of union officials.
Mr MacShane predicted that British unions would have to adapt to a
Continental system of rights for workers. He also predicted that the dispute
over representation would be settled when British unions accepted the German
model.
'For the first time in 150 years, British unions are faced with a serious
challenge not in the name of strengthening capital but in the name of
strengthening the workers,' he said.
The Trades Union Congress's organisation committee is examining how to adapt
union structures to the works council system.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): A referee steps out of the ring -
Dennis Boyd, Acas's chief conciliator
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY DAVID GOODHART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACAS, the government's conciliation and arbitration service, is an
unfashionable institution steeped in the corporatism of the 1970s, the
decade of its birth.
It is therefore not surprising that the retirement yesterday of Mr Dennis
Boyd, chief 'marriage guidance counsellor' to the two sides of industry
since 1979, has passed almost unnoticed.
Mr Boyd, officially known as the chief conciliation officer, has been
literally the beer and sandwiches provider at Acas, involved in almost every
big industrial dispute for more than a decade.
One union official who has passed many long nights at the Acas offices
recalls: 'When one side or the other was on the point of walking out, he was
always persuading people to stay on for just one more round of sandwiches.'
That extra round has often given Mr Boyd time to come up with a new formula
that has edged the two sides closer to an agreement.
He has many famous 'deals' to his name, most recently the agreement that
ended the 1990 ambulance dispute. Many disappointments, too, particularly
the 1983 Stockport Messenger dispute and the 1984 miners' strike, where
agreements were tantalisingly close but never materialised.
There is also a broader disappointment - not expressed publicly but shared
by the rest of the Acas establishment - that the organisation's conciliatory
values have gone out of fashion in the era of 'management's right to
manage'.
If the Conservatives win another election there must be a question mark over
Acas's future.
Nevertheless, the organisation is busier than ever before, with a 10 per
cent increase in collective conciliation cases last year and a 15 per cent
rise in individual unfair-dismissal and discrimination cases. At a price of
less than Pounds 20m a year, it is highly cost-effective.
Mr Boyd, 61 yesterday, rose through public-sector personnel management to
the job that made him a familiar name during the big disputes. A name, but
never a face: he has always been able to commute home to his wife Pat, near
Basingstoke in Hampshire, incognito.
He calls himself 'an old-fashioned voluntarist who believes that if the law
does have a role in industrial relations it must command the respect of both
sides of industry'.
He does credit the legal changes of the past decade with exorcising 'the
knee-jerk walk-out'. He also believes that some of the laws, especially
strike ballots, have unintentionally strengthened unions, contributing to a
spate of union 'victories' in recent years 'which have restored some of the
unions' dignity'.
Mr Boyd was universally respected as a patient, imaginative conciliator with
the knack of making everyone believe he was on their side. He will be a hard
act for Mr Derek Evans, previously head of Acas in Wales, to follow.
The retired chief conciliator will now concentrate on turning his golf
handicap from fantasy into reality. But we may not have seen the last of
Dennis Boyd; some friends believe that a Labour government would find a
place for his skills.

<TEXT>
BPCC, Britain's biggest printing group, has suffered a rash of industrial
disputes in response to the company's attempts to reduce over-capacity.
Mr George Jerome, a national official of the Graphical, Paper and Media
Union, said it was in dispute in nearly a dozen of BPCC's 44 plants over
issues including equal pay, casualisation, training and redundancy
selection.
The most serious disputes are at Pulmans in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, and
Cromo in Nottingham, where BPCC has reverted to normal five-day-a-week,
three-shift work, having been on a six-day, four-shift system.
Both plants voted yesterday for industrial action in response to what Mr
Jerome described as a 'unilateral breach of national agreements signed in
1990'. Pulmans has about 200 union members and Cromo about 300.
Mr John Holloran, chief executive of BPCC, said that because of the
recession and overcapacity in the industry, six-day working was no longer
needed. The recession has squeezed margins but the company, which was bought
from Mr Robert Maxwell for Pounds 235m in 1989, is still expected to make a
profit this year.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Noriega begins defence against drug charges: Panama
strongman was US ally, lawyer says

LAWYERS for former Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega opened
his defence yesterday with the claim that he was a key US ally in the war
against drug traffickers.
Defence attorney Jon May said in a federal district court in Miami the
defence would seek to show that Gen Noriega provided unprecedented
co-operation to the US in its efforts to stem the flow of illegal narcotics
into the country.
Gen Noriega, who was arrested by American troops after the December 1989
invasion, could get up to a 140-year prison sentence on drug and
racketeering charges.
Mr May said defence witnesses would include three former administrators of
the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA agents who had worked in Panama and
'placed their lives in the hands of Gen Noriega', a former US ambassador to
Panama, the former head of intelligence for the US army and two Central
Intelligence Agency officials .
Mr May said Gen Noriega's assistance had covered a number of areas,
including assistance in the seizure of drug ships on the high seas and in
identifying and apprehending people in Panama charged with US drug crimes.
He said there would be testimony regarding sensitive and secret joint
operations by US and Panamanian law enforcement officers.
In proclaiming the general's innocence to the jury, Mr May described Gen
Noriega as a trusted and stalwart ally in US drug interdiction efforts.
Following the opening statement the defence called its first witness, Mr
Peter Bensinger, who was the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration
from 1976 to mid-1981.
The trial judge, Mr William Hoeveler, allowed Mr Bensinger to be treated as
a hostile witness. His testimony, which was guarded, illustrates one of the
difficulties that will face the defence, which relies heavily on the
evidence of current and former government officials.
Even before the US invaded Panama, US policy treated Gen Noriega as an
adversary, so government officials may find themselves being asked to give
testimony which contradicts the US rationale for hostility toward the
general.
A second defence witness, Mr John Lawn, in charge of the DEA from 1985 to
1987, was more forthcoming.
He acknowledged having praised Gen Noriega for his 'continued success in
fighting the drug menace which affects all of us'.

FT  04 FEB 92 / US manufacturing decline continues
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US manufacturing declined for the second month running in January, according
to figures yesterday from the National Association of Purchasing Managers,
Michael Prowse reports from Washington.
The association said the Purchasing Managers' index - a closely watched
gauge of industrial conditions - registered 47.4 per cent last month. After
revisions to previous data, this was the same level as in December and the
weakest reading since last May, when the economy staged a partial recovery
from recession.
Readings of below 50 per cent indicate the manufacturing sector is
contracting.
The low reading for the index follows a spate of gloomy data last week,
including a 0.3 per cent drop in the index of leading indicators in December
and a 5 per cent decline in new orders for durable goods.
'The economy drifted into 1992 at the same listless pace as it left 1991,'
said Mr Robert Bretz for the association. Manufacturers were reluctant to
rebuild inventories because of doubts about the recovery. He said the
downward trend in the economy, at best, had stabilised.
The association's indices showed that production was static and new orders
were barely growing. Export orders, while still positive, were the weakest
for four years. The index of manufacturing employment signalled contraction
for the 33rd month.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending
fell 0.2 per cent in December and by 9.3 per cent in 1991 as a whole. This
was the first annual decline since 1982 and the biggest drop in 47 years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina signed a decree yesterday opening to the
public secret government archives on Nazi war criminals in Argentina, John
Barham reports from Buenos Aires.
'Argentina had hidden for 40 years a truth that the world wanted to know,'
he said at an elaborate ceremony.
He decided to lift the veil of secrecy on the eve of a state visit to the US
last November after members of the American Jewish community called on him
to release documents that might throw light on Argentina's role in
harbouring wanted war criminals.
Mr Menem has made great efforts to shed Argentina's reputation for
anti-semitism and distance himself from the ruling Peronist party's pre-war
Nazi and Fascist roots. He has also striven to improve relations with
Argentina's 300,000-400,000 strong Jewish community and the Israeli
government as part of his strategy of forging closer ties with western
governments.
Mr Menem invited Jewish leaders, the Israeli ambassador and ambassadors from
the Group of Seven industrialised nations, as well as cabinet ministers and
head of the armed forces, to witness signature of the decree.
At least 15 prominent Nazis fled to Argentina after the second world war,
including Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele, two of the most wanted Nazi
criminals. They found a ready welcome from President Juan Peron.
Jewish organisations say Peron issued Argentine passports to thousands of
Nazis, and subsequent regimes protected war criminals from Israeli and
German extradition attempts.
Eichmann was captured by the Israeli secret service and executed in Israel
in 1962. Mengele fled to Paraguay soon after, dying in Brazil in 1979. Josef
Schwamberger, accused of murdering 5,000, arrested in 1987 and sent to
Germany for trial, was the only Nazi Argentina ever extradited.

FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Vauxhall plants to consider ballot on
industrial action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL workers are likely to be balloted on taking industrial action short
of a strike after pay talks broke up without agreement last night.
Mass meetings will be held at the company's two factories - at Luton,
Bedfordshire and Ellesmere Port, Cheshire - and a ballot on taking action
will be held if the 9,000 workers reject the company's latest offer.
The move comes after the failure to achieve a breakthrough during all-day
talks between the company and officials from the TGWU general union and the
AEU engineering union.
Vauxhall stuck to its two-year offer of a 5 per cent pay rise from last
October and an increase matching the inflation rate from year two.
The company said 'other enhancements' were offered during the talks, but
refused to give details.
Mr Roger Butler, the AEU's chief Vauxhall negotiator, said the offer was not
acceptable. 'We will recommend rejection. If the members support that, we
will hold a ballot for industrial action short of a strike.
'Vauxhall is the only profitable motor manufacturer. It made Pounds 78m
profit last year and our members are entitled to a share of that profit.'
Southwark Council in south London says more than 100 of its white-collar
staff have accepted a 5 per cent pay cut as it attempts to win contracts in
competition with the private sector.
The workers will suffer the cut from the beginning of June - when 400
building workers will have a two-year pay freeze imposed. Both groups will
lose four days of holiday.
The deal was negotiated with Nupe, the public-service union, and Ucatt, the
building workers' union. According to Mr Keith Furnett, a management
consultant who is advising the Labour-controlled council, it will save about
Pounds 1.8m.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC governors clashed yesterday with President George Bush,
criticising the growth package he presented last week as inadequate to deal
with the economic problems of their states.
Governor Roy Romer of Colorado, chairman of the National Governors'
Association, sharply attacked Mr Bush at a White House meeting yesterday for
not cutting defence spending enough and for disguising the cost of his
budget proposals with accounting gimmickry.
Mr Romer also accused the president of presenting a partisan programme under
a bipartisan veil.
'We're concerned about the budget that you've laid out, we're concerned that
it does not provide the revenue to do what is anticipated there, and we're
concerned that some of those may end up on our backs,' Mr Romer complained.
Mr Bush also faced an onslaught from Governor George Sinner of North Dakota
over the fair distribution of the burden of taxation.
'I think you could tax the wealthy a lot more, and the fact is that if we
continue into this sewer of debt, our children and the families that are
suffering today, that's nothing compared to what the family of tomorrow will
suffer,' Governor Sinner said.
Mr Bush will not unveil the details of his plan to reform health care until
Thursday, but already came under attack from Governor Jim Florio of New
Jersey.
'The approaches that are being offered by the White House will just compound
the problems,' Mr Florio said.
Mr Bush's budget also came under attack from Democrats in Congress, with
Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who chairs the Senate budget
committee, leading the onslaught.
Mr Sasser complained that the administration's plan to cut Dollars 50bn
(Pounds 27.6bn) from defence spending over the next five years represented
an inadequate recognition that the Soviet Union had broken up.
'It would seem to many unbiased observers that the reward for peace is
modest indeed,' Mr Sasser said.
He said the Pentagon's plans for reducing its force structure from 18 to 12
active army divisions and from 10 to six reserve divisions had been devised
at a time when the Soviet Union was fielding 190 ground divisions.
But Mr Richard Cheney, the defence secretary, counter-attacked, demanding
that Congress give him greater freedom to make the defence cuts he wanted
instead of compelling him to buy equipment he did not want.

KUWAIT said yesterday its banks must either merge or raise their capital to
international levels after the government clears them of some Dollars 20bn

'Although the solution to the problem of difficult debts will ease burdens.
. . this on its own will not be sufficient to achieve reform in the banking
and financial system,' said Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Saud al-Sabah,
central bank governor.
'Merging appears to be necessary. . . units that do not favour merging will
only have the option of increasing their capital base to required levels in
conformity to international requirements,' Kuwaiti News Agency quoted him
saying.
Emirate economists said the eight commercial banks would have to merge
because most were undercapitalised before the Iraqi invasion.

NIGERIA yesterday warned foreign businesses of an elaborate fraud scandal
involving bogus officials and documents, state radio said, Reuter reports
from Lagos.
Police are investigating more than 1,000 complaints of fraud, from as far
afield as Europe and Australia, Deputy Inspector-General Perry Osayande
said. He urged foreigners seeking business in Nigeria to check out
prospective partners through their embassies. A diplomat said: 'We estimate
that up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 552m) might have been extracted from people
in the past few years.'
The warning was the second to be issued by Nigeria in six months. In
September, Nigeria's central bank said swindlers using Nigerian names had
extorted millions of dollars from people in America, Asia and Europe under
the guise of transferring cash.
Mr Osayande gave no details of the latest fraud.

A LARGE reduction in imports helped cut Australia's current account deficit
in December to ADollars 767m (Pounds 319.5m) in seasonally adjusted terms,
almost ADollars 1bn, or 55 per cent, down on the November shortfall.
Merchandise imports fell 16 per cent in December to ADollars 3.8bn,
reflecting the continuing recession. Exports remained almost unchanged, down
just 1 per cent, resulting in a trade surplus of ADollars 638m.
The improved current account results follow last week's announcement of a
1.5 per cent inflation rate in the quarter ending December 1991, the lowest
in almost 30 years.
It is now thought almost certain that Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister,
will announce additional fiscal spending in an economic statement on
February 26.
Several lobby groups are pressing the government to let the value of the
Australian dollar fall before then.
During the last few weeks, the Reserve Bank has been propping up the
currency at a value against the US dollar of about 74 cents.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ezer Weizman, one of Israel's most colourful politicians, who helped
negotiate the 1979 Camp David peace accords with Egypt, announced yesterday
that he would retire from parliament at the general election in June.
Mr Weizman is a rare example of a once passionate 'hawk' who over the years
has turned into an equally passionate 'dove', accepting that Israel must
concede a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip if it
is to achieve peace with the Arabs.
Lately an MP for the opposition Labour party, Mr Weizman, aged 67, was once
a defence minister for the ruling Likud party. Now he warns that Likud's
hardline positions under Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, will
undermine the current Middle East peace talks and lead instead to war.
Mr Weizman is a nephew of Chaim Weizman, Israel's first president. As
commander of the Israeli Air Force, he devised and ordered the devastating
pre-emptive air strikes on Egypt that largely won Israel the 1967 Six Day
War.
At that time he was a full-blooded believer in Israel's claim to rule the
West Bank and Gaza. But his Camp David experience, and the deep respect it
engendered in him for Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and his colleagues, set
him on a different political path.
He left the Likud in 1980, joining Labour six years later after a failed
attempt to build a mainstream party of his own. His articulate, no-nonsense
style - in private often riotously foul-mouthed - endeared him to many.
He summed up his 1984 switch: 'We of the military raised an entire
generation to be fighters. The generations to come will have to educate the
people of Israel. . .to believe in the necessity of peace agreements between
us and the Arabs. That's a lot harder than doing battle.'

FT  04 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Freer car market in Peru backfires for
Nissan, Toyota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE liberalisation measures have done what Maoist terrorists, sabotage,
hyper-inflation and death threats failed to do: forced Nissan to close its
21-year-old Peruvian assembly operation.
Nissan Motors, Japan's second largest car maker, indefinitely suspended work
at its Lima plant on November 4. 'The government clearly considers Peruvian
industry is in no position to produce cars,' Mr Carlos Chiappori, president
of Peru's Nissan works, said.
Vehicle assembly in Peru has fallen since the early 1980s when Nissan's
output reached 9,500 units a year, mainly cars and pick-up trucks. Then, as
successive governments opened the country to imports, cutting protective
tariffs, the slide began. In its last full year of operation, Nissan
assembled a mere 560 vehicles.
Toyota started assembling locally in 1967. Peak Peruvian output came in the
late 1970s when Toyota produced 7,000 cars a year. In 1985, in a shrinking
local market, it diversified into assembling the Hi Lux minibus, popular as
cheap transport in Lima.
'From 1985 we were neck-and-neck with Nissan here in a dying market,' a
Toyota representative in Lima said. 'But after a brief upswing in 1986-87,
it's been downhill ever since.' The last Peruvian-assembled Toyotas rolled
off the production lines last July. The motor manufacturers blame labour
costs and an obligation to buy certain local components for their inability
to produce locally-assembled cars at a reasonable price. Security, too, is
an expensive extra in Peru: 10 per cent of costs, Toyota estimates.
A 1987 attack by Sendero Luminoso guerrillas damaged Nissan's plant. It has
been made 'terrorist-proof', but Sendero slogans threaten 'Japanese
imperialists'. The coup de grace for the Peruvian assembly industry came
when economy minister Carlos Bolona slashed import tariffs last March.
Overnight, effective protection for Peru's car-assembly industry fell from
65 per cent to 15. With finished vehicles and parts coming in at the same
tariff, the assembly business was doomed.
'Government policy may be correct, strictly speaking,' says Mr Chiappori,
'but Peru needs one thing above all: work'. He limped on until November
while parts in stock lasted, then cut his workforce of 660 to 100.
Installation maintenance continues, but Nissan sees little prospect of
re-opening. Toyota has reduced its 320 Peruvian employees to 146, most
working in spares and service. But a tenth of the company's installed
capacity has been turned over to making truck superstructures and high-tech
'jigs'.
These test initial chassis assembly. Peruvian technicians have been trained
in Japan, and finished jigs are exported to Toyota assembly plants in
Colombia and Venezuela. 'It's company policy to maintain a minimum activity
here,' a Toyota spokesman in Lima said. 'While external conditions can still
change, especially with regard to import tariffs, there's always a chance of
re-opening.'
That chance hinges mainly on the Andean Pact. Negotiations over a common
external tariff bogged down late last year, with Colombia and Venezuela
pushing for a protectionist 40 per cent tariff on finished vehicle imports
and 5 per cent for CKD (complete knocked down). Peru, now the pact's main
devotee of economic liberalism, is certain to refuse to apply such a high
tariff, although a 25 per cent differential rate is an outside possibility,
Toyota says. Talks should be complete by late February and the fate of
Nissan and Toyota local production sealed.
Beneficiaries of Peru's liberalisation are Mexico and Japan. Toyota expects
to import 5,000-6,000 light vehicles this year, all from Toyota Motors Japan
(which together with Mitsui owns 98 per cent of the Peru operation). Nissan
will import a similar quantity, mostly from Mexico. Mr Chiappori says: 'We
started assembling here about the same time as Nissan Mexico. Now they have
capacity to make 300,000 units a year, and we're closed.'

THE strong role in drafting and enforcing international competition rules
advocated for Gatt by Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, in
Davos, Switzerland, yesterday, accords with current thinking in Gatt on its
future role and concerns, Frances Williams reports from Geneva.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, has said he believes its two most
crucial issues in the next decade will be the link between trade and
environment and an extension of international competition rules. A bigger
role for Gatt in the competition field would follow a successful end to the
Uruguay Round where, for the first time, international disciplines governing
domestic policies and cross-border trade have been discussed.
The draft 'final act' of the Uruguay Round envisages a Multilateral Trade
Organisation (MTO) to administer Gatt and the proposed accords on services
and intellectual property protection. This would come closer to an
International Trade Organisation mooted in 1947 which as well as supervising
Gatt would have had responsibilities for regulating international
competition in restrictive business practices, investments and commodities.

GERMANY'S economic slowdown was underlined yesterday by the latest
industrial production figures, showing a 3 per cent drop between November
and December last year, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
The sharpest falls were in construction and manufacturing, although there
was growth in consumer goods and food production, according to the
seasonally adjusted figures.
A comparison of both November and December with the two previous months
suggests a less drastic slowdown of about 1 per cent, while the year-on-year
figures for the same two months put the slowdown overall at just 0.3 per
cent.
Leslie Colitt adds: East German unemployment rose to nearly 17 per cent last
month, from 11.8 per cent in December, according to the Federal Employment
Office.
The increase - equivalent to more than 250,000 unemployed - partly resulted
from the ending last month of short-time work for many employees. But the
basis for calculating unemployment also changed; previously, 8.8m people
were considered capable of gainful employment but this was lowered to 7.9m.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Germany recoils at Stasi moral snakepit: Many easterners
feel the west is putting their whole society on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN eastern Germany's most prominent politician, Mr Manfred Stolpe, the
respected prime minister of Brandenburg state, arrives in London for
official talks tomorrow he will be closely followed.
Not, as he might have been when he was a dissident churchman under the
communist regime, by the dreaded Stasi secret police, but by a growing
all-German controversy about ordinary East Germans' secret contacts with the
dark agents of the morbidly distrustful dictatorship that ruled them.
It is a controversy that claws at the soul of a still divided Germany and
threatens further to alienate the country's east and west.
Pastors are charged with having informed on their congregations, members of
the anti-communist opposition on each other - including a husband on his
wife - and a leading footballer is alleged to have kept the Stasi informed
about his team mates at Dynamo Dresden.
And Mr Stolpe is at the centre of the controversy. The former senior
Protestant church lay official recently disclosed to an astonished nation
his nearly 30 years of contacts with the Stasi. But he argued that the
Church had no choice in its efforts to wring humanitarian concessions from
the communist leadership.
Some Germans claim the Stasi controversy is part of a necessary act of
Vergangenheitsbewaltigung, or mastering the past. Many east Germans,
however, regard themselves as victims of a west German purification zeal
which was notably absent after 1945.
East Germans charge that the Stasi revelations amount to a west German-led
witchhunt. They see a western plot - which includes the Treuhand
privatisation agency - to 'colonise' east Germany by removing the last east
Germans from responsible positions.
'The west wants us to believe that east Germany consisted of either the
Stasi or its informers, that it was all bad,' Mrs Ute Francke, a young
anti-communist east Berlin doctor said.
Behind the bitter debate lie 200km of shelves containing Stasi files which
were opened to the public on January 2. The Stasi syndrome escalated to an
obsession when former opposition leaders were able to read their files.
Their worst suspicions were confirmed as former colleagues turned out to be
Stasi informers.
Enough unsavoury details emerged to give the files the reputation of being a
moral snakepit.
If so, the files are simply 'symptoms' of the illness produced by the East
German regime, Mr Joachim Gauck, the German government's commissioner for
Stasi files, said in an interview in his austere headquarters.
Mr Gauck, who was a co-founder of the New Forum opposition movement, is
almost as controversial as the files. The gaunt pastor is accused of
presiding like an 'inquisitor' over the files and indiscriminately using
them to determine the guilt of alleged informers.
He admits the files are flawed - incriminating records of prominent east
Germans were erased in late 1989. But the files were not the only criteria
for determining a person's guilt, he said.
'My job is to answer 15 questions on a formula and it is up to the
requesting office to decide whether to exonerate or incriminate the person
and to what degree.'
Mr Gauck, however, has been attacked for insinuating that Mr Stolpe and
other individuals would have a great deal of explaining to do about their
Stasi contacts. He insists that he made such comments to the media as a
'private person'.
Mr Stolpe, in disclosures in Der Spiegel news magazine of his Stasi
contacts, argued that everyone needed to ask himself whether he had worked
'too closely' with the authorities and in some cases perhaps even 'hurt
someone else'.
To many it was an honest, if somewhat muddled, quest for the truth by a man
who had helped gain the release of East German prisoners and rejoin families
in divided Germany while protecting the east German opposition. But it was
seized on by others as an attempt by Mr Stolpe to grab the initiative before
damaging information on him was found in the files.

FRANCE'S conservative opposition increased its majority in Sunday's
by-election for the National Assembly seat of Lille-Ouest in the Nord
region, writes Ian Davidson in Paris.
The National Front candidate also substantially increased his support,
further confirming the growing strength of the extreme right-wing party.
Mr Marc-Philippe Daubresse, centrist (CDS) mayor of Lambersart, romped home
with nearly 78 per cent of the vote in the second round of voting, compared
with nearly 47 per cent in the first round.
Mr Nicolas Crochet, the National Front candidate who had driven the
Socialist party candidate into third place in the first round a week
earlier, raised his share of the vote in Sunday's run-off from 15.7 per cent
to 22.1 per cent. In some cantons he captured as much as 35 per cent of the
vote.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Georgina Dufoix, one of the key figures in the French political crisis
precipitated by last week's brief hospitalisation in Paris of the
Palestinian leader, Mr George Habash, yesterday surrendered to pressure from
her critics and announced that she would resign from the presidency of the
French Red Cross.
Mr Habash's treatment last week was arranged through the French Red Cross,
and yesterday Mrs Dufoix made an attempt to take the blame for the crisis.
She claimed that her 'great error' was that she had not informed any of her
political superiors at the Elysee Palace and the prime minister's office.
'I should have informed didn't do it, nor Hubert Vedrine (secretary general
at the presidential Elysee Palace) nor anyone at the Elysee nor at the
(Prime Minister's office at the) Hotel Matignon. It was a mistake.' Last
week Mrs Dufoix resigned as a presidential adviser after the Habash crisis
blew up. She has been a close associate of Mr Mitterrand for many years, and
held junior ministerial positions in previous Socialist governments, before
losing her parliamentary seat in the 1988 elections.
But there was no sign yesterday that her departure, nor her virtual
admission of responsibility, would succeed in calming what is turning into a
serious political storm threatening the Socialist government of Mrs Edith
Cresson.
On the contrary, pressures for ministerial resignations, and even for a
complete change of government, remained intense not only from the
conservative opposition but also from leading members of the Socialist
party.

FT  04 FEB 92 / EC tackles legal hurdle to 19-nation trade zone: Community
compromises on interpretation of laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC MINISTERS moved yesterday to try to ease the legal logjam impeding final
agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), the 19-nation trading zone.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal, which is currently
the EC president, said the Community had pushed members of the European Free
Trade Association (Efta) as far they could reasonably go in accepting the
predominance of EC law, and that EC-Efta negotiators should aim for 'the
best possible degree of legal homogeneity' in running the 19-state economic
zone.
A Portuguese official said this meant accepting 'less than 100 per cent'
uniformity in the interpretation of common EEA laws.
The action opens the way for detailed negotiations on the EEA to continue
this month before a possible signing of the treaty in March.
The shift in EC mood stems from a realisation that the EEA may only be
shortlived, as most Efta countries have applied, or are about to apply, for
full EC membership.
Indeed, it is the current legal impasse in EEA negotiations which has
highlighted to Efta the unsatisfactory nature of the EEA arrangement that
puts them half in, half out of the Community.
The heart of the present dispute is not over EEA laws themselves. The seven
Efta states agreed to wholesale adoption of some 10,000 pages of existing EC
single market legislation, forming the core of EEA rules. The Efta states
will get the chance to influence future EC laws affecting the EEA, and to
opt out if they do not like them.
The key dispute is over future judicial interpretation of common EEA laws,
as court judgments can significantly alter the impact of a law.
A mixed EEA court of EC and Efta judges would have ensured uniform
interpretation of laws. Or so it seemed, until last December when the
Community's Court of Justice (ECJ) effectively struck down the joint-panel
idea, claiming it jeopardised its own autonomy in determining what was, and
what was not, EC law.
Is either side, then, ready to accept the sway of foreign judges? The short
answer is no. But, as essentially the weaker side in the negotiation, the
Efta states have come up with a compromise:
Competition cases involving EC companies or business turnover in the EC
could all pass to the Commission in Brussels and the ECJ in Luxembourg for
resolution. This is less of a concession than it seems, for two reasons. EC
competition authorities already claim the right to rule on any
anti-competitive practices or mergers with economic effects on the EC
market. Efta states, too, trade less with each other than with the EC.
Disputes over special provisions of the EEA which do not simply mirror EC
legislation would be submitted to binding outside arbitration. One such
special provision would allow the EC to 'rebalance' the EEA accord by, for
instance, suspending all EEA transport provisions if Efta states decide not
to adopt some Brussels rule on road transit.
In such retaliation, Efta says it cannot allow the EC to be sole judge and
jury in its own cause. The EC, it seems, can tolerate outsiders pronouncing
on rules that are not also part of its own internal body of law. But this
still leaves the problem of what happens when EC and Efta courts reach
differing judgments on legislation.
In its December opinion, the ECJ pointed out that such divergence was
likely, as judges in the EC had to bear in mind that the goal of their
Community was a fully-fledged political community, while those in Efta lived
in a mere free-trade zone.
But EC ministers took a more political tack yesterday. Provided Efta states
could be committed to making their best endeavours to take ECJ rulings into
account, they seemed ready to accept that some legal imperfection was a
small price to pay for a common market extended to 380m people.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Brussels plans to speed CIS food aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC is to try to accelerate the pace and widen the scope of its Ecu2.2bn
(Pounds 1.56bn) food aid programme for the former Soviet republics, writes
David Buchan.
The European Commission said it would do its best to speed aid, after
several EC foreign ministers yesterday expressed frustration that EC food
loans were being blocked, and echoed Russian calls for the EC to spread food
deliveries beyond Moscow and St Petersburg.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, reacted to
ministerial pressure by suggesting Brussels might have to withdraw its
guarantee from the long-delayed Ecu500m commercial food credit being
organised by Deutsche Bank, and lend the money directly to the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS).
But Deutsche Bank said last night the problem lay in Moscow, where it was
unclear whether Vnesheconombank - the old Soviet foreign trade bank - had
the authority to take on new loans. The bank said it was still trying 'very
hard' to clarify the borrower's status. This, it added, was a problem which
the EC would have to face if it became the direct lender.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, also urged the Commission to settle
quickly the dispute holding up a separate Ecu1.25bn food credit, offered by
the EC directly. The Commission is demanding Russia waive sovereign immunity
in any dispute arising out of the loan. Russia is refusing.
Pressure to widen the geographical scope of the EC's Ecu450m food grant
programme also came from Mr Hurd, who said that according to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin there were several Russian cities in greater need
now than Moscow and St Petersburg.
These cities had been almost totally dependent on defence and now had no
economic base to fall back on.
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, suggested the EC
devote some of the Ecu400m in technical aid still not spent from last year,
or some of the Ecu500m technical assistance pledged for this year, to
finding employment for Russian nuclear scientists.
But Mr Hurd reported Mr Yeltsin as saying he was taking his own steps to
prevent Russian nuclear know-how ending up in dangerous hands.
Ministers endorsed the Commission's general approach to the CIS of offering
individual republics something better than the simple trade agreement which
the old Soviet Union had with Brussels, but less than the association
agreements just reached with central Europe.
Such 'intermediate' accords should provide for substantial political
dialogue, ministers agreed.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Italian poll could force huge changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE dissolution of the Italian parliament and the calling of general
elections on April 5 has opened the way for an upheaval in Italian politics.
This will primarily focus on the ability of the main political parties to
convince a disillusioned electorate they are still capable of carrying out
the reforms necessary to enable convergence with Italy's principal European
partners. Another political contest involves intricate horse-trading to
decide who will be the country's next prime minister and who will succeed
President Francesco Cossiga when his term of office ends in July.
Both are inter-related because any collapse in the vote for the traditional
parties, especially the Christian Democrats who have ruled uninterrupted
since the Second World War, could affect the candidacy to the presidency.
The forthcoming elections are also the first since the break up of the
Soviet Union and the fall of communism in eastern Europe. As such they will
test the strength of electoral support for Italy's ideologically bereft
left, until last year represented by the Communists, the strongest
opposition party, now regrouped round the Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS).
The outgoing government, headed by the veteran Christian Democrat leader, Mr
Giulio Andreotti, is Italy's 50th in the post-war period. The legislature,
Italy's 10th, should have concluded in May but the increasing difficulty of
holding together the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and
Liberals in the four-party coalition has led Mr Andreotti to concede that
his mandate is exhausted.
Indeed, the bitter infighting which has characterised recent months, not
least over the 1992 budget, has underlined the inadequacies of an electoral
system which produces coalition governments.
The ever controversial President Cossiga appears determined to make sure
that the political ground rules will change. Secure in the knowledge of a
powerful groundswell of support, Mr Cossiga wants to see genuine reform
through parliament. The alternative, he says, is an ill-controlled reform
movement inspired by referendums.
Announcing the dissolution of parliament, he launched an open attack on his
former Christian Democrat colleagues and the opposition PDS, urging Italians
to desert and permit political reform.
The enmity between Mr Cossiga and Mr Andreotti not only risks upsetting the
Christian Democrats' electoral calculations but also the question of
succession to the presidency. If he were constitutionally able, Mr Cossiga
would like to stand again. As this is unlikely, he seems out to spoil Mr
Andreotti's ambition.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Pay deal set to avert German steel strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DISRUPTIVE steel strike in Germany appeared to have been averted yesterday
after union leaders struck a last-ditch pay bargain with employers.
The IG Metall union urged steelworkers to accept a pay package equal to a
6.35 per cent rise in the country's first big wage settlement this year.
Members are to be asked to annul last week's overwhelming strike vote
following the weekend deal, which includes a basic 5.9 per cent
across-the-board rise and a one-off bonus of DM175 (Pounds 60.80).
The settlement straddles the 6 per cent upper limit considered the maximum
tolerable to the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, before it can consider
reducing interest rates from their record levels.
There was concern that the agreement would encourage other unions involved
in, or about to start, their 1992 pay talks to strike in pursuit of claims
which so far are averaging 10 per cent.
Mr Rudiger Pohl, an independent economic adviser to the Bonn government,
criticised the settlement, describing it as a case of 'pilot error'.
The overall 6.35 per cent deal would set 'a standard for the whole economy',
Mr Pohl claimed. The Bundesbank would interpret such agreements as
provocation and maintain its high-interest policies, he predicted.
Mr Helmut Kaiser, head of research at Deutsche Bank, said he was glad a
strike and lost production had been avoided, and that the 'absolute pain
threshold of 6 per cent' had not been overstepped. But he was anxious the
deal should not be seen as a 'pilot settlement' for other sectors.
The agreement did little to ease tension in world markets watching the
Bundesbank for signs of relaxation of its tight grip on German money supply
and interest rates.
Although no rate cuts are expected until after the main pay deals have been
completed, bankers and governments elsewhere in the European Community had
hoped for a clearer indication of the outcome of the pay round.
Steel employers warned that the extra costs of the 'unexpectedly high'
settlement would have to be met by rationalisation. The industry is thought
to be planning to cut its 130,000 workforce by at least 6,000 this year.
Some 70,000 jobs have been lost since 1981.
The deal was hammered out in secret at an industry 'summit' at the weekend
after intervention by Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine
Westphalia, the north-western state where the steel industry is
concentrated.
Mr Heinz Kriwet, chairman of Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker, and Mr
Franz Steinkuhler, chairman of the IG Metall union, joined talks with Mr Rau
and the two sides' chief negotiators.
According to Mr Steinkuhler, the settlement proved 'that reasonable
agreements are possible even in these economically difficult times'. It also
allowed the union to bring wages for steelworkers closer to those of their
better-paid colleagues in engineering.
Mr Klaus Murmann, head of the BDA employers' association, stressed the
importance of keeping rises below 6 per cent. The most important element in
the package for him was 'the five before the decimal point', he said.
The next confrontation over pay is expected at talks between public
employers and the OTV public services union.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Break-ins at MPs' offices fuel conspiracy theories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAIMS that the security services may have been involved in stealing
computer data from Labour MPs' offices, yesterday fuelled pre-election
hostility and distrust at Westminster.
Labour MPs' fears that the party has been subjected to a surveillance
operation were not eased by Liberal Democrat and Conservative revelations of
burgled constituency offices.
Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, demanded that ministers launch an
inquiry into why six Labour MPs' offices at Westminster were broken into and
computer disks or other equipment tampered with. The MPs included Mr Jack
Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, and Mr John Prescott, the
party's transport spokesman.
'Who could have been interested in the Labour party's plans and strategy in
the run-up to the general election? I think the answer can only be either
the intelligence services supplying the Government or the Conservative
party,' Mr Hain said on BBC radio.
Mr Cunningham said there was 'no evidence' pointing to any particular
organisation being responsible for the break-ins. 'I have made no political
accusations and I am not responsible for the story emerging in the first
place.'
In spite of the Labour leadership's refusal to become involved and the scorn
ministers poured on conspiracy theories, the allegations added to a frenzy
of smear and counter-smear, sometimes bordering on the farcical.
The allegations come at the start of what could become Britain's dirtiest
general election campaign, with Labour and the Tories neck and neck in the
opinion polls.
At the weekend there were Labour claims of a Tory-inspired smear over
opposition party links with the Kremlin in the early 1980s.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, dismissed suggestions of a
political intelligence operation as 'nonsense' and 'symptomatic of the kind
of hysteria that seems to have built up on the Labour side.' Only one
break-in at Westminster had been reported to the Commons' authorities, he
said. Conservative Central Office officials, however, confirmed last night
that constituency offices in some marginal seats had been burgled in the
past year.  Computer equipment and a microwave oven were stolen from the
office of Bath MP, Mr Chris Patten, party chairman.
The Liberal Democrats' election strategist, Mr Des Wilson, called for a
tri-party pact to concentrate on issues, not smears. Asked about the
burglaries, he said: 'I don't know and I don't care'.
Party officials later said that constituency offices at Littleborough and
Saddleworth had been broken into at the weekend and computer equipment
stolen. Membership lists had also been stolen over the past year from the
constituency offices of Mr Richard Livsey, MP for Brecon and Radnor, and Mr
Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro.
Last September, the membership list of the Liberal Democrats' councillors'
association, stored on a hard computer disk in offices in Hebden Bridge,
Yorkshire, was also stolen.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Granada TV head quits after split with board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID PLOWRIGHT, executive chairman of Granada Television, was yesterday
forced to resign less than four months after leading the company's
successful bid for a new franchise.
His departure, after more than 30 years at Granada, is being seen by many in
British commercial television as a symbolic turning point, reflecting the
pressures in the industry after the competitive tenders for new franchises.
Mr Plowright, who had been associated with programmes as diverse as
Coronation Street, Disappearing World, Brideshead Revisited and Jewel in the
Crown, made no attempt to disguise the split within the board of the parent
Granada Group.
'There is a fundamental disagreement between myself and the board of Granada
about how to manage the change into the new broadcasting environment of the
next decade. In these circumstances, the group board has asked for my
resignation as executive chairman of Granada Television,' he said.
Staff and department heads at Granada TV in Manchester voiced their
opposition to the forced resignation. One staff petition said: 'His going is
not simply a tragedy for Granada but is a blow to the entire future of
British television.' A Granada executive said: 'It's a clash between public
service television and accountancy television.'
Even The Rover's Return was mourning him. Actress Julie Goodyear, who plays
barmaid Bet Gilroy on Coronation Street, said: 'David Plowright has Granada
stamped through him like a stick of Blackpool rock. He won us our franchise,
and if there is any way that this could be reversed, I'd be very happy.'
Mr Andrew Quinn, Granada TV managing director, becomes chief executive and
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of the parent group, is expected to
become non-executive chairman. Mr Robinson was hired in October from
Compass, the catering and private hospitals group, to replace Mr Derek
Lewis, who was forced to resign as chief executive last May.
Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'I really am genuinely sorry that it didn't work
out between me and David but it didn't'
Two contradictory accusations were being levelled at Mr Plowright at Granada
group level yesterday. One was that he was autocratic and would not begin
the dialogue on the urgent need for change which the board felt was
necessary. The second was that he was inconsistent - appearing to agree that
speculative film ventures would have to stop and then changing his mind.
Executives said the real issue was that, in the middle of a recession, Mr
Plowright was faced with demands for month-on-month profit increases which
he believed threatened the integrity of Granada's licence application.
Staff fear his departure presages plans to make Granada more of a publisher
broadcaster - commissioning rather than making programmes, a charge the
group denies.
Granada shares closed 1p lower at 223p.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Threat to Arctic ozone layer poses health risk in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HOLE in the earth's protective ozone layer is likely to appear in the
atmosphere over Europe and north America for the first time this spring,
according to international scientific observations released last night.
A hole in the ozone layer would expose early season sunbathers to a slightly
increased risk of contracting skin cancer.
Scientists working on the European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment
(Easoe) say 'the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere is highly perturbed
this winter'. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
last June injected large amounts of natural pollutants into an atmosphere
already heavily loaded with man-made chemicals.
Easoe is a Pounds 14m project involving 250 scientists from 17 countries who
are measuring chemicals in the atmosphere from ground-based instruments and
from balloons, rockets and high-flying aircraft. Their observations have
been confirmed by satellite measurements.
The European scientists, based at Kiruna in Sweden, say 'unprecedented'
reactions are now taking place in the atmosphere. Natural chemicals thrown
many miles high by the Pinatubo volcano are exacerbating the man-made damage
caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which have built up in the atmosphere
after decades of use in the world's refrigerators, aerosol sprays, cleaning
fluids and insulating foams.
The reactions have already destroyed a few per cent of the ozone layer,
which is several kilometres thick and about 20km high. It protects life on
earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.
More extensive ozone loss is likely over the next two months, or so, as the
early spring sunshine accelerates the destruction.
How large an 'ozone hole' actually appears will depend on weather patterns
and atmospheric circulation. The original Antarctic hole, which started
appearing in the early 1980s, is a seasonal phenomenon. It appears every
year in the late winter and disappears during the summer as winds bring in
ozone-rich air from lower latitudes.
But the Antarctic hole covers a largely unpopulated region. An Arctic ozone
hole would increase radiation over all temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere, as far south as the Mediterranean.
If an Arctic ozone hole does appear this spring, it will increase pressure
on governments to speed up the timetable for phasing out CFCs. According to
the Montreal Protocol, signed by all industrialised countries, CFC
production must stop by 2000 but the environmental group Greenpeace says the
latest evidence justifies an immediate ban. It would then take several
decades for the atmosphere to repair itself naturally.

Keith Orrell-Jones, 54, is to succeed Jim McColgan as group managing
director of Blue Circle, one of the world's largest cement companies.
McColgan will be leaving in September when he reaches Blue Circle's normal
retirement age of 62.
For the past year Orrell-Jones has been president of Blue Circle's US
operations. He was previously chief executive of ARC, the aggregates and
concrete subsidiary of Consolidated Gold Fields which was acquired by Hanson
in 1989.
Orrell-Jones joined ARC in 1972 and was president of the group's north
American business between 1981 and 1987 before returning to the UK to become
chief executive.
According to McColgan, Orrell-Jones's tenure in the US for Blue Circle has
coincided with one of the worst construction recessions that country has
seen. 'The US division had problems other than the recession. Keith
Orrell-Jones, however, has managed to reduce costs, increase management
efficiency and improve cashflow. I cannot think of many European cement
companies operating in the US which will be able to boast of a similar
record.'
Orrell-Jones was educated at Newcastle High School and St John's College,
Cambridge and is married with four children.

FT  04 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Light profit-taking hits share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW uncertainties on the political and economic fronts discouraged UK equity
investors yesterday and share prices gave ground in sluggish trading.
However, there was no shortage of corporate features to enliven the market.
Profit-taking was encouraged by nervousness over the UK political outlook
and by doubts on the near term prospects for Wall Street. Last weekend
brought indications in the latest UK opinion polls of reviving support for
the Labour party, and of increasing bitterness in the general election
campaign already effectively under way.
London showed only a cautious response to the developments in the wage
negotiations in the German steel industry. UK investors feared that the
compromise agreement might provoke the Bundesbank to raise German interest
rates, thereby snuffing out hopes of an early cut in UK base rates. However,
optimism on UK rates was encouraged by another steady performance from the
pound yesterday.
Stock index futures provided a lead for the underlying market but the March
contract on the FT-SE Index closed well below 2,600, leaving the stock
market without direction at the end of the session.
Among the privatisation issues, which have been closely linked to the
opinion poll fortunes of the Conservative government, water stocks gave
ground as some market analysts took a fresh look at the sector. Elsewhere in
the market, share prices suffered modest profit-taking but the FT-SE Index
bounced when it approached the 2,500 area at mid-session. The final reading
put the FT-SE Index at 2,560.2, for a fall on the day of 11 points.
Traders pointed out that this is the final week of an equity account which
has brought significant gains in shares and that the dearth of company news
ahead may have encouraged investors to take their profits in case prices sag
at the end of the week.
Seaq volume fell to 414.8m shares from the 668.5m recorded on Friday, when
retail or customer business remained high at Pounds 1.4bn. The increase in
retail business on days when the FT-SE Index has been rising tends to
confirm that the institutions are willing to top up portfolios when they
feel more confident about the outlook.
The concern over Wall Street proved unjustified, for the time being at
least, and the Dow Industrial Average was two points ahead when London
closed for the day. But UK analysts remained cautious ahead of the meeting
of the Opec ministers in the middle of the month.
Among the day's features, a cloud continued to hang over the brewery sector
following Friday's reports that the UK Office of Fair Trading had made an
unexpected ruling regarding a planned deal between Allied-Lyons and Brent
Walker. The picture was complicated by the Allied boardroom's rejection of
bid speculation.
There was further demand for Reuters, the global data communications group,
after the UK press reported strong recommendations for the shares from
London brokerage houses, some of which claim that the group now merits an
international market rating similar to that accorded the top grade
pharmaceutical stocks which dominated world equity markets during the 1980s.

FT  04 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Insolvency law excludes silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RE BISHOPSGATE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LTD MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS AND
OTHERS v MAXWELL AND OTHERS
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Dillon, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and Lord
Justice Mann):
January 29 1992
PRIVILEGE against self-incrimination is excluded by insolvency legislation,
and accordingly a person questioned by provisional liquidators investigating
company affairs cannot refuse to answer on the ground that to do so might
expose him to prosecution.
But the statutory exclusion cannot be invoked by a company which is not in
liquidation, administration or receivership, and a former director or other
fiduciary questioned by court order as an aid to Mareva relief in an action
to account for monies transferred away from the company can avail himself of
the privilege under the general law, and refuse to speak.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing three appeals by Mr Kevin
Maxwell and others against Mr Justice Hoffmann's decision that he must
answer questions put to him by the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate
Management Ltd; and dismissing an appeal by Mirror Group Newspapers and
others from the judge's decison that Mr Maxwell was entitled not to answer
questions put to him by their directors on the ground that to do so might
incriminate him.
LORD JUSTICE DILLON said Bishopsgate was the investment trustee of a common
investment fund established for the Mirror Group Pension scheme. Mr Maxwell
was a director of Bishopsgate from February 1988 until he resigned on
December 4 1991.
Large sums of money which ought to be in the common investment fund were not
there and had not been traced. Other parts of the fund had been traced into
the hands of banks claiming security rights.
Mr Maxwell was one of the most obvious persons for the provisional
liquidators to question.
As for the Mirror Group claims, Mr Maxwell was a director of Mirror Group
before its flotation in May 1991, and from November 6 1991 until he resigned
on December 3 1991.
Even when not a director between May and November, he remained an authorised
signatory on certain Mirror Group bank accounts.
In the Mirror Group action, under court orders in aid of Mareva relief, the
Group sought information about 26 transfers totalling Pounds 120m from Group
accounts, from May 29 to November 29 1991.
It appeared that some Pounds 50m represented a facility which Mr Maxwell
helped his father to negotiate for the Group with Bankers Trust Co.
The Group's present directors wanted to know the purpose of that facility,
and of each of the 26 payments.
Apart from his concern with the negotiation of the Pounds 50m facility, Mr
Maxwell was one of the signatories who authorised two of the 26 payments.
There was no doubt that, apart from the privilege against
self-incrimination, Bishopsgate by its provisional liquidators, and Mirror
Group, were entitled to receive from Mr Maxwell any information he had on
the respective matters about which they sought to question him.
It was conceded for the liquidators and for the Group that answering the
questions might expose Mr Maxwell to prosecution on charges of conspiracy.
Privilege against self-incrimination became established in the Common Law
after abolition of the Court of Star Chamber.
Parliament could abrogate the privilege by statute.
Two recent decisions in which it had been held that the privilege was
impliedly unavailable to a person questioned under a statute were London
United Investments FT, January 17 1992, and Bank of England v Riley, October
17 1990, CA.
The essence of both decisions was that if Parliament in the public interest
set up investigatory procedures to find out if a company's affairs had been
conducted fraudulently, or if there had been infringements of the Banking
Act, it could not have intended that anyone questioned under those
procedures should be entitled to rely on the privilege.
The question in the Bishopsgate appeals was whether similar reasoning
applied to the relevant sections of the Insolvency Act 1986.
Section 235 of the Act provided that an officer of a company, required to
answer the queries of an 'office holder' (administrator, administrative
receiver, liquidator or provisional liquidator), 'shall' give him such
information as he might reasonably require.
Section 236 provided that the court might summon before it any officer of
the company or other person thought capable of giving information concerning
the company.
In Levitt, October 29 1991, which Mr Justice Hoffmann followed, Mr Justice
Vinelott said rightly that the provisions of the 1986 Act must be looked at
as a whole to ascertain the purpose of an examination under section 236, and
whether that purpose necessarily involved abrogation of the privilege.
He said: 'To answer that question the court must ask whether the person whom
it is sought to examine owes a duty to furnish information sought, and
whether there is any public interest in ensuring that the inquiry was
carried out thoroughly and expeditiously.'
Part of the mischief in the old law was its apparent inability to deal
adequately with dishonesty or malpractice on the part of bankrupts or
company directors.
That was a matter of public concern and there was a public interest in
putting it right.
As steps to that end, Parliament had by the 1986 Act greatly extended the
investigative powers available to office-holders with the assistance of the
court, and had expressly placed officers of the company and others listed in
section 235(3) under a duty to assist the office-holder.
In agreement with Mr Justice Vinelott's general approach, it was held that
Mr Maxwell was not entitled to rely on the privilege. The Bishopsgate
appeals were dismissed.
With regard to the Mirror Group appeals, the Group was not in liquidation,
administration or administrative receivership. Accordingly, it could not
invoke the 1986 Act and had to rely on the general law.
It submitted that under the general law privilege against self-incrimination
was not available to a fiduciary, servant or agent.
It relied on Green v Weaver (1827) 1 Sim 404, Robinson v Kitchin (1856) 21
Beav 365,8 DeGM &amp; G 88, and Chadwick v Chadwick (1852) 22 LJCh 329.
Mr Falconer for the Group said that any person who by contract put himself
into the position of fiduciary, servant or agent, impliedly contracted not
to invoke the privilege.
It was wholly unreal to suppose that when two parties, neither of whom was
in probability thinking of privilege against self-incrimination, entered
into a contract under which one became the other's fiduciary, servant or
agent, they impliedly contracted that he could not invoke privilege.
Several of the earlier cases which formed the background of authority to the
three cases were so tersely reported and difficult to follow that it was not
possible to derive any principle from them. The same could be said of
Chadwick.
In Green, where unqualified brokers held themselves out to be qualified,
Hart V-C held they could not rely on the privilege. He deduced from the
authorities that a man by contract or the effect of his own acts might
exclude himself from the benefit of the privilege against
self-incrimination.
The facts in Robinson were similar and Green was approved.
It was possible that Green and Robinson depended on some principle of
estoppel. If so, they had no bearing on the present case.
In Tate Access Floors v Boswell (1991) Ch 512 Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson
V-C held that Green and Weaver did not establish the wide proposition that a
fiduciary impliedly contracted not to claim privilege. He doubted that the
cases were good law today.
Privilege against self-incrimination was so firmly entrenched in English law
before Green, that it could not have been open to Hart V-C to carve such a
substantial exception out of the privilege.
The present court was not bound by Green and Robinson.
It upheld the decision in Tate Access Floors, which Mr Justice Hoffmann
followed.
The Mirror Group's appeal was therefore dismissed.
Any decision to curtail the privilege or make it unavailable was a matter
for Parliament.
Ther Lordships gave concurring judgments.
For Mr Maxwell: Gavin Lightman QC, R Alun Jones QC, Michael Briggs and
Philip S Marshall (Peters &amp; Peters).
For Bishopsgate: Philip Heslop QC and John Brisby (Stephenson Harwood).
For Mirror Group: Charles Falconer QC, Martin Moore and Lexa Hilliard
(Lovell White Durrant).

NEWS THAT the world's biggest waste management group plans a Dollars 500m
listing in New York and London lifted Wessex Water, whose joint venture
group with Waste Management International will form part of the flotation.
The planned listing incorporates all the non-North American business of the
parent company.
Dr Angela Whelan at BZW said the US waste management market was several
years ahead of Europe in terms of environmental legislation and commercial
development. 'The move for a listing sends a very strong signal that Waste
Management sees considerable growth in the European market,' she said.
Wessex gained 12 to 412p.
Elsewhere, sentiment turned against the water utilities, as traders and
analysts considered the sector's recent surge - it outperformed the Footsie
by 6 per cent in January - overdone. County NatWest changed from a buy to a
hold on the sector, analyst Mr Robert Miller arguing that 'the upside is
limited until the election outcome is clearer.' However, he is moving to a
sell on Thames Water, believing its recent outperformance to have gone too
far. Thames lost 3 to 368p.
Courtaulds hit
Chemicals and fibres group Courtaulds fell sharply after one UK agency
broker expressed caution on the outlook, other City analysts cut profit
forecasts and the shares were hit by profit-taking following a two-day
presentation by the company at the Gleneagles hotel in Scotland.
James Capel remained convinced that the stock was expensive relative to
others in the sector and reiterated to clients its 'weak hold' stance, first
published in September. At that time, Capels also featured BOC and Mr David
Ingles of the house chemicals team said yesterday: 'We think they are both
good companies but Courtaulds is a little expensive while BOC is a little
cheap.' BOC, helped by a stock squeeze ahead of first quarter results on
February 13, rose 10 to 648p.
A number of securities houses marked their return from Scotland by shaving
profit forecasts after Courtaulds had signalled that profits for the year to
March 1992 would be no higher than Pounds 200m. For instance, Hoare Govett
came back by Pounds 5m to Pounds 200m despite being a buyer of the stock.
Finally, there was profit-taking following a 22p rise in the stock over the
past fortnight. The shares fell 12 to 522p.
Granada upset
The resignation of Mr David Plowright, executive chairman of Granada TV,
caused consternation but no instant consensus in the market over the
implications for the performance of parent Granada Group. Although the
market had been alerted to boardroom unrest for several weeks, the
resignation came as a shock, particularly as Mr Plowright was due to retire
at the end of the year.
One leading analyst criticised chief executive Mr Gerry Robinson for
'rocking the boat'. Large shareholders also expressed unease at the
upheaval. However, others in the market believed the move strengthens Mr
Robinson's hand in tackling Granada's financial problems. The shares eased a
penny to 223p.
Allied-Lyons fell 10 to 639p following a report that the Office of Fair
Trading would still count as tied 734 pubs which the brewer plans to lease
to Brent Walker.
The report resulted in Warburg Securities cutting its estimate of Allied's
profits this year by Pounds 20m to Pounds 630m and next year by Pounds 33m
to Pounds 700m.
Berisford International was one of the most actively-traded stocks yesterday
after the new chief executive, Mr Alan Bowkett, bought Pounds 1m worth of
stock. The shares gained gained 2 to 26p on turnover of 11m.
Tightly-traded Wellcome jumped 24 to 1173p after announcing that interim
analysis of a Wellcome study supports the use of its Aids treatment Retrovir
at an earlier stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Over a
two-year period Retrovir can halve the likelihood of disease progression for
people infected with HIV but who are still healthy, according to newly
available data, the firm said.
Profit-taking left Thorn-EMI 15 off at 826p. The shares had risen on Friday
after the group announced plans to rationalise its electrical retailing
operations. Yesterday's fall was stemmed by news of Thorn's Pounds 31m
purchase of a US rent-to-own group, a move which will strengthen its hold in
the sector.
Speculation that Monument Oil &amp; Gas might bid for Premier Consolidated
lifted the latter 2 1/2 to 30p and left the former slightly easier at 36p.
Fisons fell 7 to 387p after securities houses advised profit-taking as bid
rumours dimmed. Last week persistent speculation suggested that Hanson (off
4 at 205p) might bid for Fisons or make a joint offer with Medeva (off 2 at
274p).
Buying ahead of the figures on February 12 continued in Reuters and pushed
the shares up by 11 to 1139p.
A cut in profit forecasts by one US securities house hung over Royal Bank of
Scotland, which lost 5 to 161p. The house reduced its estimate for the year
to March 1992 by Pounds 35m to Pounds 140m and for the forthcoming year by
Pounds 90m to Pounds 200m. The cuts reflect lack of profits in the bank's
English operations and do not take into account bad debts, expected to be
around Pounds 295m. The house also adopted a more bearish stance on the
shares.
Profit-taking took the wind from Rank Organisation's sails, the shares
losing 6 to 665p. There was also talk of brokers switching to Ladbroke, with
the feeling that the shares represent good value in the lead-up to the
leisure group's results in April, and with the possibility of an increased
dividend. Yesterday UBS moved its stance on Ladbroke to a buy. The shares
lost 4 to 210p.
Leading property shares fell on fears that the possibility of an interest
rate cut was fading. British Land lost 5 to 268p, Hammerson 'A' fell 9 to
498p, while MEPC slipped 7 to 377p.
National Power and PowerGen were each squeezed 5 higher on a shortage of
stock. PowerGen closed at 243p and National Power ended at 232p.
Acquisitive conglomerate Tomkins jumped 9 to 441p after UBS Phillips and
Drew reiterated its positive recommendation on the stock. Mr Jack Jones at
the securities house said the company had 'a strong balance sheet and cash
flow and is well placed for further acquisitions.'
Worries over the dividend continued to overhang BET, down another 5 to 146p.
Profit-taking and a forecast cut from SG Warburg hit Siebe. The shares lost
16 to 563p after the broker was reported to have reduced current-year
estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 150m. The following year's figure was cut
by Pounds 20m to Pounds 180m and Warburg cited weakness in the US economy
where Siebe derives over 40 per cent of its sales. Turnover reached 1.8m.
TI Group continued weak after a negative report from brokers Williams de
Broe on the company's accounting practices. The shares gave up another 17 to
580p.
James Wilkes added 5 to 182p after Petrocon Group announced a Pounds 36.6m
bid for the company. Petrocon closed unchanged at 46p.
Securiguard jumped 17 to 136p after reporting a 30 per cent improvement in
profits.
The FT's London Share Service now carries Investment Trust share prices in
two separate categories. Those companies designated as investment trusts by
the UK Inland Revenue under rule 842 of the Income and Corporation Tax Act
1988 - all those shown under the Investment Trusts heading in the past -
will be listed as Investment Trusts-Authorised.
A second category, Investment Trusts-Unauthorised, will contain 56 companies
until now listed under the Other Financials heading. Initially, daily net
asset values estimated by County NatWest WoodMac will be shown for seven of
these companies. In time, it is hoped to provide net asset values for all
this category.

FT  04 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS reported a dull session in the derivatives markets, with little in
the way of economic data or other features on which to focus, writes Joel
Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the March contract opened strongly, with a 32-point
premium and was squeezed higher before running into a bout of mid-morning
selling.
The selling reduced the March premium prompting renewed buying before a poor
opening on Wall Street once again halted the contract's advance. Sentiment
was also affected by weakness in other European markets and concern at the
level of pay settlements agreed for German steel workers.
March closed at 2,589, and some 13 points above its estimated fair value
premium of 16. Volume reached a reasonable 6,820 contracts.
In traded options, turnover reached 24,680, down on Friday's high figure of
more than 31,000 contracts.
The FTSE-100 Index option was busy, trading 7,058 contracts. British Gas was
the busiest stock option, with 2,182 lots dealt. The June 240 puts were the
busiest series. This was followed by Hillsdown, with 1,560 contracts and
then Cable &amp; Wireless, with 1,133 lots changing hands.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Appointments: The compliance merry-go-round
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernard Rouget, who has been in charge of compliance at County NatWest in
the aftermath of the Blue Arrow affair, moves to become director of group
compliance at National Westminster Bank.
Rouget, 54, who had earlier been a senior inspector at NatWest, was plucked
from the St James's Street branch of the UK clearer after the 1987 stock
market crash to help sort out auditing procedures after a trainee accountant
client of County NatWest had managed to run up losses of over Pounds 1m in
traded options positions.
Rouget initially reported to Elizabeth Brimelow, who later became embroiled
in the Blue Arrow investigation. Rouget took over her job, as head of
compliance as well as audit, in September 1988.
His primary task, he says, was to establish the independence of the
compliance function. 'We were all feeling our way somewhat,' he recalls,
referring to the early days of the implementation of the Financial Services
Act.
Reporting lines were to the chairman and chief executive of County as well
as to the director of group compliance, the job he moves to on the
retirement of John Fraser, who had been at NatWest for 44 years.
Rouget is replaced by Keith Palmer, a 'natural fit' from his previous job as
deputy group compliance director at Midland as well as head of compliance
for Midland Montagu. Palmer, who is 46, joined Midland's legal department in
1975.
While Rouget acknowledges that compliance is easier in the current sombre
environment - a marked contrast to the frenetic deal-making that
characterised the latter part of the 1980s - he emphasises that compliance
officers cannot afford to rest on their laurels when business is scarce -
'that is when commissions are hard to come by'.

Barclays de Zoete Wedd has promoted three Frenchmen from its Paris corporate
finance operation to the positions of managing director, previously a title
within the Barclays group inhabited largely by British nationals.
Bertrand Poplu, Michel Tirouflet and Thierry Varene are all at Compagnie
Financiere Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The move reflects a further effort to internationalise top management as the
UK clearer pursues its ambitions on the continent. Barclays recently
announced Carlos Martinez de Campos as its new director of European retail
banking and Jacques Rambosson as director of European corporate banking.
Other managing directors of corporate finance announced by BZW are Richard
Mews, based in Hong Kong, John Plaxton in Toronto, and Richard Gillingwater,
Malcolm Le May and Philip Remnant in the UK.
*****
Sir John Cuckney has announced that he will resign as chairman of 3i at the
agm in July. He had originally planned to steer the company through its
flotation and then step down in 1993.
However, those plans were made in the belief that the flotation would take
place in March. Since it has now been postponed until after the election,
Sir John thinks it would be preferable for his successor to be in place for
the flotation.
*****
Simon Thorp, who recently left Salomon Brothers, has now joined NatWest as
head of gilts trading. NatWest claims it has beefed up its gilt trading
operations during 1991 and is 'currently trading profitably' after showing
pre-tax losses in the four years after Big Bang. It claims to have a market
share of between 6-7 per cent in gilt-edged market making.

Jonathan Custance Baker is appointed md and director of European business
development, PUTNAM's new London office.

FT  04 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Political initiative
helps Nikkei to rise for the third day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices extended their gains to a third day yesterday. Buying by
foreign investors and arbitrageurs lent general support to the Nikkei
average in thin trading, and last Friday's political initiative for the
equity market brought added interest in the afternoon, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei, which rose 2.1 per cent on Friday, added another 116.54 to close
at 22,139.59. The 225-share average eased on arbitrage-related activity,
hitting a low of 21,973.95 in the morning, but later rebounded to an
intraday high of 22,340.92 in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 200m shares from Friday's 330m, as activity remained
dealer-led. Advances led declines by 604 to 356, with 158 issues remaining
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 1.68 to
1,632.62, although in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.6 to 1,251.07.
The afternoon boost came from reports that the ministry of finance had
accepted the leading Liberal Democratic Party's recommendations to consider
a rescue package for the sluggish equity market. Last Friday, leaders of the
LDP expressed their concern over the current stock market slump, and urged a
review of dividend policies and the securities tax system.
Price movements, however, were still dominated by futures-related activity,
and the rally lost steam towards the end of the session after
arbitrage-related selling. 'The underlying environment hasn't changed much,'
said Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto at Nikko Research Institute.
Foreign investors remained buyers. 'The foreigners were active buyers in
January, and will remain so this month,' said Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg
Securities. He added that the strength in the second section and
over-the-counter market was an encouraging sign of real demand, rather than
index-linked trading.
Despite foreign support, average daily trading volume on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's first section fell to a 10-year low for January, at 217.4m
shares.
Bargain-hunting by foreigners lifted some high-technology issues. Sony
advanced Y100 to Y4,340 and Pioneer Electronic gained Y110 to Y3,520. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone rose Y12,000 to Y713,000.
Banking issues lost ground. Traders said that investors have been selling
the sector due to concerns over the banks' exposure to real estate loans.
Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y2,930 and Fuji Bank lost Y50 to
Y2,250.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 75.88 to 23,714.35 in volume of 29.7m
shares. After slumping on profit-taking in the morning, the index gained for
the fifth consecutive day on buying in the drug and construction sectors.
Ono Pharmaceutical gained Y280 to Y5,690.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim was quiet ahead of today's Chinese New Year holiday.
Singapore, Seoul, Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur were closed.
HONG KONG saw active half-day trade, the Hang Seng index putting on 70.31 to
4,672.09 in turnover of HKDollars 1.64bn. Interest continued in the banking
and property sectors, with bank results due out later in the month.
Hong Kong Bank gained 75 cents to HKDollars 38.25, New World rose 40 cents
to HKDollars 13.70 and Swire Pacific put on 70 cents to HKDollars 25.80.
BANGKOK was quiet with turnover at Bt3.4bn down on the recent record highs:
the SET index rose 3.74 to 767.19. The release of some 50 annual results had
a mixed effect although banks gained: Bangkok Bank rose Bt14 to Bt554 and
Thai Farmers Bank Bt12 to Bt422.
AUSTRALIA ended lower despite economic news which was better than
expectations. The release of December's current account deficit, the lowest
in almost four years, and a rise in housing approvals pushed the market
ahead before it fell. The All Ordinaries closed down 11.4 to 1,611.3 in
turnover of ADollars 184.5m, down on last week.
Coles Myer, the retailer, issued disappointing half-year sales figures and
lost 40 cents to ADollars 11.70.
The announcement by prime minister Mr Paul Keating that the economic
statement would be on February 26 is likely to make the market cautious,
analysts said.
NEW ZEALAND showed little interest, with the NZSE-40 index up 4.02 to
1,459.07 in volume of NZDollars 19.8m.
MANILA rose on investor confidence, buoyed by last week's sale of
state-owned Philippine Airlines to a private group. The composite index
closed 11.31 up at 1,267.28 in volume of 3.2bn (2.1bn).
BOMBAY fell sharply after trading restrictions were announced. The BSE Index
was off 29.73 from Friday's record close to 2,272.81.

FT  04 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Good showing in Japan lifts world index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong showing in Japan, on the back of futures-linked buying, helped lift
the overall performance of global stock markets last week. According to the
FT-Actuaries World indices, the world index rose 0.5 per cent in local
currency terms, but it would have fallen by the same amount if Japan's 2.9
per cent increase had been excluded.
Nomura International says that although sentiment in Tokyo remains
depressed, due to tokkin and mutual fund selling to meet redemptions and the
prospect of further political scandals, the oversold nature of the stock
market could prompt a recovery. Another pointer to an upward equity
correction is the increased volatility in index options, which have
increased their influence on the Tokyo stock market during the past few
months.
Europe performed better than the world index with a 1.2 per cent rise on the
week, thanks mainly to a 2.4 per cent rise in the UK. Europe also produced
the week's best rise in the FT-A world indices, with Austria rising 4.3 per
cent. The Austrian market fell by 14.2 per cent last year as civil unrest in
Yugoslavia prompted an exodus by international investors.
Mr Martin Gollner, Austrian analyst at Baring Securities, says that
foreigners had started to return and were keen to pick up cheap, cyclical
companies in anticipation of an economic recovery in Europe in 1993. Radex
and Veitscher, two producers of refractory bricks for furnaces, were in
demand. Volume also improved, and stood at Sch758m (Dollars 66m) last
Friday, well up on September's average daily volume of Sch539m.
However, Mr Gollner is cautious about the overall outlook for Austria, which
is restricted by high interest rates in neighbouring Germany, depressed
economies in eastern Europe and the prospect of a flood of rights issues
which were delayed last year.
Sweden was the week's worst faller, on opposition to the Volvo/Procordia
merger.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Trading held to tight ranges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading was restricted to tight ranges yesterday on the foreign exchange
markets, with dealers cautious ahead of US employment data due for release
on Friday, writes Simon London.
The dollar was mixed overnight in the Far East, losing ground against the
D-Mark but holding firm against the yen. The US currency closed in Tokyo at
DM1.6050, from DM1.6115 at the close in New York, and Y125.65 from Y125.80.
These tight ranges were carried forward into European trading, with only a
brief flurry of activity on the announcement that German steel workers and
employers had reached agreement over pay.
The 130,00 workers represented by the IG Metall union now look likely to
accept a 6.4 per cent pay offer. The union was originally asking for a 10.1
per cent pay increase and last week received strong backing for strike
action. Even so, most analysts saw the settlement as disappointing and
encouraging other unions to press for higher pay.
Against this, industrial production figures for December showed output in
western Germany falling by 3.1 per cent during the month, having risen by
0.3 per cent in November. Although the data is distorted by national
holidays, the figures were taken as a sign that economic activity is now
contracting.
Overall the D-Mark was stronger. The settlement higher than retail price
inflation, currently around 4 per cent, may encourage the Bundesbank to
maintain a tight monetary stance.
In the afternoon session, the dollar weakened further against the D-mark
following the realese of the monthly index produced by the US National
Association of Purchasing Managers. The index registered 47.4 in January,
unchanged from December. A figure below 50 shows that economic activity is
generally contracting.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.5975 from DM1.6080 on Friday;
Y125.90 from Y125.55; Sfr1.4235 from Sfr1.4285; and Dollars 1.8000 from
Dollars 1.7900 against sterling.
The D-Mark was also stronger against the yen, rising to Y78.75 by the London
close, having traded below 78.00 at the end of last week.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the strength of the D-Mark
renewed the pressure on sterling, the weakest currency.
The UK unit fell back in the afternoon to close at DM2.8675 from DM2.8775 on
Friday, just a shade above its floor within the system, determined by its
maximum permitted divergence from the strongest currency, the peseta.
The peseta was bouyed by the removal of capital controls in Spain, closing
in London at Pta62.91 against the D-Mark, little changed from the levels
seen on Friday.
Analysts expect the liberalisation measures to increase the flow of overseas
funds into peseta assets.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money market rates were little changed yesterday although conditions were
squeezed as repurchase agreements set in January reached maturity, writes
Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 650m early in
the session, later revised up to Pounds 750m. The main component was
maturing repurchase agreements set last month, draining Pounds 1.106bn from
the market. This was moderated by exchequer transactions, which added a net
Pounds 620m to the system.
However, rates were steady early in the day at below 11 per cent and the
Bank of England added only Pounds 22m funding during the morning session,
through the purchase of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Afternoon assistance amounted to a more substantial Pounds 368m, again
through the outright purchase of band 1 and band 2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per
cent. A late liquidity injection of Pounds 70m bought total assistance for
the day to Pounds 560m.
Despite the net drain of funds during the day, overnight money rates were
stable. The unsecured overnight money rate closed at 10 - 9/16 per cent from
10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent at the end of last week. One month interbank money
closed at 10 - 5/8 per cent; three-month interbank funds closed at 10 5/8 -
1/2 per cent.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange was weaker, closing at 89.63 from 89.67 at the close on
Friday.
Analysts commented that the pay settlement between German steel workers and
employers for a 6.4 per cent pay offer meant that German interest rates are
likely to stay high for some time. This could limit the ability of the UK
government to reduce interest rates, a factor reflected in the futures
market. The closing level of the March sterling contract implies bank base
lending rates of 10.37 per cent by the Spring.
In Frankfurt call money interest rates eased following the sharp month-end
liquidity squeeze last week. Call money traded mostly at 9.60/70 per cent,
from a peak of 9.75 per cent on Friday.
The tight conditions last week were reflected in the amounts borrowed by
financial institutions at the Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency
funding rate. Lombard borrowings rose to DM7.1bn on Friday, from DM2.1bn on
Thursday.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bond scheme suggested to break
CAP reform deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLOCK over reform of Europe's crippling farm subsidy policies could
be broken by offering farmers one-time payments in the form of marketable
bonds, one of Europe's leading farm economists argues in a report to be
published this week.
In a stinging assault on the present common agriculture policy, Mr Stefan
Tangermann, at the Institute of Agricultural Economics in Germany's
Gottingen university, praises the MacSharry plan for CAP reform, which aims
to decouple income support for farmers from price support for farm output.
But he complains: 'It is a pity it stops a couple of steps short of reaching
its own targets'.
Mr Tangermann says the present CAP has failed 'in nearly all respects': in
its primary aim of raising farmers' incomes; by plunging governments around
the world into a 'nonsensical' spiral of agricultural protectionism; and by
aggravating environmental problems by encouraging excessive use of chemical
fertilisers and pesticides.
'The aim of CAP reform should not so much be to reduce surplus production
and public spending in EC agriculture, but to make Europe's farming industry
more economically efficient and internationally competitive.'
The critical flaw in the MacSharry plan is its proposal for compensation
payments, Mr Tangermann argues. By basing compensation on each year's farm
output, the plan both locks the EC into constant monitoring of production,
and forces farmers to keep output up to qualify for compensation. It is also
in direct conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay
Round trade reform plans, in which negotiators insist that such an
arrangement would distort trade.
Instead, Mr Tangermann argues that compensation should be based on
historical rather than current production; a limit should be set on the
duration of payments - he suggests 15 years; and the volume of payments
should be predetermined over the whole payment period.
'Improvements of this type would eliminate production incentives, allow the
avoidance of set-aside, make it possible to turn payments into bonds which
can be sold on the capital market, improve chances for structural adjustment
in EC agriculture, enhance farmers' confidence in compensation, greatly
reduce administrative costs, and make CAP reform more consistent with
international efforts to achieve a multilateral liberalisation of
agriculture trade,' he says.
He is also emphatic that policymakers should be clear that they are
compensating farmers rather than farms, and need to resist the politically
expedient temptation to use environmental funds as 'sweeteners' to farmers:
'Such payments are likely to miss both their economic and their ecological
target,' he says.
Reforming the CAP, by Mr Stefan Tangermann, is published on Thursday by the
Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North St., London SW1P 3LA.

Nickel moved ahead on the LME after news that a compromise had been reached
in the German steel industry dispute, prompting some short covering. The
strike that appeared inevitable after Friday's ballot in favour of a
stoppage appears to have been averted. Continued speculation on Russian
smelter closures was also supportive, dealers said. Three-month tin held
just above support at Dollars 5,500 a tonne on persistent short covering.
The closure of the Kuala Lumpur market until Thursday for the lunar New Year
holiday could dampen sentiment, dealers said. London cocoa prices closed
lower, although off the day's lows. Dealers said fund-selling appeared to be
partly responsible for an early tumble, but there were signs of industry
buying around the lows, with support for near May pegged around Pounds 730 a
tonne. 'People are anticipating the Ivory coast will come back into the
market as a seller with the new crop, and the arrivals of the current crop
have remained higher than expected,' said one dealer. 'The charts are
turning bearish again.' In Chicago wheat prices were up at midsession on
fund and commission house buying. Trade talk that India requested 500,000
tonnes of old-crop EEP wheat provided initial support.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Too much
hot air being talked over nitrogen threat - It is clear that most of the
fear of nitrate levels present in public water supplies is based on emotion
rather than science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 1.6m tonnes of nitrate fertiliser is applied to UK farm crops each
year. Research has shown that were this artificial fertiliser not used,
yields of some of those crops would be halved. Such is the influence of
nitrogen on production and therefore on profits and, somewhat predictably,
applications of nitrates to farmland have increased significantly over the
last 50 or so years since economic methods to produce them were perfected.
However it has also been established that between 10 per cent and 60 per
cent of this fertiliser may not be taken up by the crops on which it is
spread, implying a possible wastage and more seriously, leakage, of nitrate
through the soil into water supplies. It is this so-called leaching that
exercises the environmental groups that allege that higher levels of
nitrates in water supplies are leading to dangers to health and degradation
of the environment.
But is the situation as serious as they suggest and is agriculture entirely
to blame? As the subject, Farming, Fertilisers and the Nitrate Problem,
points out there is no conclusive proof for any of the allegations.
Indeed there is an old and well worn correlation the authors say, between
the number of bottles of whisky sold around the turn of the century and the
number of clergymen in England and Wales at the same time. But that does not
prove that the men of the cloth were drunkards. A far more likely
explanation, they suggest, is that the distilleries expanded to serve the
needs of a growing population, as did the church.
In other words the growth in population and industry, with their wastes and
sewage, are partly responsible for the undoubted increase in nitrate content
in our water. And while agriculture must accept its share of the blame it
has by the use of nitrates over a 50 year period increased UK
self-sufficiency for food from 30 per cent to 70 per cent while the
population has itself increased from 35m to 55m.
Some might say that a marginal increase in nitrates in British water
supplies is a small price to pay for such a desirable economic achievement.
Others would argue, of course, that if it meant endangering the lives of
British citizens, including unborn babies, it was too high a price.
But are these real dangers or are they imagined?
It is widely perceived that high nitrates in water cause stomach cancer and
blue babies and there seems little doubt that very high levels, accompanied
by bacteriological contamination, may cause such problems.
As is reported in Farming, Fertilisers and the Nitrate Problem, however, the
last documented death of a blue baby in the UK was in 1950, when microbial
infection, probably resulting from the use of excreta-contaminated well
water, caused the chemical suffocation of a baby. The last blue baby case in
Britain was in 1972 and fortunately that baby survived. There have been no
known cases associated with public water supplies.
The emotive association of water-borne nitrate with cancer is equally
difficult to substantiate. Moreover a well-documented study conducted
between 1969 and 1973, comparing the incidence of stomach cancer in
so-called high risk areas, the public water supply had high nitrate levels,
others where it was low, revealed that there were less stomach cancers in
the high nitrate areas.
It is clear therefore that most of the fear of nitrates levels currently
present in public water supplies is based on emotion rather than science.
Nevertheless, the UK government agreed to a European Community directive
more than a decade ago committing itself to ensuring that all water supplies
in this country would contain less than 50 parts per million of nitrates by
1985, compared with the 100 ppm standard it previously imposed.
It failed to do so and when EC inspectors discovered last year that some UK
water supplies still had higher levels of nitrate (between 50 and 100 ppm -
the World Health Organisation still says that up to 100 ppm is quite safe)
they decide to condemn Britain for failing to comply with the directive,
causing the government embarrassment and Friends of the Earth and other
environment groups much satisfaction.
In an attempt to respond to EC pressure, in 1990 the Ministry of Agriculture
identified some of the areas where nitrate leaching from farmland appeared
to be most significant and designated a series of 10 small 'nitrate
sensitive areas'. These, it said, were to test agronomic systems which might
reduce the leaching. Participation by farmers in limiting fertiliser
applications and modifying techniques is voluntary and compensation for loss
of income averaging about Pounds 75 per hectare per year is paid by the
government.
Meanwhile the EC has moved on. It has now issued a new nitrate directive
that requires all member states to identify, by December 1993, 'vulnerable
zones' - all areas where there is a possibility that farming may contribute
to what it describes as a deterioration of water quality - and to impose
restrictions on farming in those areas over the course of the next six
years.
The areas concerned represent much of the most productive land in the
country. It has in fact been estimated that up to 2m hectares (5m acres) of
UK land might be affected. That equates approximately to 5 counties the size
of Norfolk and the farmers in those areas, most of which would be in East
Anglia, would be required to comply with similar yield-inhibiting
regulations to those in the experimental nitrates sensitive areas.
Up to now there has been no mention of compensation to farmers for loss of
income. Indeed the cost to taxpayers, if it came anywhere near to covering
the loss, would be so massive as to make it prohibitive.
It seems to UK farmers therefore that once again they may be penalised by
the bureaucratic bulldozer that is Brussels for reasons of politics and the
reduction of surpluses rather than because of any real dangers their use of
fertilisers may pose. Statistics prove that for economic and environmental
reasons UK farmers have, in any case, reduced their use of artificial
nitrogen over the last 5 years.
Furthermore they find it somewhat ironic that the same EC that seeks to cut
the leakage of nitrates into water supplies advocates the expansion of
organic farming. For any soil scientist will tell you that organic nitrogen
is the leakiest of all.

support from government

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S FLEDGLING class of private farmers, experimenting with western
style lobbying, yesterday hit out against an unpopular 28 per cent value
added tax and demanded more support from the government.
But a random survey of delegates at a National Farmers Congress in Moscow
suggested that most were optimistic about the future despite the additional
hardship brought on by a first month of market reforms. President Boris
Yeltsin's move to a market economy is partly predicated on the successive
attempts - begun more than a year ago but now being accelerated - to boost
agricultural supply through the growth of private farming. Last month the
government decreed an end to subsidies for loss-making farms in the state
sector.
Cheap credit was high on the list of demands as speaker after speaker
demanded a lowering of interest rates, or special banks to finance farmers.
Mr Viktor Paskinov of the Tambov region even suggested that farmers should
be included in government committees handling foreign credits so that they
would get the bulk of the money.
Mrs Galina Khnichkova, 32, a former hospital worker, acquired 10 hectares of
land with her husband, who learned farming as a boy on a collective farm.
Having acquired equipment relatively cheaply - before the liberalisation of
prices last month - her main complaint was a leap in interest rates to 11
per cent (on a bank loan of Rbs50,000) and local authority slowness in
granting her another 15 ha.
'All young people should have land, work on it, and stop expecting the
government to look after them. If they do, they will look at life
differently,' Mrs Khnichkova said in an interview during a break. Until the
family fur and bee-keeping business gets off the ground, as she expects it
do to in a year or so, she and her husband are living on savings.
Mr Sergei Boyakov, 41, has already achieved success, admitting he now
considers himself 'a rich man'. His cattle farm occupies 238 hectares in the
Penza region and he has just paid Rbs6m for equipment to set up a sausage
making plant to process his own meat direct. His friend, Valery, has a much
smaller farm, producing both meat and dairy products.
Asked how he explained widespread milk shortages in Russia, he said he for
one had no means of transporting milk 238 km (148 miles) to the nearest
town. Nor did he have any incentive to sell milk to a neighbouring
collective farm which had refrigeration facilities because 'they pay me only
half of what they get for milk from the state'. His solution was to turn all
his milk into butter. He also planned to buy up a privatised cafe in town,
where he would sell dumplings made with his own meat.
'The most important thing is that the state should not bother us. All we
need is land and freedom,' he explained.
But six decades after private farmers were wiped out by collectivisation
under Stalin, many speakers, conscious of their new political importance,
demanded direct political power. 'All of you have come here with problems,'
a delegate from the Orel region told the congress, sponsored by Russia's
association of farms and agricultural co-operatives. 'But these problems
will remain as long as we do not seize power for ourselves at local level.'
He echoed complaints by many farmers that the local authorities that
controlled distribution of land and equipment were resisting a switch to
private agriculture.
A farmer from the autonomous republic of Kabardin-Balkaria complained that
the latter's declaration of sovereignty gave it an excuse to shun Russian
legislation on land reform.
Calling for tough action from Moscow to enforce the law everywhere in the
Russian Federation, he promised the government that in 'two or three years
time you won't need to take on debts to import food'.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble as pact
hopes evaporate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES continued to fall in both London and New York yesterday as any
hopes of progress at this week's International Coffee Organisation talks
disappeared.
Last week's news that the Colombians were not sending a delegation to London
from Bogota left New York's arabicas market sharply down on Friday. The
Colombians have been angered by the failure of Brazil, the world's biggest
coffee producer, to come up with a coherent policy on coffee in spite of
months of consultation.
The London May robusta contract closed last night at Dollars 887 a tonne,
down Dollars 23 on the day, while in late trading the New York May arabica
contract was down more than 2 cents at 73.30 cents a lb.
Mr Nestor Osorio, Colombia's ICO representative in London, said yesterday
that his country's commitment and interest in moving towards an
international coffee agreement with economic clauses had not changed. The
only way forward was to agree a method of controlling supplies, he said.
However, there appeared to be no sense of urgency among other producers
after two and a half years of depressed prices since the organisation's
export quota system collapsed.
Tomorrow the ICO working party is due to meet. Its mandate is to explore
ideas for a renewed coffee agreement, and present its findings to the full
ICO council in April.
Consumers are not expecting any progress in this week's talks, and most
analysts agree. But some delegates do not feel this week's meeting is
necessarily the last before April, and that more talks are likely at the end
of March, by which stage, Brazil is likely to have a clearer idea of its own
internal and external policy.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, does not
rule out the possibility of real progress being made this week. He believes
there is a chance the market will be surprised and that progress can be made
towards a revitalised quota scheme, pointing out that Brazil has not said it
is against quotas. He also believes the US to be very much in favour of a
new pact.
Another analyst pointed out baldly: 'If the market at this level can't
persuade them to be just a teeny bit constructive, what will?'

INCO, THE Canadian group, estimates that the Commonwealth of Independent
States (the former Soviet Union) exported about 245m lb of nickel to the
western world last year, up from 175m lb in 1991. However, Mr Michael Sopko,
chairman designate, suggests that Russia's ability to export will be reduced
this year because its nickel output will slip from an estimated 660m lb in
1991, Reuter reports from Toronto.
Mr Sopko says that he expects the western world market balance to remain
more or less unchanged from the 1991 situation, when demand was about 1.52m
lb and supply 1.56m lb. 'We're producing all we can, selling all we can
produce. The only problem is lousy prices.'
He sees no need for more production cuts by Inco but the group is reducing
capital spending by 40 per cent to CDollars 280m (Pounds 135m) this year
from earlier estimates of Dollars 350m and Dollars 440m spent in 1991. Among
other things, Inco intends to defer development of its McCreedy East nickel
mine in Ontario.

speculation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S Commissioner for Inland Revenue yesterday rejected rumours
that foreigners were to be taxed on all interest income, speculation which
last week caused a sharp weakening in the financial rand investment
currency.
The financial rand declined by 4.5 per cent on Thursday, to equal last
July's low of R3.38 to the dollar, as foreign investors withdrew deposits
from South African banks in order to avoid paying tax.
A fall in the financial rand - a pool of investment currency in which only
foreigners can deal - reflects a weakening of foreign investor sentiment.
However, Mr Hannes Hattingh, the Commissioner, said the impression that all
interest accruing to non-residents was now taxable was 'not the position at
all', adding that 'the long-established rules still apply'.
He noted that so far as interest was concerned, the general principle was
that income tax was levied if interest was received by, or accrued to, a
taxpayer from a South African source.
The source principle also applied to non-residents, and meant that the
actual source of interest was determined by the place where the credit was
made available by the creditor to the debtor. Thus interest accruing from a
direct investment in South Africa by a non-resident was subject to tax.
Market traders said the financial rand traded calmly yesterday following the
Inland Revenue's statement of clarification. It was trading at a level of
R3.37 just before yesterday's close.
Mr Hattingh noted that there were two main exceptions to the general
principle.
The first was that interest payable to non-residents on stock or securities
issued by the government, Transnet and any local authority, Eskom or the
South African Broadcasting Association, was exempt from income tax.
The second was that in terms of double taxation agreements with other
countries, South African tax would not exceed an agreed percentage of
interest.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVELOPMENT Bank of South Africa is preparing a debut issue of D-Mark
bonds in the international capital markets.
The Republic of South Africa returned to the international arena to raise
D-Mark funds last September, and followed up with an Ecu250m deal last
month.
However, a Dollars 200m Eurobond for the Independent Development Trust, a
government-funded health, education and housing trust, had to be pulled last
November when the African National Congress refused to back the deal.
The ANC opposes new international borrowings by the present government and
has said it may not honour any new loans.
The Republic of South Africa owns 84 per cent of the Development Bank of
South Africa, with the remaining 16 per cent in the hands of regional
governments in South Africa.
Bayerische Landesbank has won the mandate to arrange the DM100m medium-term
bond issue, but officials there declined to give further details of the
transaction.
Yesterday, supply in the Ecu sector continued as Daiwa Europe brought a
Ecu100m five-year deal for Kommuninvest, a Swedish local authority finance
institution. Though considered fairly priced, the deal was reported to be
faring badly as bankers struggled to find a market for a relatively unknown
name in the international markets.
The deal had strong parallels with last an Ecu issue last autumn for
Municipality Finance, a Finnish institution: both are AA1 rated
institutions, both are financing arms for the local government sector, and
both carried guarantees, in the latest case from the county council of
Orebro and 10 other municipalities.
However, with little advance preparation for the deal, bankers reported that
it was proving difficult to raise interest in the issuer, which had only
borrowed internationally before in Swiss francs. This was despite a yield
pick-up of around 30 basis points over British Gas's five-year Ecu issue,
for an offered yield of 8.779 per cent.

FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Brokers favour use of three
electronic trade systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POWERFUL group of institutional investors and stockbrokers yesterday named
three electronic trade confirmation systems which they want to see
established as standard products for use in the securities industry.
The institutions which had launched the exercise had hoped originally to
select just one, effectively driving out of the market a range of competing
commercial systems.
But the final decision reflected the impracticality of foisting a single
system on to all users, and the need to keep an element of competition.
Electronic confirmation of the details of trades, which would replace the
current system based on telex and facsimile, is seen by the institutions as
a way of speeding up the clearing and settlement of deals. Some users hope
that the trade confirmation infrastructure could later be used to support
electronic dealing, by-passing existing exchanges.
The three systems chosen were Trax (developed by the International
Securities Market Association), Sequal (the London Stock Exchange) and Oasys
(a commercial system developed by Thomson). In addition, the Depositary
Trust Corporation of the US will also be recommended once it's product is
completed.
Mr Chris Smith, manager of the transaction department in the UK of Fidelity,
one of the leading fund managers behind the initiative, said the intention
had been to pick only one supplier but it had proved politically impossible
to do so.
Instead, national markets were likely to develop their own systems, he said,
with international suppliers providing systems which were able to link
internationally active investment firms into them.

FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan's second-rank brokers
feel the squeeze - Securities houses are being hard hit by the ailing Tokyo
stock market, which has entered its third year of weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN travelling on the 'Bullet Train', executives at National Securities, a
medium-sized Japanese brokerage, do not take the first class car any more.
'We're telling everybody to bear through the hard times,' says Mr Kikuo
Noguchi, senior managing director at National, an affiliate of Matsushita
Electric Industrial, the electronics group. Japanese securities houses are
being hard hit by the ailing Tokyo stock market, which has entered its third
year of weakness.
Faltering trading volume has led to sharply lower stockbroking commissions,
hurting the small and medium-sized brokers which are dependent on broking
fees. Mr Robert Zielinski, financial analyst at Jardine Fleming, a Hong
Kong-based brokerage, assesses that losses at some of the medium-sized
brokers could total as much as Y40bn.( Dollars 325m)
Due to the dominance of the Big Four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and
Yamaichi - in corporate business, such as underwriting and stockbroking for
institutional investors, the remaining 260 second and third-tier brokers
have come to rely heavily on brokerage commissions from individual
investors.
According to Mr Zielinski, the daily average volume needs to be between 500m
to 700m shares for second and third-tier brokers to be profitable. The daily
volume for the first half to September last year averaged 326.2m shares, and
prospects for a recovery in the second half remain bleak, with daily
activity falling to a ten-year low at 217.5m shares in January.
The smaller brokers have started to turn to larger houses for support. Last
year, Daiwa Securities sent its executive managing director to Imagawa
Securities in Osaka to revitalise its management. Yamaichi Securities group
took Yamagen Securities, a small Osaka-based broker, under its wing by
increasing its stake to 56 per cent.
'A lot of customers have lost faith in us because of last year's stock
scandals,' says Mr Noguchi. About 80 per cent of National's revenue comes
from its retail business, and it saw income plunge 32.3 per cent and pre-tax
earnings fall into the red in the interim period to September last year.
Mr Noguchi says that National has started a 'Peoples Capital Stock' campaign
in order to revive individuals' interest. He admits that only one client in
a hundred is willing to hear about stock investments, but says they will try
to convince clients that, in the long term, stocks are still attractive
investments.
'It's the smaller brokers' responsibility to try to revive investor
confidence among individuals,' says Mr Noguchi.
The market volatility which has been blamed on futures related trading is
not helping smaller brokers' efforts to to encourage individual investors to
return to the market. 'Our salesmen claim that they cannot recommend stocks
to clients when prices are being manipulated by dealers,' says Mr Noguchi.
The medium-sized brokers are seeing profits squeezed because they are unable
to reduce heavy costs. During the stock market boom of the late 1980s,
medium-sized houses invested heavily in computer networks and increased
overheads to maintain competitiveness.
Since costs on capital investments are fixed, and staff cuts are not normal
practice in Japan, the brokers have resorted to cutting expenses such as
advertising and entertainment. At National, entertainment costs have been
reduced by 25 per cent, while all advertising has been cancelled.
Personnel moves and branch closures have also been another cost-reduction
measure. Last year, a total of seven branches at five medium-sized
brokerages were closed.
'We're trying to weather the storm as quietly as possible,' says Mr Hiroshi
Endo, senior managing director at Mito Securities, another medium-sized
brokerage listed on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Mr Endo
says although closure of branches were currently being discussed, decisions
have yet to be made.
Mito, however, says it has an edge on other brokers due to its strong ties
with its clientele in the area to the north of Tokyo. 'In the late 1980s,
the larger brokers tried to break into our turf, but the market slump has
put a stop to their expansion,' says Mr Endo. Mr Endo says that Mito will
concentrate on rebuilding ties with customers in the region.
Meanwhile, financial deregulation, under which barriers between banking,
securities, and insurance industries are expected to be eased next year,
poses a serious threat to the survival of some of the second and third-tier
brokers.
The Ministry of Finance also wants to liberalise fixed-rate commissions on
stockbroking. The lack of price competition among securities houses due to
the current fixed-rate commission system has been blamed as the leading
cause for brokers compensating favoured clients for their losses on equity
holdings.
The securities industry's bitter protest has managed to delay implementation
of the ministry's plan to deregulate broking fees. However, the present
market slump and expectations of increased competition are adding pressure
on the securities industry, especially medium-sized houses, to rationalise.
Mito recently announced that it would absorb Kojima Securities, a small
brokerage based in Yokohama, south of Tokyo. Mr Endo says that since Mito
and Kojima have maintained close ties, it only made sense that Kojima, with
only one branch, should merge with Mito.
Mr Noguchi, at National, says that meetings with other brokerage officials
lack the previous hostile atmosphere.
'I guess you try to be nicer to others in the industry if there is a
possibility that you might be working with them in the near future,' he
adds.
