FT  29 JAN 92 / Italian politicians scent wind of change: The referendum is
emerging as the country's best reform tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACKED into 230 boxes, papers containing 1.37m signatures calling for
referendums on electoral reform of the senate and Italy's municipalities
have just been despatched to the supreme court.
The signatures will now go through a lengthy process of scrutiny before
being passed to the constitutional court which will pronounce on the
legitimacy of the referendums demanded.
'This is a crucial stage because the constitutional court could well decide
to reject them,' says Mr Mario Segni, a Christian Democrat member of
parliament who is one of the leading sponsors of these referendums. The
Italian constitution only permits the principle of an abrogative referendum.
He knows this from bitter experience. In January last year the court
rejected referendums on electoral reform of the senate and the
municipalities similar to what is now being proposed, on the grounds that
they were propositive. Only one was admitted, abolishing the
multi-preference system of voting for the chamber of deputies, because it
was abrogative.
This latter referendum was held in June and despite the hostility of the
main political parties, which regarded it as a deliberate attempt to limit
their traditional hold over the choice of candidates, 27m Italians gave an
overwhelming endorsement.
'This vote changed the face of Italian politics. It was an enormous
demonstration that the Italian electorate wants to change the present
political structure,' says Mr Segni.
He is not alone in such a view. A sizeable proportion of politicians across
the party spectrum sensed the wind of change and put their individual names
behind Mr Segni's new referendum campaign, which began in October and whose
first stage has just concluded with the collection of signatures.
Indeed, the referendum has come to be seen as the most effective tool of
trying to force change on the ossified Italian political system.
No fewer than nine different referendums are being canvassed by a varied
assortment of politicians and pressure groups. Starting with the 1974
referendum on divorce, this device has been traditionally exploited on very
specific issues such as abortion, hunting and shooting, nuclear power (a
1987 referendum discarded nuclear power as an energy source). Never before
has there been such a quantity of referendums promoted simultaneously with
such overtly political aims.
The three canvassed by Mr Segni and his supporters are the broadest in
scope. Two concern reform of the senate, discarding the existing system of
proportional representation and introducing a hybrid - 268 of the 315 seats
would be elected by a British-style first-past-the-post rule, while the
remaining 77 would be elected on a proportional basis. The third Segni
referendum proposes that in municipal elections the list with the most votes
obtains three-quarters of the seats, and mayors should be directly elected.
If approved, electoral reform of the senate would tend to break up the
existing multi-party structure and force the formation of larger political
groupings. It would also oblige the parties to field competent candidates
who could attract votes. In the case of local elections it would create
greater local autonomy and accountability. Significantly, these reforms have
been backed by Confindustria, the industrialists' association, and the
church.
Another three referendums, proposed by a committee headed by Prof Massimo
Giannini, an expert on administrative law and a former minister, are
narrower in scope. But in all three cases the effect would be to limit the
dead hand of government favours and interference.
One calls for abrogation of part of the law permitting government aid to the
south so as to ensure future assistance only goes to productive investments;
a second seeks to abolish the Ministry of State Shareholdings (currently
controlled directly by Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, but liable
to disappear as privatisation gathers pace), and the third wants to end the
government's right to name the boards of savings banks by transfering the
responsibility to their own boards.
The Radical party is sponsoring two more referendums. One is intended to
abolish the 1974 law concerning the public financing of political parties.(
This law, incidentally, was subjected to a referendum in 1978 and won 57 per
cent of the vote, but has never been respected). The Radicals in alliance
with green groups are also seeking to legalise the personal use of drugs via
referendum. The ninth referendum, promoted by environmentalist groups, aims
to remove environmental controls from the ambit of the health service. Mr
Segni says that with the exception of the legalisation of drug use, where
there is a lot of resistance within the country, all the others stand a good
chance of being approved.
In order to prosper, a referendum proposal has to obtain more than 500,000
signatures within three months. 'We have had a tremendous response up and
down the country,' he says. The campaigns have relied on mainly stands set
up in big city thoroughfares manned by volunteers, with financing coming
from private contributions to local committees. Only Mr Segni's Rome office
has had a temporary staff of 15 with a L50m (Dollars 41,900) budget.
Critics of the campaign argue it risks producing limited reform of bits of
the political system which will make it more complex to operate. However,
the referendum proposals will almost certainly push the issue of political
reform to the forefront of the debate in the general elections, due in
April. They may also force the next parliament to pass legislation which
heads off the referendums.

FT  29 JAN 92 / Another eastern state to get western premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEST German candidate, Mr Bernhard Vogel, former prime minister of
Rhineland Palatinate and close confidant of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, seems
certain to become the third western premier to run a former east German
state in the federal republic.
The move by the dominant Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the state of
Thuringia amounts to a calculated risk by the Chancellor to bring his
eastern house in order.
The danger is that it will further infuriate east German opinion, which is
already bitter about the behaviour of westerners in enforcing the free
market economy on their collapsed socialist system.
The benefit is that it could provide new leadership to an eastern CDU which
has so far failed to produce outstanding personalities, and is torn between
politicians tainted by co-operation with the former Communist authorities,
and angry young reformers without experience of office.
Mr Vogel, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute, a CDU think tank in Bonn,
has been proposed by Thuringian Christian Democrats to their Free Democrat
partners in government after the resignation last week of Mr Josef Duchac.
Mr Duchac had been under pressure after revelations that he had once
performed as a clown to entertain the officers of the former East German
Stasi security police.
Reports from Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, yesterday showed conflicting
reactions. Some said Chancellor Kohl was showing typical 'Wessi' arrogance
towards the east, foisting his own candidate on the local party. Others
admitted that easterners did not trust anyone from their own land.
One western import, Mr Kurt Biedenkopf in neighbouring Saxony, has had
considerable success in galvanising his state government and attracting
investment. Mr Werner Munch in Saxony Anhalt has been more lacklustre.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Haiti's junta tries to block Aristide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAITI'S military rulers are intensifying their efforts to frustrate the
return to the country of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president who was
overthrown and sent into exile last September. They have also prevailed on
legislators to delay indefinitely negotiations with the Organisation of
American States for Mr Aristide's return.
The military is attempting to prolong the interim government which it set up
after the coup, and wants to organise elections.
In another development, soldiers and policemen attacked the office of Mr
Rene Theodore, the prime minister-designate, at the weekend, killing one of
his bodyguards.
The attack, the second on Mr Theodore's offices this month, has raised
concerns in the Caribbean state over his safety, while Haitian legislators
consider whether to ratify his appointment. Ratification would clear the way
for the return of Mr Aristide. The OAS and Mr Aristide have agreed on Mr
Theodore as the interim prime minister, but the army has been forcing
parliamentarians to delay a decision on his ratification.
The senate has imposed a 10-day moratorium on negotiations with the OAS,
apparently to appease the military. Following the attack, Mr Theodore said
the country was being held hostage by thugs.
'Two things must be clarified now, at this moment of deepening crisis,' he
said after the attack. 'We need to know whether the commander-in-chief
cannot control his troops, and whether parliament will or will not prolong
the mandate of the interim government.' The country's military rulers appear
emboldened by the limited effect of a trade embargo imposed by the OAS, the
European Community and several countries. A shortage of fuel has been
relieved by three shipments since the embargo was imposed.
Mr Joao Baena Soares, secretary general of the OAS, said last week: 'We must
come to the conclusion that it is not possible to implement the embargo.'
The political stalemate in the country of 7m has led to a resurgence of
refugees seeking asylum in the US.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gavin McCrone, one of Scotland's top civil servants, is joining GLASGOW
UNIVERSITY's social and economic research department where he is already a
visiting professor.
McCrone, a Cambridge-educated economist, was unusual in entering the
Scottish Office in 1970 from academic life, first as special adviser to the
then Labour Scottish Secretary.
Since 1972 he has been chief economic adviser, as well as holding,
concurrently, a number of senior administrative posts - including head of
the industry department from 1980-1987.
McCrone, 59, possesses an exceptionally lucid delivery and is one of the
most open figures at the Scottish Office. In 1986 he assisted Malcolm
Rifkind as Scottish Secretary when the latter gave Ernest Saunders a
ferocious wigging over Guinness's broken promises to Scotland.
In 1987 he was made head of the environment department, removing him from
day-to-day events in industry and thus diminishing his role as chief
economic adviser.
Harold Mills, 53, currently the Scottish Office's principal financial
officer, replaces McCrone as secretary of the environment department but no
appointment has been made to the post of chief economic adviser.

FT  28 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: New account opens on buoyant note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first day of the new two-week trading account saw share prices race
higher in response to opinion polls in the weekend press indicating a
Conservative party lead, and hints of increased scope for another cut in UK
interest rates in the near term.
Better than expected UK trade figures, and a pledge by finance ministers and
central bank governors of the Group of Seven countries to promote global
economic growth, added to the general bullishness surrounding equities.
The FT-SE 100 share index closed 29.5 higher at 2,539.9. This was well below
the day's best level, 2,547.6, a rise of 37.2, reached just after a
moderately positive start to the Wall Street session.
Opening 18.3 points ahead, the Footsie never looked back. Dealers, said to
be running extremely tight trading books, and worried late last week about
the weekend's spate of opinion polls, marked prices sharply higher in an
attempt to head off any big buying interest. A strong opening by the Footsie
future also drove the market higher.
Marketmakers, who adopted a cautious view on the market late last week, were
said to be concerned about the prospect of dividend cuts from some of the UK
market's big names in the next few weeks, after last week's dividend
reduction by Lonrho.
An illustration of the market's concern about possible dividend cuts came
late in the session when Rank Organisation shares tumbled amid suggestions
that the group may reduce the payment when it reveals preliminary figures on
Thursday. There was also the suggestion that Rank could take the opportunity
to launch a cash raising exercise via a rights issue. A more straightforward
explanation for the steep decline in the Rank shares, according to one
specialist, was that one broker had attempted to place a line of some
200,000 shares.
The Rank story prompted a note of caution in an otherwise buoyant trading
day. It was also pointed out that last week saw a growing number of cash
calls in the market.
A steady flow of generally small buying orders kept prices high throughout
the day. Turnovers, however, remained pitifully thin. Yesterday saw only
448.1m shares traded, well down on last week's numbers which saw the level
of business top 600m on two occasions.
The better than expected December trade figures helped sentiment and kept
sterling on an even keel against the D-Mark. Against the dollar, however, it
was a different story. Sterling was sharply lower against the US currency
and American buying was said to have been a substantial factor in the
strength of the pharmaceuticals sub-sector.
Politically sensitive areas of the market responded readily to the opinion
poll readings. Water stocks, the Labour party's main target for
renationalisation, surged higher, as did the regional electricity shares.
There were worries among some commentators about the pace of the market's
reaction to what is seen as a glimmer of hope on another cut in domestic
interest rates. Mr Ian Harnett at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, the
French-owned investment bank, described the market's response as 'an
excessive reaction to some small pieces of good news', but expected the
Footsie to test the 2,550 level in the short term.

FT  28 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Pre-finals raid hits Rank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT anxiety over Rank Organisation erupted after rumours swept the market
that the company would announce a rights issue with its results on Thursday.
The speculation triggered a heavy fall during late trading and the shares
dropped to 598p at one stage before rallying to close a net 16 off at 607p.
Turnover reached an above-average 782,000 shares.
An analyst said the heavy debt that Rank carries led dealers to suggest a
Pounds 500m one-for-three cash call. However, he added that 'it is an easy
one for bear raids', and most observers tended towards that view.
There was also concern that the dividend might not be maintained. Mr Hamish
Dickson at Hoare Govett put the fall down to market jitters prior to the
results. 'We think the dividend is safe, although we remain negative on the
stock,' he said.
Ms Jane Anscombe, at BZW, is a buyer of Rank and cites key fundamentals
which have yet to make themselves felt on the balance sheet, such as the
Mecca purchase.
Utilities wanted
Waters surged forward on the back of opinion polls favourable towards the
Conservatives. Some brokers also recommended the stocks following the
sector's recent poor showing, which put it at its lowest rating since the
flotation.
Panmure Gordon has changed its stance on the sector from 'neutral' to
'overweight'. Analyst Mr Alex Buck said: 'Water shares are good value at the
moment. Although they continue to be governed by political factors, we are
recommending them whichever party wins the election.' He is particularly
keen on Wessex Water, 9 ahead at 381p, and Thames Water, up 13 at 359p.
Fisons strong
An early gain in Fisons was clipped back as speculation faded that Medeva
might bid for the group. However, Fisons shares turned sharply higher in the
afternoon to close 14 1/2 up at 349p.
The stock was supported in early trading by a report in a Sunday newspaper
that Medeva had lined up Fisons for a Pounds 2.5bn takeover bid. Medeva
denied the talk and ended the day 7 better at 255p.
The pharmaceuticals sector was strong amid a feeling that many of the stocks
have been oversold recently. Glaxo rose 17 to 859p and SmithKline Beecham
picked up 20 to 908p.
Wellcome was helped by a statement that it had reached agreement to sell its
environmental health business to Roussel Uclaf, of France, for Pounds 43m.
The price was less than some analysts had hoped for but the shares, which
were firm earlier, advanced on the statement to finish 22 up at 1094p.
An emergency statement was put out yesterday by Racal Electronics after
press reports suggested that the company was facing problems reaching the
profits forecasts it made during its recent successful defence against
Hillsdown Holdings. The shares tumbled in heavy trading of 20m, but rallied
after the company announced that its profits 'will not be less than Pounds
50m'. They finished a penny off at 48 1/2 p.
One leading electronics specialist supported the company view. 'This will
blow over quite quickly. I see no reason why Racal will not make those kind
of profits,' he said.
Body Shop forged ahead 39 to 362p on good turnover of 1.2m, receiving a
boost from a positive article in Barron's, the US business weekly. It also
gained from a general rebound in the sector and a feeling that Body Shop was
oversold after recent profits downgrades by various brokers.
Clinton Cards jumped 14 to 79p on press speculation that WH Smith was about
to launch a bid in spite of a denial by the latter yesterday.
Clinton said earlier it had not received an approach and was not aware of
any impending offer. WH Smith shares ended 3 higher at 461p.
A downgrade on P &amp; O left the shipping group's shares 7 lower at 440p.
Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, cut its
1992 profits forecast by Pounds 37m to Pounds 248m ,taking a more cautious
overview of the shipping sector.
Charterhouse recommended that their clients switch from P &amp; O to Eurotunnel,
which gained 25 to 457p.
Profit-taking and the recent 'topslice' recommendation issued by Kleinwort
Benson pushed British Airways down 6 to 244p.
Television issues were in good form, gaining support from a hefty note on
the sector by SG Warburg Securities. Scottish Television, which the house
has as a soft buy, strengthened 13 to 728p.
Pre-press and printing group Wace fell sharply on market speculation
following weekend press reports on IRA links with the stock market. The
company took the unusual step of issuing a denial yesterday. The statement
helped the shares to rally and they ended a net 11 down at 166p, after being
22 off earlier.
Argos firmed 3 to 271p, but on a day when the stores sector was strong the
shares underperformed the market in keen trading. The retail team at BZW has
changed its recommendation on the stock from hold to sell, pointing out that
Argos shares now stand at a 50 per cent prospective premium to the market.
According to BZW the share price has underperformed the market by 9 per cent
since the middle of last year and this trend will continue, as Argos loses
its competitive edge.
Among life assurance companies, Legal &amp; General touched 380p and finished 7
ahead at 375p. It announced that, in order to reduce the effect of volatile
general insurance business on mainstream life and pensions profits, the
company had reinsured 40 per cent of its household property structure and
contents accounts.
L &amp; G lost Pounds 38.3m at the half-year stage on Pounds 121.4m premium
income on its UK property account, according to a spokesman. He dismissed
speculation that the insurer had resorted to a reinsurance programme to
avoid breaching capital ratio requirements.
Textiles were ignored by a strong market as UK investment bank SG Warburg
stepped back from its bullish stance. Mr Lawrence Rubin, Warburg's textile
analyst, turned short-term bear on the whole sector, arguing that: 'There
will be a lull in the sector's outperformance until later in 1992.'
Lonrho was unable to rebound significantly from the 30 per cent fall in its
shares sustained last Friday after reporting a lowered dividend and sharply
reduced profits. The shares also went ex a 5p final dividend yesterday and
closed 2 better at 117p.
Johnson Matthey had lost ground in the wake of Lonrho's results but bounced
back yesterday as investors refocused on the prospects for its contribution
to the catalytic converter market. The shares rose 20 to 355p.
ICI, which often tends to reflect the perceptions about the UK economy,
jumped 24 to 1269p.
Airtours rose 11 to 244p after the scrip issue. Hoare Govett, the
stockbroker, raised its profits forecast for Airtours following the news
from the company last week that bookings were up by 95 per cent. Hoare is
looking for Pounds 38m, up Pounds 1 1/2 m, for this year, and an extra
Pounds 1m in 1993 at Pounds 43m.
Granada Group rose on weekend reports that BSkyB would move into profit by
March. The shares gained 7 to 225p.
BT fully-paid added 6 at 324 1/2 p ahead of Thursday's finals and expected
Oftel document. Analyst Mr Marshall Whiting at stockbroker Gilbert Eliot is
positive on the stock, believing the cash flow to remain strong and the
regulatory outlook as fair, with a service sector downturn the main cloud on
the horizon.
Lucas was strong on the back of a recommendation from Strauss Turnbull. It
is aggressively bullish on the prospects for the year ending July 1993, and
believes the company will make around Pounds 100m, compared with the
market's present average forecast of Pounds 70m. Lucas moved ahead 6 to
120p.

FT  28 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OVERHEATED premium in stock market futures held back turnover yesterday
as investors waited for the underlying equity market to catch up, writes
Peter John.
The FT-SE contract for March delivery opened at 2,575, 45 points above cash,
and ticked up a further five-point gain in response to the general economic
optimism.
Although it ran out of steam at 2,580, the enthusiasm emanating from a
weekend MORI poll and the present G7 summit deterred any unwinding of long
positions.
On the other hand, the high premium of March, against its new estimated fair
value premium of 16, ensured that it was far too expensive to buy.
Active morning trading drifted into desultory two-way business, which
resulted in a small slide and low closing turnover of some 5,000 lots before
after-hours' dealing. By the official close, March had recovered to end the
day at 2,580, a premium of 39.
In the LTOM, volume was just over 24,000 contracts. The busiest stock option
was BT, with 1,520 lots traded. Most of the turnover was represented by a
bearish hedging trade as one UK investment bank bought 1,300 of the May 300
puts at 6. Lonrho was also active with 1,475 lots dealt.

FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued ahead of State of
Union address

Wall Street
SHARE prices were becalmed in light trading yesterday, as investors remained
on the sidelines ahead of today's important State of the Union address to
Congress by President George Bush, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.83 at 3,240.61,
having spent the day only a few points above Friday's finish. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.50 down at 414.98, while the
Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks lost 3.68 to 621.00.
Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 191m shares, while rises outscored
falls by a narrow margin.
After last week's declines, the market opened in a subdued mood yesterday.
All eyes were fixed on the US president's State of the Union speech,
scheduled for 8pm New York time this evening.
Mr Bush is expected to unveil a package of tax cuts aimed at stimulating the
sluggish economy. Although tax cuts should be generally positive for the
stock markets, there is concern that any measures would lead to a widening
in the budget deficit, which could prompt a sharp rise in bond yields.
Diversified securities house Merrill Lynch shed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61
1/8 in spite of record full-year earnings of Dollars 696m, achieved with the
help of a Dollars 171m fourth-quarter profit.
The record figures had been expected in the wake of buoyant securities
markets in the final quarter, and the decline in the price yester-day was
put down to profit-taking following the stock's strong performance over the
past 52 weeks.
LA Gear slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 1/2 after the company formally
announced the retirement of Mr Robert Greenberg, its founder, from the posts
of chairman and chief executive. The sports-shoe maker will unveil a new
marketing campaign this week. Of its rivals, Nike eased Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 72 1/2 and Reebok International relinquished Dollars  5/8 to Dollars
30 1/2 .
Chrysler enjoyed a rare gain, advancing Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 15 on the
back of a reported upgrading from Shearson Lehman, the broking house. The
remaining members of the Big Three car manufacturers also firmed, with
General Motors adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 34 1/8 and Ford rising
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 .
On the over-the-counter market, Hutchinson Technology climbed Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 24 3/4 after reporting net income of 54 cents a share for the
first fiscal quarter, well up on the 35 cents a share earned at the same
stage a year ago.
Going the other way on the earnings front was Arkansas Freightways, which
tumbled Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 32 1/2 on news of a fourth-quarter profit
of 20 cents a share, down from the 33 cents earned a year earlier.
Canada
TORONTO stocks, after a firm opening, fell back to close with an easier bias
on balance after moderate trading. A weak Canadian dollar, however, helped
some resource-based issues to improve.
The composite index was finally 2.2 off at 3,628.5, while declining issues
outnumbered advances by 308 to 267. Volume decreased to 23.3m shares from
Friday's 28m. The index was ahead almost 15 points in the first half-hour of
trading, but quickly settled back and then traded in a narrow range for the
rest of the day.
Du Pont Canada 'A' dipped CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 41 1/4 . The company
reported fourth-quarter earnings of CDollars 14.3m, or 46 cents a share, up
from CDollars 10.3m, or 33 cents, a year earlier.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar gains as G7 disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR strengthened on currency markets yesterday following the weekend
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven
industrial countries, writes Simon London.
The communique released after the G7 meeting said that the participants had
reviewed recent developments in the foreign exchange markets and reaffirmed
their desire for stable rates. However, this was not related to specific
rates or broader policy goals.
The US unit rallied as soon as the statement was released, gaining ground in
Tokyo and maintaining the firm tone through European trading.
From a New York finish of Y123.55 and DM1.5920 on Friday, the dollar rose to
stand at Y124.57 and DM1.6040 by the Tokyo close. All through Asian trading,
dealers pushed the dollar higher, although fears of central bank
intervention held the dollar below Y125 and DM1.6150.
Many analysts had been watching for more specific foreign exchange goals,
such as a stronger yen to contain the Japanese trade surplus.
The tone of the statement was underlined by comments from Mr Yasushi Meino,
Bank of Japan governor. He said that the G7 meeting had not discussed
specific exchange rates.
In afternoon trading in London, the dollar pushed through resistance levels
seen in Tokyo to peak at DM1.6180 and Y125.40. The US currency closed in
London at DM1.6165, from DM1.5875 on Friday; and Y125.40 from Y123.30. The
dollar was also strong against sterling, ending at Dollars 1.7765, from
Dollars 1.8055 on Friday. In New York the US unit ended at DM1.6105, Y125.25
and Dollars 1.7820.
Many economists are expecting the US unit to push ahead this week, testing
resistance at DM1.6350, its peak during the last rally earlier this month,
and Y127, the level at which the US and Japanese authorities intervened on
January 17.
Elsewhere, the D-Mark weakened as dealers focused on potential industrial
disputes in Germany. The German currency fell to Y77.60, having traded over
Y78.00.
The weakness of the D-Mark against the Spanish peseta, which appreciated to
Pta63.00 from the Pta63.20 level seen last week, raised sterling's floor
within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The pound's floor, determined by its maximum permitted divergence from the
strongest currency in the system, was yesterday around DM2.8665.
However, sterling was buoyant following the publication of opinion polls at
the weekend giving the UK Conservative government a narrow lead.
Current account figures for December also supported the UK currency. The
data showed the current account deficit narrowed to Pounds 338m in December,
from Pounds 630m in November. The deficit for the whole of last year was
Pounds 5.78bn, against an official forecast of Pounds 6.5bn.
Sterling traded above DM2.87 for most of the day, finishing at DM2.8725 in
London, from DM2.8650 on Friday.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money market rates were steady yesterday, with sterling's stability on
the foreign exchange markets continuing to dampen speculation about the need
for higher interest rates, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the
session, revised up to Pounds 1.1bn. The main factor was maturing repurchase
agreements, draining Pounds 674m from the market. Exchequer transactions,
the main component of which is taxation payments, added a net Pounds 265m
funds to the market.
In spite of the substantial shortage, there was no clamour for funds and the
Bank of England refrained from early assistance. Later in the morning,
Pounds 265m was injected, through the outright purchase of band 1 bills at
10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 177m paper purchased for resale to the market on
February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent.
Afternoon assistance totalled Pounds 207m, again through the purchase of
band 1 and band 2 bills, all at 10 3/8 per cent, continuing the recent trend
for relieving liquidity shortages with the very shortest maturity paper.
A late liquidity injection of Pounds 400m brought the total assistance for
the day to Pounds 872m, around Pounds 228m less than the forecast drain of
funds.
The unsecured overnight money rate rose from a shade over 11 per cent to 13
per cent by early afternoon. However, the late injection of funds removed
any pressure for higher short rates and overnight money was trading at 11
1/4 -11 per cent by the close.
Three months inter-bank funds traded at 10- 9/16 per cent; one month
inter-bank money was at 10 13/16 - 9/16 per cent, from 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent
on Friday.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange was slightly stronger, closing at 89.74, from 89.69 on
Friday.
In Frankfurt, call money rates were marginally higher at 9.50/60 per cent
from 9.45/55 per cent at the end of last week and the 9.40/50 per cent level
which prevailed for several days.
Pension payments are expected to drain funds from the market this week and
the call money rate is expected to stay at between 9.55 and 9.65 per cent.
However, so far market conditions appear to be comfortable, following the
Bundesbank's decision to raise rates on December 19.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Bonds: National Bank of Hungary launches
DM600m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Bank of Hungary, the Hungarian government's borrowing conduit,
yesterday launched its largest bond offering to date in the international
capital markets, a DM600m issue of seven-year bonds.
The perception of Hungary's credit in the international capital markets has
improved steadily in the past year, allowing the bank, once confined to the
Japanese and German markets, to raise funds in a range of sectors.
However, the latest offering of 10 1/4 per cent seven-year bonds looked too
aggressively priced, compared with a DM500m transaction launched last
October which carries a coupon of 10 3/4 per cent and matures in 1998. 'The
coupon level is of prime importance to retail investors. There is no reason
for them to buy these bonds, if they have 10 3/4 per cent bonds,' one trader
said.
The National Bank plans a number of transactions in the international
capital markets this year. Its borrowing programme consists entirely of
refinancing, totalling Dollars 2.4bn. However, about half will be met by
funds from agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank, leaving around Dollars 1.2bn of funding to be completed in the
international capital markets.
Interest servicing needs will be covered from Hungary's current account,
which is running a trade surplus, according to Mr Bela Sandor, general
manager in the international division of the National Bank.
'Fresh money will come from direct capital investment throughout the
commercial banking sector,' Mr Sandor said.
Hungary has also raised Y30bn through an issue of 7 per cent 10-year bonds
in the Samurai market - the Japanese domestic market for foreign borrowers.
Hungary's next international offering is likely to be denominated in Ecu or
dollars. The government is keen to establish benchmark issues in these
sectors, by issuing deals of a reasonably large size - a minimum of Dollars
200m or Ecu200m. However, following the latest financings, Hungary has
covered its current funding needs until June and will be able to service its
debt without reducing its foreign exchange reserves.
In the dollar sector, Chugoku Electric Power, the Japanese electricity
utility, launched a Dollars 250m five-year bond via Goldman Sachs. The bonds
were considered fairly priced, offering a yield spread of 54 basis points
above the comparable US Treasury bond.
The dollar sector remains overburdened with paper, and is not being helped
by a rather uncertain tone in the underlying US Treasury market. However,
the familiar name, coupled with a 7 per cent coupon, attracted firm demand
from Japanese investors, according to the lead manager.
In the equity-linked market, Hanwa Company launched a Dollars 360m offering
of bonds with warrants via Yamaichi. The deal was bid at less 1/2 point,
comfortably within 2 1/2 point fees.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries quiet ahead of State of the
Union address
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RELUCTANCE to trade heavily before this evening's State of the Union
address by President George Bush left Treasury prices little changed in
light trading yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  3/32 at
103 7/32 , yielding 7.716 per cent. The two-year note, however, was down
1/16 at 99 13/32 , to carry a yield of 5.175 per cent.
Although most of the details of Mr Bush's annual address have been reported
in the press, the bond market remains concerned about the extent of any tax
cuts announced by the President. In particular, the investors and dealers
are worried that heavy tax cuts could overheat the economy and revive
inflationary pressures, and they are worried that national deficit could
widen as a result of over-generous fiscal fine-tuning.
Market participants also had an eye yesterday on the latest Conference Board
consumer confidence index, which will be published this morning, and more
important economic statistics, including the January employment report which
will be unveiled at the end of next week. The Conference Board is expected
to report a modest decline in consumer confidence, while the unemployment
rate is forecast to rise slightly in January from 7.0 per cent in December
to 7.1 per cent.
SHORT-DATED UK government bonds firmed slightly on hopes of a cut in
interest rates, but long-dated issues ended the day slightly lower ahead of
Wednesday's gilt auction.
Traders said sterling's strength raised hopes of a half-point cut in the
base rate, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rising from its opening of 100
27/32 to 100 31/32 by late afternoon.
The weekend's opinion polls - which showed the ruling Conservative party up
to 3 points ahead of the Labour party, helped to lift long-dated gilt prices
early in the day. However, longer-dated issues drifted back later, and the
benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening of 115
19/32 to 115 15/32 to yield 9.45 per cent.
Volumes in the futures market were low at 7,000 contracts, and the Liffe
gilt futures contract fell from 97.11 to 97.07 by late afternoon.
Traders reported some buying of the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due
2001 which the Bank of England announced for sale on Friday. The Bank is to
sell two tranches of Pounds 150m each - the 2 1/2 per cent due 2001 and the
2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilt due 2009.
GERMAN government bonds slipped on low volumes during the day, with traders
indicating little reaction to the Group of Seven nations' weekend meeting.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 88.32, traded down to a low
of 88.11 and ended the day at 88.13 on a volume of about 28,000 contracts.
JAPANESE government bonds barely changed on the day after the weekend G7
meeting in New York produced no firm statement in support of a strong yen.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 closed at 5.235 per cent, having traded in
a narrow range of 5.225 per cent to 5.245 per cent on low volumes.
Bankers and ministers at the meeting agreed to increase co-operation to
strengthen global economic growth and to continue monitoring and
co-operating in the foreign exchange markets.
Traders said many bond market participants were waiting on the sidelines
ahead of tomorrow's expected auction of 10-year government bonds. The
Finance Ministry is expected to auction about Y800bn of the No 145 issue,
which has a coupon of 5.5 per cent.

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM Australia, an offshoot of US computer group International Business
Machines, has plunged into the red for the first time in its 60 years of
operation in Australia.
The company reported it had turned a ADollars 241m (USDollars 185.3m) profit
into a ADollars 389m loss in 1991 on a near-ADollars 600m slide in revenue
to ADollars 1.34m from ADollars 1.93m.
The result forms part of a USDollars 2.8m loss reported earlier by the US
group.
Despite its own difficulties, the parent has injected ADollars 200m into the
Australian offshoot, the first such support package since the early 1980s.
Mr Brian Finn, IBM Australia managing director, said the injection was
needed because the Australian company was not generating enough cash and
because it needed to maintain balance sheet ratios to hold its debt rating.
The loss reduced shareholders' funds at December 31 to Dollars 269m from
ADollars 386m and total assets to ADollars 1.79bn from ADollars 2.05bn.
Mr Finn said that widely-defined capital spending, which rose to ADollars
401m from ADollars 362m, would probably increase again in 1992.
He confirmed that IBM Australia expected to complete a 25 per cent staff
reduction which would see 1,200 employees leave by the end of February,
mainly through voluntary redundancies.
This was expected to cut about ADollars 75 m from costs in a full year.

THE trend in sharply lower 1991 earnings from US oil companies continued
yesterday as Arco and Unocal, both Los Angeles-based energy groups, reported
seriously reduced profits.
Arco's full-year net profit slumped by 64.7 per cent to Dollars 709m. The
company said this occurred after taking Dollars 295m in net charges related
to personnel reductions and property sales.
Arco's fourth-quarter earnings fell by 52.7 per cent to Dollars 268m.
Fourth-quarter revenues were 16 per cent lower at Dollars 4.8bn, while
full-year revenues were 3.5 per cent down at Dollars 18.2bn. The share price
closed unchanged at Dollars 108.
Unocal, meanwhile, said 1991 net earnings dropped by 81.8 per cent to
Dollars 73m. Revenues for the year fell to Dollars 19.9bn from Dollars
11.8bn in 1990.
The company suffered a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 16m, compared with a
Dollars 38m net profit in the last quarter of 1990. Revenue in the quarter
declined by 18 per cent to Dollars 2.77bn. Unocal's share price fell Dollars
 3/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 .

EARNINGS from the recently-released film Beauty and the Beast and other
animated film and television products helped The Walt Disney Company to a 22
per cent rise in net income of Dollars 208.1m in the first quarter to
end-December.
The profits, on revenues 30 per cent up at Dollars 1.94bn, mark a recovery
for Disney, which ended its financial year to September 30 with a 23 per
cent slump in net income to Dollars 636.6m.
One of the problems facing Disney - flat attendance at its US theme parks -
continued in the first three months of the new financial year.
Operating income in the theme parks and resorts division dropped 18 per cent
to Dollars 113m, on revenues that were 6 per cent higher at Dollars 662.4m.
Increased costs associated with the 20th anniversary celebration of Walt
Disney World also contributed to lower operating results.
The filmed entertainment division managed a 49 per cent rise in revenues to
Dollars 965.8m in the quarter, with an 81 per cent jump in operating income
to Dollars 166.8m. These results reflected the success of Beauty and the
Beast in the US as well as the worldwide home video release of Fantasia.
The company's consumer merchandise division recorded 15 per cent higher
operating income of Dollars 88.7m on revenues that up 39 per cent at Dollars
308.4m.
Disney declared a 20 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend to 21 cents
per share. But Wall Street marked the company's shares Dollars 5/8 lower at
Dollars 132 1/2 .

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp unveils new guidelines
on lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the largest US bank which is struggling to cut costs and contain
loan losses, has introduced a new set of US corporate lending guidelines
that aims to improve loan pricing and reduce concentrations in specified
sectors.
The new lending guidelines, contained in a 50-page spiral-bound set of
photocopied text and graphs known inside the bank as the 'blue book', comes
in the wake of sharp criticism on Wall Street of the bank's credit policies.
Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister who on March 1 takes over
as a new vice-chairman of the bank, will oversee implementation of the new
lending policies, which are to be phased in over the next 18 months.
Mr Ruding will have responsibility for Citicorp's corporate banking
business, which until recently was known as the Japan, Europe and North
America (Jena) division.
Last year, the Jena division suffered losses of more than Dollars 1bn -
nearly four times higher than a year earlier.
At the end of 1991, Jena had Dollars 79bn of total assets, of which Dollars
7.7bn were non-performing loans. The biggest problem area was in US
commercial real estate, where Dollars 4.8bn of the Dollars 13bn loan book
was classified as non-performing.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Macy's files for protection
under Chapter 11

R. H. Macy, one of America's largest department store chains, yesterday
filed for protection against its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code - the latest, and one of the largest, casualties of the
leveraged buy-out mania of the 1980s.
The company, which has one of the world's best retailing franchises, was
taken private by its management in a Dollars 3.6bn buy-out in 1986, but it
has struggled for years with a heavy debt burden, currently estimated at
around Dollars 3.7bn.
Recession in the US and poor sales during the crucial Christmas season
delivered the final blow, reducing cashflow to the point where it could not
pay its suppliers, who began to hold back merchandise shipments.
Mr Edward Finkelstein, the chairman, who just weeks ago denied that a
Chapter 11 filing was an option, said: 'We worked day and night to find a
suitable solution, and ultimately came to the conclusion that filing for
Chapter 11 was best for Macy's future. I am convinced that beginning this
rehabilitative process is the best way to protect our valuable franchise.'
Macy's is expected to follow the path of other retailing groups which have
gone through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reorganised their finances, and emerged
essentially intact, albeit somewhat smaller, with control of the group
handed over to senior creditors in return for debt relief.
Before filing for Chapter 11, Macy's yesterday obtained a vital Dollars 600m
debtor-in-possession financing commitment from Chemical Banking and Bankers
Trust. These funds, which have priority in any debt repayment, will allow
the company to meet the day-to-day financing needs of the business,
including employee salaries and payment to suppliers.
All Macy's 144 stores remained open yesterday and operating as usual. The
company has 98 outlets using the Macy's name, mainly in the north-east US,
the south and California. It also operates 29 Bullock's and 24 I. Magnin
stores in California. The company bought the latter two chains in a
misjudged acquisition in 1988 which added Dollars 1bn to its already heavy
debt burden.
Among the main losers from yesterday's filing will be the holders of Macy's
equity, including its management; GE Capital, the financial services arm of
the General Electric group; and Loews Corporation, the diversified company
headed by Mr Laurence Tisch. A Dollars 1bn eleventh hour rescue attempt by
Mr Tisch broke down on Friday night, prompting yesterday's bankruptcy
filing.
Other losers will include the holders of Macy's unsecured junk bonds, issued
at the time of the buy-out, who will get back only a fraction of their
investment.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Union Carbide suffers Dollars
28m loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SPIKE in raw material prices plus Dollars 220m of special charges
associated with a restructuring programme caused Union Carbide, the big US
chemicals company, to suffer a Dollars 28m loss in 1991, compared with a
Dollars 308m net profit in 1990.
The company took a Dollars 70m pre-tax (Dollars 46m after-tax)
fourth-quarter special charge. This was for severance payments and facility
consolidation costs associated with its previously announced restructuring.
Costs associated with the proposed spin-off of its industrial gases business
were also part of the special charge.
Union Carbide suffered a Dollars 63m loss in the fourth quarter of 1991,
compared with a Dollars 7m net profit in the last quarter of 1990.
Fourth-quarter sales, restated to reflect the not-yet-completed spin-off of
the industrial gases business, were 14.6 per cent lower at Dollars 1.15bn.
For the whole of 1991, on the same basis, sales were 7 per cent down at
Dollars 4.88bn.
Last September, Union Carbide said it would cut its workforce by 5,500 as
part of a cost-cutting programme that aims to reduce annual expenses by
Dollars 250m by 1994.
First-quarter earnings were reduced by the serious disruption caused by an
explosion that killed several workers last March at a chemicals plant in
Seadrift, Texas.
Mr Robert Kennedy, Union Carbide's chairman, said the company had
accelerated its cost-cutting. He said the fourth-quarter results, even
excluding the special charges, reflected very competitive market conditions
and a spike in raw material prices - especially for polyethylene and
ethylene glycol - that reduced profit margins.
On Wall Street, Union Carbide's share price closed at Dollars 24, down
Dollars  3/8 .

BANKERS TRUST, the New York banking group, continued to out-perform most of
its competitors in the north-east in the fourth quarter of 1991, with an 11
per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 137m.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman, said earnings reached a record in 1991 despite
the US recession. He stressed that total bank revenues were 4.5 per cent
higher year-on-year, staff numbers were cut 9 per cent and non-interest
expenses were up only 3.6 per cent.
The bank, which recently announced the departure of Mr Ralph MacDonald, one
of the co-heads of its global corporate finance division, said its return on
equity in the fourth quarter was 18 per cent.
Net earnings of Dollars 667m for the whole of 1991 were only Dollars 2m
higher than in 1990, while the bank's return on equity last year was 23 per
cent.
Although net interest revenues after bad-debt provisions were Dollars 100m
lower in 1991 at Dollars 499m, Bankers Trust made up for this with
non-interest revenues Dollars 195m higher at Dollars 2.5bn. Foreign exchange
trading revenues fell from Dollars 425m to Dollars 272m in 1991, but this
was offset by a Dollars 356m rise in the bank's trading account, to Dollars
957m.
Bad-debt provisions were up only slightly in the fourth quarter, from
Dollars 73m to Dollars 75m. For the whole of 1991 bad-debt provisions rose
to Dollars 238m, from Dollars 194m in 1990.
On Wall Street, the Bankers Trust share price was marked Dollars 2 1/4
higher, to Dollars 66 1/8 .

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: A master of good timing -
Bombardier's aerospace forays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Bombardier transport equipment group has assumed a leading role in
the world regional airliner and business jet markets through a five-year
marathon of astutely-timed takeovers.
The final step is the recent acquisition of de Havilland Canada (DHC), the
Toronto turboprop commuter aircraft builder, from Boeing of the US.
Bombardier took over the company after Aerospatiale-Alenia, the
French-Italian makers of the successful ATR commuter plane, had their bid
rejected on competition grounds by the European Commission.
Bombardier will have to compete against the giants of aerospace as they
jostle for position in the growing regional airliner markets. Its strategy,
however, is to stay firmly in the 30-to-70 passenger niche. DHC has nearly
30 per cent of the turboprop sector.
Bombardier began its foray into aerospace in 1986 when it bought Montreal's
Canadair, caught by a downdraft in the business jet market, from the
Canadian government.
It soon took over Short Brothers in Belfast from the British government.
This was followed by Learjet in the US, and now DHC.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin and Mr Raymond Royer, chairman and president of
Bombardier, were initially reluctant to move their mass transit equipment
and snowmobile company into aerospace. But they became more confident with
each takeover: they could see how aerospace had the potential to double
their business quickly and at low risk.
They have driven hard bargains with governments, suppliers and trade unions,
and have insisted on guarantees such as those covering losses on past
contracts, research and export finance support, job flexibility and
competitive pay contracts.
In return, Bombardier has offered, among other things, heavy investment in
modern equipment and it has developed a full range of aircraft for world
markets.
The company goes to great lengths to win workforce support, providing full
training from shop floor to executive level, and where possible it keeps
existing management.
This strategy is being applied at DHC, where Bombardier has gained 51 per
cent ownership and full operating control for CDollars 51m (USDollars 43.9m)
with the Ontario government as a 49 per cent equity partner. The deal is
backed by a package of nearly CDollars 500m in federal and provincial
support.
Bombardier has to restructure a company with more than 3,000 employees,
including 500 engineers and technicians, at a plant where CDollars 1bn has
been spent on modernisation over the past five years. It has also to fill
out the Dash-8 turboprop family to a full 30-70 passenger range  - these
aircraft are designed for trips of up to 90 minutes.
DHC has made about 350 so far.
The Canadair 50-passenger Regional Jet, using fan-jet engines, is intended
for trips of more than 90 minutes. Bombardier believes the two product lines
are complementary and can be sold to the same feeder airlines operating
within modern hub systems.
Comair, a Delta feeder line in the US and a big user of turboprops, recently
gave Canadair a CDollars 200m order for Regional Jets.
DHC will add about CDollars 450m to Bombardier's sales in the year ending
January 31 1993. It will bring Bombardier's annual aerospace revenues,
including defence products, to around CDollars 3bn, out of a total of about
CDollars 4bn, including mass transit equipment and snowmobiles.
'They're getting a very good plant at minimum risk and their timing is
right,' said Mr Richard Stoneman, engineer and analyst with Deacon Barclays
de Zoete Wedd. 'They're building critical mass in a single market sector.
The aerospace cycle can be tricky, but they've shown they can manage.'
Bombardier's aerospace order book now stands at more than CDollars 5bn and
its mass transit equipment backlog is about CDollars 2.5bn.
The company, including DHC, will have a payroll of nearly 30,000 with plants
in seven countries, including the UK, France and Belgium. The mass transit
subsidiaries in Europe are being meshed in a new holding company.
Bombardier has successfully turned three ugly ducklings of aerospace around
and must now repeat the process at DHC. The timing, at least, seems
favourable. The workforce has given the deal an enthusiastic welcome, and
the commercial aircraft market seems finally to be climbing out of its Gulf
war tailspin.

STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, is planning to invest an estimated
NKr4bn (Dollars 641m) to upgrade and expand European refinery capacity, and
is also seeking new capacity outside Europe, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Statoil produces about 1m barrels of crude oil a day, but has just 200,000
barrels a day refining capacity.
It will spend about NKr2bn to boost annual refining capacity in Denmark to
4.8m tonnes from 3.5m tonnes by building a plant adjacent to its existing
refinery at Kalundborg. Construction will be completed in the fourth quarter
of 1994.

<TEXT>
TOTAL, the French state-controlled oil group, yesterday estimated net
earnings rose by 41 per cent last year to FFr5.8bn (Dollars 1.07bn).
The increase, from FFr4.1bn in 1990, represents a slowdown on the growth
published in the previous year. However, Total has since changed its
accounting methods to reduce the wild swings in its results that used to
come from oil price changes. It has switched from accounting for stocks on a
first in, first out basis to accounting for oil stocks at replacement cost.
Last year's growth reflects an upturn in activity and productivity gains
across the group, said Total. Margins were lifted by the Gulf war, but then
shrank with the subsequent fall in oil prices and the dollar's value.
Total's oil and gas reserves outside the Middle East rose by more than 15
per cent, while sales of crude oil rose by 13 per cent, faster than the
market,

WERELDHAVE and VIB, the Netherlands' second and third largest property
investment funds, plan to look into the possibility of entering into a
'far-reaching form of co-operation'.
The companies, which are listed on the Amsterdam bourse, are to consider all
options including that of a merger. Their decision is expected in several
months.
The announcement yesterday comes at a time of extensive alliance building in
the Dutch property sector.
In December, ABP, the Dutch civil servants' pension fund, said it planned to
buy a 12.5 per cent stake in Rodamco, the country's largest property
investment fund, in order to expand its international property holdings.
Rodamco, which has property holdings of around Fl 8bn (Dollars 4.4bn) and
which is seeking new funds for further growth, is also in talks with PGGM,
another large Dutch pension fund, about possible co-operation.
Wereldhave and VIB have property and other investments worth about Fl 5bn
and are very active on overseas markets, but Wereldhave's portfolio is more
international.
Nearly one-third of Wereldhave's investments is in the UK, a legacy of the
company's successful hostile takeover of Peachey Properties in 1988.
The two companies' shares rose slightly on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange
yesterday following the news of talks on a possible partnership. Wereldhave
gained Fl 1.60 to Fl 120.70 while VIB rose Fl 0.10 to Fl 59.80.
VIB switched from an open-ended to a closed-ended structure in autumn 1990,
in line with Rodamco's decision to stop its daily practice of buying in and
selling its own shares to keep its share price equivalent to net asset
value.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nestle given go-ahead for
FFr13.42bn Perrier bid

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, has been given the go-ahead by the French
stock market authorities for its FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) hostile
takeover bid launched last week for Source Perrier, France's leading mineral
water company.
The Swiss group, which is funding the bid jointly with Banque Indosuez, the
prominent Paris bank, now needs to secure the consent of the French
government since it is based outside the European Community.
In recent days, Nestle has appeared to be trying to play down the aggressive
aspects of the bid which threatens to turn into a bitter battle with the
Agnellis, the Italian industrial dynasty, for control of Perrier.
Mr Reto Domeniconi, director general of Nestle, stressed in interviews with
Espresso and Il Mondo, the Italian weeklies, that he hoped to reach an
agreement with the Agnellis.
He suggested that his company could keep Perrier's water and cheese
interests while the Agnellis, who are in the throes of a FFr5.6bn bid for
Exor, the French property group that controls 35 per cent of Perrier, could
retain its holdings in wine and property.
Despite Mr Domeniconi's placatory overtures, Nestle is pressing ahead with
its legal battle to prevent the Agnellis from blocking its bid for Perrier.
Nestle is trying to invalidate the FFr1.5bn purchase earlier this month of a
13.8 per cent stake in Perrier by Saint Louis, another company linked to the
Agnellis. The combination of this holding with Exor's 35 per cent would give
the Agnelli camp control of 48.8 per cent of Perrier, making it almost
impossible for Nestle's bid to succeed.
Nestle last week obtained a court order to freeze the voting rights attached
to the Saint Louis shares. The Tribunal de Commerce, the Paris commercial
court, yesterday announced it had set a date of February 25 to deliver its
judgment on the validity of Saint Louis' investment.
The Commission des Operations de la Bourse, another French stock market
regulator, is expected to decide this week if it will sanction the Saint
Louis share sale.
Meanwhile, Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has headed his family's drive into
France, has tried to mend the damage to the Agnellis' carefully cultivated
francophillic image by stressing their commitment to long-term investment in
France.

BICC Group, the international cables and construction group, is selling its
data networking business to 3Com, the US-based global data networking
company, for Dollars 25m (Pounds 13.8m) and 500,000 shares of 3Com common
stock.
The sale reflects moves by BICC to move out of peripheral businesses and
focus more closely on its core cable and construction operations.
For 3Com the attraction of the acquisition is that it gives the US company a
leading market position in four of the key products in data networking. The
acquisition also immediately provides it with a strong presence in the
European market.
BICC's networking business will also benefit. Although it had sales last
year of Dollars 75m and was profitable, it did not have the critical mass
needed to gain international competitiveness, said Ms Janice Roberts,
currently president of BICC's networking business in the US.

Stavert Zigomala, an investment holding company which also retails furniture
and carpets, reported pre-tax profits reduced to Pounds 23,623 for the half
year to end-September.
The decline from last time's Pounds 33,567 came on turnover of Pounds
384,347 (Pounds 372,678). Earnings emerged at 5.978p (8.232p) per ordinary
stock unit and at 4.655p (6.697p) per deferred stock unit.

Recovery is well under way at Haynes Publishing, the printer and publisher
of workshop manuals.
Underlining the confident tenor of his statement at the group's annual
meeting in October, Mr John Haynes, chairman, yesterday announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.13m for the six months to November 30.
The outcome, which was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 453,000
for redundancies and cancellation of titles, and higher interest charges of
Pounds 240,000 (Pounds 104,000), compared with profits of Pounds 494,000 in
the corresponding six months of 1990 and just Pounds 26,000 for the last
financial year.
Much of the profits increase was attributable to operations in the US which
continued to do well, Mr Haynes said, despite 'shark-like' trading
conditions. Trading profits in the US rose from Pounds 374,000 to Pounds
870,000.
Turnover, reflecting a sales promotion and merchandising campaign, improved
to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.56m). The interim dividend goes up 1.5p to 2.5p,
payable from earnings of 6.9p (2.9p) per 20p share.

Aukett Associates, the architectural and design group, saw pre-tax profits
decline from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 360,000 in the year to September 30.
However, Mr Gerry Deighton, chairman, pointed out that the fall was
exacerbated by a Pounds 700,000 exceptional provision against the investment
in Albert Bridge House, a joint development project.
He added that turnover decreased to Pounds 16m (Pounds 18m) but that the
total work done amounted to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 17.7m), a fall of only 12
per cent. A recent Royal Institute of British Architects survey, he said,
showed that workloads were down by an average of 40 per cent.
After tax greater than the pre-tax figure at Pounds 403,000 (Pounds
772,000), losses per share emerged at 0.32p (earnings 8.01p). The final
dividend is reduced to a recommended 0.5p (2.75p) for a total of 1.75p
(4.25p).

<TEXT>
Southern Radio, formerly Invicta Sound, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 363,000 for the year to end-September.
That compared with a profit of Pounds 197,000 previously and came from
turnover down from Pounds 4.21m to Pounds 3.62m. In December 1991, Invicta
reversed into Southern Radio and the figures exclude the results of
Southern.
The company said that advertising revenue in the period had come under
considerable pressure as the result of the recession. National airtime
revenue fell by 3.7 per cent while local airtime revenue fell by 18.6 per
cent.
Strict cost-cutting measures had been introduced resulting in a 7.5 per cent
reduction in operating costs. Exceptional charges during the year totalled
Pounds 383,000, and mainly related to redundancy and reorganisation costs
and provisions against loans of a related company.
Losses per share were 3.51p (1.13p earnings) and there is no dividend
(0.75p).

WILLIS CORROON Group, the insurance broker, is buying a 50 per cent stake in
UTA, a family-owned group which is one of Italy's top 10 insurance brokers.
No price was given.
UTA earned commission income of L8.3bn (Pounds 3.9m) on total premiums of
L77bn last year. The company, which will continue to be run by members of
its three controlling families, has in recent years extended its activities
from its original Turin base to a number of big Italian cities.
'Willis Corroon has long-standing relations with Italian insurers and

<TEXT>
DALE ELECTRIC Inter national, the Yorkshire-based power and lighting group,
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 497,000 in the six months to October 27,
compared with a loss of Pounds 146,000 in the corresponding period.
The group said the improvement continued the good work of the second half of
last year, when it moved back into the black after suffering from project
delays.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 24m) but directors said that
continuing rationalisation and the strength the group's export markets had
improved its resilience to recession.
The order book stood at Pounds 35m, enough for seven months work.
Although lower base rates cut interest payments from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds
962,000, gearing remained about 88 per cent. The group is seeking to dispose
of surplus property in Ashford, Kent, but this was being delayed by
uncertainty over the Channel rail tunnel and the present depressed state of
the market.
Earnings per share of 2.79p compared with losses of 1.76p last time. The
interim dividend is maintained at 2p.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Verbal basis of Goldman deals shocks City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONS have expressed surprise that Goldman Sachs, the US investment
house, dealt with secretive trusts introduced to it by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell simply on the basis of 'verbal confirmation' that they were
unconnected with Mr Maxwell.
Their comments came as investigators uncovered another offshore trust, TIB
Inc, which is understood to be involved in the alleged illicit operation to
support the shares of Maxwell Communication Corporation.
Investigators, who now believe that hundreds of millions of pounds missing
from Mr Maxwell's public companies were used to prop up MCC's shares, have
focused on several deals last spring and summer in which Goldman sold MCC
shares to trusts in Liechtenstein and Switzerland.
Although the orders came from the independent lawyers who managed the
trusts, the money to buy the shares is now known to have come from Mr
Maxwell's private companies, and after dealing, some of the shares were held
in private Maxwell companies.
It is illegal under UK company law for a company to use its own funds to buy
its shares without shareholder approval.
Before dealing, Goldman obtained verbal confirmation that the buyers were
not connected with Mr Maxwell, and obtained written confirmation in all but
one case afterwards. However, as indications of the share support operation
have emerged, Goldman has become concerned that it could have been misled.
Institutions and brokers with experience of dealing with Goldman were
surprised that the investment house had considered verbal confirmation to be
sufficient because of its 'famously tough' vetting of new clients and other
parties with which it deals.
In their view Goldman has been among the most rigorous of the brokers, both
in complying with regulations and in protecting itself against credit risk
in dealing.
One large institution said yesterday: 'They are very definitely in the
meticulous camp in all aspects of dealing and it would be extremely unusual
for them to relax that.'
Another said: 'It's a real struggle to get accepted as a client - you have
to fill in a mound of paperwork, and if you get a little box wrong, it can
all come right back to be done again,' while showing the Financial Times the
half-inch-thick pile of statements required by Goldman for dealing in
futures and options.
There is no suggestion that Goldman has broken the rules of the Securities
and Futures Authority in the UK or the Securities Exchange Commission in the
US.
According to the SFA's current rules, there is a general obligation on the
broker to 'know your client' but this does not apply if the broker is
approached 'for execution only' - simply to transact the deal, rather than
to offer investment advice.
However, other brokers said last night that they were reluctant to take on
large 'execution only' orders because of the credit risk in dealing with
unknown parties.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Buy-out team seeks to spur sale of MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PETER PARKER, the recently appointed chairman of the management buy-out
team at Mirror Group Newspapers, is planning a meeting with senior bankers
in an attempt to speed up the sale of the popular newspaper group.
There is growing concern in the buy-out team, which includes Mr Richard
Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror, that more than three months after the
death of Mr Robert Maxwell no formal data is being made available.
Since the collapse of the Maxwell empire the future of MGN is largely in the
hands of big banks. The banks hold the 51 per cent of MGN shares that were
owned by the private Maxwell interests.
Sir Peter, a former chairman of British Rail, hopes that he can persuade the
banks that it is in their interests to go for a sale as quickly as possible.
The buy-out team fears that delays and uncertainties, particularly over
issues such as the MGN pension fund, could damage morale at the Mirror
group.
There is also concern about the high interest rates that the newspaper group
is having to pay on the short-term funding.
Sir Peter's team, backed by Electra, the venture capital group, believes
that the basic numbers have not changed since early December. Enough
unaudited data should now be available to enable a bid to be put together.
The fear is that both Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator, and
the banks are taking a relaxed view about the future of MGN because it is
profitable.
There are even signs that if no immediate buyers come forward the banks are
prepared to continue running the group for the foreseeable future.
The danger is that the Mirror titles could suffer in the highly competitive
popular newspaper marketplace where games backed by heavy television
promotion can be vital for maintaining circulation.
Yesterday The Sun launched a new Pounds 1m bingo competition. The Daily
Mirror is expected to launch its own bingo game soon.
Meanwhile Daily Mirror journalists have discovered that despite
uncertainties about the precise level of pensions in the event of their
death in service their dependents will be cared for.
Insurance premiums have been paid on members of the pension fund so that
widows of Mirror journalists, for example, would receive a lump sum equal to
three times salary plus continuing payments of a quarter of salary.
An MGN executive last night challenged the view that the group might be a
deteriorating asset if a sale does not happen quickly.
'MGN will increase in value and will get a higher price,' the executive
said.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell crash sparks fees bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSIONAL FEES related to the collapse of the Maxwell business empire may
have topped Pounds 11m since last November and could currently total more
than Pounds 325,000 a day, according to estimates by the Financial Times.
News of the amounts charged comes at a time when the insolvency profession
is undergoing severe criticism, including questions about the Pounds 75m
bill in fees and costs charged by Touche Ross for winding up BCCI.
However, estimates suggest that the Maxwell collapse has already clocked up
accountancy bills of more than Pounds 5.3m, and legal bills of more than
Pounds 6m. A conservative estimate of accountants' bills assumes that they
have worked only eight hours a day, five days a week, with hourly charge-out
rates of Pounds 200 per hour for partners and Pounds 80 per hour for other
staff.
Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, has had about 100 staff and 10
partners involved in the administration of the private Maxwell companies
since December 5. This suggests a total bill so far of Pounds 2.8m or nearly
Pounds 80,000 a day.
Price Waterhouse, the administrator of Maxwell Communication Corporation,
has had an average of about six partners and about 90 staff working since
late December - a total of about Pounds 1.5m.
Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm acting as provisional liquidator of
Bishopsgate Investment Management, the pension fund manager, have had two
partners and the equivalent of 15 other staff full-time investigating
pensions since early December, suggesting a bill of Pounds 448,000 to date.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte appointed two partners and about a dozen staff as
investigators to the private Maxwell companies after Mr Maxwell's death:
about Pounds 218,000.
Touche Ross, the liquidator to First Tokyo Index Trust, a fund controlled by
Mr Maxwell, has employed a partner and about seven staff since early
December: about Pounds 213,000. Other work from Grant Thornton,
administrator to Robert Maxwell Estates and administrator or receiver to
several other related subsidiaries, has used about five staff and one
partner since early December: about Pounds 168,000
The firms involved declined to comment on their charges, although several
have pointed out that the assumptions behind the hours put in were
conservative - they have been sacrificing their evenings and weekends for
months.
However, insolvency practitioners respond to general complaints of
overcharging by saying that reports of their fees have been exaggerated,
that their costs are scrutinised by the courts and creditors, such as banks,
which appoint them, and that the fees they receive represent a small
proportion of the assets recovered.
The legal bills in the Maxwell case are no less significant. At least 16
leading City law firms and 32 barristers have been involved in the legal
quagmire resulting from the collapse of the Maxwell empire, employing an
estimated 42 partners and 47 assistant solicitors.
Taking solicitors' charges at an average of Pounds 250 an hour for partners
and Pounds 170 for assistants, that suggests a daily bill of about Pounds
148,000. In addition, senior QCs will probably be charging between Pounds
400 and Pounds 600 an hour.
Since early December most of the solicitors and a third of the barristers
will have been working full time on the Maxwell cases, giving total legal
costs of the Maxwell collapse of approximately Pounds 6m.

FT  28 JAN 92 / National Westminster Bank to restructure management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER, the second largest UK banking group, yesterday
announced a shake-up of its corporate and financial markets operations and
the appointment of two deputy group chief executives who will serve under Mr
Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive.
The two new deputy group chief executives are Mr Bert Morris, 57, and Mr
Derek Wanless, 44. Mr Morris currently heads NatWest Support Services
Division and will succeed Mr Roger Flemington, who is to retire as deputy
group chief executive in May, while retaining his present executive
responsibilities.
The promotion of Mr Wanless, who joined the NatWest board less than two
years ago when he was made head of the bank's UK financial services
division, is likely to arouse the most interest. In spite of his age, he
must now be a leading contender to succeed Mr Frost as group chief executive
when he retires in August next year.
Mr Wanless, whose career so far has been in NatWest's personal customer and
retail banking business, will head a new grouping of the bank's corporate
and investment banking and trading market activities, to be called NatWest
Markets.
It will have its own board, chaired by Sir Michael Angus, NatWest deputy
chairman, with Sir Geoffrey Littler, chairman of County NatWest, as his
deputy.
Mr Wanless said yesterday that the changes were only a managerial
restructuring and would not affect County NatWest in any other way.
'We are bringing County NatWest together with group treasury and capital
market because we think that the strategies of the three can increasingly
support each other across the range of activities they do,' Mr Wanless said
yesterday.
'Customers are looking to get products across that whole range from us. All
three of the units have tackled their problems over the last year or two and
developed up their business well and increased their complementary skills
well,' he said.
The latest appointments come 10 days after NatWest brought in Mr Richard
Goeltz, a 49-year-old American, to be its chief financial officer in
succession to Mr John Burns who left the bank to become finance director at
TSB.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Surgeon eases the suffering: A look at a change in approach
for NatWest's troubled US operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Tugwell, the 51-year-old main board director of Britain's National
Westminster Bank who was rushed over to New York last April to take over as
chief executive of the bank's troubled US operations, has no illusions about
the mess he has inherited.
'This is a wounded bank,' he admits, as he recounts the surgery he has
performed on the bank's loan portfolio and management. Earlier this month
NatWest's US operation revealed a Dollars 371.5m (Pounds 208.2m) loss for
1991, with non-performing loans (most of them property) representing 8.16
per cent of the Dollars 14.1bn loan book.
In the City and on Wall Street, NatWest's US adventure - which began with
the 1979 acquisition of National Bank of North America - is considered a
deep problem that has helped depress the parent company's London share
price. In the first half of 1991, NatWest made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
101m; this profit would have been Pounds 250m had it not been for US losses.
The US strategy, the brainchild of Mr Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive,
has cost the group Dollars 2.5bn in acquisition costs and capital
injections.
The return on this investment is negative - some Dollars 745.5m of net
losses.
Much of the pain has come since NatWest, on the back of bold talk about
becoming a super-regional US bank, paid top-of-the-market prices and began a
rapid expansion into New Jersey in the late 1980s.
NatWest Bancorp - as the US operation is called - has suffered large losses
in four out of the past five years, some Dollars 1.1bn of deficits in all.
The losses resulted from risky Latin American sovereign lending, bad US
project finance and property loans that include write-offs on borrowings by
Mr Donald Trump, the discredited New York property developer, and the woes
of recession in the New York area.
Mr Tugwell concedes that the bank's US strategy has changed several times in
recent years and claims he has a plan aimed at achieving a 15 per cent
return on equity by 1995.
'This has not been, so far, a good investment for the NatWest shareholder.
The stockholder will still be waiting for a return on investment,' he
admits. 'I don't know whether we can ever recoup our investment.'
Asked if NatWest Bancorp would have gone bankrupt had it been a stand-alone
bank lacking a parent with deep pockets, he replies: 'It would have been
very close to that. Some 10 to 11 per cent of our assets were non-performing
at one point.'
Mr Tugwell downplays any responsibility he had as a regional general manager
of NatWest Bancorp between 1984 and 1987, but acknowledges mistakes of
Bancorp's past management.
He admits that his personal stake in turning the US business around is 'very
substantial, it is my own reputation'. He acknowledges City speculation that
he is seen as a possible heir to Mr Frost.
NatWest's approach to the US is at odds with Britain's three other clearers.
Lloyds has a tiny US presence. Barclays has been hard hit by the recession
but it is more sharply focused on corporate and investment banking.
Midland's US presence is a shadow of its past, not surprising after its
debacle with the California-based Crocker National, which it sold off in
1986.
NatWest now has Dollars 21.5bn of US assets, two-thirds of which are in its
New York bank and the rest in New Jersey. Its 260-branch network and staff
of 7,300 are evenly split between the two states.
Mr Frost mapped out the growth strategy, proclaiming in 1988 the goal of
building a super-regional bank in the north-east of the US with Dollars
30bn-Dollars 40bn of assets. He said he was seeking a 10 per cent
contribution to group profits from the US.
The original NatWest foray into the US market was couched in terms of global
diversification.
By 1988, when NatWest paid Dollars 820m to buy First Jersey National Bank,
the super-regional strategy was adopted.
Looking back, Mr Tugwell admits that too much was paid in New Jersey.
Mr Tugwell says that among NatWest's worst mistakes were loan portfolios
where the bank was overexposed. US commercial property - where 50 per cent
of the bank's Dollars 1.5bn loan book is classified as non-performing - is
the most obvious example.
Since last April Mr Tugwell has ousted most of the previous top managers at
NatWest Bancorp, made Dollars 567.7m of bad debt provisions and tried to
steer the bank towards a new strategy. To correct the US bank's credit
policies he brought over Mr Alan Jones as senior credit control manager, a
role he played at the NatWest group level. Mr Tugwell says the bank is
trading profitably and analysts expect it could earn Dollars 100m in 1992.
One thrust of his attempt to reach a 15 per cent return on equity by 1995 is
a drive into the retail market. He says the aim is to shift the business mix
from its present 80:20 split between corporate and retail to 60:40 by 1995.
He wants to develop more non-interest income by improving the number of
services sold to clients, and to earn more from specialist areas such as
leasing, cash management and lending in niche markets.
The retail ambition seems odd at a time when consumer delinquencies are at
record levels and even retail banking profits at Citicorp, the New York
leader, have crashed as a result of the recession.
'We have neglected our consumer base of 1.25m customers and it ought to be
relatively simple to achieve early results,' he says.
This optimism runs counter to conventional wisdom in New York banking. But
so does Mr Tugwell's conviction that he must expand NatWest in Connecticut,
one of the most depressed states in the north-east.
Mr Tugwell says the London board is committed to the bank. It discussed and
'soundly rejected' last year the option of selling the US business. But
NatWest's top executives have repeatedly claimed the worst was over in the
US - and they have repeatedly been wrong.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Proposed Volvo merger delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ATTEMPT by Volvo, the Swedish car group, to become majority owner of
Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals conglomerate it owns jointly
with the state, was still uncertain last night.
The outcome of what would be Sweden's first privatisation of a partially
state-owned company may depend on the verdict of the Swedish government's
advisory privatisation committee.
Headed by Mr Curt Nicolin, the committee was still considering its attitude
to the proposed Skr38.7bn (Pounds 3.71bn) deal.
The nine-strong body, made up of prominent financiers and industrialists,
met yesterday for an hour to discuss the deal and decided to continue their
discussions today.
The commission's primary stated task is to advise Mr Per Westerberg,
industry minister, on the timing, selling price and conditions for the
privatising of Sweden's 35 wholly or partially state-owned companies.
However, it is clear from the reaction of the Swedish government Procordia's
second largest shareholder, that the commission's advice will be vital in
deciding how ministers will react to the proposed deal.
On the Stockholm bourse reactions were mixed. Volvo's unrestricted share
price rose from SKr393 to SKr398 at the close of trading. So far this year
Volvo's share price has surged by about 30 per cent as investors have shown
increasing interest in buying its stock.
By contrast, Procordia's unrestricted share price fell from SKr212 to
SKr198. There were similar trends in London, reflecting the market view that
the deal is good for Volvo but bad for Procordia.
The outcome of the proposed merger may depend on talks between the two
companies and the Swedish government. The judgment of the privatisation
commission is now seen as vital if there is to be rapid agreement on
Procordia's future.
Last Friday the commission rejected Procordia's first offer of 10 Procordia
shares for four Volvo shares on the grounds that it was too generous to
Volvo shareholders. The second and existing offer was slightly modified to
nine Procordia shares for four Volvo.
Although Mr Nicolin and his colleagues do not have the legal powers to veto
the share offer their views are bound to carry considerable weight.
The commission also made some fundamental criticisms about the industrial
logic of the deal, suggesting that it had advantages for Volvo but
disadvantages for Procordia.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Mountleigh loses Pounds 73.7m midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTLEIGH GROUP, the debt-laden property company, yesterday announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 73.7m for the six months to October 31 and passed
its interim dividend. A year earlier, it made a Pounds 12m pre-tax profit
and declared a 1.25p interim pay-out.
These heavy losses are the latest in a series of announcements by the
company. Last summer, it announced a Pounds 96.1m annual pre-tax loss and
the breach of its banking covenants.
It launched a Pounds 96m rights issue, which provoked a public censure by
the stock exchange. In October, the chairman and three joint managing
directors resigned before the company's annual meeting, as a result of the
change of strategy.
About half the loss was due to a provision taken on its Merry Hill shopping
centre in the West Midlands, which it has agreed to sell for Pounds 125m to
investors led by the O'Connor Group, a US pension fund adviser, in
partnership with Hammerson property group. The deal is likely to take
several weeks to complete.
The difference between Merry Hill's book value of Pounds 160.4m and the sale
price was the main cause of a Pounds 40.1m exceptional charge. In addition,
the exceptional charge included Pounds 6.5m of the Pounds 9.8m costs of last
summer's Pounds 96m rights issue.
The interim results suffered from an increase in the interest charge from
Pounds 26m to Pounds 35.5m, largely because it has stopped capitalising
interest. Net borrowings stood at Pounds 526.4m at October 31 compared with
Pounds 641.1m at May 31. Operating profits in the UK fell from Pounds 11.2m
to Pounds 7.9m. Property sales dropped from Pounds 116.7m to Pounds 48.6m
with a further Pounds 22m raised from the sale of investment properties in
Spain. Rents and service charges increased from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds
13.3m. The sale of Merry Hill, which has a rent roll of Pounds 10.8m, will
significantly reduce rental income in future.
Galerias, the Spanish department store, made a Pounds 1.9m loss, as
increases in operating costs offset an increase in sales and gross margins.
Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, who is recovering from heart surgery,
reiterated Mountleigh's objectives of reducing debt by selling its UK and
continental property portfolio and positioning Galerias Preciados as a high
quality Spanish retail business. There was a loss per share of 20.1p,
compared with earnings per share of 4.7p a year earlier.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Four Maxwell pension funds to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR MAXWELL pensions funds, covering about 4,000 people are to be wound up.
They are the first to be closed since the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
The decision was taken by Mr Alan Fishman, of Clay &amp; Partners Pension
Trustees, because of the large sums of money missing from the funds and
because 'the chances of them being made up are negligible'.
The funds involved are for employees and management at AGB Research, the
market research group, which was bought by Mr Robert Maxwell's private
interests, and the employees of his cable television interests.
Winding up will take some time and Mr Fishman said the trustees would
'ensure, as far as we are able, that benefits continue to be paid'. It was
clear last night however that many of the employees are likely to lose the
money they have paid into the funds.
There is little chance of any money for deferred pensioners, who left the
company but still had some pensions rights, or those currently employed by
the companies involved. The position is unclear what priorities there will
be for block transfers, groups of employees who have moved in or out of the
schemes as a result of purchases or disposals in the Maxwell empire.
Present pensioners have the first priority and continue to receive their
pensions. However the value of their ultimate pensions will depend on the
financial state of the funds when the windings up are complete and all
assets realised.
Mr Fishman declined to discuss numbers last night but it is clear there may
not be enough for all pensioners to receive their full entitlements. The
funds being wound up are the AGB Research Group Retirement Benefits Scheme,
the AGB Pension Scheme, the Maxwell Media Pensions Plan (covering cable) and
the Directors Pension Plan.
Mr Fishman said last night it had been his duty to make a ruling on the four
funds. He had decided to end the speculation and uncertainty although
inevitably there were human tragedies involved.
A member of the consultative committee on the MCC pension fund said: 'In the
absence of any recovery of money missing from the MCC pension fund what has
happened at AGB must be a matter of great concern for members of the MCC
fund.'

FT  28 JAN 92 / Newhaven-Dieppe ferry faces closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER cross-Channel ferry service faces the threat of closure following
a decision by the sole operator of the Newhaven-Dieppe service to pull out.
Societe Nouvelle d'Armement Transmanche, a subsidiary of French railways,
said it would shortly stop operating the 144-year-old route because of
unsustainable losses.
Its move comes less than a month after Sealink Stena Line of the UK closed
the 148-year-old Folkestone-Boulogne route to concentrate its resources on
Dover-Calais services.
If no company offers to replace SNAT on the Newhaven-Dieppe route, the
combined effect of the closures will be to leave a gap in cross-Channel
ferry services stretching from Dover-Calais to Portsmouth-Le Havre.
SNAT and Sealink Stena Line sail their vessels under the Sealink banner, a
pooling arrangement under which they market each other's cross-Channel
services.
Newhaven-Dieppe is operated by two French-crewed SNAT vessels, the
now-closed Folkestone-Boulogne service was operated by two British-crewed
Stena vessels, and Dover-Calais - by far the busiest route - is operated by
two vessels from each.
Mr Frederic Avierinos, an executive director of SNAT, said the company's
losses on the Newhaven-Dieppe route had been caused by restrictive working
practices and a long series of industrial disputes.
Hardest hit by the ferry services closure would be the port of Dieppe, which
benefits not only from the employment created by the French-based vessels
but also from the influx of tourists from Britain.
Mr Avierinos said SNAT would keep the route open until it had been
established whether or not another operator was prepared to take it over.
Yesterday three possible candidates - P&amp;O European Ferries, Sally Line and
Brittany Ferries - ruled themselves out.
Sealink Stena Line, however, said it might be interested if the costs of the
service could be reduced.
One uncertainty facing would-be buyers is the planned opening of the Channel
tunnel between Folkestone and Calais next year, which will create a severe
competitive threat to the nearest ferry crossings.
P&amp;O's Dover-Boulogne service is also seen as a candidate for early closure,
and some ferry industry leaders predict that Dover-Calais will be the only
short-sea crossing to survive the tunnel's opening.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Fears grow of German steel strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOM gathered over the Ger-man steel industry yesterday as unions said that
workers were voting heavily in favour of a strike, in spite of further
warnings of job losses.
The IG Metall union said yesterday that the ballot, which began on Sunday
and runs until Friday, had so far produced a 90 per cent 'yes' vote for
strike action. Its figures were based on unofficial estimates by local union
officials.
The voters' motives were mixed. While some claimed the employers would now
have to pay dearly for their refusal to offer more than a 5.5 per cent pay
rise, others said they were prepared for action only because they were
unwilling to 'let the union down'. Voting coincided with a report from the
RWI economic research institute in Essen which forecast stagnant steel
output this year and the loss of 6,000 jobs from the industry's 135,000
workforce in western Germany.
The DAG white collar union, meanwhile, voted to hold a strike ballot this
week among banking workers who have claimed a 10.5 per cent pay increase and
been offered 4.5 per cent. IG Bau, the 1m-strong construction industry
union, is expected to announce a 9.5 per cent claim tomorrow.
Trade union solidarity is emerging as the main issue in the 1992 pay round.
With claims averaging 9.5 per cent and government, employers and the
Bundesbank united in resisting any advances beyond 6 per cent, tension is
increasingly rapidly.
Implicit support for resistance to union demands from the meeting of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations in New York at the weekend brought
protests yesterday from the DGB trade union federation.
Mr Michael Geuenich, a DGB board member, said internal wage negotiations
were a matter for unions and employers and had no place in international
discussions.
Results of the steel ballot are expected on Saturday when, provided a 75 per
cent majority votes in favour of action, the IG Metall board is expected to
announce the first stoppages.
An immediate all-out strike is unlikely, and tactical stoppages are expected
as the union attempts to extract an improved offer from employers.
Meanwhile the rise in west German inflation appeared to slow down in January
according to provisional figures from several states.
The state of Hesse yesterday reported a 0.4 per cent increase over December
' largely due to higher rents ' which translated into a 4.1 per cent
year-on-year rise. This compares with a figure of 3.8 per cent in
Baden-Wurttemberg and 3.9 per cent in North Rhine Westphalia, home state to
the bulk of the country's steel industry.

DEMANDS by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for a broader Palestinian

multinational forum due to open in Moscow today.
US and Russian co-sponsors of the forum feared the issue of Palestinian

clear the Palestinian delegation must be restricted to only representatives
from the West Bank and Gaza strip, occupied by Israel in 1987.
Palestinian delegates, including their spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi, are

FT  28 JAN 92 / Nissan chief accuses Iacocca of 'outrageous remarks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan Motor, yesterday made a stinging attack
on Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler Motor and a leading US critic of
Japanese business practices.
Mr Iacocca had accused Japanese business and government leaders of duplicity
following the recent visit to Japan by US president George Bush, during
which the Japanese pledged to make an effort to increase sharply the imports
of US-made cars and car parts. The pledges were part of an effort by the two
countries to reduce Japan's Dollars 40bn (Pounds 22bn) trade surplus with
the US.
Mr Kume said: 'In international business circles, Mr Iacocca's remarks and
behaviour are outrageous and insulting to us.
'I just cannot tolerate his remarks that the Japanese government is a liar.'
His comments, made during an interview with a group of journalists,
including one from the Financial Times, are very unusual for a Japanese
business leader. They reflect growing resentment over what are seen in Japan
as unjustified and politically motivated attacks on the country.
Mr Iacocca accompanied Mr Bush on his visit, and along with the chairmen of
General Motors and Ford met the leaders of Japan's automotive industry.
Mr Kume said: 'At the meeting we offered the best we could do. But in
response the US side's endeavours are not so evident. The reaction of the US
side is incomprehensible to me.'
While Nissan was able to live up to its pledge to purchase more US
components, it could not guarantee the sale of US cars, even though it was
making arrangements to market Ford vehicles through its own dealer network.
'We are ready to sell US vehicles in Japan, but there are some conditions
attached,' Mr Kume said.
The US companies had to conduct market research and modify vehicles to meet
Japanese consumers' tastes and requirements. 'It is up to them to make the
effort,' he said.
The tough attitude of the Nissan chief is unlikely to go down well in
Washington, where a range of protectionist legislation has been proposed in
the Congress aimed at cutting the US trade deficit with Japan.
US-Japanese relations have been buffeted by a series of highly publicised
disputes, on issues ranging from automotive trade to remarks by a senior
Japanese politician suggesting that US workers are lazy and illiterate.
Reuter adds from Brussels: The US-Japanese car trade agreement is 'more
cosmetic than real', Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, president of the Association
of European Automobile Constructors, the EC lobby group, said yesterday. He
said his group did not intend to challenge the accord under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Anger at Hong Kong's BCCI alert: Commissioner warned bank's
subsidiary to reduce exposure to parent before closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong banking commissioner has admitted warning managers of the
local subsidiary of Bank of Credit and Commerce International to reduce
their exposure to the parent company before the worldwide closure of BCCI on
July 5.
The warnings followed earlier alerts arising from the late publication of
BCCI's 1990 accounts. BCC Hong Kong (BCCHK) reduced its lending to the rest
of the group from Dollars 757m (Pounds 418m) at the end of 1989 to Dollars
4m at June 30 1991.
Mr David Carse, Hong Kong banking commissioner, also sent examiners into
BCCHK branches the day before the closure was announced, when he already
knew it was planned.
The disclosure, revealed in a report last year by Mr Carse to Sir David
Wilson, governor of Hong Kong, has provoked an angry response from bank
supervisors in Gibraltar, where BCCI depositors lost Dollars 96m in the
closure. Mr Brian Davidson, Gibraltar's banking supervisor, said yesterday
he had made representations about the warnings to the UK's Bingham inquiry
which is examining the role of the bank regulators in the BCCI affair. 'We
actually feel quite aggrieved here about it all,' he said.
The 30 local UK authorities which lost Pounds 83m in the collapse are also
complaining because they say the Bank of England gave them no inkling of
problems in BCCI before the closure.
Creditors of BCCI are now demanding to know how widespread and comprehensive
the warnings may have been and whether they affected banks in other
jurisdictions.
The Bank of England said yesterday it had not seen the Hong Kong report and
could not comment.
Mr Carse's report outlines the extent of Hong Kong's foreknowledge gained as
a member of an exclusive group of bank supervisors who formed a college of
regulators for BCCI in 1988. The initial members were the UK, Spain,
Switzerland and Luxembourg. Hong Kong became a member in July 1989.
He said concerns because of the delay in publication of the 1990 BCCI
accounts led his office to urge BCCI Hong Kong to increase its liquidity and
to reduce lending to other parts of the group. In calendar 1990, BCCHK's
lending to other parts of BCCI was reduced by nearly Dollars 600m to Dollars
175m.
Details of the July 2 meeting at the Bank of England, when it was decided to
close BCCI, were passed to Mr Carse the same night. He said he put various
contingency measures in place, including dispatching a team of examiners to
the bank the day before the closure.
He said in the report: 'I held discussions with the management of BCCHK and
its auditors to obtain their current assessment of the bank's financial
position. Without revealing the precise nature of my concern, I explained to
the management of the bank that I understood there were some problems in the
rest of the group that were delaying finalisation of the 1990 accounts and
that BCCHK should ensure that it maintained high liquidity.'
BCCI Hong Kong was sufficiently solvent after the shutdown to remain open on
the Saturday after the closure and its doors were not closed until the
following Monday.
The Gibraltar supervisor has complained that the use of the college to
exchange information without informing regulators in other jurisdictions was
unfair. 'We did not even know there was a college of regulators,' Mr
Davidson said.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Case for February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The correct time to ann-ounce a general election is today. At once.
Immediately. Be-fore any further ado. Straight away. Or, as some residents
of Calcutta would put it, in the wonderful improvement on English that they
have evolved, 'now itself'.
I say this because we already know more than most of us want to about the
merits of the contesting parties. Let's get it over with. It would be
surprising if Mr John Major were to do any such thing, but you never can
tell. One of his senior ministers remarked recently that he thought the 1992
election would be 'our revenge on Labour for February 1974'. February? Does
he mean February? Surely not.
The two largest parties each attracted 37-per-cent-plus-a-fraction in the
February 1974 election, but the Conservatives won the larger fraction. This
translated into a national lead of some 225,000 votes. Under Britain's
idiosyncratic electoral system this clear Tory victory produced a Labour
minority government, based on 301 parliamentary seats against the
Conservatives' 297. At that time 318 seats constituted a majority, so the
Liberals had to help prop Labour up. In the October re-run the Tories lost
nearly 1.5m votes and 20 seats, and Labour moved ahead to 319. This put the
country under five years of mismanagement by the worst Labour government
ever to hold office.
I cannot say which of these events the above mentioned minister imagines
will be the subject of revenge - the inversion of the electoral arithmetic;
the coincidence of two elections in one year; a switch in Liberal support;
or the subsequent confirmation in power of, on his logic, one of the
poorest-performing Conservative governments of the century. Any of this is
possible. What persists is the February question.
The case against an immediate election is that to go now would deprive the
government of one of its strongest potential weapons, namely a budget that
would seek to buy votes with the electorates' own money. The case in favour
is that the chancellor would be absolved from the temptation to offer an
outrageous bribe, such as an unjustifiable cut in the standard rate of
income tax.
Perhaps the Tories can persuade themselves that they can win without doing
the indecent thing. They are clearly on a roll. Voters have been frightened
by blatant, ruthless, and lying propaganda into believing that Labour will
increase taxes for ordinary wage-earners. This has been achieved almost too
easily. The Conservative tabloids have cast aside pretensions to honest
journalism or democratic principles. They have become propaganda pamphlets
for central office.
There is plenty for them to crow about. Mr Major - a trump card - is
spending this The chancellor would be absolved from the temptation to offer
an outrageous bribe
week high in the headlines. There was, first, Sunday's masterly appearance
on the BBC's Desert Island Discs, then yesterday's re-launch of the
Citizen's Charter. The prime minister has an opportunity to make news at
today's Question Time. That will be followed by Thursday's visit from Mr
Boris Yeltsin, and capped by Friday's flight to New York to chair a special
session of the United Nations Security Council. Imagine a half-point cut in
interest rates at around the same time, and how could anyone resist the
temptation to announce a snap election?
The answer, alas, is 'quite easily'. Mr Major's reason for not calling an
election last spring, on the crest of the wave of Tory popularity that
followed the Gulf war, is that it would have been the wrong thing to do and
that, anyway, the government still had to make good its undertaking to
abolish the poll tax. As to an election last November, he had promised to
represent Britain at the Maastricht summit in December. This was wise: the
probability is that the Conservatives would have lost a November election.
If the prime minister persists with this year's apparent game plan, which is
April 9 (polls permitting), May 7 (if all else fails), and early July (if
he's desperate), he will have no excuse if he loses.
The best reason for ploughing on for a few more months is that he cannot be
sure of winning. The FT poll of polls suggests that it would be touch and
go. If you take Mori's poll in this week's Sunday Times the responses work
out at a Tory overall majority of about 10 seats. In present circumstances,
with most of the economic news bad, that would be a triumph for Mr Major.
The FT's average of all polls tells a different story. In December one
version of our computer model produced a hung parliament with the Tories the
largest party, another a similar stand-off with Labour just ahead. The same
is true of the January results to date. Unweighted, the score is 41 per cent
Tory, 40 per cent Labour and 15 per cent Liberal Democrat. You need 326
seats to win; our model says that these percentages would leave the
Conservatives five seats short of that. If the same results are weighted
according to the size of the polling samples, and then averaged once again,
the Tories come out at 40.85 per cent against Labour's 40.18 per cent - and
the number of Conservative MPs is down to 318, or eight short of the goal.
These mathematical games can be played all day. They become more complicated
if you feed in regional differences, although the complexities tend to work
out in the Tories' favour. The essence of the matter is that a few weeks of
encouraging news do not constitute an election victory. From the
government's point of view, that is the case for holding on. Yet there can
be no certainty that two more months of politicking, plus a giveaway budget,
will further improve the Conservatives' standing. On the political
fundamentals - their management of the economy - they should have fallen off
the bottom of the chart by now. If they wait, they might. That is the case
for daring to go in February.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Still waiting for the revolution: The difficult relaunch of
the Citizen's Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, ALISON SMITH and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the prime minister, Mr John Major, launched his Citizen's Charter in
March 1991, he said that its aim was to improve 'every part of the public
services'.
Standards would be set out in 'clear contracts of service - contracts which
mean something'. There would be 'financial sanctions, (with) direct
compensation to the public or loss to the budgets of those that fall down on
the job'.
This was Mr Major's big idea, and it represented a distinctive break with
the policies of his predecessor. Mrs Thatcher appeared to believe that
public services should provide a basic service for people who could not
afford to pay their own way.
But yesterday's bullish relaunch of the Charter cannot conceal the
difficulties which have been encountered in turning the idea into reality.
Certainly there has been considerable activity since detailed plans were set
out in last July's white paper on the Citizen's Charter.
One highly visible result has been a flood of charters, covering everyone
from benefits claimants to users of the Scottish courts. Another is that
more public servants are wearing name badges, a measure which Mr Francis
Maude, the Treasury minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter, believes
will make a profound difference to the quality of service.
'Being identified makes people behave differently,' he says. 'The individual
can't shelter behind the anonymity of the machine.'
There are measures in the legislative pipeline which will strengthen the
powers of regulators to set service standards for the privatised utilities.
And the government has tabled plans for more performance-related pay for
people working in the public service.
But the success of the Charter will be measured by its achievements in the
core public services which are widely seen to have declined in recent years:
the three 'Ps' of parents, patients and passengers.
Charters have already been published covering the first two, but they
demonstrate the difficulty in satisfying the prime minister's desire to
provide clear contracts of service which mean something. Seven of the 10
points in the Patient's Charter, for example, restate existing entitlements
of limited appeal, such as to be registered with a GP or to be kept informed
of treatment.
The only significant new guarantee is that from April 1992 no patient will
have to wait longer than two years for an operation once he or she has seen
a consultant. However, there is no time limit on the delay before seeing a
consultant (this can be six months or more). Worse, recent figures on NHS
waiting lists suggest that the two-year guarantee is lengthening the delays
for operations where waiting times are less than one year.
Those involved in the Charter point out that this is only the first step in
a process of changing the culture of the health service, so that its
priorities are set by the customers rather than those working in it. The
Charters will be revised regularly, ratcheting up the standards year by year
 -so that, for example, the maximum waiting time for an operation will soon
be reduced from two years to 18 months, with further reductions later. But
at some point, providing acceptable levels of service will almost certainly
need extra resources, a point that ministers are reluctant to concede.
The delay in producing the third of the three Ps - a Passenger's Charter for
British Rail customers - reveals the difficulties in meeting Mr Major's aim
of financial sanctions when charter pledges are not honoured. Promised for
last autumn, the Passenger's Charter has become bogged down in the
difficulty of finding money to fund the scheme.
The Treasury is not going to underwrite it: that would rather defeat the
point. But if BR has to find the money from its own resources, it must come
from lower investment or higher fares - in either case, rebounding on the
people it is intended to help.
Instead, therefore, the emphasis will be placed on prevention rather than
cure. Thus, on Network SouthEast - the most troublesome part of the railway
 -the plan is to give each of the 15 principal routes an individual,
achievable target for punctuality and reliability, and to give commuters a
discount on the cost of renewing their season tickets if the targets are not
met. Each line's performance will be measured as a moving average, so that
managers can counteract any downward blip with a big effort to restore
performance.
People making individual journeys may be disappointed to find that
compensation is no more generous than the semi-secret system operating
already, except that it will be more open and less arbitrary. The only
significant difference is likely to be the introduction of a self-financing
scheme allowing people to buy entitlement to superior compensation rights by
paying a premium in the form of a reservation fee.
Ministers acknowledge that one reason for the difficulty in agreeing an
acceptable Passenger's Charter is that the government does not control BR in
the same way as it does the health service. The same absence of control has
led to similar difficulties in applying the principles of the Charter to
local authorities which are responsible for delivering many public services.
For example, it had been hoped to use the charter mark seal of approval as
an incentive for local authorities to improve the quality of their services.
The very limited charter mark scheme announced yesterday is unable to fulfil
this role, partly because ministers realised that they simply did not have
enough information to make it work.
Ministers are also conscious that a consumer satisfaction sanction exists
already: what incentive is a government seal of approval compared with the
prospect of re-election?
The engine for change in local services is now seen as the new powers and
duties of the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog. It will be
able to specify performance indicators and produce league tables to identify
good and bad performers.
However, the Commission estimates that it will need probably five
indicators, such as value for money and the amount of service provided, for
as many as 40 service areas. A limited range of 'bell-wether' statistics
could be chosen as key indicators, but that would encourage different
interests to pick their favourite statistics from the information available.
The system could become incomprehensible to the people it was intended to
benefit.
Whatever the sophistication of the indicators, there are still difficulties
in comparing the effectiveness of services. How, for example, can fair
comparisons be made between a council which provides high-quality nursery
education for a few children and one that provides it for almost every child
but does so less well?
Other problems in making the Citizen's Charter work have resulted from the
inclusion of bright ideas in the white paper which have proved difficult to
implement. For example, little progress has been made so far on plans to set
up a network of local lay adjudicators to deal informally with complaints
over public service failures.
A consultation paper on the idea, promised before the end of 1991, has yet
to appear because of two problems:
the multiplicity of existing compensation schemes for the public service -
many of them statutory and not therefore easy to subsume in a uniform lay
adjudicator scheme;
the resistance of the Treasury to funding a scheme - even a simple free
telephone number which could provide complainants with information of the
channels for complaint.
When the consultation paper does emerge, the scheme will be all 'lay' and no
'adjudicator', as one insider puts it. The likelihood is that the scheme
will amount to little more than a network of local worthies who point
disgruntled consumers of public services towards the appropriate channels.
Perhaps this is not surprising, given the experimental nature of much of
what the government is doing.
'We are on a voyage of discovery into uncharted waters,' says Mr Maude. 'No
government has tried to do anything like this before, and it is inevitably a
process of evolution.'
But the achievements of the first six months since the Citizen's Charter
white paper was published must be judged against the prospectus set out by
Mr Major when he first launched the idea. Apart from a lot of paper, it is
hard to see much which could not have been achieved without a Charter. It
certainly does not yet amount to a revolution in the public services which
puts the consumer in the driving seat.

When two Canadian hunters returned to their hired seaplane dragging a huge
moose, the pilot first refused to risk taking off with so heavy a load. The
pair shamed him into it by saying a rival pilot hadn't feared to carry as
big an animal shot nearby a year earlier.
The plane failed to rise, however, crashing into the lakeside, luckily with
no serious injuries, although stunning one of the hunters who woke up
asking: 'Where are we?'
'Back where we were a year ago,' said his partner.

As Boris Yeltsin announces that his missiles are facing away from US cities,
what
better way to celebrate than by sitting down with a six-pack and pizza and
tune into Time-Warner's 18 hours of television offerings? 'Warner Week' is
currently beaming into 200m homes in the erstwhile Soviet Union on
Ostankino's Channel 1 (formerly Gostelradio).
Highlights of the night shows include the gangster action movie, Bonnie and
Clyde, and the The Postman Always Rings Twice, a cinematic tale of murder
and betrayal. Ostankino gets the programming free; Time-Warner gets three

Clearly, the lessons of capitalism are being learnt fast.

Few will be down in the mouth to hear from sources well placed to know that
we shall not long need to wrap our tongues around one of the unhappier
pieces of recent verbal coinage: the Commonwealth of Independent States,
alias what used to be most of the Soviet Union.
Whatever language it comes in, the title for the uneasy bedfellows of the
former Soviet empire is clumsy and cumbersome, besides being virtually
meaningless in lacking any geographical indicators. In the UK in particular,
it has the added snag of engendering confusion with the British
Commonwealth, and the acronym CIS is at least as bad, having hitherto
referred to the Charter Institute of Secretaries and the Cooperative
Insurance Society.
In Germany the acronym is the rather more helpful and familiar GUS, for the
Gemeinschaft Unabhangiger Staaten. But it is nevertheless already falling
out of fashion in high places.
'We are no longer referring to GUS,' a senior German finance ministry
official confided. 'We only talk about the countries of the former Soviet
Union. I'm afraid we don't believe it is going to last that long.'
As by far the biggest single creditor of the 'countries of the former Soviet
Union' (CFSU?), Germany should know best. So long, GUS - or alternatively,
CIS transit gloria mundi.

<TEXT>
Once upon a time the NatWest itself was a great British institution like
Unilever, with its management succession seemingly cast in stone. However,
yesterday's boardroom upheavals there are the surest sign yet that chairman
Lord Alexander plans a radical overhaul of the troubled bank's top team.
By promoting NatWest golden boy Derek Wanless to be one of two new deputy
group chief executives, he has leapfrogged a generation of NatWest bankers
who might have felt they should have been given a chance of succeeding Tom
Frost, the present NatWest chief executive, who has been doing the job since
1987.
Frost is 58 and due to retire in August 1993, but his period at the NatWest
helm has not been a happy one and it would not be a surprise if he took
early retirement. Like NatWest finance director John Burns, who is going to
the TSB, Frost could be forgiven for opting for a quieter life.
Wanless, a Geordie who took a first in mathematics at Cambridge, may be just
the new breed of banker NatWest needs to set it back on course. But he has
not spent all of his time just piloting NatWest through the retail banking
revolution.
Besides being an enthusiastic supporter of Aldershot football club, he is an
Eric Clapton fan, regularly attending rock concerts. Perhaps of greater note
to NatWest's rivals in the banking world is that he is also an outstanding
chess player.
Yesterday he modestly tried to play down a widespread legend among his
company colleagues that, at the peak of his powers, he could beat 20
simultaneous challengers blindfolded. 'If it ever was true, it is not true
these days,' he said.

As next boss of the UK arm of Unilever, Michael Perry has an important
advantage over fellow-Brits who've held the job before. He speaks Dutch, and
so can converse with his counterparts at Unilever NV in their own language.
Having joined Lever Brothers as a management trainee 35 years ago, Perry
spent his early years as a brand manager in Holland and two thirds of his
career has been overseas. But by the time he became president of Unilever
(Japan) his interest in extending his linguist skills had subsided.
Although Perry cannot be regarded as a mere caretaker chairman of the
group's British undertakings, he is less than four years younger than Sir
Michael Angus, who steps down as chairman in May. With Morris Tabaksblat's
name pencilled in as the eventual successor to Floris Maljers, chairman of
Unilever NV, 46-
year-old Niall FitzGerald seems to be the frontrunner to succeed Perry. If
he did, he would have more time to impose his mark on the business.
Not that Angus shows signs of wanting to cut his workload as he nears
retirement.
He is increasingly involved in sorting out the problems of National
Westminster Bank, and over the next few months will take on the chairmanship
of Whitbread and the presidency of the Confederation of British Industry. If
British Airways ever sealed the knot with KLM he would make an ideal
chairman of the mega-carrier. But does he have time to take on yet another
big job?

Coming rather late to the Falklands War Replay Stakes, ITV begins a
documentary series, In Time Of War (7.30), which, surprise surprise, begins
with Governor Rex Hunt warning the islanders that they are about to be
invaded. The standard of chairman on Assignment's occasional discussion
programmes is being maintained: the excellent John Tusa is going (it was
surprising that the managing director of the World Service ever did find the
time) but is being replaced by the estimable Sheena McDonald. In her first
programme (7.45 BBC2) the subject is the United Nations.
At 8.00, Channel 4 shows the first of a six-part series, Class Action, on
what we are are assured is a crisis in British education (when was there no
'crisis'?). In Without Walls (9.00 C4) novelist Saul Bellow has the first of
five conversations 'exploring people's growing sense of unease as the world
moves towards the year 2000'. Since the calendar is an artificial man-made
concept it will be interesting to see what the fuss is about.
BBC1's Inside Story Special (10.25) promises 'a dramatic new perspective' on
Londonderry's 'Bloody Sunday' which occurred 20 years ago.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: Talking Heads - Comedy Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever else may be said about Alan Bennett's Talking Heads, it certainly
isn't funny. Adjectives that come to mind are racist, cruel, condescending
and bilious. It is also quintessentially English. Talking Heads has the
authentic English whinge; if there is anything to complain about, complain -
not because you that something might be done about it, but because of the
satisfaction of making the complaint.
That may be unfair. Bennett's three monologues, part of a series first shown
on television, are plainly meant to be about loneliness: in particular, the
loneliness of the lower middle class, women who are not married and who see
their expectations fading away. As you might expect from Bennett, the
flavour is northern, dour: it is as if the second world war is still going
on. The English are enjoying adversity; having a good laugh about it, or a
good cry, as the case may be.
People who saw the series on television have told me that it worked very
well. I can report only on the stage version. The trouble is that it lacks
both satire and sympathy. The formula is mechanical. It may well be true,
for example, that many English people have resented the post-war influx of
blacks and Asians to this country. It is inadequate, however, to make
sniggering jokes either about the immigrants or reactions to them by the
indigenous community.
That is what Bennett does all the time in this triplet. 'They sell mangoes
in the Post Office' or 'I smelled curry on my Woman's Own'. It is the same
patronising attitude towards blacks as practised by Harold Pinter. It may be
true that most English people are snobs, all the way down the class line.
Yet what is funny about a man who exposes himself outside of Sainsbury's and
the riposte of one of Bennett's characters, 'As mother says, Tesco's you
could understand'?
In short, this is abysmal stuff. There is a touch of English nostalgia in
the woman who notes the number of policemen nowadays who wear glasses and
another who remembers as she is dying that she has always been lucky with
buses - 'I don't think I've ever had to wait for more than two minutes'. But
that's about it.
The first monologue by Patricia Routledge is the longest; one assumed that
it was therefore the weakest. It turned out be the best. From then on, it is
down hill all the way. Bennett does a turn himself as an unmarried son,
still living with his mother and suspected of reading too much. Then Ms
Routledge comes back as an arch/complainer letter-writer who discovers that
she has never felt so free as when she is sent to prison. Possibly the
message is that England's a prison. Certainly Bennett's England is. One is
agog to see what his characters will do with a citizen's charter.
In my review on Monday I referred to Brian Friel's Faith Healer at the Royal
Court as a new play. It was first performed in 1980, but was new to me. I
apologise.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You hardly ever come across a pop concert that is as near as dammit perfect.
So many things can irritate - the star may have the personality of an
insurance salesman; the band may be plugging an album reflecting a change in
artistic direction; the venue may be awful and the audience repellent.
But Simply Red are passing through their Golden Age, or perhaps their
Platinum Period, given that their latest album Stars is out-selling Michael
Jackson, Queen, the lot. Catch Simply Red on tour and restore your faith in
pop music.
My irrational dislike of Mick Hucknall, who fronts the band and controls it
with the authority of a Spanish traffic cop, is an irrationality based on
his political posturing; his use of other people's songs - 'Money's too
tight to mention', 'If you don't know me by now' - for the band's hits; and
a hair style best suited to Medusa. But all this melted within minutes. He
really has a most bewitching voice, as strong as it is pure, as tingly in
the higher reaches as it is funky in the lower. He has also written for
Stars a batch of classic songs, which could have stepped out of a lost, late
Beatles album, but updated with the soul strains of the 1970s.
And, just to make the cup overflow, he wears a natty suit and a controlling
hair band, at least for the first half, and his current love affair is with
the European Community (he boasts the EC emblem as a tattoo) which makes his
'message', concentrated in the song 'Wonderland', so bland as to be
acceptable.
Simply Red, or rather Hucknall, delivers the perfect pop video live. There
is a touch of gimmickry for old times sake - the inevitable slides of Mrs
Thatcher; a restrained fountain of fireworks for the encore, the insidious
'Something's got me started' - but the overwhelming impact comes from the
music.
Hucknall is the boss but he has hand-picked a superb band which he allows
plenty of rope. Gota, from Japan, is about the only drummer I remember
actually watching in happy amazement, while Heitor TP from Brazil proves you
can be a guitar giant and not be flash.
Hucknall hardly speaks, but the music pours from him in a well-balanced
flow, mainly slow songs in the first half then a non-stop boogie after the
interval. Perhaps it lacks a bit of good honest sweat; perhaps it is a bit
too carefully contrived, son-of-Fleetwood Mac music for the happy masses
rather than meat for the discerning few, but anyone craving a fix of
escapist pop should beg a ticket.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Bad instructions at 48p a
minute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A nasty little habit appears to be creeping into the mores of British
computer companies. They are using premium-rate telephone lines to provide
technical support. A portion of the call's cost on these lines goes to the
information provider, in this case the computer company.
Customers are increasingly being forced to fork out 48p a minute at peak
times - and most services are only available at peak times - to discover how
to get their computers to work.
Ordinarily this wouldn't be such a cause for griping. A problem clearly
exists for the computer companies. In the past they have provided technical
support free of charge, creating a demand limited only by the willingness of
callers to pay small amounts for phone calls. And although lengthy calls
have cost customers very little, they have proved highly expensive for the
companies providing the necessary back-up. It has also proved irritating for
customers - the lines seemed permanently engaged.
Times are tough in the computer industry. So the decision by Amstrad, Alan
Sugar's British computer company, and Locomotive software, suppliers of the
Locoscript word processing program, to use 0898 premium rate numbers is at
one level understandable.
Howard Fisher at Locomotive says the company used to end up answering every
question under the sun about their product and those of others. As many of
their software packages were selling for Pounds 30 it just was not
financially viable to provide 30 minutes of support over the telephone.
Meanwhile, Amstrad says it is not embarrassed about introducing premium-line
services in spite of a certain resistance from customers. The group claims
its 12 customer-support staff have been able to handle 25 per cent more
calls because users, aware they are spending 48p a minute, take less time to
make their queries.
Both Amstrad and Locomotive also say people now tend to be more careful to
read the manuals before they phone.
Reading the manuals before ringing is a good idea. What I resent is having
to pay extortionate amounts to a company which has produced a completely
incomprehensible manual.
So here's the gripe. My father recently purchased an Amstrad SX9600AT
facsimile machine, including bells, whistles, a button for accessing the
Mercury telephone system and a completely useless manual. Having persuaded
my father - incapable of operating a video machine after more than 10 years
 -to sign-up with Mercury, it was left to me to program the fax machine with
the Mercury access code.
Being a bit of a technophile, I thought this wouldn't be too tricky. I
turned to page 33 of the manual. I defy anyone to be able to program the
machine for Mercury from the instructions there. It appeared necessary to
have read the manual step-by-step from page one to 33 before setting-up the
Mercury line.
The result was that I was forced to spend money on the telephone rewarding
Amstrad for writing an incomprehensible and impossible manual.
So I'll make a plea to electronic hardware and software companies. Technical
support has to be paid for, and if the cost isn't covered in the price of a
product, by all means use premium-rate numbers for recouping expenses. Most
customers won't mind spending a little extra on a premium-rate telephone
call.
But please give the customer a chance. Write manuals that are comprehensible
in the first place. Electronics companies shouldn't be rewarded for writing
poor manuals. I'll be writing to Alan Sugar asking him to invest my Pounds
2.40 in new instructions.

<TEXT>
THE Wales Trades Union Congress is to produce a review of the crucial issues
facing the Welsh economy.
It has commissioned academics from the University of Wales to produce
reports on subjects such as low pay, training, unemployment and relations
with Europe. The first report, on low pay, will be published early next
month.
Mr Kevin Crowley, Wales TUC chairman, said in Cardiff yesterday: 'Each of
the publications will set out clearly the waste of talent and resources that
has occurred over the last 13 years in Wales. This is the most comprehensive
review of the Welsh economy we have undertaken and it will point out the
shortfalls in government policy.'
Mr David Jenkins, Wales TUC general secretary, said the WTUC had 'a duty to
bring before the people of Wales a detached and thoughtful examination of
the record of the present government. There are areas of policy where the
government's record has been less than satisfactory. Our intention is to
produce background information so that the people can decide for themselves
whether they want change.'

talks effort - Brooke Meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders agreed yesterday to abandon attempts at
starting formal negotiations on the province's future until after the
general election.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, aimed to minimise
recriminations as he put efforts to resume 'round table' talks on hold
during a 90-minute meeting at Westminster with the province's four main
political leaders.
The announcement may mark the end of Mr Brooke's painstaking efforts to
reconcile Unionist and nationalist aspirations. In his two years in the
province he has won rare praise for a Northern Ireland secretary after
starting 'round table' talks last year, only to see them run into
difficulties over procedural disputes.
Although Mr Brooke's offer of resignation last week was rejected by the
prime minister, he is expected by many to leave the Northern Ireland office
after the general election.
Ministers have felt frustrated that even the increased concern about
terrorism in the province has failed to generate sufficient political will
to overcome the main obstacle to talks - the question of whether they could
continue under a Labour government.
The appointment of a Labour secretary might lead to further delays in fresh
negotiations - particularly if it was Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern
Ireland spokesman, who is committed to eventual Irish unification by consent
and is unlikely to win the confidence of Unionists.
Mr Brooke agreed a joint statement with the leaders emphasising the 'great
potential' of political dialogue. Ministers will continue to meet MPs from
the province on economic and other matters.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister, is to meet nationalist and
unionist representatives with the aim of promoting debate on alternative
forms of government for the province. The statement agreed by Mr James
Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Mr John
Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, backed the broad structure of talks
proposed by Mr Brooke.
It went on: 'However, they concluded with regret that it was not possible in
present circumstances to proceed to launch fresh substantive talks on the
lines envisaged.'

FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: EC funding row resurfaces -
Regional Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW over the European Community's refusal to release funds for depressed
UK regions resurfaced yesterday as Labour published leaked documents which
it said undermined the government's assertion that the EC stance was
unjustified.
It was fuelled also by clashes in the Commons, as Labour MPs accused the
government of the 'deceitful' diversion of the funds and demanded that
ministers stop vilifying Mr Bruce Millan, the EC regional commissioner and a
former Labour cabinet minister, over his role in events.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on the prime
minister to resolve the issue at today's cabinet meeting. Downing Street
said the matter was likely to be raised, but added that negotiations were
continuing with the European Commission.
The Commission has said that the money is at risk because of the UK
government's refusal to give satisfactory assurances that the EC money would
be in addition to the government's own planned expenditure.
Mr Brown said the need for a resolution was now urgent, and pointed out that
the documents warned that the most likely outcome was that the Commission
would block payment to the UK of most or all of the Pounds 900m or so
regional grants so that 'resources intended for the UK would in effect be
diverted to other member states'.
Officials, however, expressed doubt about the legality of diverting to other
countries funds earmarked for the UK, and made the point that discussion of
the regional and structural funds would have to be related to discussion
about the cohesion funds agreed at the Maastricht summit. The cohesion funds
will be for the poorer EC countries, while the structural funds are
available to depressed regions in any EC member state.
The Department of the Environment said the documents were written in July
last year, and accompanied a letter from Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, to the Treasury arguing that the government position
was untenable.
The draft letter from Mr Heseltine was leaked by Mr Brown in December.
In the Commons yesterday, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, headed a
concerted Labour assault, accusing the government of wanting to divert the
EC money to 'keep down poll tax in Wandsworth and Westminster'.
His lead was followed by a number of MPs from coal-producing regions,
including Mr Derek Enright, the recently elected Labour member for
Hemsworth, who said the government was 'cheating' with the money.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Coventry plant closure plan
attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS have expressed concern about the planned closure of a factory in
Coventry owned by Matrix Churchill, the machine tool manufacturer bought
from Iraqi ownership last February.
Automation Investments, the Midlands-based group which also owns
Birmingham-based BSA Tools, said earlier this month that it was closing the
Matrix plant at Fletchamstead Highway, Coventry, with the loss of 100 jobs.
Production of Matrix Churchill's lathes and grinding machines will be
transferred to BSA. A second Matrix plant at Baginton in Coventry will stay
open.
The closure is the latest evidence of the pressures on the UK machine tool
industry. With little sign of an upturn in orders in the domestic market,
companies are going ahead with job cuts and closures they fought to avoid
last year.
Coventry district officers of the AEU engineering union and the TGWU general
union said that since the takeover of Matrix Churchill there had been no
investment or action to secure the long-term future of the company in
Coventry.
Automation Investments, they said, had acquired a lathe product that was
technically five to 10 years in advance of its own, while the significant
movement of plant and machinery would not be reflected in the number of
Matrix employees offered jobs at BSA.
They suggested that the Coventry site was more likely to be used for a
supermarket than to create engineering jobs.
Mr Keith Bailey, AI's chairman and chief executive, said the union comments
were 'ill-informed'. Matrix had been rescued from a 'horrific situation' in
late 1990, caused by the Iraqi involvement. The alternative to purchase by
AI had been bankruptcy.
He conceded that AI had not invested in manufacturing at Matrix, but the
machine tool maker would announce its Omega range of high-tech lathes at the
Mach 92 exhibition in Birmingham in May.

LEGISLATION to end the uncertainty about the use of computer evidence in
poll tax cases was promised yesterday by the government as an amendment to
the Council Tax Bill.
The move was immediately condemned by Labour as too slow, while some local
authority associations warned of difficulties for councils over enforcing
liability orders before the new law takes effect, probably early in March.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, said the amendment would
put beyond doubt councils' ability to present computer evidence in
magistrates court applications for liability orders to cover enforcement of
the poll tax, the business rate and the council tax.
The Council Tax Bill is currently receiving detailed debate in the Lords.
The government could not say yesterday when the amendment would be brought
forward, but it will have to be during the next few weeks.
The proposed change will not apply to the use of computer evidence in other
cases. Ministers are still considering the more general question of hearsay
evidence, but the decision to act on poll tax cases alone prompted
speculation of continuing differences between the Department of the
Environment and the Home Office.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the government should
have taken stronger action and made the change retrospective. He warned that
the delay in clarifying the law would mean higher bills next year, because
councils would be unable to enforce the poll tax until the change became
law.
The Environment Department said, however, that there was no case for
compensating councils because even where they decided to suspend proceedings
until after the change in the law, they would suffer only the loss of
interest on their cashflow.
The announcement came against a backdrop of heightened political wrangling
about poll tax bills due to be sent out in March. Mr Gould, accusing
ministers of being 'in a panic' about the bills, said he would not be
surprised at some minor change to the poll tax in the Budget in order to
delay distribution of bills until after the general election.
Mr Heseltine promised last week that there would be no tax. Ministers have
acknowledged that poll tax bills were likely to overshoot government
predictions by up to Pounds 15, but reject Labour claims that the target
poll tax figure of Pounds 257 - if councils spent according to government
assessments of what they needed - would in practice end up closer to Pounds
300.

SEXIST stereotyping about the abilities and 'natural' role of women prevents
them from being appointed to top health authority jobs, according to a
report published yesterday, Diane Summers writes.
Only one of the UK's 14 regional health authorities is chaired by a woman
and only 16 per cent of district health authorities are chaired by women. Of
the first 57 National Health Service trusts, only three are headed by women.
Earlier this month the Department of Health said shortlists for senior NHS
management jobs should include female candidates. Targets were also set for
increasing the number of general management posts held by women from 18 per
cent to 30 per cent.
Yesterday's report from the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts and the King's Fund Centre is being backed by Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
the health minister.
It found that informal procedures and the 'old boy network' worked against
the selection of women. Suitable women could be found if they were sought
out, said the report.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories plan to extend private
prisons - Home Affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative election manifesto will commit the government to extending
its programme of prison privatisation, Mrs Angela Rumbold, Home Office
minister, said yesterday.
Britain's first privately managed prison, the Wolds remand prison at
Everthorpe, Humberside, is due to open in April, while a tender competition
has been announced for Blakenhurst local prison near Redditch, Hereford and
Worcester.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mrs Rumbold said: 'The difficulty
with Wolds is that it was built by the prison service. The ideal is really
to say to a firm we will give you the opportunity to develop this new prison
and it is a contract to design, build and manage.
'That is always an infinitely better prospect because they don't have to
take on some of the possible built-in inefficiencies of somebody else's
design.'
The government had made no secret of the fact that if contracting-out tests
were successful, 'we shall continue to go out to tender for as long as there
are people willing to undertake this work'.
Mrs Rumbold said while the new Criminal Justice Act gave ministers powers to
extend privatisation to all except high security prisons they would proceed
slowly. 'It may be that the whole venture at the end of the day is not a
particularly successful idea, in which case I don't want to box myself in.'
Mrs Rumbold, a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back Group, has
expressed concern that private and public sectors might not fit together,
and has said she did not want to provoke prison staff.
Yesterday she admitted she remained cautious. 'I don't want to foist an idea
on to the system without having sufficient caution to say that I am not
going to go headlong down that route. I am going to take it step by step so
that we can test it properly.'

FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Discreet rumblings of discontent in
Labour ranks - Voices raised to question the party's pre-election campaign
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY

<TEXT>
A POINT of order yesterday about an alleged misuse of Commons photocopiers
by a Labour prospective candidate was more interesting as an example of
modern campaign techniques than as an abuse of parliament.
Mr Bryan Davies, secretary to the parliamentary Labour party and candidate
for Oldham and Royton, had used a 4,000-name petition opposing the 'opt-out'
of Oldham hospital from the control of the local health authority to
mass-leaflet its signatories.
MPs cannot get enough of petitions these days. With modern word processors,
they offer a god-given opportunity to target voters with letters fine-tuned
to their pet issues. Furthermore, for sitting MPs, a petition shares the
status of a constituent's letter and can therefore quite legitimately be
answered using Commons post-paid envelopes.
Such details of modern campaign techniques may provoke yawns at the
beginning of a parliament. Right now they are all the rage. And as the
election nears, the talk among backbenchers in the Commons tearoom is
centring less on the nitty-gritty of party policy and more on crucial
election tips that might make the difference between five more years at
Westminster or a forlorn visit to the headhunters.
None of that alters the fact, however, that the mood music from the public
policy battle, waged daily in the media, may be worth a lot more. Among some
Labour backbenchers in the Commons yesterday there were mixed feelings about
the party leadership's current score.
After the weekend poll figures and an apparently unharmonious duet from Mr
Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, and Mr Jack Cunningham, the campaigns
co-ordinator, on the timing of Labour's 'kick-start' for industry, there
were murmurs of mild discontent.
'There is no sense of a panic, but a lot of people are growing uneasy that
after three weeks on the tax issue we are still fighting on Tory ground,'
said one loyal Kinnockite. 'We should have a core of three or four key
organisers like the Tories do. There are just too many committees.'
Another discreet critic of Labour's recent campaigning said that while it
was right to tackle the Tory attacks on tax now, not enough effort had been
made to go on the offensive. In particular, mix-ups on policy detail led
from too much defensive explaining and not enough ridicule of Tory claims
such as the charge that Labour has a Pounds 35bn programme of public
expenditure.
'It is really absurd that they should get us into a fix about a Pounds 1bn
kick-start for the economy when that represents less than a half a
percentage point of total spending,' he said.
'We should simply say: 'If these are Norman Lamont's projections, you know
how much they are worth - Next question please'.'
Labour's campaign organisers repeatedly claim their campaign howitzers - the
National Health Service and the quality of public services - have yet to be
announced. The debate over tax and spending is best held now, they argue,
leaving it less potentially damaging when the 'official' election gets under
way.
None the less, some are dubious about the real value of the regional tours
recently occupying Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, and his economic
team, while there is fierce hand-to-hand combat under way in Westminster.
Others disagree, claiming that feeding the regional media now is a shrewd
medium-term investment.
To accuse Labour of complacency when it is currently campaigning at the rate
of three policy briefings a day would be unfair in the extreme. Still,
yesterday's crop - on poll tax, EC aid and nursery schools - suggested more
a blunderbuss approach than a rapier.
Even away from the intrusive microphones, a clear majority of Labour MPs
appear as convinced off the record as on it that little or nothing can stop
their party from, at the very least, forcing the Tories into a hung
parliament.
'We are neck and neck at one goal all, and there is 15 minutes still left to
play,' was the image conjured by one seasoned electioneer close to the heart
of the Labour campaign team.
If that is really the apposite metaphor, then a Conservative outright
victory cannot be ruled out and it is still anyone's game.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Sharp rise in bias cases for Acas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD number of individual unfair-dismissal or discrimination cases was
referred to Acas, the government conciliation service, last year. The total
was 60,605, an increase of more than 15 per cent on 1990.
The figures, which will be published in the spring, show the increased
readiness of individuals and unions to pursue such cases. They also reflect
the depth of the labour shake-out which began gathering pace from the middle
of last year.
Acas has a statutory duty to try to conciliate between employees and
employers before a case goes to an industrial tribunal, and is usually
successful in that. Of the 60,605 individual conciliation cases referred
last year, 36 per cent were settled at Acas, 32 per cent were withdrawn and
only 32 per cent went to tribunals.
The most dramatic percentage increase last year was in the area of sex
discrimination, where, according to Mr Brian Atkins, director in charge of
individual conciliation, the number of incoming cases rose by 119 per cent
to 3,500. That was mainly because of a wave of cases influenced by the
European Court's Barber judgment, which extended the definition of pay in
equal pay cases to include pensions.
There was also a 45 per cent increase to 12,000 in the number of cases
brought under the Wages Act, where employers are alleged not to have paid
wages or benefits laid down by wages councils. Mr Atkins said the increase
was connected with a sharp rise in redundancies, with workers trying to
claim unpaid benefits, such as holiday pay, which may have been outstanding.
The number of race discrimination cases increased by 24 per cent to 1,500
and the number of cases under the Equal Pay Act also rose by more than 20
per cent to 941.
The number of straightforward unfair-dismissal claims, always the biggest
category, rose by only 1,700 to 39,200. The number of collective
conciliation cases, of which about half concerned pay, rose 10 per cent to
1,400. More than a third of all Acas arbitration cases during the
organisation's first 10 years from 1975 to 1985, involved Britain's largest
union, the TGWU general union.
The figure, probably reflecting the influence of Mr Jack Jones, a former
TGWU leader and one of the founders of Acas, is contained in unpublished
research into arbitration in post-war Britain by Dr Alice Brown of Edinburgh
University.
Arbitration was mainly used by workers with highly developed bargaining
structures, the analysis concludes.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Rolls-Royce cuts pay increase for car
workers as sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars is to halve cost-of-living pay increases for its
3,000-strong workforce because of the continued fall in worldwide sales.
Workers had expected a 6 per cent pay rise in February, plus 4 per cent in
return for the introduction of new working practices. The 4 per cent will
still be paid but there will be only 3 per cent extra as a cost-of-living
increase.
The increases had been agreed with unions under a two-year deal; the second
year of the agreement begins next month. The reduced increase has been
approved by unions.
Two-year deals are common in motor manufacturing as a way of increasing
stability and reducing time spent on pay talks. It is extremely unusual for
the second part of a two-year agreement to be renegotiated, even if there is
a drop in prevailing rates of pay or inflation slows.
The Engineering Employers' Federation said last week that the median among
its affiliates concluding pay deals in December was 4 per cent.
Ford recently concluded a two-year pay deal for its 29,000 manual workers
that led to pay rises of 5 per cent.
Vauxhall, in pay negotiations covering 9,000 manual workers, has offered 5
per cent in the first year, again as part of a two-year deal.
Rolls-Royce said that in view of market conditions it would have been
'madness' to pay increases of the size previously agreed under the two-year
deal. Had the agreement not been in place, the workforce would not have
expected any pay increase, it added.
The company, which is a subsidiary of Vickers, cut its workforce by more
than a third last year and introduced three-day working at one of its
plants.
Sales worldwide dropped by about half last year compared with 1990.
Recessions in the UK and the US have hit sales.
The introduction of a US luxury car tax has also had a strong impact on
sales of the company's Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars. It said yesterday that
it could see no immediate uplift in business.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wakeham offers words of hope - Coal
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN WAKEHAM had some half-comforting words for the British coal industry
yesterday when he said it might possibly supply the bulk of the needs of the
fossil-fuel generators in years to come.
The generators' current contracts with British Coal expire in March 1993.
Negotiations over how much domestic coal electricity producers will take
after that date are already at the centre of a political row after the
dismissal of the British Coal executive who was expected to be the company's
leading voice in the talks.
In Commons exchanges over the competitiveness of domestic coal, the energy
secretary also referred to an 'encouraging' report from John T. Boyd, a US
mining consultancy, which he said suggested that British Coal should be able
to compete on price.
While productivity in British coal mines was now the highest in Europe, it
needed to be raised still further in order to compete with output from other
countries.
For Labour, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, asked why the
government was making miners redundant in what was 'the most efficient
colliery in western Europe'.
Mr Peter Hardy, Labour MP for Wentworth, complained that the reward for the
industry's recent productivity gains was 'brutal' loss of employment.

</HEADLINE>

REPORTS OF water pollution in England and Wales more than doubled in the
1980s, according to the National Rivers Authority.
Statistics issued by the authority yesterday showed that there were 28,143
reports in 1990, up from 12,600 in 1981. The biggest increase was in the
Northumbria region, where reports rose 57 per cent between 1988 and 1990.
The authority cautioned that the lack of early data made it difficult to
trends hard to assess trends, but it said that there was no question that
the number of reports had risen. The largest category of reports concerned
oil and sewage spills, with each accounting for just over 20 per cent.
The authority pointed out that only a very small proportion of the reported
incidents - 658 in 1990 - could be classed as 'major', involving extensive
fish deaths or the temporary closure of a public water intake.

THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds yesterday unveiled a code of

The code, intended to be voluntary, follows an association study which
concluded that fund managers competing for business presented information
about their success that made comparisons difficult.
Mr David Adams of the British Rail Pension Trust Company, who chairs the
NAPF committee which drafted the code, said: 'People naturally wanted to
advertise their best points for commercially valid reasons.' The code
applies to all unsolicited advertisements received by pension fund trustees
and is intended to take effect immediately.

PICKFORDS TRAVEL is threatening Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain of travel
agents, with legal action over its refusal to carry holiday brochures of
seven tour operators offering discounts through Pickfords shops, Michael
Skapinker writes.
Pickfords said yesterday that it would take legal action if Lunn Poly did
not agree to carry the brochures by noon today.
The threat follows an instruction from Lunn Poly to its shops on January 23
telling them to take the brochures of the seven operators off their racks
and replace them with holiday information from other companies.
The operators concerned are The Club, French Life, Jetsave, Meon, Novotours,
Seasun and Sunset. Lunn Poly told its shops that bookings for those
companies could be accepted if demanded by customers but that no effort
should be made to promote their holidays.
It told its shops the reason for the action was that 'these operators are
sponsoring activity with our competitors'. Lunn Poly confirmed that it had
issued the instruction to its shops and said it was 'normal commercial
practice'.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Inquiry opens today into proposed Pounds 25m bridge to Skye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTROVERSIAL plan to build a privately funded toll bridge over the sea
to the isle of Skye, off the west highlands of Scotland is to be tested at a
public inquiry starting today.
Many local people reject the principle of a toll bridge on a route that has
no easy alternative. They oppose the formula for setting tolls in line with
the ferry charge of Pounds 4.20 for a car, with a 50 per cent discount for
locals. By comparison, the toll for a car on the Forth road bridge is 40p.
Others object to the design of the concrete box-girder bridge. Some oppose
the construction of a bridge altogether and would prefer to keep the
Caledonian MacBrayne ferries, which began operating a 24-hour service last
year.
Last month the Scottish Office signed contracts with a joint venture of
Miller Group, the Edinburgh-based construction company, and Dywidag of
Germany.
The consortium will build the bridge and have a concession to charge tolls
for up to 27 years, although the bridge is expected to pay for itself in
about 15 years.
The bridge will cost about Pounds 25m, of which Pounds 8m will be paid by
the Scottish Office for the approach roads. It will be the first privately
financed toll bridge in Scotland. In England, Trafalgar House operates a
toll bridge across the Thames at Dartford and an Anglo-French consortium is
building one across the Severn.
The inquiry, which is to be held in Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland side of
the crossing, will consider nearly 200 objections and may take three weeks.
There are no objections from people or institutions directly affected by the
project.
Miss Elizabeth Haran, the Scottish Office reporter (inspector) at the
inquiry, might in theory recommend against the plan for the bridge. However,
the contractors hope to start work in April for completion in early 1995.
Many of the 9,000 people on Skye want a bridge, believing it will benefit
the island's tourist industry and reduce the sense of isolation resulting
from being linked to the mainland only by the ferry. The crossing takes four
minutes.
However, a minority of the inhabitants, including many who have moved to the
island from England, believe that extra tourists will ruin the island, and
want to preserve its separateness from the mainland.
Recently the National Trust for Scotland, which owns part of the land that
the bridge and its approach roads will cross, agreed modifications to the
bridge with the Scottish Office, which will add Pounds 1.3m to its cost.
Some Trust officials had favoured a more spectacular but expensive bridge of
the cable-stay type for this beauty spot, but that objection was dropped.
In spite of the opposition to the high tolls, the government says that a
publicly funded bridge could not be justified for 25 years.

FT  28 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Change to rules on disclosure recalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX MONTHS after the battle for Distillers in 1986, the City Takeover Panel
altered its rules to require disclosure of indemnity arrangements during
bids, the jury at Southwark Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Graham Walsh, a former director-general of the panel, said the change
resulted from an investigation of the Turner &amp; Newall takeover of AE, the
engineering group.
It had been discovered that Barclays Bank and Midland Bank had been given
undisclosed indemnities against loss totalling about Pounds 4m by Hill
Samuel, AE's merchant bank, in connection with purchases of AE shares.
Cross-examined by Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director at
Morgan Grenfell, Mr Walsh agreed that Barclays had disclosed its share
purchases but not the indemnities, and that Midland had disclosed neither.
The panel, which had not criticised either bank, had been told that those
concerned had 'addressed their minds' to the issue of disclosure.
Mr Walsh also agreed that in its published statement on the case in October
1986 the panel had said that in future its rules should be interpreted as
requiring disclosure of indem-nity arrangements invol-ving associates of
companies involved in takeovers, as well as of the relevant share dealings.
Mr Walsh, who was Morgan Grenfell's head of corporate finance when it acted
for Guinness in the battle for Distillers, is a prosecution witness in the
trial in which Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance managing
director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, deny fraud and
false-accounting charges.
The case against the two defendants centres on undisclosed indemnities given
to purchasers of Guinness shares during the bid.
The trial continues today.

FT  28 JAN 92 / New charter airline to fly A320s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH of a UK charter airline yesterday gave the European Airbus
consortium a psychological boost as the new carrier announced that it would
start operations in May with three A320 airliners.
The highly computerised twin-engine aircraft has been at the centre of
controversy after the crash of an Air Inter A320 in France last week in
which 87 people died.
But Mr Bob O'Donnell, the managing director of the new charter airline,
Excalibur Airways, said he had no doubts about the integrity of the A320's
systems. In two previous crashes the aircraft, its systems and engines had
been cleared, and Mr O'Donnell said he expected the aircraft to be
exonerated again in France.
The airline is the first UK charter carrier to operate the A320 on charter
services. British Airways operates 10 A320s on scheduled routes.
Investigators are trying to discover the cause of last week's A320 crash,
but the French civil aviation authority said an initial examination of the
aircraft's flight recorders had yielded no reason to ground other A320s.
The new airline has been constituted after a management buy-out of Trans
Europe Airways UK, the British charter subsidiary of the collapsed TEA
Belgian airline.
TEA, one of the victims of the decline in air travel caused by the Gulf war
and the economic slowdown, went into bankruptcy last year. Although its UK
subsidiary was profitable, it was forced to suspend operations last
September after the demise of its Belgian parent company.
The new airline is the second UK carrier to have been reconstituted from the
collapse of previous airlines. The other is Euroworld Airways, the
Gatwick-based commuter airline, part of the failed Air Europe group. It
started operations again under new management last year and renamed itself
Cityflyer Express last week.
The management of the former TEA UK charter airline has been backed in its
buy-out by 3i, the investment capital group, and Air Malta. Both 3i and the
Maltese national airline are taking a 30 per cent stake each in Excalibur
Airways, with the former TEA UK management team taking the remaining 40 per
cent.
Mr Albert Mizzi, Air Malta's chairman, said yesterday his airline had been
seeking to invest in another carrier.
Excalibur Airways is to start operations in May with two A320s based at
London Gatwick and one at Manchester international airport. The airline,
whose headquarters is East Midlands international airport, expects to carry
half a million passengers in its first 12 months and is planning to expand
its fleet next year.
Excalibur is leasing the three A320s from GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing
group. The three aircraft are together worth about Pounds 85m.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Construction industry warns of further job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 50,000 jobs are likely to be lost this year in the construction
industry, executives warned yesterday.
The construction industry expects its annual output to fall to its lowest
level for six years.
Mr John Smith, chairman of the Building Employers Confederation, said that
at least half of all cons-truction contracts won recently by companies were
either loss-making or had been achieved at zero mar-gin.
The confederation, which has more than 9,000 members, yesterday published
its latest workload survey, showing that more than two thirds of builders
expect output to fall during the next 12 months.
More than 75 per cent of the 600 companies questioned at the beginning of
this year said they were working at between two thirds and three quarters of
normal capacity. A fifth of companies said they were working at less than
half capacity.
Mr Smith said the only chink of light in the survey was that slightly fewer
companies were reporting a decline in inquiries for work. There was also
evidence that more companies were undertaking repair and maintenance work.
The situation facing the industry, however, remained 'terribly serious', he
said.
The survey will make gloomy reading for ministers who may be hoping that an
upturn in the housing market will stimulate greater confidence in the
economy as a whole.
Mr Smith said that since the start of the year there had been a sharp
increase in interest from would-be house purchasers, but that had still to
be turned into firm sales.
Even if the upturn were sustained, it would be unlikely to benefit house
builders until the end of the year - such was the large number of unsold
properties still on the market.
Mr Smith, chairman and managing director of KL &amp; NR Smith, a family-owned
builder in Southampton, said that the number of jobs lost in the
construction industry since July 1989 was forecast to rise from 200,000 to
250,000 by the end of this year.
Those worst affected by the fall in orders were national contractors who
tend to work on larger contracts, he said. Some of those were trading down
to smaller jobs, adding to competitive pressures in the rest of the
industry.
The number of construction company liquidations, which last year rose from
5,000 to 7,000, was likely to remain high.
The decline in construction output in 1990-92 was expected to be similar to
that which occurred in 1979-81. The decline in company profitability,
however, has been much greater during the present recession, said Mr Smith.
The collapse in residential and commercial property sales and values has
handicapped many construction companies that had moved into speculative
development during the 1980s.
They are now likely to be hurt further by sharp falls in contracting profits
as contracts won at lower margins approach completion.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Asian-based tabloid sells 20,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE newspaper, a Sunday tabloid, sold an estimated 20,000 copies at
the weekend of its new Asian edition, edited for the Asian community. It is
the first national newspaper to produce a separate edition for the UK's
people of Asian origin, who number more than 1m.
The lead headline in yesterday's edition - the second issue - reported:
'Bloodbath fears halt Hindu unity march.'
Other reports said Bangladesh was on a war footing in preparation for an
attack from Burma; profiled Ms Kim Vithana, an actress; and told of Wild
West, a film to be shot in Southall, west London, a leading Asian centre. A
guide to Asian radio stations is also provided, and the latest Asian videos.
For more traditional Asians, the special news from the sub-continent will
sit uncomfortably with some of The People's more traditional fare. This
week's issue had eight pages of Making Love - 'the guide to better sex that
all Britain is talking about'.
Mr Bill Hagerty, editor of The People, accepted that traditionally minded
Asians were unlikely to buy his newspaper. His main market is young
second-generation Asians for whom English is their first language.
Mr Hagerty said: 'What sells in Indian films is sex. Once you couldn't kiss
in Indian films - now you can kiss.'
The newspaper sells about 2.2m copies a week. The Asian edition is being
targeted at the main centres of Asian population such as Southall, Leeds and
Bradford.
The People has been planning the Asian edition for the past three months
with the help of Mr Daljit Sehbai, a publisher who has been acting as
consultant.
If the Asian edition boosts circulation, The People believes, other national
newspapers may follow.

FT  28 JAN 92 / BT in talks to set up global telecoms net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom and the German and Japanese telecommunications
organisations, Deutsche Telekom and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT),
are continuing negotiations aimed at establishing a global business
communications network.
The talks seemed to be foundering late last year when Mr Iain Vallance, BT
chairman, failed to seal an alliance with his German and Japanese
counterparts during an international telecommunications trade fair in
Geneva. Now BT hopes that a deal can be concluded soon involving Telekom and
NTT in taking shares in Syncordia, a BT venture in Atlanta, Georgia,
established last year to manage voice, data and video links for
multinational companies.
BT hopes to exploit the trend towards 'outsourcing' among large
international companies - passing over management of their
telecommunications and data communications networks to a third party on a
fee basis.
BT said yesterday that the negotiations were 'warm', but that no date for
concluding the deal had been fixed. It agreed that its potential partners
were Telekom and NTT but could not confirm that BT would expect to retain 48
per cent of the equity in Syncordia while Telekom and NTT would take 26 per
cent each. Each partner's shareholding was still under discussion.
The chief threat to the success of BT's plans to develop Syncordia through a
relationship with the Germans and Japanese is from its international rivals
 -France Telecom, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and MCI of the US - which,
through their own attempts to attract Telekom and NTT, were instrumental in
preventing BT from concluding a deal in Geneva.
The overall plan is fairly small in BT's terms, with an initial investment
of less than Pounds 100m. Technology, Page 11;

FT  28 JAN 92 / Trade deficit smallest for 8 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTERS pushed up sales volumes to record levels in the final quarter of
last year, providing a dose of optimism to counter the gloom caused by the
recession.
The good progress of exports showed up in figures released yesterday by the
Central Statistical Office on the manufacturing trade deficit for last year.
At Pounds 3.5bn, it was the smallest annual deficit for eight years, and
compared with a deficit of Pounds 11.4bn in 1990.
One measure of exports often taken to indicate the underlying trend was up
2.5 per cent between October and December, compared with the previous
quarter. The measure excludes oil and high-price erratic items such as ships
and gems. It was 4 per cent higher than the same period in 1990.
Overseas sales of manufactured goods, which account for about four fifths of
all exports, grew by nearly 3 per cent last year compared with 1990, from
Pounds 82.8bn to Pounds 85.1bn. Manufactured imports fell sharply, from
Pounds 94.2bn to Pounds 88.6bn, because of slack UK demand caused by the
poor economic climate.
Car exports last year climbed to Pounds 4.1bn from Pounds 3.3bn in 1990,
while imports were cut to Pounds 5.5bn from Pounds 7.4bn the previous year.
That gave a trade deficit for cars of Pounds 1.4bn, the lowest figure since
1981.
In December the value of all merchandise exports was Pounds 9bn, 2.5 per
cent up on November, while the value of imports was little changed at Pounds
9.6bn. That produced a deficit on merchandise trade last month of Pounds
688m, against a revised Pounds 930m deficit for November.
With the CSO's assumption that invisible trade - services and various
financial payments - produced a Pounds 300m surplus in December, the total
deficit on the current account last month comes to Pounds 388m. In November,
it was Pounds 630m.
Excluding oil and erratics, the merchandise trade deficit in December was
Pounds 951m, the smallest deficit on that measure since June. It compared
with November's deficit of Pounds 1.2bn.
On a quarterly basis, which gives a better view of the trend, the deficit
for that measure of visible trade showed little fluctuation during last
year. It fell from Pounds 3.6bn in the first quarter to Pounds 3.3bn in the
fourth quarter.
Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the European Community, which
accounts for roughly half of UK trade, fell particularly sharply last year
to Pounds 1.9bn, from Pounds 10.9bn in 1990.
Trade with Britain's two biggest overseas business partners showed a
differing pattern. While the deficit with Germany fell to Pounds 3bn last
year from Pounds 6.8bn in 1990, the deficit with the US edged up from Pounds
1.4bn to Pounds 2.3bn.
In the final quarter of last year, exporters with the best growth
performance included makers of food, drink and tobacco products, which
showed an 11 per cent increase in volumes on the previous three months. Over
the same period, chemicals saw a 3.5 per cent exports increase, measured by
volume, while exports of general consumer goods rose 4.5 per cent.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Plan for Pounds 350m freight park on PowerGen site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, plans to turn the site of a coal-fired
power station into a Pounds 350m freight park.
The station, Hams Hall in Coleshill, Warwickshire, is still active, but due
to close this year as part of the company's strategy of replacing coal
stations with gas plant.
The freight park, to be built on part of the 800-acre site, would include a
link to the Channel tunnel and handle more than 1m tonnes of freight a year.
The proposed development is a joint venture with Trafalgar House Business
Parks.
PowerGen has not yet decided what it will do with the station and the land
it occupies.
Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, recently proposed that PowerGen
and National Power, the other large generator, should offer power stations
for sale when they close them down to allow competition a chance to enter
the electricity market.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Industry told gas shortage may cut supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS said yesterday that it faces a severe gas shortage by the mid
1990s that may force it to cut supplies to some big customers which take
large amounts of cheap gas.
'It is inevitable that we will have to withdraw significantly from the
interruptible market by 1994-95,' Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing director,
said. Interruptible customers pay almost 10p a therm less than other
industrial consumers, which pay 30p a therm. Interruptible customers are
those which agree to be cut off at four hours' notice during peak supply
times.
The looming gas shortfall may cost companies such as Imperial Chemical
Industries and British Steel several million pounds extra in fuel bills a
year, as they will have to turn to alternative sources such as heavy fuel
oil or gas oil.
Mr Brown said the shortage would arise partly from the amount of gas being
sold to new power stations. The power generation market has grown over three
years to equal half the size of British Gas's entire industrial market of
about 10bn therms a year.
'We have been voicing our concerns about the scale of growth in this market
and its impact on the rest of the market to the Department of Energy for
quite some time,' Mr Brown said. British Gas expects a shortage of 1.5bn to
2bn therms a year by 1994.
As part of British Gas's deal with its regulators to aid the development of
competition in the industrial market, the company has agreed not to buy any
new gas for the next three years. At the same time, it will release part of
its existing supply to rivals.
Even if British Gas could contract to buy new supplies, Mr Brown is
sceptical that imports from Norway could fill the gap.
Norway will have little new gas available before the second half of the
1990s and that will be more expensive than UK gas.
Mr Brown foresees a substantial rise in price for industrial customers as
supplies become tight. At the same time, the company has warned that
domestic customers may face price rises when British Gas hives off its
transport division into a separate company.
That is required under its agreement on competition with the regulators.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Pressure rises over who must pay: The row over gas-fired
power plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 30 unnecessary gas-fired power stations are being builtin what is
known as the dash for gas - and the electricity consumer will have to pay
for them.
That argument has been advanced repeatedly during meetings of the Commons
energy committee this month. It contradicts the view of Mr John Wakeham, the
energy secretary, that the new stations springing up since electricity
privatisation are a sign of competition.
In December Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said the
new gas-fired power stations were of second-rate design and wasted energy.
The Coalfield Communities Campaign has said the stations were unnecessary
because there was surplus generating plant. They would force competitive
coal stations out of the market.
British Coal told the energy committee that existing coal stations, fitted
with scrubbers to meet environmental standards, could produce electricity as
cheaply as 2.2p a unit. The new gas-fired power stations would produce at
2.9p a unit, British Coal estimated.
MPs took those arguments seriously and asked Mr Wakeham whether electricity
consumers would end up paying for the new stations.
They believed that might happen because many of the 12 regional electricity
companies had signed long-term contracts with the new stations. That would
mean that even if the stations could not compete in the electricity pool -
wholesale market - the regional companies would be bound to buy their power
and would then pass the cost to the customer.
If so, Mr Wakeham said, the regional companies would be breaching their
licences, which oblige them to buy electricity for consumers 'economically'.
His remarks did little to settle the row over whether the stations are
economic.
So far, 11 projects have signed gas deals and look likely to go ahead, and a
further four are optimistic that they will do so. Others are embryonic or
are temporarily frozen by planning constraints or a shortage of gas at the
right price.
The regional electricity companies fiercely defend the competitiveness of
the power they will buy from the new stations, and argue that British Coal's
figures make no sense.
Mr Gregory Fenby-Taylor, power purchasing manager for Norweb, which signed a
deal with Lakeland Power, which in November became the first independent
project to come on stream, says: 'If anyone offered me a 2.2p contract I'd
take it - but believe me, there's no such beast.'
Mr Richard Stubbs, a director of Lakeland Power, says: 'I don't think you'd
get a regional company to sign a deal at 2.9p.'
The regional companies say that prices from the new stations are more likely
to be close to 2.75p a unit, the price at which Nuclear Electric sold power
contracts recently.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, told the energy committee last
week that Killingholme, south Humberside, his new gas-fired station, would
produce electricity at 2.5p a unit, compared with 4.5p for the old
coal-fired plant it would replace.
Critics say that power stations that signed gas deals after British Gas
increased its prices, on the so-called LTI 3 pricing schedule, will have to
sell their electricity for more if they are to make decent returns. Some say
they may produce electricity at more than 3p a unit.
A consultant to several new gas station projects says: 'I would say at LTI 3
you are getting to an electricity price level of close to 3p, as high as
anyone expects the pool price to be.' He and others point out that other
factors, such as the site of the project, and the efficiency of the plant,
can also influence its economics.
Since no one can predict what the pool price will be in 15 years, it is hard
to tell exactly which of the new stations will be competitive. That question
will only begin to be answered in mid-century, when several should be
running and bidding into the electricity pool. Meanwhile, Mr Wakeham faces
two more difficult questions.
The first, from those who believe gas is a good idea, is why the government
is dragging its feet over allowing imported gas into the UK - it has
insisted on tying imports to exports.
The second question, from the coal and environmental lobbies, is whether he
believes the electricity market is making the right investment decisions.
They argue that not only is the market's half-hourly price system an
inadequate way of deciding what kind of fuel and plant Britain will need in
the long term, but the new gas-fired stations are indifferent even to that
system because they have signed long-term contracts.

FT  28 JAN 92 / British Gas may buy power station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS will almost certainly buy one of the four power stations on sale
in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Office said yesterday.
A partnership between Tractebel, the Belgian power conglomerate, and
Associated Energy Supply (AES), the US power company, is likely to buy two
more stations. The fourth will probably go to a management buyout team.
The sale of the stations will be an important step in the privatisation of
Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), the electricity generator and supplier.
A draft order providing the legislative basis for NEI's privatisation was
passed in the Commons last night.
NIE's four power stations will be sold as individual units. The company's
electricity supply business will remain intact and will be sold to the
public in November.
British Gas is expected to buy Ballylumford, Northern Ireland's largest
power station. AES, which has invested in a new power station in Kent, and
Tractebel are expected to buy Kilroot, the newest station, and the old
Belfast West station.
The fourth, Coolkeeragh, will probably be bought by management.
There will initially be no electricity pool - wholesale market - in Northern
Ireland and the purchasers of the four stations will receive 15-year
contracts to supply NIE.
They will, however, still compete with each other through a bidding system.
Another power station is likely to be built after NIE next month invites
bidders to extend the life of existing stations or provide an alternative.
A Labour government would not seek to return a privatised Northern Ireland
Electricity to public ownership, Mr James Marshall, a frontbench spokesman,
told the Commons last night.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Threat to electrical retailers predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETAILING arms of the recently privatised electricity companies are
emerging as a significant threat to established electrical goods retailers,
according to Corporate Intelligence Group, the retail consultancy.
It suggests that this month's merger of the retailing and servicing
interests of South Western Electricity and South Wales Electricity to create
a business with combined sales of Pounds 70m represents the future.
The consultancy expects more mergers and identifies London Electricity and
Seeboard as interested parties.
Shop sales by the 15 electricity companies in 1991 were about Pounds 850m,
with appliances accounting for 80 per cent. The electricity companies
represent the UK's second-biggest electrical retailing concern after Dixons.
Most of the 1,000 electricity company outlets are on high streets, however,
where trading efficiencies are lower than at edge-of-town superstores.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA has frozen all discretionary government spending and public-service
hiring to contain a spiralling budget deficit and calm increasingly jittery
foreign investors.
Mr Don Mazankowski, finance minister, said yesterday the freeze would hold
the federal government's deficit to CDollars 31.5bn (Pounds 15bn) in the
year to March 31, still above the original deficit projection of CDollars
30.5bn.
The spending freeze will save a relatively modest CDollars 200m in the
remaining two months of the fiscal year, but Ottawa is anxious to send out a
message of restraint and financial prudence. The minister acknowledged the
government was unlikely to meet its target of a CDollars 25bn deficit in
1992-93.
Canadian bond prices and the Canadian dollar tumbled yesterday ahead of Mr
Mazankowski's announcement. The dollar fell as low as 85 US cents, down from
a peak of 89.30 US cents last November. The currency has lost more than a
cent in the past week.
Investors have also been unsettled by the deepening fiscal troubles of
Ontario province, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the country's
output. Ontario acknowledged last week that without further belt tightening
its deficit would balloon to CDollars 14.3bn next year, from an original
projection of CDollars 8.9bn.
Ottawa is also reviewing all new capital projects. Mr Mazankowski said it
would proceed only with those required for 'health, safety or essential
services'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas was gambling yesterday that an
extraordinary prime-time television confession of 'wrongdoing' in his
marriage has salvaged his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
During a joint TV appearance with his wife, Hillary, Mr Clinton admitted his
marriage had been rocky, but he denied allegations of a 12-year-long affair
with a former Arkansas state employee and part-time cabaret singer.
Ms Gennifer Flowers, the employee, last night held a news conference in New
York in which she accused Mr Clinton of lying when he claimed they were just
friends. She said: 'I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years. . . he is
absolutely lying. I'm disappointed, but realistically I never thought he'd
come out and admit it.'
In response to one question, she said the local Republican party in Arkansas
had offered her money six months ago to reveal her affair with Mr Clinton,
but she had refused. She said she had lied to the press to protect him and
that later she sold her story to a supermarket tabloid because he had
angered her.
At the press conference Ms Flowers played 10 minutes of tape-recorded
telephone conversation she said was between her and Mr Clinton. Published
excerpts of these tapes have so far proved inconclusive and questions have
surfaced about her credibility.
Ms Flowers maintains she met Mr Clinton in 1979 and 1980 at the Excelsior
Hotel in Little Rock. But the hotel did not open until 1982. She also claims
to have reported on Mr Clinton while working with a local TV station, but
Little Rock's KARK-TV said it could find no tapes to support this.
Mr Clinton, the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination, was judged
yesterday to have taken a huge gamble by appearing on CBS's programme 'Sixty
Minutes', which generally attracts more than 30m viewers.
Although his campaign advisers said the sex scandal rumours were drowning
out the Arkansas governor's message to voters, the risk was his confessions
could draw further media scrutiny just three weeks before the critical New
Hampshire primary election.
Mr Clinton, 46, appeared calm and good-humoured throughout the interview. 'I
have acknowledged causing pain in my marriage,' he said. 'I have said things
to you tonight and to the American people from the beginning that no
American politician ever has.' But in response to a question on whether he
had ever committed adultery, Mr Clinton avoided a clear-cut response. 'I'm
not prepared to say tonight that any married couple should ever discuss that
with anyone but themselves.'
He appealed to the US public for fairness and urged the media to respect his
privacy, instead of turning the 1992 campaign into a 'game of gotcha'.
Mr Clinton saw his popularity fall sharply last week among likely Democratic
voters in New Hampshire, Reuter reports from Boston.
In a poll by the American Research Group, which has conducted daily surveys
in advance of the February 18 primary, support for Mr Clinton fell 14
percentage points in five days last week.
The latest polling data put Mr Clinton in second place, with 25 per cent, to
Mr Paul Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator, who has 27 per cent of
voters' support.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Pentagon poised to reveal cuts in weapon production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PENTAGON is expected tomorrow to unveil far-reaching plans to scale back
production of new weapons systems, including nuclear warheads, in response
to the collapse of the Soviet Union, writes Lionel Barber.
The plans are intended to save billions of dollars in military spending, but
could face stiff opposition from Congress and US defence contractors.
In their most radical form, the plans would halt production of most new
weapons systems once a prototype was ready. The aim would be to restrict the
Defence Department's costs to research and development - which typically
represents about a quarter of the cost of an advanced weapons system.
Big defence contractors argue that this would saddle industry with the cost
of research without the security of future earnings through mass production.
A further objection is that mass production irons out defects in advanced
weapons systems, and also helps to sustain the country's defence industrial
base.
Separately, the administration is reported ready to announce a halt in
production of the W-88 nuclear warhead. This would fit earlier steps to
reduce the US nuclear bomb-building capability in line with cuts in nuclear
warheads agreed with the former Soviet Union.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Grim backdrop for US budget: Uncertainties likely to affect
economic planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration will tomorrow unveil budget plans for fiscal 1993
against an uncertain economic outlook and deteriorating medium-term trends
for the federal deficit.
'The deficit outlook is far bleaker than was expected when Congress and the
president reached their budget summit agreement in the fall of 1990,' the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned last week. This time last year the
administration used that agreement - which cut prospective deficits by
Dollars 500bn (Pounds 276.2bn) over five years - to justify its projection
of a rapid decline of the budget deficit. Mr Richard Darman, the budget
director, even forecast a slim surplus of Dollars 14bn by 1996.
The CBO, set up to provide non-partisan advice for Congress, now believes
such projections were too optimistic. In its budget assessment last week it
forecast only a gradual decline in the budget deficit, from Dollars 352bn
this year to Dollars 178bn in 1996. The deficit then begins to rise again,
reaching Dollars 407bn by 2002.
If distortions caused by the bail-out of savings and loans and the Gulf war
are excluded, the CBO figures suggest the deficit will not fall below
Dollars 200bn, or 3 per cent of gross domestic product, at any point during
the next decade. Indeed, by 2002 the deficit will have risen to 4.1 per cent
of GDP, the same ratio as expected for fiscal 1993.
A budget deficit represents negative saving by the federal government. The
CBO's projection of another decade of large deficits indicates that, on
unchanged policies, the US will be unable to raise its low national savings
rate. This in turn implies a low rate of capital formation and sluggish
economic growth.
What accounts for the deterioration in outlook for the deficit? In the
short-term, the culprit is the more stubborn than expected recession. Last
year the administration forecast a recovery beginning last summer. This
failed to materialise and many economists expect the recession that began in
July 1990 to be the longest since the Second World War.
Most forecasters, including the CBO, now project a weak recovery in the
second half of this year. But few economists are taking a recovery for
granted and not many expect more than lacklustre growth of 2-3 per cent at
an annual rate.
In the longer term, the CBO blames the poor outlook for the deficit on
projected spending trends. Provided permanent tax cuts are avoided in this
week's budget, the organisation projects federal revenue to rise slightly as
a share of GDP, from 18.9 per cent this year to 19.2 per cent in 1995 and
then to hold steady.
However, its forecast for spending shows outlays at or above 22 per cent of
GDP for most of the next decade. Discretionary spending - on defence and
domestic programmes - is projected to decline steadily over the next decade.
But these gains are offset by a sharp increase in mandatory spending on
entitlement programmes, mainly health care for the elderly and the poor, and
pensions.
Mandatory spending, estimated at Dollars 708bn this year, is already more
than twice the size of the defence budget. The growth in spending on
entitlements can thus easily outstrip even a large 'peace dividend'. Debt
service will remain one of the government's largest programmes, absorbing
3.5 per cent or more of GDP.
The CBO concludes that another round of deficit-cutting, rivalling the 1990
summit, is now 'urgent if the government's drain on national savings is to
be curbed'.
Mr Darman's talent for creative accounting will result in the most
flattering possible presentation of long-run budgetary trends. But analysts
striving to assess the US economy's long-term potential will be looking for
concrete evidence of either reduced growth of entitlement spending or higher
revenues.
In the absence of either, the outlook for saving and capital formation is
likely to remain poor, despite the large scope for cuts in the defence
budget.

FT  28 JAN 92 / BJP unity tour falls short of expectations: Leaders forced
to abandon grand climax at Srinagar

<TEXT>
THE OPPOSITION Bharatiya Janata party's much publicised ekta yatra (unity
tour) ended in a shoddy victory, at best. Its leaders are now pondering
whether it was worth the effort.
The BJP had hoped by emphasising national unity to widen its appeal among
voters and to deflect attention from its emotional communal campaign to
build a temple to the Hindu god Ram on a religously disputed site. The BJP
had failed to live up to its promise to start building the temple.
Meant to symbolise India's unity, the caravan headed by Dr Murli Manohar
Joshi, the BJP president, was to finish its 45-day tour at Srinagar, capital
of the state of Kashmir, where the national flag was to be unfurled before a
huge gathering. The grand climax did not take place.
A short discussion with Mr G N Saxena, the Kashmiri governor, the day before
the planned grand drive forced Mr Joshi to change his plans. Thousands of
volunteers were stranded, with only a token group ferried to Srinagar by the
Indian Air Force to unfurl the national flag in a 15-minute ceremony. It was
exactly this sort of tokenism that Mr Joshi had been deriding.
Honours went to the militants seeking Kashmir autonomy. In spite of an
official curfew, gunfire in the Kashmir valley was heard throughout the day.
Even the unfurling site was the target of rocket attack. The militants were
able to show that they held sway.
The diverse militant groups fighting for independence apparently suspended
their differences, if only for the day, although political observers believe
this could well lead to more cohesion among the guerrillas. The ekta yatra
seemed only to strengthen the militants' resolve, and the BJP might now be
forced to abandon yatra politics.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Democracy discomforts Hong Kong business: Conservatives fear
Beijing's anger towards the colony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emergence of a limited degree of democracy in Hong Kong is causing
unease among some of the colony's conservative politicians, many of whom are
finding it difficult to adjust to the changed political environment brought
about by democratic elections.
Since September's elections, the government in Hong Kong has changed from
one where the wishes of the colonial authorities were enacted into law by a
relatively compliant legislature, to one where virtually all aspects of the
government's legislative programme are vigorously debated, and, in some
cases, changed.
This has caused alarm in Beijing, which has no interest in seeing an
alternative centre of power establishing itself before 1997. It has made
plain its desire to inherit an 'executive-led' government from Britain's
colonial administration. The change in political landscape is also worrying
conservatives who want to take the line of least resistance with China.
But these concerns cut little ice with Hong Kong's democratically-elected -
mainly the United Democrats - politicians who can fairly claim to represent
the people. They want greater democracy in Hong Kong before the colony is
handed over to Beijing, and want relations between Hong Kong and China to be
rooted in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, rather than the Basic
Law.
And, according to foreign observers of the colony's politics, the United
Democrats' views command popular support. Explaining their appeal, one
diplomat noted that there was a strong current of support for
self-determination in the colony. 'There is also support for a degree of
confrontation with China; a desire to demonstrate independence. But it is
not anti-Chinese or anti-British,' he said.
The elections in September were a watershed in Hong Kong. They allowed
voters to elect candidates to 18 of the 60 seats in the Legislative Council
(Legco). This was the first time the people of the colony had been given the
opportunity to vote for political representatives.
The United Democrats, led by the mild-mannered yet outspoken Mr Martin Lee,
who in European terms would be called a Christian Democrat, won 12 of the 18
democratically contested seats, while others of equally liberal persuasion
won five of the remaining six.
A further 21 of the 60 seats were elected indirectly by so-called functional
constituencies - groupings which represent business, finance, the law and
the labour movement, among others. Of the rest, 18 members were appointed by
Sir David Wilson, the governor, with the remaining three occupied ex officio
by senior government officials.
Legco's powers are substantial. It can amend and vote out legislation
proposed by the colonial government. It cannot propose spending bills, but
it can exercise a line-by-line veto over any of the government's spending
plans. Last year it forced the then financial secretary, Sir Piers Jacobs,
to back down from his budget proposal to increase tobacco taxes by 200 per
cent.
Legco has already exhibited its new democratic muscle by voting to condemn a
UK-China agreement on the composition of Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal -
a vote which commanded cross-party support - and last week by strongly
attacking the British government for the delay in appointing a new governor.
But the new-found robustness and content of the debates leads conservative
local politicians to worry about upsetting delicate relations with China,
which will assume sovereignty of the territory - albeit as a special
administrative region - in 1997.
Mr Stephen Cheong, a Legco member since 1980 who now represents the
Federation of Hong Kong Industries (FHKI) as its functional member, went so
far as to express fears that anarchy could develop in Hong Kong, during a
speech at a conference to promote the territory's future in London.
Mr Cheong was roundly criticised for this by the local media. The
Chinese-language Economic Journal suggested that the FHKI reconsider his
qualification to represent it. 'Democratic changes in Hong Kong are now a
matter of fact,' the paper said. 'The (United) Democrats' performance has
been reasonable and Hong Kong people should try to get used to living with
democracy.'
Yet, intemperate as Mr Cheong's remarks were, they do strike a chord with
the political supporters of Hong Kong's business and financial
establishment. These people stand for stability, a reasonable relationship
with China, no hurry on democracy, and keeping the economic environment
favourable for business. In short: the maintenance of the status quo as it
existed before September's elections.
In party political terms they call themselves the Co-operative Resources
Centre (CRC). It numbers more than 24 adherents in Legco and has four
members on the Executive Council - the governor's cabinet. All members of
the CRC were either appointed by the colonial government or submitted
themselves to a limited plebiscite as a functional constituency member of
Legco. Not one democratically-elected politician has joined their group.
Their concerns are derided by the democratically-elected politicians, who
see them as representatives of the ancien regime. They accuse them of
kowtowing to China either in the hope of preferment after 1997, or in the
misguided hope that by acquiescing now Hong Kong will be spared later.
But they do agree that the central issue is Hong Kong's relations with China
and an appropriate modus vivendi for them. The United Democrats' position,
however, places them on a collision course with the colonial government,
Westminster and Beijing. They want nothing less than the amendment of the
Basic Law - which sets out how Hong Kong will be governed after 1997 - and
more people democratically elected in future plebiscites.
China has said the Basic Law can not be amended. Mr Douglas Hurd, the
British foreign secretary, has said he will raise the matter with Beijing,
although he held out little hope for success. Yet politicians such as Mr Lee
will not let go.
'What the people of Hong Kong want are politicians who dare to speak the
truth particularly when China and, to a lesser extent the Hong Kong
government, is not doing the right thing by Hong Kong,' he says. 'Many
people are prepared to criticise the Hong Kong government. But where can you
find people to criticise China? That's why we did so well in the elections.'
Yet as the year progresses Mr Lee expects the temperature of politics in
Britain's last important colony to rise. Given the representation in Legco
the government will not lose a vote, the conservatives will see to that. But
that is a mixed blessing to the colonial and British governments.
'Every time we fight and lose it is a pyrrhic victory for the government,'
says Mr Lee. 'The question is how many pyrrhic victories can they afford to
win. Soon or later the people will become disillusioned.'
He may have a point.

FT  28 JAN 92 / S African miners scrap profit-linked pay deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African National Union of Mineworkers' (NUM) decision to scrap a
profit-and productivity-linked wage deal was the first shot across the bows
of mining houses in the run up to annual wage talks, analysts said, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg.
'It might well be the start of a push for a differently structured
arrangement for 1992-93, and one at better terms,' Mr Rob Gillan, analyst at
Frankel Max Pollak Vinderine, said.
However, if the NUM's new demands were unrealistic, employers, hit by weak
gold prices, would be forced to shed more workers, he said.
The NUM's outgoing acting general secretary, Mr Marcel Golding, told a news
conference at the weekend that the union would pull out of the agreement at
the June wage talks because of members' dissatisfaction with the bonus
system and the way most mine employers were applying it. The NUM and the
Chamber of Mines signed an historic performance bonus agreement last year,
whereby a minimum annual wage increase is supplemented if the gold price
reaches a trigger level.
The gold price did not trigger the bonus in the first half of the July-June,
1991-92 year covered by the agreement.
But, in terms of cost containment and productivity schemes, some mines have
paid out bonuses of up to 12 per cent, on top of a minimum 4 per cent wage
increase for the year, analysts said.
Mr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the Conservative Party, yesterday formally
spurned an offer by President FW de Klerk to put his party's proposal for
racial partition on the agenda of multi-party democracy talks, Reuter
reports from Cape Town.
Mr Treurnicht told parliament in Cape Town that Mr de Klerk's offer was a
'cynical' attempt to draw his party into negotiations.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Private banks start to open in Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATELY owned banks have begun opening in Taiwan this month, ending a
40-year monopoly by government-run institutions and setting the stage for
intense competition.
Grand Commercial Bank and Dah An Commercial Bank have begun operating, and
13 more are due to to follow soon under licences issued last May. The new
banks have a minimum capitalisation of Dollars 400m (Pounds 221m) and are
backed by some of the biggest names in Taiwanese industry.
Among shareholders are Lucky Cement, Far Eastern Department Stores, Asia
Cement, Evergreen Shipping, Formosa Plastics, China Rebar, Pacific
Enterprises, Tainan Spinning, President Business Group.
The change is part of the ruling Nationalist (KMT) government's programme of
financial liberalisation, which in 1991 included facilitation of trading in
bonds and foreign exchange, and allowed trust companies to apply to convert
to banks.
With their targeting of medium and small businesses, the new banks will also
play a role as the first alternative to Taiwan's underground financial
markets. The government banks' unwillingness to lend to any but fully
collateralised concerns has meant that underground banks have flourished.
Conservatism about lending stems from the government's tight monetary policy
to avoid the mistakes which led to hyper-inflation when they were in power
on the mainland over 40 years ago.
Mr Peter Kurz, of Baring Securities, said Taiwan's large supply of capital
and strong manufacturing base gave it the potential to be a key financial
power worldwide, although it lacked the necessary financial services as yet.

China's foreign trade in 1991 soared 17.5 per cent to Dollars 135.7bn
(Pounds 74.9bn), the Chinese government announced yesterday, Kyodo reports
from Beijing.
The country's balance of trade in the year posted a surplus of Dollars
8.12bn with Dollars 71.91bn in exports against Dollars 63.79bn in imports.
Exports were up 15.8 per cent and imports 19.5 per cent from the previous
year. Beijing attributed the good showing mainly to last year's abolition of
export subsidies aimed at making Chinese enterprises more competitive, and
to the west's lifting of economic sanctions and the virtual ending of a
strict domestic economic policy that brought on appreciable growth in
imports.
Hong Kong was China's top trade partner with Dollars 49.6bn while Japan was
second with Dollars 20.3bn. Third was the US at Dollars 14.1bn and South
Korea was fourth at Dollars 3.3bn.

THE minority government of the Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Shamir,
survived five parliamentary motions of no confidence yesterday, Reuter
reports.
The motions were put down in a single vote which resulted in a 55-49 victory
for the government with five abstentions, a Knesset (parliament) spokesman
said.
It was the first challenge to Mr Shamir's fragile coalition since two
far-right parties pulled out last week over participation in Middle East
peace talks.
Opposition parties brought the motions in protest at what they described as
deteriorating social and economic conditions in Israel - rising unemployment
coupled with lavish spending on construction of Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories.
Mr Shamir's success in mustering enough support for his government in the
vote will give him the upper hand in setting the early date for national
elections set for November but now expected to take place within six months.
Senior members of Mr Shamir's Likud party yesterday began consultations with
coalition partners and opposition parties on the election date.

UN INSPECTORS investigating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons stocks
were trapped in a bus by demonstrators outside the Sheraton hotel in Baghdad
yesterday while police looked on and refused to intervene.
The incident was reported to the Security Council and protests were
addressed to the Iraqi government. According to an official UN account in
New York last night, 40 male demonstrators confronted the 18 inspectors. Ms
Karen Jansen, their deputy chief, was pinned against the hotel wall.
Meanwhile, other team members were held in their bus as demonstrators jumped
and pushed UN vehicles. Eventually, the inspectors forced their way through
the crowd and into the hotel.
A UN spokesman called the incident a clear Iraqi breach of UN resolutions.
In a development which the spokesman said was unrelated to the incident, a
special UN mission was due in Baghdad last night to discuss with the
authorities Iraq's failure to disclose detailed information about its
weapons of mass destruction and weapons research and industries.
This failure was 'a serious obstacle to the implementation of the long-term
monitoring and verification of Iraq's obligations' under Council
resolutions, the UN said.

LAST-MINUTE talks were being held last night to ensure the Middle East
multinational forum due to open in Moscow today goes ahead as planned,
following demands by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for broader
Palestinian representation.
US and Russian co-sponsors of the forum feared the issue of Palestinian
representation could provoke a walkout by the Israeli delegation.
PLO calls for the Palestinian delegation in Moscow to include
representatives from the diaspora, among them Jerusalem-born Palestinians,
have cast a shadow over the multilateral talks, the third stage of the
latest Middle East peace effort launched in Madrid last October.
Seeking to play down the argument, US and Russian officials made it clear
the Palestinian delegation must be restricted to the 'Madrid formula'
allowing only representatives from the West Bank and Gaza strip, occupied by
Israel in the 1967 war.
A two-tier Palestinian delegation was due in Moscow last night. At the
Madrid opening last October, the Palestinian team included representatives
from east Jerusalem, but these did not participate directly in the
discussions with Israel.
Representatives from about 18 countries, including permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council, are expected to sit down today in Moscow's
Hall of Unions to discuss such issues as regional disarmament, economic
development, water and the environment.
Syria and Lebanon are boycotting the talks, claiming Israel has shown no
commitment to a Middle East settlement based on the 'land for peace' formula
outlined in United Nations Security Council resolutions. Radical
Palestinians have condemned Arab participation.
The US wants to use the Moscow meeting - involving Israel for the first time
in discussing Middle East questions with Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey as well
as Arabs from the Gulf and Africa - to lessen the Jewish state's regional
isolation.
Israel and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian
Palestinian team have conducted three rounds of bilateral talks in Madrid
and in Washington marked by procedural argument.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state and originator of this latest
Middle East peace effort, is anxious for the Moscow meeting to establish the
framework for tackling multilateral Middle East issues before the general
election in Israel later this year brings the peace process at least to a
temporary halt.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Asean leaders fear effects of Soviet collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH-EAST Asian leaders, meeting at their first summit since 1987,
yesterday welcomed the end of the Cold War but expressed foreboding about
the probable economic consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse and
remained divided on how to ensure regional security.
Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, urged the summit of the
Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) to approve a proposed Asean
free trade area and so enable the dynamic economies of its six member
countries to compete with central Europe for investment as the European
Community expands.
Asean might have a population of more than 300m, he said, but its combined
gross national product amounted to only about Dollars 310bn (Pounds 170bn),
compared with more than Dollars 4,000bn for the EC and about Dollars 6,000bn
for the US, Canada and Mexico. The EC population's purchasing power was 15
times and North America's 20 times that of Asean.
'Unless Asean can match the other regions in attractiveness, both as a base
for investments as well as a market for their products, investments by
multinational companies are likely to flow away from our part of the world
to the single European market and Nafta (the North American Free Trade
Area),' he said.
A common theme running through the speeches of Mr Goh and the other five
leaders - from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei -
was a fear of protectionism in Asean's main export markets and of the
emergence of potentially protectionist regional trade blocs in America and
Europe.
Although the Asean leaders want to establish a free trade area within 15
years, some of them also emphasised the need to continue nurturing ties with
their main trading partners outside south-east Asia.
Mr Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, warned that proposed
intra-Asean tariff reductions would not be easy. Asean, he said, would have
to avoid the red tape and lack of determination which undermined previous
attempts.
'In the short run, it could result in initial losses of government revenue,'
he said. 'Inefficient sectors would become vulnerable to competition.'
In a speech characteristically critical of the west, Mr Mahathir Mohammed,
prime minister of Malaysia, urged industrialised countries to help fight
tropical forest fires and to combat piracy in the Straits of Malacca instead
of attacking the environmental policies of developing nations.
He said: 'More forests can be saved by preventing forest fires or putting
them out quickly than by boycotting the export of tropical timber or
advocating that forest dwellers remain in the forest, eating monkeys and
suffering from all kinds of tropical diseases.'

power order

<TEXT>
AN international consortium including Howden Group Canada, part of the
Scottish engineering company, and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power
engineering group, has won a Dollars 770m (Pounds 425.4m) turnkey contract
to build a 1,100MW power station in western Iran.
The contract is the first important project for GEC Alsthom in Iran since
the end of the Iran/Iraq war, and one of the biggest announced in the Middle
East since the end of the Gulf war. Over the past year, Iran has been
reactivating projects in thermal and hydroelectric power generation.
GEC Alsthom said it had won 'the major part' of the contract, while Howden
said its share was Dollars 121m. Other members of the Ontario Group
consortium include Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Canada and Italy's Nuova Cimimontubi.
The project, at Arak, is for Tavanir, the Iranian electric utility.
Construction will begin later this year and the new station is due to be
fully operational by 1996. GEC Alsthom and Howden will design and supply the
turbine island.

FT  28 JAN 92 / World Trade News: BP hopeful of share in east German
refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum, recently beaten in the race for east Germany's lucrative
Minol oil company and the Leuna petrochemicals refinery by Elf-Aquitaine of
France, may yet share in the Leuna site near Merseburg.
Elf won the preliminary DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.91bn) contract to take over Minol
and build a new refinery at Leuna in a consortium with Thyssen and SB-Kauf.
But the Treuhand agency, owning virtually all the east German chemicals
industry, wants to privatise the chemicals side of Leuna, losing nearly
DM200m a year.
Mr Paul Achleitner, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, the investment
bank advising Treuhand on the sale, said chemical companies pledged to
invest at Leuna could join the Elf-led consortium and become joint owners of
the new refinery.
Treuhand is negotiating with several companies, including ENI of Italy and
OMV of Austria, and hopes to finalise a package by next June when the Elf
contract is to be signed. BP Chemicals had also sounded out interest in
building an acetic acid plant at Leuna, Treuhand said.
'BP could build it in a consortium or alone, we don't care,' Mr Klaus
Schucht, in charge of the chemical industry at Treuhand, declared. Listing
why Elf had clinched the Minol-Leuna refinery deal, he said that unlike BP,
it had guaranteed that the highly-profitable Minol service station network
would not be broken up. Elf aimed to build a new refinery at Leuna while BP
wanted to refurbish the old one. The company, partly owned by the French
Government, had a 'strategic' interest in moving eastwards while BP was more
concerned with 'short-term returns', Mr Schucht claimed.
But BP still has a say in the future of the Leuna refinery, stemming from
the joint venture it set up in 1990 with Leuna and Intrac which markets 80
per cent of the refinery's petrol and diesel oil to Minol. It also invested
DM60m in a filling terminal at Leuna for oil tank trucks.
Under a year ago, Leuna and the two other chemicals producers, Bitterfeld
and Buna, were seen as so obsolescent they could only be closed. That would
have meant the end of chemicals output in east Germany. In 1989, 130,000
people were still employed as chemical workers in the Halle-Merseburg area.
Aware that costs of 'de-industrialising' the region would exceed those of
reviving it, Bonn backed a plan to rescue the chemicals centre which will
cost Treuhand up to DM10bn in infrastructure investments.
Mr Schucht expected medium-sized German companies would locate at
Bitterfeld. Albright &amp; Wilson of the UK is negotiating to produce plant
protection agents on part of the site. He hoped enough companies would be
attracted over the next five years for the old loss-making Bitterfeld AG to
be greatly reduced.

FT  28 JAN 92 / World Trade News: 'Pots and kettles' clash in auto war -
American sales of vehicles deriving from Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE American car makers rail against Japan's Dollars 31bn (Pounds 17.1bn)
automotive trade surplus with the US, the Big Three themselves, General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler, now account for nearly a sixth of all the
Japanese-derived cars sold in the US.
Japanese makers led by Honda, Toyota and Nissan boosted their direct share
of US new car sales to 30.2 per cent in 1991 from 27.8 per cent a year
earlier. But Japanese producers' overall share of the US new car market is
significantly higher, thanks to the efforts of the US car makers.
GM, Ford and Chrysler all sell under their own badges Japanese cars - both
direct imports from Japan and cars assembled by Japanese plants in the US,
the so-called transplants - despite their increasing opposition to the level
of Japanese car sales in the US.
The Big Three's sales of Japanese-derived cars in the US totalled 473,068
last year and accounted for 16 per cent of all Japanese-related car sales in
America. Including both the Japanese makers' own car sales and
Japanese-derived cars sold by GM, Ford and Chrysler, the Japanese auto
makers captured a record 36 per cent of the US new car market last year,
against 33.5 per cent in 1990. The US car makers' marketing efforts for the
Japanese producers include:
General Motors has established a special franchise, called Geo, as part of
its Chevrolet division, for the sale of a range of Japanese-derived
products. Geo car sales totalled 265,992 last year. The Geo Prizm (a
re-badged Toyota Corolla) is produced in the US by NUMMI, the Toyota/GM
joint venture; the Geo Metro (a re-badged Suzuki Swift) by CAMI, the
Suzuki/GM joint venture in Canada (it is also imported from Japan). The
Isuzu Impulse coupe is imported from Japan and sold as the Geo Storm.
Chrysler sells several Mitsubishi Motors models under its Dodge, Plymouth
and Eagle badges. Sales last year totalled 130,781. Models such as the Dodge
Stealth (a re-badged Mitsubishi 3000 GT) are imported from Japan, while
others like the Plymouth Laser/Eagle Talon coupe (the Mitsubishi Eclipse)
are built in the US at Mitsubishi Motors' plant in Bloomington-Normal,
Illinois, a wholly-owned Mitsubishi plant (previously a joint venture with
Chrysler).
Ford sells the Ford Probe, a version of the Mazda MX-6 coupe, produced by
Mazda at its Flat Rock, Michigan, plant. Ford Probe sales totalled 76,295 in
the US last year.
Mr Richard Recchia, executive vice-president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of
America, says the US auto companies are backing legislation that would
further restrict Japanese vehicle sales in the US, while they 'not only
enjoy the benefit of selling imported vehicles, but receive vehicles from
the so-called transplant Japanese manufacturing operations. 'This has all
the earmarks of the pot calling the kettle black.' The US car makers 'view
an imported car or truck as bad, unless it's a 'captive import' sold by one
of the Big Three. Then it's good.'
MR Lee Iacocca, Chrysler chairman and leader of the US auto industry's
campaign to cut Japan's trade surplus, ignores the Big Three's own sales of
Japanese cars in his attacks on Japan. Japan has the US auto industry
'targeted and they're not about to take us out of their gunsights,' he said
on his return this month from Tokyo. 'We ship them food and chemicals and
raw materials, just like a colony. And they ship us value-added cars and
machine tools and electronics, just like a mother-country.'
While GM is being forced to cut its domestic operations drastically, the
Japanese presence in North America is still expanding. After the wave of
investment in the 1980s by Japanese vehicle makers in assembly plants in
North America (eight in the US and three in Canada), Japanese producers
accounted for 24.9 per cent of total US car output last year, increasing
their share from 21.7 per cent in 1990.
Car output by the Japanese transplants in the US (including NUMMI) increased
by 1.1 per cent to 1.33m, despite the recession in US new car sales, and in
contrast to the 11.7 per cent drop in overall US car output to 5.36m.
Japanese car production capacity in the US is being further expanded with
Toyota spending Dollars 800m to almost double its Georgetown, Kentucky,
plant to 420,000 cars a year by the end of 1993 (220,000 at present), and
Nissan spending Dollars 490m virtually to double its car and light truck
capacity at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant to 440,000 units a year by
mid-1992. The transplants' total car and light truck production capacity in
North America is planned to reach 2.7m vehicles a year by 1993/94 following
a Dollars 7.5bn investment.
Mr Bob McCurry, executive vice-president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, says
that, with the build-up of their assembly plants in North America, Japanese
car makers have achieved 'one of the largest and quickest industrial
transfers' in modern times.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UN envoy talks peace to Serbs in Croatia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS special envoy Marrack Goulding met Serb leaders from Croatia
yesterday in an attempt to persuade them to accept a UN peace plan which
provides for the withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia after the
deployment of a 10,000-strong multinational peacekeeping force.
Serb leaders in Croatia oppose the plan because they say it fails to offer
guarantees for Croatia's 600,000 Serbs.
However, Mr Goulding, who is responsible for peacekeeping operations in the
former Yugoslavia, said he was 'encouraged' after meeting Mr Goran Hadzic, a
leader from the self-proclaimed Serbian region in eastern Slavonia.
'It is possible to say that a step forward has been made. . . We all have to
do everything we can to convince the leaders of Krajina (the self-proclaimed
Serbian republic in south Croatia) that it is a. . . plan which offers the
possibility of establishing peace in Yugoslavia,' he said.
Mr Goulding later met Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president, who is a staunch
opponent of the UN peace plan, which also envisages creation of UN-protected
areas in Serb-populated regions, as well as the disarming of Serb and Croat
irregulars.
Mr Babic reaffirmed his opposition to the plan after meeting the envoy. 'The
basic objection is it treats Krajina as a part of Croatia which will be
placed under UN protection,' he said. 'This is naturally unacceptable from
our side.'
Serb insurgents, backed by the federal army, currently control a third of
Croatia.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia says he supports the UN plan but he
appears to lack control over Serb leaders from Croatia. And in a sign of
another shift in Serbian policy, Mr Ratko Markovic, a legal adviser to the
republic's government, called for Serbia to 'reactivate' its independent
status.
Politika, a Belgrade daily and mouthpiece for the Serbian government, quoted
Mr Markovic as saying: 'Serbia must elaborate its concept of an independent
state and reaffirm its recognition which exists since 1878.'
Mr Milosevic has insisted previously that Yugoslavia still exists despite
the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Serbia did not apply for
independent status or seek recognition.
Mr Goulding is due to hold talks in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, where
the truce continues generally to hold.

PILOTS at the French domestic airline Air Inter have called a 24-hour strike
for Thursday, accusing the government of jumping to conclusions about an
Airbus crash in eastern France which killed 87 people last week, Reuter
reports.
The USPNT pilots' union said the Transport Ministry had 'exonerated' the
ultra-modern Airbus A320 and, by implication, blamed the crash on pilot
error.
A preliminary report on the crash, the third involving an A320 since the
airliner entered service four years ago, is not due for a month.
The airliner is one of the fastest selling in the world.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Kohl warns CIS against military build-up: German chancellor
calls for dismantling of tactical nuclear weapons

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday warned the former Soviet republics not to
contemplate setting up new armed forces of a size which would disturb the
security balance in Europe.
It was 'senseless' for the west to provide humanitarian aid and help rebuild
the economies of former Soviet republics if at the same time they were
debating setting up forces 'which would disturb the European balance, and
tie up financial and technical resources which could be used more sensibly
in other fields'.
Mr Kohl was addressing the chiefs of the general staffs of all nine member
states of the Western European Union (WEU), who gathered for the first time
yesterday in Bonn as part of the process of building a stronger European
defence identity.
His remarks coincided yesterday with a decision by Mr Leonid Kravchuk,
Ukraine's president, to appoint three commanders loyal to the republic, in a
further step towards creating a Ukrainian national army.
The new commanders, whose predecessors refused to swear an oath of obedience
to Ukraine, will head the military districts situated in Ukraine.
The move is likely to cause consternation in Moscow where military chiefs
are strongly against dismemberment of the Red Army.
Ukraine has been largely successful in its effort to form its own army,
securing the loyalty of nearly 300,000 soldiers by the end of last week.
Mr Kohl yesterday called for the dismantling of tactical nuclear weapons in
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), successor to the Soviet Union,
and gave his backing to moves to provide peaceful occupations for former
Soviet nuclear scientists, to prevent them exporting their knowledge abroad.
David White adds: Britain said it would make concrete proposals for helping
to ensure the security of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union in
talks later this week between Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, and Marshal
Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the armed forces chief. The talks are to take place on
Thursday in London during the planned visit of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, to Britain.
Mr King said UK technical help might include containers for shipping nuclear
arms due for destruction. It was essential that weapons be made safe and
that materials from them be safeguarded. Discussions would also focus on the
future of Soviet nuclear scientists to ensure they had work and did not
become 'idle hands'.
Reuter adds from Moscow: Fighting raged in different parts of the Caucasus
yesterday, with dozens killed in one of the bloodiest battles in a
longstanding territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Armenian mission in Moscow said 45 Azeris and 15 Armenians had been
killed over the weekend in Nagorno- Karabakh.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Growth in condom sales expected to slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDOM sales in Europe should increase 25 per cent from Dollars 492m (Pounds
271.8m) in 1990 to Dollars 616m over the next five years, according to a
report* published by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market research company.
However, the rapid market growth during the late 1980s, following the first
realisation that heterosexuals were at risk from HIV, will not continue,
said the report.
The largest market in Europe for condoms remains Italy, with annual sales of
Dollars 193m. The Italian market is still growing rapidly, increasing 12 per
cent during 1990, mainly because of low usage of the pill.
West Germany is the second largest European market, where sales reached
Dollars 111m in 1990. Unification should increase the condom market since
they were not officially available in East Germany.
In the UK, condoms have overtaken the pill as the most popular form of
contraception for the first time since the 1960s. Condom sales reached
Dollars 67m in 1990.
In Spain, more than half of women between 15 and 45 do not use any form of
contraceptive. The pill remains the most popular form of birth control.
The French condom market worth Dollars 45m, is poorly developed, according
to the report.
*The European market for OTC external medication, OTC contraceptives and
home diagnostics, Frost &amp; Sullivan, 071 730 3343.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Record exports boost hopes for economic revival: Stronger
pound increases speculation over interest rate cut ahead of Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government was yesterday given fresh heart on the economy with
news of record exports in the final quarter of last year.
Indications that UK exporters are continuing to find sales opportunities in
a fragile world economy helped sentiment on the London stock market, where
shares ended firmly higher.
A strengthening of sterling against a weak D-Mark also in-creased
speculation that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might find room to cut
in-terest rates before the Budget on March 10 in a move which would help the
government's general election chances.
The developments gave Mr Lamont, who in recent weeks has been troubled by a
weak pound and signs of continuing deep recession, his most heartening day
on the economic front since Christmas.
According to the Central Statistical Office, export volumes in the three
months to December were up 0.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter,
and 3 per cent higher than in the same period in 1990.
Last month, exports grew in value by 2 1/2 per cent compared with November
to Pounds 9bn, while imports stayed little changed at Pounds 9.6bn.
According to the CSO, the total deficit on the current account last month
came out at Pounds 388m, as against expectations in the City of a Pounds
500m deficit. In November, the figure was Pounds 630m.
The figures helped to buoy the stock market, where the FT-SE 100 index of
leading shares closed below the day's highs at 2,539.9, up 29.5. On currency
markets, the pound climbed three-quarters of a pfennig against the D-Mark,
closing in London at DM2.8725. In New York yesterday evening it was slightly
up at DM2.8737.
Sterling remains only about a  1/2 pfennig above its theoretical floor in
the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) against the peseta, the strongest
currency in the system. But it is far enough away from its D-Mark 'lower
floor' of DM2.78 for the government soon to start contemplating the
possibility of a reduction in base rates. These have been stuck at 10.5 per
cent for nearly five months, during which many politicians and
industrialists have called for new cuts in borrowing costs to aid the
recovery.
The good performance by UK exporters during 1991 was a big factor behind a
fall in the current-account deficit for the whole of 1991 to Pounds 5.8bn,
from Pounds 15.2bn in 1990. In the government's Autumn Statement in
November, Mr Lamont had predicted a deficit of Pounds 6.5bn. Also
contributing to the cut in the overall deficit was a sharp drop in imports,
caused by low demand due to the recession. Although the CSO said import
volumes between the third and fourth quarters of 1991 were virtually flat -
providing little evidence that faint stirrings of recovery were stoking
increased demand for imports - yesterday's figures encouraged hopes that
good export growth during 1992 will aid the UK economy.
Despite signs of a puncturing of the general gloom about the economy over
the past month, many investors remain cautious about the short-term outlook.
Today's quarterly report on industrial trends by the Confederation of
British Industry is expected to paint a downbeat picture of prospects over
the next few months.
While the Treasury said the export figures were 'quite en-couraging', the
government's political opponents took the chance to highlight the size of
the trade deficit, which Labour and the Liberal Democrats took as a measure
of underlying economic weakness.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said Britain was
still firmly stuck in recession, while the Liberal Democrats said: 'An
end-of-year deficit of (nearly) Pounds 6bn during the deepest recession
Britain has experienced since the war is disgraceful.'

FT  28 JAN 92 / Yeltsin leaves Moscow after cancelling engagements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yelt-sin cancelled all engagements for yesterday and
today and has abruptly left Moscow on what his aides described variously as
'domestic business' and the need to prepare for a visit to Britain and the
US later in the week.
Speculation that he might be ill - following recent reports of heart
problems - was strongly denied by Mr Pavel Voshchanov, his press spokesman,
who said: 'The president is absolutely healthy and in excellent shape.'
Mr Yeltsin's whereabouts were not made known, though officials promised a
statement today. Senior Russian government officials said last night they
had been given no further information. However, western diplomats said they
were reassured by news that his foreign trip would go ahead.
Although it was not being suggested that his absence had any more ominous
political explanation, the haste of Mr Yeltsin's departure was, if nothing
else, being viewed last night as having been poorly handled in diplomatic
terms.
Japanese officials were told on Sunday that a meeting scheduled for
yesterday with Mr Michio Watanabe, their foreign minister, had been
cancelled without a new date being set. Mr Seiji Morimoto, a the Japanese
Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: 'We were told that a meeting on Monday was
impossible, and that perhaps the meeting would be possible at another time.'
Japanese press reports yesterday had quoted unnamed officials close to Mr
Yeltsin as saying he had a heart ailment. However, a Yeltsin aide told
Japan's Kyodo news service he was suffering from a cold. Mr Yeltsin had also
been due to attend the opening of the Middle East talks today.
His planned trip to the UK on Thursday to meet Mr John Major, the prime
minister, and to New York for the United Nations Security Council summit on
Friday, was said yesterday by Russian and British officials to be still on
course. He is due to spend Saturday - his 61st birthday  - at Camp David
with US president George Bush.
In recent weeks, Mr Yeltsin has travelled to the Urals, the Volga region, St
Petersburg and Ryazan for speeches and to meet workers and shoppers - trips
which saw him heckled for the first time since becoming president.
He has been under growing pressure from former close allies such as Mr
Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, for insisting on price
liberalisation.

FT  28 JAN 92 / PM hails Citizen's Charter progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister yesterday took the general election campaign on to
Labour's traditional territory with a pledge to put the improvement of the
public services such as health and education at the heart of his
government's programme.
Addressing a conference in London, Mr John Major presented an upbeat
assessment of the progress in implementing the Citizen's Charter as a
'blueprint to deliver higher standards' across the public services.
He announced details of two measures to strengthen the charter's drive to
improve services: the chartermark, an award for excellence in the public
services; and a new telephone helpline - the Charterline - to provide
information to the public on the charter.
Labour denounced the initiatives as electioneering. Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader, said: 'When the government promises better services without
better investment they simply show what a confidence trick they are trying
to pull.'
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, attacked the charter as
'an excuse to spend taxpayers' money on party political advertising'.
Government departments have so far spent more than Pounds 5m on promoting
the charter and the Citizen's Charter unit in the Cabinet Office has a
budget of Pounds 850,000.
Mr Major told a conference of senior executives in the public sector and
privatised industries that although the Citizen's Charter was only six
months old, its effects were building fast. Among the improvements in public
service which had resulted were:
guaranteed maximum waiting times for NHS operations, with individual
appointments for outpatients;
annual reports for schoolchildren, and league tables of performance
indicators for schools;
more flexible opening hours for tax offices, Jobcentres, benefits offices
and driving test centres.
'Too often the public are treated as if they were the lucky recipients of a
free service,' Mr Major said. 'They are entitled to be treated as
creditworthy customers who've paid in advance.'
He outlined plans to strengthen the inspection of services such as police,
social work and probation by including 'outsiders such as professionals,
users, commonsense citizens' in their inspectorates.
The prime minister urged local authorities to seek out ways of helping
businesses which find that different authorities apply the same laws in
different ways. A business that gained approval from one authority should
know it was valid for others, he said.
The chartermark will be awarded to 50 organisations a year.
Schools, hospitals, agencies and local authority services will be eligible
for an award, which can be displayed on products and stationery for up to
three years. Applications for the 1992 awards, to be announced in September,
must be submitted by the end of June.
Earlier, the Benefits Agency launched a Customer Charter for some 20m people
who receive social security benefits. Mr Michael Bichard, its chief
executive, said a survey would be commissioned later in the year to check on
progress.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Hachette-Matra merger plan outlined by chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to merge the Hachette publishing group and Matra, the missiles and
electronics maker, was outlined yesterday by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the
chairman of both companies.
'I am reflecting today on integrated financial structures which could unify
the group without weakening control over it,' Mr Lagardere told La Tribune
de l'Expansion, a French newspaper.
The plan, designed to allow cash to flow more freely between the two French
companies, received a sceptical response from analysts, who argued that it
produced few clear benefits apart from making both companies perhaps more
resistant to hostile takeover than they already are. Both are majority
controlled by Mr Lagardere and shareholders loyal to him.
The scheme would create a group with FFr54.3bn (Pounds 5.55bn) sales and
FFr1.1bn net profits based on their 1990 accounts, which showed group net
profits of FFr492m on turnover of FFr30bn for Hachette and FFr606m of
profits on sales of FFr24.3bn for Matra.
However, Hachette swung into loss in the first half of last year and faces
heavy losses at La Cinq, its 25 per cent owned television station, which is
seeking a rescue after filing for bankruptcy.
Matra announced a steep profits decline over the same period, hit by falling
demand for defence and telecommunications products.
'In these businesses, continuity, independence and long-term strategy are
indispensable and one cannot build in the fear of a hostile bid,' said Mr
Lagardere.
Once La Cinq's problems were settled, both companies would be very
profitable, he said. 'The objective is not to cover the possible losses of
one by the profits of the other, but to allow cash flow to circulate to
invest in the most promising domains,' Mr Lagardere explained.
Officials at Hachette and Matra made it clear that there was no timetable
and that the project was in its initial stages.
Mr Lagardere pointed out that Hachette's share of La Cinq's expected
FFr1.12bn losses for last year would be covered by the FFr2.5bn profit from
the sale by Hachette of the Paris headquarters of its NMPP press
distribution company.
Mr Lagardere described Hachette and Matra as a 'two-headed eagle' and argued
that they had been unable to draw the benefit of belonging to the same
group.
He bought a stake in Hachette in 1980, and wanted to merge it with Matra at
the time. But Matra was nationalised a year later by the first Socialist
government, to be privatised again by the Gaullist administration in 1987.
Today, Hachette and Matra are linked through Mr Lagardere's private holding
group, MMB, the ultimate owner of controlling stakes in both.

FT  28 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Acceptance of letter of credit completes oil
rig transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVY OFFSHORE LTD v EMERALD FIELD CONTRACTING LTD Queen's Bench Division
(Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: January 21 1992
TITLE TO North Sea oil equipment transferred under a supply contract which
provides for completion on payment by letter of credit, passes when the
credit is drawn on the accepting bank on tender of contractually specified
documents, irrespective of any time lapse between draw-down and actual
delivery of cash.
Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when giving judgment for the plaintiff supplier,
Davy Offshore Ltd, on its claim against Emerald Field Contracting Ltd under
a sub-contract for the supply of oil field equipment.
HIS LORDSHIP said that Emerald was a contractor under agreements to supply
equipment and services to licensees of the right to explore and extract oil
from the Emerald Oil Field in the North Sea.
In order to fulfil its contractual obligations it entered into a supply
contract dated November 30 1988 with Davy Offshore.
Davy agreed to supply Emerald with a floating production facility and single
point mooring system (FPF).
The overall structure of the contract provided for phases of the work and
the provision of certificates. At the completion certificate stage the FPF
would be towed to the field and handed over to Emerald.
Originally completion was to be August 5 1990 but work was delayed and would
not be finished until summer 1992.
Clause 18.1(a) of the contract provided that title to the work and
facilities should be transferred to Emerald 'immediately upon completion and
payment of the amount due . . . at completion as referred to in clause
17.2'.
By clause 18.1(b) Davy warranted that at time of transfer and vesting of
title, the work and facilities would be free of all mortgages, liens or
other encumbrances; and by 18.1(c) it agreed that at time of transfer it
would deliver to Emerald a duly executed bill of sale in British form
(statutory form 10A) in respect of the FPF, reflecting the warranty.
The contract and the form therefore contemplated that by the time of
transfer of title, consideration for transfer would have been paid, and all
mortgages and other charges would have been paid off.
Clause 17.2 provided that on completion Emerald should pay Davy 95 per cent
of the contract price, the 5 per cent balance to be paid three months and
five banking days after completion.
Clause 17.5 of the contract provided that Emerald's obligation to pay under
clause 17.2 might be satisfied by Davey drawing under a letter of credit.
Accordingly, for the purposes of clauses 17.2 and 18.1, the moment of
payment was when the bank accepted documents tendered.
Under the letter of credit, Davy would not receive the money until five
business days after the relevant documents had been received by the bank.
Thus there was a time lapse between date of draw-down under the letter of
credit and actual delivery of cash.
The documents Davy was required to produce were the first qualifying
certificate together with documents referred to in it.
Others to be tendered at the same time corresponded to documents referred to
in clause 36 of the contract. They included the completion certificate, a
bill of sale in British form, the final stage certificate, and a 'section 10
certificate' from the secretary of state for trade and industry confirming
that all conditions of the guarantee issued under section 10 of the Industry
Act 1972 had been satisfied or waived.
The scheme of clause 36.3.1 was clear. There had to be satisfactory
completion or works and facilities. Davy had to produce to Emerald the
various listed documents. Implicitly, Emerald had to be satisfied that they
complied with the requirements of the contract. It then had to issue the
completion certificate, countersign the final stage certificate and obtain a
section 10 certificate. It would return all the documents to Davy, which
would present them to the bank under the letter of credit.
Davy submitted that title in the FPF did not pass until it had drawn on the
letter of credit, because until it had done so payment under clause 17.2 of
'all that is due . . . at completion' would not have been made.
Emerald said the amount due at completion did not include sums payable under
the letter of credit, since they were only to be paid after completion - it
only included cash payments to be made at time of completion. It said that
under clause 36.3.1 completion occurred when the documents to be provided by
Davy were received by Emerald, and at that time sums were not payable under
the letter of credit.
The significance of the arguments derived from the fact that if Davy did not
receive the 95 per cent before parting with title of the FPF, it might well
receive only part of what would be owing to it; and from the fact that
Emerald was going to be in very real difficulties in procuring the section
10 certificate.
The contractual intention as to the point at which title should pass was
clear.
The starting point was clause 18.1(a).
That was an express clause dealing specifically with the passing of title.
Title was not to pass until 'completion and payment of the amount due . . .
at completion as referred to in clause 17.2'. Both conditions must be
satisfied.
Clause 17.2 required Emerald to pay Davy the 95 per cent on completion and
contained an express cross-reference to clause 17.5. Clause 17.5 expressly
provided that the obligation to pay the 95 per cent might 'be satisfied by
the contractor drawing under' the letter of credit.
It followed that until Davy had so drawn payment had not been made.
Payment of the cash by the bank was to be postponed for five working days
after presentation and acceptance of documents. Acceptance crystallised the
bank's liability and rendered it unconditional. The bank's accrued
obligation to pay under the letter of credit was clearly intended to satisfy
Emerald's obligation to pay.
It followed that it was Davy's drawing under the letter of credit that
satisfied (in the present context) the second condition to the passing of
title in clause 18.1(a).
It also followed that performance by Emerald of those of its obligations
necessary to enable Davy to draw under the letter of credit were indirectly
conditions of the passing of title and that, failing putting Davy into a
position where it could draw under the letter of credit, the only way
Emerald could perform the second condition to the passing of title would be
by making an actual cash payment.
That conclusion was confirmed by clause 36.3.
Prior to completion, Davy, besides finishing the relevant work, had to
provide Emerald with the various documents listed in 36.3.1.
If those documents complied with the contract, completion 'shall occur'. But
that was not the end of it. Emerald had to perform the three stated
obligations and 'return all such documents forthwith' to Davy.
That showed the bill of sale and other documents were not given to Emerald
without qualification, but simply for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy
itself that they met contractual requirements and return them to Davy.
The intention of the contract was clear, and was consistent with the natural
meaning of the words used in clause 18.1(a). Emerald's arguments to the
contrary were mistaken.
The obligation to provide the section 10 certificate was an indirect
condition of the passing of title. It was a condition that arose at
completion.
In June 1991, after the contract had run into difficulties, causing
financial problems for the parties and their backers, a 'settlement
agreement' was negotiated. Under clause 17 it was agreed '(a) subject to the
provisions of sub-clause (b)' that repayment to Davy of sums outstanding at
completion should be deferred. Sub-clause (b) provided that 'the provisions
of sub-clause (a) above shall not apply to any letter of credit issued to
Davy in relation to the prime contract'.
That could only be sensibly construed as leaving intact Davy's right to be
paid in so far as it involved payments under letters of credit.
Judgment for Davy.
For Davy: Lord Irvine QC, Edwin Glasgow QC, Richard Wilmot-Smith, and Stuart
Catchpole (Ashurst Morris Crisp).
For Emerald: John Dyson QC and Mark Templeman (Watson, Farley &amp; Williams).

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Royal's US gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The hunt is on for a new boss for the ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND's US banking
business following the announcement that George Graboys is retiring as
president and chief executive of the Royal Bank's Rhode Island-based
subsidiary - Citizens Financial Group.
Graboys, who has headed Citizens for the last decade, is the latest in a
series of top level retirements at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. It is
just over a year since George Younger took over from Sir Michael Herries, as
chairman, and earlier this month George Mathewson replaced Charles Winter as
group chief executive.
Picking the right replacement for Graboys, who has overseen a five-fold
growth in Citizens' assets to Dollars 4bn, is important because so many UK
banks have run into difficulties in the US banking market. Under Graboys,
Citizens has remained profitable throughout the deep US recession and
remains one of the best-capitalised banks.
Although Herbert Cummings, an executive vice president of Citizens Financial
and Kenneth Hogberg, the chief financial officer, are potential candidates
for the top job, it is likely that the successor will come from outside the
bank.
Graboys is to retire in December when he will have reached the age of 60.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unilever's heir apparent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Perry is to succeed Sir Michael Angus as chairman of the British
half of Unilever in May, one of a number of top management appointments at
the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group.
Perry has been Sir Michael's heir apparent since last May when he was named
a vice chairman of Unilever PLC and a member of the three-man Special
Committee, the group's most powerful executive authority.
Like Sir Michael, Perry, who turns 58 next month, has spent his entire
working life with Unilever. However, his career as a manager has spanned a
wider range of geographical and business assignments.
After joining Lever Brothers, the group's UK detergents business, as a
management several years working on detergents and personal products in the
Netherlands before becoming marketing director of Lever Brothers in Thailand
in 1968.
Following a period in London, he returned to Thailand in 1973 as chairman of
Levers. He then went to Argentina and Japan before returning again to the
UK. In 1987, he was put in charge of Unilever's personal products business
and marketing division.
Sir Michael Angus' place on the Special Committee will be filled by Morris
Tabaksblat, chairman of Unilever's Food Executive, who also becomes a vice
chairman of Unilever NV This puts him in line to succeed Floris Maljers as
chairman of Unilever NV
Unilever also named Roy Brown, managing director of Lever Brothers UK, and
Clive Butler, a senior manager of the Food Executive, as main board
directors. Mr Patrick Egan, a director for 14 years, will step down in May.

FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats in thin
trading as G7 fails to excite
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES retreated in thin trading yesterday, as volume on the first
section fell to 137m shares due to the lack of fresh news, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 65.04 to 21,007.11 after a day's high of 21,078.87
and low of 20,859.61. The index fell below 21,000 just before the morning
close on light selling.
Trading volume reached its lowest level since December 9. Declines led
advances by 604 to 322 with 195 issues unchanged. A total of 100 stocks fell
to their lowest levels since the beginning of last year. The Topix index of
all first section shares shed 10.39 to 1,574.47, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.89 to 1,210.93.
Market participants, hoping that the outcome of the Group of Seven finance
ministers' meeting would fuel trading, were disappointed. 'Investors will
neither buy nor sell at current levels,' said one trader.
However, some analysts see the current low volumes as a positive signal for
the market. Mr Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'The inactivity
reflects a stall in fund flows, indicating that money has stopped leaving
the market.' In the week ending January 17 individuals and corporate
investors, who have been net sellers of equity during the past year, became
net buyers.
Foreign investors, who were aggressive buyers last year, are also expected
to commit further funds into Japanese stocks. 'Foreigners' asset weightings
in Japanese stocks are still light,' said Mr Paul Muller at Schroder
Securities.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y13,000 to an all-time low of
Y682,000. Some investors have been discouraged by reports of cuts in long
distance telephone rates. Market participants are also worried about an
over-supply of shares, as the Ministry of Finance has included proceeds from
the sale of 500,000 shares for the year ending March 1993 into the fiscal
budget.
International blue chips, firm on foreign interest last week, lost ground on
light profit-taking. TDK retreated Y200 to Y4,450 and NEC Y10 to Y1,150.
However, some bargain hunting lifted Fujitsu Y3 to Y790 and Sony Y40 to
Y4,240.
Kirin Brewery rose Y10 to Y1,280. The company expects earnings for the
current year to reach Y85bn thanks to rising beer sales.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 122.48 down at 22,502.91 in volume of 41.4m
shares. Machineries and high-technology issues declined, while some domestic
demand-related issues held firm.
Roundup
PROFIT taking in Hong Kong was the outstanding feature in the region
yesterday. Australia was closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG saw profits taken again, the Hang Seng index losing 45.35 to
4,554.73 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.02bn to a still-active HKDollars
2.05bn. Utilities suffered the session's biggest falls, followed by banks.
Some fund managers were keen to realise profits before next week's Chinese
New Year holiday, which will close the market for three days. Volume was
diminished by nervousness ahead of the State of the Union address tonight by
President George Bush.
SEOUL ended higher on renewed expectations of improved relations between
North and South Korea. The composite index gained 10.82 to 675.11 in
turnover of Won537.9bn, after Won541.1bn.
Reports that North Korean leaders had agreed to set up joint ventures with
South Korean companies boosted construction and trade-related issues.
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, the nation's largest construction
company, advanced by its upper limit of Won800 to Won15,800.
NEW ZEALAND saw some block trades, but trading was depleted by holidays in
Auckland and in Australia, where most local blue-chip issues are also
listed. The NZSE-40 Index improved 5.68 to 1,487.02 after a fall of 1.6 per
cent last week. Turnover increased from Friday's NZDollars 20.8m to
NZDollars 24.7m.
White goods manufacturer Fisher and Paykel topped the actives list with 2.3m
shares traded and closed steady at NZDollars 2.10 after London-based fund
manager Morgan Stanley Asset Management said it had raised its stake in F &amp;
P from 17.4 to to 19.4 per cent.
SINGAPORE closed mixed in quiet trading. The Straits Times Industrial index
put on 3.60 to 1,545.92 in thin turnover of SDollars 114.1m (SDollars
127.2m). Trading in KUALA LUMPUR was also dull, the composite index rising
1.77 to 570.55 in turnover of MDollars 66.7m (MDollars 75.5m).
MANILA extended its recent downward correction, the composite index sliding
10.48 to 1,268.20 as profit-takers reacted to President Corazon Aquino's
endorsement of Mr Fidel Ramos, her former defence secretary, as a candidate
to succeed her in the May presidential elections. Combined turnover on
Manila's two bourses was down from 187.5m pesos to 150.4m pesos.
TAIWAN focused on small companies as the weighted index climbed 42.50 to
5,341.49, after a rise of 55.39 on Saturday. Turnover expanded from TDollars
55.6bn to TDollars 60.9bn. Observers said the index was boosted mainly by
strength in cements and financials, most of which have been lagging.
BANGKOK suffered its biggest one-day loss in two months on heavy
profit-taking in finance and property issues. The SET index finished 9.70
off at 771.93 after turnover of Bt8.17bn.
BOMBAY rose on speculative buying, the BSE index ending 32.78 ahead at
2,172.11 after a day's high of 2,181.35.

FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: China factor behind Hong Kong's rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'China factor' gave momentum to Hong Kong's record-breaking advance last
week, on reports, later denied by the Chinese authorities, that charges
against the former Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang had been dropped.
Investors pulled back on Friday and, indeed, again yesterday, but this
profit-taking was still perceived to reflect a general rally ahead of the
Chinese New Year next Tuesday.
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity comments that the China factor was very
strong, backed by news from the mainland that China was looking to speed up
reforms with further economic liberalisation to promote growth. This was
particularly welcomed by the market since most of China's exports go through
the colony.
However, further profit-taking was expected to be in evidence this week as
money is taken out of the market prior to the new year celebrations, during
which factories will close for a two-week holiday.
Australia recorded the largest fall on the Pacific Rim, with the bond market
particularly sensitive to concern that interest rates might not continue to
come down.
The markets are also nervous about the fiscal package which the Keating
government is due to unveil in late February or early in March. Australian
interest rates remain high, although some analysts feel that they could come
back. Quarterly inflation figures are due to be published tomorrow.
Europe remained generally flat. The biggest changes were seen in Norway and
Finland which reversed the strength of the week before as they recorded
falls of 5.9 and 3.3 per cent respectively.
Norway was hit by news that Norsk Hydro, which accounts for 22 per cent of
Oslo's equity market capitalisation, was taking a special charge in the
fourth quarter.
Analysts note that Finland has started to drift back after the new year
spree of bargain hunting, and that investors are beginning to focus on
preliminary results which will start to come out in March.

FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses move up as Volvo's
strategy comes under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKETMAKERS saw buying from domestic sources as bourses, by and large,
improved yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT broadened its switch to cyclical stocks as opinion spread that a
steel strike need not necessarily be bad for the industry, or for the German
economy.
Goldman Sachs yesterday decided to move German equities from underweight to
market weight, advancing four reasons:
valuation, given the rally in German bonds and the underperformance of its
equity market last year;
the probability that the Bundesbank will lower interest rates this year;
its expectation of GNP growth, and inflation, of 2.5 per cent and about 3
per cent respectively in 1993; and
'distinct signs' of improvement in the east.
Chemicals, steels and engineers did well as the FAZ index rose 6.67 to
684.20 at midsession, and the DAX closed 18.81 higher at 1,683.58, close to
the top of its 1992 trading range. Volume was thought to have risen from
Friday's DM5bn.
In carmakers, Volkswagen jumped DM11 to DM333.50 after an MM Warburg
recommendation. VW is up 16 per cent from this year's low.
PARIS opened the February account in optimistic mood but turnover was
disappointing at FFr1.85bn after Friday's FFr2.2bn. The CAC 40 index rose
19.35 to 1,869.27.
Euro Disney was the day's most active stock as it rose FFr4.80 to FFr146.50
on a favourable interview with a senior company official by a US news
agency.
Eurotunnel was one of the day's biggest gainers as it picked up FFr2.85 or
6.6 per cent to FFr46 on the back of the 'easy money' argument and buy
recommendations from Paribas and French financial newspapers. The UK broker
Charterhouse has recommended a switch out of P &amp; O and into Eurotunnel.
Profit-taking wiped FFr16 off the oil refiner Total to FFr1,047 in spite of
a pleasing 41 per cent rise in 1991 net attributable profit.
MILAN traded quietly ahead of Fiat's preliminary 1991 results which are due
this afternoon. The Comit index fell 1.42 to 547.68 in turnover estimated at
slightly below Friday's L102bn.
Analysts said the market had already discounted disappointing figures from
Fiat and was instead waiting for the company's view on 1992, which some
expected to be on the cautious side. The stock eased L25 to L5,170.
In the insurance sector, Generali added L10 to L31,210 while Ras rose L55 to
L21,600. In a report on the non-life insurers issued late last week, Nomura
advised selective profit-taking because in its view, the sector is due for a
period of underperformance.
Among smaller stocks trading in ABB Tecnomasio, the mechanical engineering
group, was delayed because of an order imbalance following news that its
parent company was buying in the outstanding 9.23 per cent at L3,100 a
share. The share later jumped L528 or 21 per cent to L3,043.
OSLO recovered a little, the all-share index gaining 9.38 at 453.00. Norsk
Hydro rose NKr5.5 to NKr151. Higher prices for North Sea oil pushed Saga
Petroleum free shares up NKr6.5 to NKr97.5. HELSINKI rose 1.66 per cent on
strong demand for industrials, the Hex index adding 14.3 at 873.9 in
turnover of FM30.1m.
AMSTERDAM remained quiet, the CBS Tendency adding just 0.7 to 121.4.
Turnover was thin. There was increased demand for cyclicals, such as the
chemical groups, DSM and Akzo: DSM gained Fl 1.60 to Fl 105.30 and Akzo Fl
1.20 to Fl 138.60. The announcement of appointments to Nedlloyd's
supervisory board, expected today, was being awaited, analysts said.
MADRID's general index rose 2.25 to 253.41 with interest in both Endesa and
Repsol stocks. Endesa put on Pta115 to Pta3,215 and Repsol rose Pta50 to
Pta2,975. Telefonica fell Pta10 to Pta1,180 on news that its dividend would
remain unchanged.
ISTANBUL rose 1.8 per cent on active buying following the favourable results
from the Social Democrat Populist Party's weekend congress. The 75-share
index gained 90.68 to 5,112.74.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKHOLM decided that there was scant logic in the proposed merger between
Volvo and Procordia. The Swedish Shareholders Association, which represents
80,000 private investors, said the proposal was 'probably a bad deal for
shareholders in both companies'.
Volvo free Bs initially rose SKr27 to SKr420 but closed only SKr5 up at
SKr398, while Procordia free Bs fell SKr14 to SKr198. The Affarsvarlden
General index rose 2.60 to 987.30 in turnover of SKr611m after SKr632m.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile plans Dollars 430m boost
for copper production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CODELCO, THE state-owned Chilean Copper Corporation, is raising its
investment budget by 16 per cent to Dollars 430m this year to develop new
ore bodies and reduce toxic emissions at its ageing smelters. The budget
increase marks an important victory for Codelco, which lobbied a reluctant
government for more funds to maintain its position as the world's biggest
copper producer.
'The importance of this year's budget is that it sets a benchmark for future
years,' Mr Ignacio Guerrero, Codelco's financial vice-president, said
yesterday. Investment levels of the past two years - Dollars 330m in 1990
and Dollars 370m in 1991 - were not sufficient to combat falling output and
declining ore grades at Codelco's ageing mines.
About half of this year's investment budget would go towards prospecting and
developing new ore bodies, Mr Guerrero said. Another 20 per cent would be
channelled towards environmental protection. Chuquicamata, the vast copper
complex in the Atacama desert, would get a new sulphuric acid plant that
will absorb noxious sulphur dioxide emissions. Smelters at Potrerillos and
Caletones were also scheduled for overhaul.
Codelco plans to start exploiting low-grade copper sulphides at Chuquicamata
and at two other mining divisions, Salvador and El Teniente. In the
mid-1990s, a new mine to the north of Chuquicamata, recently christened
Radomiro Tomic, is scheduled to come on stream. Productive capacity at
Codelco's smallest division, Andina, is also being expanded.
The company hopes that these new projects will reverse the trend of
declining output of the past two years. It produced 1.12m tonnes of refined
copper in 1991, down from a peak of 1.24m tonnes in 1989.
However, most of Chile's increased copper production in the 1990s will come
from large private sector projects under construction. The latest of these
was announced yesterday by Rio Algom. The Canadian mining company said
Chile's foreign investment committee had approved its plans to develop the
Dollars 290m Cerro Colorado mine in the Atacama desert.
Rio Algom plans to bring the mine into production by late-1994. Cerro
Colorado's reserves of 79m tonnes, with an average ore grade of 1.39 per
cent copper, will be sufficient to produce 40,000 tonnes a year of high
quality copper cathodes over the mine's 23-year life.

<TEXT>
A MAJOR Russian gold producing company is threatening to strike unless the
government raises the price it pays for gold and meets other demands,
according to Tass news agency, reports Reuter from Moscow.
The independent Interfax news agency said the far eastern company, Yakutia
Gold, had already decided to hold a two-week-warning strike on January 28
and planned further industrial action on February 10. Tass did not mention
the warning strike at the state-owned company, which it said accounted for
about 15 per cent of Russian gold output, officially estimated at about 150
tonnes in 1991.
Yakutia Gold, which has three refineries, will strike from February 9 if
urgent measures are not taken to haul the industry out of crisis, Tass
quoted Mr Taras Desyatkin, the general director, as saying. He said
Yakutia's gold producers were 'on the brink of catastrophe' as a result of
heavy taxes, low gold prices and sharply rising prices for equipment and
other goods.
'Closing the enterprises in February, in his opinion, is the only way to
influence the government,' Tass said.
Mr Desyatkin called on the government to review the producer price for gold,
bring it up to world market levels, change existing tax policies and fulfil
other obligations to workers.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indians want to double sugar
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN sugar mill industry wants the government to authorise exports
totalling 1m tonnes on the world market this year, up from 525,000 tonnes in
1991.
At prevailing world prices the sales would be at a loss but the industry is
keen to maximise exports because of expected oversupply throughout the year,
according to Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for the Indian Sugar Mills
Association. Last year's exports left the industry with a loss of about
Rs450m (Pounds 9.7m) and this year's will be at a minimum loss of Rs160 a
quintal (100 kg).
The government, facing a serious balance of payments crisis, is likely to
accede to the industry's request. It has , however, turned down a suggestion
to create a buffer stock of 1m tonnes, claiming it does not have the money
to finance it.
Whatever happens the sugar mills, which in 1991 lost more than Rs7bn, will
fare even worse in the current year. According to Mr Dhanuka, the industry
is moving deeper into the red because of the unscientific pricing policy for
sugar-cane and the high percentage of sugar the mills are required to sell
to the government at much below production costs for distribution through
'fair price' shops.
Every year the federal government lays down the statutory minimum price for
cane, which forms the basis of the levy sugar price. For the 1991-92
(October-September) season the minimum cane price is Rs26 a quintal, based
on a sugar yield of 8.5 per cent. But the states, seeking to placate the
powerful cane growers' lobby, are forcing the mills to pay up to Rs16 a
quintal more. The mills are supposed to make sufficient profit from the sale
of 55 per cent of sugar production in the open market to compensate for the
loss incurred on the 45 per cent levy portion. But they are realising a
little over Rs700 a quintal, compared with the break-even price of Rs970a
quintal.
Because of these poor returns, the mills are not able to clear their cane
bills. By April, the problem will be assuming threatening proportions when
cane arrears are likely to be exceed Rs7bn. At one point last season the
uncleared cane bills amounted to Rs3.5bn. About Rs1bn from the last season's
arrears has been brought forward into the current year.
The farmers, furious with the mills for their failure to clear their bills,
have in many places destroyed the ratoon (autumn crop), otherwise sugar
production in the current season could easily have reached 13m tonnes,
instead of equalling last season's 12m tonnes, as is expected.
Mr Dhanuka does not rule out the possibility of large scale diversion of
land from sugar-cane to other crops.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemen's oil-fired optimism -
Bidding has been intense for exploration rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW DISCOVERIES of oil, gas and precious metals are leading the way to
brighter economic prospects in Yemen, long considered one of the world's
least developed countries. Precise estimates of the country's potential have
yet to be determined, but experts are enthusiastic about initial signs.
Exploration rights have been purchased by 18 oil companies over the past
year and one of them, Canadian Occidental, has already reported a major
find. Located at Masila, in southern Yemen, the new field was early this
month declared commercially viable, with total reserves at 550m barrels, of
which 235m barrels are recoverable.
Can-Oxy plans to start production in mid-1993 after an accelerated programme
of development.
With exploration still in the early stages experts are wary of making
precise predictions about Yemen's oil potential. But most agree that the
country will be able to produce about 1m b/d in the foreseeable future.
Though Yemen's first commercial strike was in the north, most exploration is
now concentrated in the south, particularly around Shabwa in the Hadramaut
Valley. Oil companies had long suspected that there were considerable
reserves there, but concession rights in the former Marxist state were
dominated by the Soviet Union.
Unification of North and South Yemen in May 1990 opened the way for western
companies and the new Yemen government has been quick to capitalise on the
competition, selling rights this year alone for an estimated Dollars 700m.
Oil executives say that competition for concessions has been intense and
that the bidding for rights has been unusually high. But they point out the
potential rewards. Yemen's oil is said to be first-rate, with a low sulphur
content and a high ratio of associated gas. Comparable in quality to Arabian
light crude, Yemen's oil is said to require little refining and so may
attract premium prices on the world market.
While optimistic about Yemen's potential, oil executives nonetheless state
that full commercial production is still several years away. Apart from
seismological work, exploratory drilling and assessment of commercial
feasibility, production can be further delayed by the nature of a site and
it surrounding terrain.
A time span of three to five years between discovery and production is
generally thought realistic. That is supported by the local experience of
the Hunt Oil Company. In July 1984 Hunt announced Yemen's first commercial
oil strike, but exports did not begin until three and a half years later.
In addition to normal preparations on the site, Hunt also had to construct a
450 km pipeline over mountainous terrain and a marine export facility at Ras
Issa on the Red Sea coast.
Apart from oil, Yemen is also reported to have immense gas reserves. Indeed,
the country is now rumoured to be sitting on top of the world's biggest gas
'bubble'.
According to industry insiders, the discovery of Yemen's gas has come as a
surprise and has led to difficulties between Hunt Oil and the Yemen
government over concession rights to the unexpected find.
Hunt officials, however, play down estimates of Yemen's gas reserves and
sharply deny any breach with the Yemen government over concession rights.
One says the two sides have now signed a joint protocol to study Yemen's gas
potential and results are expected by late February 1992.
Depending on the outcome of that study Yemen's income from gas could be
considerable, especially from its reserves of natural gas. Liquefied natural
gas is an alternative to oil in the generation of electrical power and has
potential markets throughout the industrialised world. Marketing experts are
said to be paying especial attention to Korea and Japan where LNG is used
extensively in industry.
Yemen is also said to have considerable reserves of liquid propane gas, used
for domestic purposes such as cooking and heating. Though Yemen's reserves
have some export potential, their primary use will be for domestic
consumption thus ending the country's former dependence on imported
supplies.
While oil and gas are certain to be the main sources of Yemen's mineral
wealth, exporters are also looking into its mining potential. That potential
has long been suspected and, indeed, mining experts are now using ancient
historical documents to guide their initial explorations.
Preliminary reports are so far sketchy. But in addition to traces to gold
and silver at traditional mining sites, geologists also hint at the
possibility of uranium deposits in altogether new areas of exploration. They
stress, however, that their explorations have only just begun and that much
preliminary work remains to be done before any reliable statements can be
made about Yemen's mining prospects.
Tentative as they are, these new discoveries of Yemen's potential mineral
wealth are bringing a sense of optimism to the country. Chronically one of
the world's poorest nations Yemen was especially hard-hit by the Gulf war
and for most of the past year its economy has suffered from steadily rising
inflation and unemployment. Recent times have been hard for Yemen and its
problems may continue for a while yet. But, as one oil executive put it:
'I'm bullish on the prospects'.

UNCERTAINTY IS deepening over the Brazilian position at the next
International Coffee Organisation meeting in London on 5 February. A meeting
between exporters and the Brazilian government to define a new price listing
proposal was postponed to today because of what the government referred to
as 'scheduling problems'.
The Brazilian coffee sector has been floundering for the lack of some kind
of coherent policy since its proposal (made jointly with Colombia) for the
retention of 10 per cent of production in an effort to boost prices was
rejected a few months ago by other major coffee producing nations, who felt
a better option was the revival of the International Coffee Organisation's
export quota system, suspended since July 1989.
Brazilian exporters say they are firmly against a return to any kind of
quota system.

PLATINUM'S PRICE discount against gold narrowed sharply yesterday as the
white metal led an advance at the London bullion market. The platinum price
closed at Dollars 351.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 8 from Friday, while gold
was up Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 356.15 an ounce. Silver edged up after
Friday's sharp fall, ending 1 cent to the good at 418 cents an ounce.
'Physical demand and a little speculative activity have helped the metals,'
one Zurich dealer said, adding 'the firm opening on Wall Street helped
sentiment in white metals a little'. Meanwhile a London trader suggested
that 'people are trying to trade the gold/platinum spread to flat again.' At
the London Metal Exchange aluminium prices maintained the recent bullish
sentiment. The cash price closed at a 5 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,267.50
a tonne, adding Dollars 18 to last week's Dollars 61.50 rise and taking the
rise on the year so far to Dollars 141. Dealers said the tone was aided by
an early burst of Far East buying, short-covering, options-related activity
and constructive chart patterns. But nickel continued to retreat from the
upside resistance area tested on Friday. Under profit-taking pressure the
cash price closed Dollars 105 down at Dollars 7,760 a tonne. Copper prices
bounced with cash metal gaining Pounds 33 to Pounds 1,227 a tonne.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels strives to keep farm
reform plans on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission was last night trying to keep its plans to overhaul
the Common Agricultural Policy on track in the face of attempts by several
member states to postpone decisions until the outcome of the Uruguay Round
world trade negotiations is known.
As feared, the impasse over farm subsidies within the General Agreement on
Tarifs and Trade negotiations is calling into question the European
Community's internal farm reform process, which the commission had managed
to push towards near consensus by the end of last year.
EC farm ministers broke off their meeting here last night to enter lengthy
bilateral negotiations with the Portuguese presidency of the EC and the
commission. These were expected to try to resolve by today the 'chicken and
egg' question of whether enough member states feel able to decide levels of
reduction in CAP support before the level of subsidy cuts within Gatt is
agreed.
The council meeting openned with six of the 12 - Denmark, the Netherlands,
the UK, Ireland, France and Italy - saying the Uruguay Round outcome must be
known first. Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister, first in to the bilateral
'confessionals' with the presidency and commission, said 'we must wait for a
Gatt deal and find out what it is, and then work for a CAP deal'.
The CAP reform proposed by the commission envisages sharp cuts, centred on a
35 per cent reduction in cereals support prices over three years, refunded
to farmers on the basis of average yields in the 1989-91 reference period,
thereby getting rid of the incentive to produce more grains, the main
product in the farm subsidies dispute within Gatt. Larger farmers would have
to take land out of production to get the compensation.
The agriculture chapter in the draft conclusions of the Uruguay Round,
requires a 36 per cent cut in export subsidies, a 24 per cent cut in the
volume of subsidised exports, and a 20 per cent drop in domestic support,
all over six years. Though seemingly compatible, the Gatt formula would not
allow the EC's direct compensation payments in to the 'green box' for
'neutral' subsidies, even though they are tailored to restrain production,
which would feed through into less subsidised exports which distort trade.
The commission insists it needs some recognition of this quasi-decoupled
compensation if it is to make the cuts. It also fears that some member
states now see the opportunity to play off the two negotiating processes,
thereby winning back the ground they had ceded in the CAP talks throughout
last year.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, can - his officials say -
threaten to introduce cuts without any compensation at all as part of this
year's price package, in an effort to cajole ministers and the big farm
lobbies into line.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk board launches co-op plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILK Marketing Board for England and Wales yesterday launched plans to
become a single voluntary co-operative with pooled prices.
The plans, which follow two years of painfully slow progress towards reform,
include the issue to milk producers of shares in Dairy Crest, the MMB's
wholly-owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent stake in the UK's manufactured
dairy products market.
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents dairies and processors and has
resisted any MMB attempt to keep control of Dairy Crest, said: 'This is a
major step forward. We strongly support the separation of Dairy Crest with
its shares to be directly owned by dairy farmers'.
The two sides have been locked in a stubborn contest about how the UK's
60-year-old cartel should be reformed to meet the challenge of the 1990s,
particularly the single European market.
Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the MMB, said yesterday the board would have
preferred to maintain the old scheme, amended within a European context.
However, change was inevitable, and the board's objective now was to create
a worthwhile industry that gave farmers a chance to maintain their own
destiny.
Mr Andrew Dare, a former president of the DTF who shocked the industry by
becoming an adviser to the MMB, said that shares in Dairy Crest would be
given to existing milk producers on the basis of the milk they had supplied
in the past over a given period. The shares would be tradeable among milk
producers.
The plan would give Dairy Crest clear objectives and put it on an equal
footing with competitors, he said.
The single voluntary co-op could be the strongest and most efficient
marketing organisation in Europe. It would collect milk, pool it and pay the
farmers monthly as now, as well as maintaining quality assurance.
But at the end of the day the new co-op would only survive if it met its
customers needs, Mr Dare said.
Prices, now fixed according to what the milk is used for, would be set by an
agreed pricing system 'to be discussed with the dairy trade, Maff (the
agriculture ministry) and the European Commission,' the MMB said.
Mr Steven said he would be surprised to see any legislation before the
coming election.

<TEXT>
THE World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, its private sector
finance affiliate, are reported to have been barred from issuing further
debt in the Spanish bond market.
The ban is a result of a dispute between the Spanish government and the
World Bank, according to market sources.
The argument centres on the Spanish authorities' displeasure at the low
number of construction contracts awarded to Spanish companies for World Bank
and IFC projects in less-developed countries.
Both agencies have been active borrowers in the 'Matador' bond market - the
Spanish domestic market for foreign borrowers.
But last week the Spanish Treasury, which regulates the market, refused IFC
permission to launch its planned Pta10bn five-year Matador bond issue.
Instead, the European investment Bank launched a Pta15bn 10-year deal.
Officials at the Spanish Treasury were unavailable for comment yesterday.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank, the Frankfurt-based merchant
bank, is launching an issue of profit-sharing certificates (Genusscheine)
packaged together with warrants.
The nominal value of the issue will be DM200m, although the precise amount
to be raised for the bank will not be determined until the issued is priced
ahead of the planned offer date of March 1.
Shareholders will be offered one certificate (nominal value of DM1,000) plus
warrants for every 32 ordinary shares held. Each certificate comes with two
warrants, entitling the shareholder to subscribe to one new DM50 ordinary
share at two different dates. The certificates will be redeemed on June 30
2003.
Details of the issue - the price of the certificates and the scope of the
entitlement to profit share as well as the terms of the warrants - will be
fixed and published shortly before the offer is formally launched. The
certificates and the new warrants will be traded on the Frankfurt and Berlin
stock exchanges.
The bank said it was making this issue in order to strengthen its capital
base under the terms of the German Banking Act.
'Given the sustained growth of our business volume, BHF-Bank is pursuing its
policy of maintaining its good capital base by taking early capital-raising
measures,' the bank said.
Genusscheine are a hybrid between debt and equity treated as Tier Two
Capital by the Bank for International Settlements and regular liable capital
by German regulatory authorities.

THE DRIVE to expand into the former east Germany led to a boom last year in
German mergers and acquisitions.
The number of published transactions was up by over a half to 2,172 compared
with 1,412 in 1990, according to figures produced by M&amp;A International, a
consultancy based in Konigstein.
Of the deals, 949 were done in the east, while in the west the number of
deals fell by 5 per cent, from 1,296 to 1,223. Despite the surge in the
number of deals, the total value of all domestic transactions fell to DM51bn
from DM52bn, reflecting the low prices paid for companies in the east.
Despite the activity in the east, west German companies made 246
acquisitions overseas last year, up from 186 in 1990. France was the most
popular country for German investment - the number of companies bought there
rose from 23 to 44 - followed by the UK and the US, where Germans bought 31
and 30 companies respectively.
In the other direction, foreign companies made 490 - up from 469  -
acquisitions in Germany, of which 149 were in the east. The biggest buyers
were the Americans, who bought 88 companies, followed by the Swiss with 78,
the French with 71 and the British 63. The number of Japanese purchases fell
to 17 from 19 last year.
The most active buyers in the former east Germany were the Americans, who
made 25 acquisitions there, followed by the Swiss and the French who each
made 22 purchases. M&amp;A remarks that 'only very few non-German speaking
foreigners were investing directly in that market without using already
existing west German subsidiaries'.
The Treuhandanstalt, the government agency responsible for privatising east
German industry, has recently stepped up its marketing efforts to encourage
non-German companies to buy there.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England to reduce
deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is to return Pounds 200m of interest-free deposits to
banks in the UK in the latest of a series of moves to lower its cash ratio
requirements.
The Bank said that the change was prompted by its internal financing needs
and did not reflect any change in macroeconomic policy.
Until now, banks have had to place 0.4 per cent of their sterling deposits
with the Bank in interest-free accounts. This float, currently standing at
around Pounds 1.6bn, provides the Bank's main source of income to fund its
banking operations (although not operations in the money and foreign
exchange markets).
The ratio will be reduced to 0.35 per cent on January 31, the Bank said
yesterday. It attributed the move to the increase in sterling deposits on
which the deposits are made (around 6 per cent in the past year); increased
efficiency in its own operations; and its view of how deposits will change
over the next four years. The Bank has reserved the right to increase the
ratio again at any time up to April 1986.
The Bank does not publish details of its income and expenses, but in the
year to last February made an operating profit of Pounds 161m (up from
Pounds 122m the previous year). It also has reserves of more than Pounds
800m.
The ratio was last cut a year ago, from 0.45. It had stood at 0.5 per cent
before October 1986.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: DTB introduces Dax index
future option
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German derivatives exchange, has
introduced an option on its Dax index future, its third product linked to
the Dax index of 30 German stocks.
An option on the index itself and a Dax future contract are already traded
on the exchange. Dealers said the option on the future will be more
attractive to institutions, because of its larger contract size (DM100 per
index point, like the future, compared with DM10 per point for the option on
the index) and lower fees.
In addition, the new options are American style, that is, they can be
exercised at any time.
The smaller option contract on the index is widely used by German retail
investors, with average daily volume of 38,000 contracts.
The option on the future traded 1,430 contracts in its first day of trading
on Friday, a rather slow day in the German stock market. Volume is expected
to pick up gradually, as fund managers get to grips with its more
complicated structure.
The future contract, also an institutional product, trades around 8,600
contracts a day.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: CME, LSE agree on futures
listing
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Stock Exchange have reached
an agreement to allow the CME to list futures and options on futures on the
FT-SE 100, Eurotrack 100 and Eurotrack 200 share indices.
The CME's move into foreign index products aims to attract more
institutional investors who are seeking ways to manage the risks of their
increasingly international portfolios.
According to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds, the
assets of US mutual funds that invest in Europe, for example, have more than
doubled to Dollars 3.5bn at the end of 1991, from Dollars 1.3bn at the end
of 1989. The number of funds increased over the same period to 28 from 15.
Foreign investment by US pension funds has also soared. Intersec Research,
which monitors investments by pensions funds and other tax exempt entities,
said overseas assets of US tax exempt investors rose to Dollars 93bn by
1990, of which Dollars 74bn was in equities, from Dollars 27bn, with Dollars
24bn in equities, in 1985.
The success of the CME's Nikkei 225 Japanese Stock Average future is a gauge
of the demand for foreign index products.
Launched at the end of September 1990, CME trading in the Nikkei has grown
steadily, with daily average volume rising to 976 contracts in 1991 from 765
last year. The CME had long hesitated to launch the Nikkei 225 futures for
fear that, with the differences in time zones, the lack of a concurrent cash
market in the underlying index would inhibit futures investors and traders.
But this concern has been neatly demolished with the success of the Nikkei
futures.
The new CME contracts, which will enjoy concurrent trading with the cash
market in London for a portion of the day, will require US regulatory
approval before they can be launched. But CME officials hope to begin
trading them inside four months.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has already won regulatory
approval to trade the cash market options on these indices.
The CME, the leading US futures exchange for index products, is home to the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index. It also will launch soon futures and
options in S&amp;P's MidCap 400 stock index of mid-sized companies.
The primary market for futures on the FT-SE indexes is the London
International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). For traded options it is
the London Traded Option Market (LTOM), which is due to merge with Liffe in
March.
The CME plans to work with the Options Clearing Corporation, which clears
CBOE trades, to agree on cross-margining of FT-SE futures and options
between the CME and the CBOE. The two exchanges have had an agreement on
cross margining on the S&amp;P 500 index since 1989.

ACCUMULATOR Invest, a property and investment company dominated by Mr Klaus
Riskaer Pedersen, a Danish Euro MP, went into receivership yesterday.
Mr Pedersen said he believed all creditors would be paid in full. The
collapse of the company, which had at one time made Mr Pedersen a wealthy
man, came when an attempt to reorganise the company, by excluding Mr
Pedersen from any influence over company affairs and appointing a lawyer as
chairman, came undone.
One consequence of the collapse was the immediate closure of one of the
country's oldest and most prestigious provincial newspapers, Frederiksborg
Amtsavis, which was one of a group of newspapers acquired by Mr Pedersen in
1990.

<TEXT>
MR DAVID GLEDHILL, chairman of Swire Pacific, the aviation, property and
trading group, will step down in May and will be succeeded by his deputy, Mr
Peter Sutch, the company announced yesterday.
Mr Gledhill, 57, has been chairman of Swire, a company controlled by the
Swire family and a leading 'hong' in the colony, for the past four years.
He said last night that by the time he retires he will have exceeded the
company's policy of retiring senior executives at 55 by two-and-a-half
years.
'We have a policy of bringing younger people on in the company, and my time
has come,' he said.
Mr Sutch, 47, in addition to being deputy chairman of the Swire group, is
currently chairman of Cathay Pacific - Hong Kong's international airline. He
joined Swire in 1966.
Analysts in Hong Kong expected little change in the running of Swire under
Mr Sutch.
Given his age, however, Mr Sutch could expect to preside over Swire in the
run-up to 1997 - and possibly beyond  - when China regains sovereignty over
Hong Kong from the British.
Analysts said that although the airline has been suffering in line with
other international carriers during the current world downturn, Swire's
property investment and industry divisions have been performing well.

non-recourse financing to dealers

<TEXT>
TOYOTA Motor, Japan's largest car-maker, is expanding the operations of its
fast-growing finance subsidiary by offering non-recourse financing to Toyota
dealers in Japan.
Toyota said yesterday Toyota Finance Corporation would begin purchasing
credits on vehicle instalment payments from Toyota dealers and guarantee
customer payments by the end of the year. Since operations began in 1989,
Toyota Finance has confined its business to lending money to Toyota dealers,
who take vehicle loans on to their books and administer the loans.
The expansion of Toyota Finance's business is a reflection of changes in the
financial and vehicle marketing environment, but it also represents an
important step in the growth of a business with huge potential. Toyota
Finance will begin accumulating a large databank on Toyota customers that
will put it in position to move into other consumer financial services -
from credit cards and consumer loans to insurance. Some of these ideas are
under consideration by the Toyota management, although no plans have been
fixed.
A senior Toyota Finance executive said yesterday he expected Toyota Finance
would become a major part of Toyota's business in the future, along the
lines of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the finance arm of
General Motors.
Toyota said the offering of non-recourse finance was demanded by its dealers
who, because of Japan's labour shortage, are having difficulting managing
the administration of loans. The Bank of International Settlement capital
adequacy requirements were also forcing banks to seek more profitable
business, such as consumer finance. Toyota would have to offer similar
services to compete.
Toyota Finance now has about Y650bn (Dollars 5.27bn) in annual transactions,
and it expected to have about Y200bn of annual transactions in non-recourse
finance in about three years.
The company had Y403.7bn of outstanding loans at the end of last June.
Although Toyota Motor, a cash-rich company, provided initial funds for
Toyota Finance, Toyota Finance is mainly dependent on bank loans for its
operations, and expects to end entirely any use of intra-company funding.

<TEXT>
RIO ALGOM, 51 per cent owned by Britain's RTZ, has shelved plans to sell its
metals distribution subsidiaries in North America and Australasia after
failing to attract acceptable offers.
The businesses, which had 1990 sales of CDollars 743m (USDollars 640.5m),
were put on the block last February as part of Rio Algom's strategy of
focusing on mining.
But the Toronto-based company said yesterday the unexpectedly protracted
recession had 'affected the level of interest of prospective purchasers'. It
said offers received so far did not meet its objective of enhancing
shareholder value.
Mr Colin Macaulay, Rio Algom's chief executive, said the delayed economic
recovery had 'significantly altered investment plans of potential buyers in
North America and internationally'. Rio Algom declined to identify the
bidders.
The businesses operate under the names of Atlas Alloys in Canada, Vincent
Metals in the US, and Atlas Steels in Australia and New Zealand. They posted
a combined operating profit of CDollars 37.3m in 1990, but Rio Algom's
third-quarter 1991 report said earnings had been dented by the recession.
NOVA Scotia has put its loss-making Sydney Steel rail mill up for sale,
following a CDollars 275m modernisation.
Sysco, on Cape Breton island, has absorbed nearly CDollars 2bn in public
money since being acquired by the province from the former Hawker Canada
group in 1968.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM Australia, offshoot of US computer group International Business
Machines, has plunged into the red for the first time in its 60 years of
operation in Australia.
The company reported it had turned a ADollars 241m (USDollars 185.3m) profit
into a ADollars 389m loss in 1991 on a near-ADollars 600m slide in revenue
to ADollars 1.34m from ADollars 1.93m.
The result forms part of a USDollars 2.8m loss reported earlier by the US
group.
Despite its own difficulties, the parent has injected ADollars 200m into the
Australian offshoot, the first such support package since the early 1980s.
Mr Brian Finn, IBM Australia managing director, said the injection was
needed because the Australian company was not generating enough cash and
because it needed to maintain balance sheet ratios to hold its debt rating.
The loss reduced shareholders' funds at December 31 to Dollars 269m from
ADollars 386m and total assets to ADollars 1.79bn from ADollars 2.05bn.
Mr Finn said that widely-defined capital spending, which rose to ADollars
401m from ADollars 362m, would probably increase again in 1992.
He confirmed that IBM Australia expected to complete a 25 per cent staff
reduction which would see 1,200 employees leave by the end of February,
mainly through voluntary redundancies.
This was expected to cut about ADollars 75 m from costs in a full year.
'We don't intend to incur a second loss in succession,' Mr Finn said.
'But we are not expecting economic conditions to improve in 1992. And when
you can't get your revenue up, you have to cut costs.'
The latest result was before a tax credit of ADollars 142m, against an
expense of ADollars 106m previously.
The company's revenue per employee fell to ADollars 335,000 from ADollars
462,000.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chemicals group puts its house
in order - A look at plans to restructure Akzo into a more cohesive unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Aarnout Loudon, the chairman of Akzo, has embarked this month on the
final and probably the most radical phase of his five-year-old mission to
foster greater unity at the Dutch chemicals group.
In many ways, his plan for a 'drastic' reorganisation of Akzo's structure,
unveiled in a message to staff on January 8, also marks the effective
completion of the merger which created the company 23 years ago.
As part of the reorganisation, scheduled to be completed by the end of May
1993, Akzo is to scrap the layer of management which separates its
headquarters in Arnhem from its 40 business units. The company, which had
turnover of Fl 17.25bn (Dollars 9.6bn) and net profit before extraordinary
items of Fl 716m in 1990, is active in fields ranging from fibres, coatings
and pharmaceuticals to speciality chemicals, basic chemicals and salt.
The restructuring will be accomplished by merging Akzo's headquarters staff
with the staff of its five divisions. The divisions will then be eliminated,
ensuring that the company's 40 business units, to be grouped in four new
product-group 'clusters' - chemicals, fibres, coatings and pharmaceuticals -
will report directly to a revamped management board.
Up to 1,000 jobs could be affected by the decision to move divisional staff
from around the Netherlands and neighbouring Germany to Arnhem. The
reshuffle comes on top of thousands of job losses resulting from Akzo's
continuing cost-cutting programme, particularly in its fibre businesses. The
company has a total workforce of 64,000.
Mr Loudon, 55, who joined Akzo in 1969, the year of the merger, and later
became its chairman in 1982, said the company's existing structure had
proved to be inefficient. 'It led to communication lines which were far too
long, to the risk of misunderstandings, and to the slow execution of
decisions,' he said.
Until 1987, Akzo was a loose federation of independent-minded divisions, a
legacy of the merger which brought together AKU, an international,
Dutch-based fibres group, and KZO, a wide-ranging domestic chemicals,
pharmaceuticals and salt concern. Soon after the merger, Akzo was plunged
into the fibres crisis of the 1970s, preventing the newly-formed group from
coming to grips with the inefficiencies of its corporate structure.
Then, under Mr Loudon in the early to mid-1980s, Akzo made a series of big
acquisitions, many of them in the US, leaving little time for internal
matters.
Since 1987, however, Akzo has tried to concentrate foremost on putting its
own house in order. An internal and external 'corporate identity' campaign
was launched, an exercise which included the fashioning of a new logo - a
stylised figure of a man holding his arms outstretched above the company's
name.
Once-proud names of group subsidiaries, such as Enka in the field of fibres
and Sikkens in paints, were replaced by the Akzo name as part of efforts to
create a single corporate culture.
Mr Loudon said his latest reorganisation, which follows the decision in 1989
to introduce dozens of business units within the divisions, is bound to
enhance profitability at Akzo, though he said it was impossible to quantify
the improvement in terms of bottom-line results.
He denied that the organisational shake-up was a response to a downturn in
Akzo's results in 1990 and 1991. 'Our motivation is the desire to shorten
the lines of communication with our business units and is entirely unrelated
to developments in the chemicals industry in 1991,' he said. Figures for
1991 are scheduled to be released on February 26.
Mr Loudon's speech to staff was well-received on the Amsterdam bourse, where
Akzo's shares have risen by nearly 8.5 per cent since January 8 to around Fl
138.00, outstripping the market's gain of roughly 6 per cent over the same
period.
The buoyancy of Akzo's shares is partly the result of expectations that the
company stands to benefit from an upturn in the US economy and a firmer
dollar. Another factor, however, was Mr Loudon's simultaneous announcement
that Akzo planned to divest more of its weakest operations and that it might
seek partnerships for some other activities which have reasonably strong, or
potentially strong, market positions.
Akzo has said an analysis of its weaknesses and strengths showed that its
strongest business units, such as pharmaceuticals and chlor-alkali products,
generated 80 per cent of operating profit on just 45 per cent of turnover.
The middle range of activities, encompassing industrial fibres, among
others, accounted for 25 per cent of operating profit and 40 per cent of
turnover.
However, the weakest of Akzo's businesses, accounting for 15 per cent of
turnover, were persistently loss-making on balance.
So far, Mr Loudon said, half of this category had already been removed from
Akzo's books, through plant closures, outright divestments - such as the
sale of the group's majority stake in Spanish fibre company La Seda de
Barcelona - or through an exchange of assets with fellow Dutch chemicals
group DSM. In mid-1991, Akzo agreed to swap its engineering plastics
activities for DSM's powder coatings business.
Since late 1989, Akzo has pursued a more restrained acquisitions policy
compared with the mid-1980s, and this will continue. 'But, of course, things
are never black-and -white, for either a company or for a person,' Mr Loudon
said. 'If a strategic acquisition comes our way, we will look at it very
seriously.'
Recent examples of strategic takeovers are Akzo's purchase of a US tyre yarn
plant from Goodyear and its acquisition of Macpherson, a leading UK paint
manufacturer.
On the whole, however, Akzo's attention for the next couple of years will
clearly be focused not on takeovers but on reshaping its internal structure,
a project which is likely to be Akzo's last big overhaul for the rest of the
1990s.
The reorganisation will also be Mr Loudon's last. Due to retire by 1998, he
has made clear that he will probably leave earlier, but not before Akzo has
finally been reshaped into a more cohesive unit.

BANKERS TRUST, the New York banking group, continued to out-perform most of
its competitors in the north-east in the fourth quarter of 1991, with an 11
per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 137m.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman, said earnings reached a record in 1991 despite
the US recession. He stressed that total bank revenues were 4.5 per cent
higher year-on-year, staff numbers were reduced by 9 per cent and
non-interest expenses were up by only 3.6 per cent.
The bank, which recently announced the departure of Mr Ralph MacDonald, one
of the co-heads of its global corporate finance division, said its return on
equity in the fourth quarter was 18 per cent.
Net earnings of Dollars 667m for the whole of 1991 were only Dollars 2m
higher than in 1990, while the bank's return on equity last year was 23 per
cent.
Although net interest revenues after bad-debt provisions were Dollars 100m
lower in 1991 at Dollars 499m, Bankers Trust made up for this with
non-interest revenues Dollars 195m higher at Dollars 2.5bn. Foreign exchange
trading revenues fell from Dollars 425m to Dollars 272m in 1991, but this
was offset by a Dollars 356m rise in the bank's trading account, to Dollars
957m.
Bad-debt provisions were up only slightly in the fourth quarter, from
Dollars 73m to Dollars 75m. For the whole of 1991 bad-debt provisions rose
to Dollars 238m, from Dollars 194m in 1990. On Wall Street, the Bankers
Trust share price was marked  5/8 higher, to Dollars 64 1/2 .
Mr Robert Diamond, a senior executive in London for Morgan Stanley, has
joined rival US investment bank CS First Boston as chief executive of its
Far Eastern activities, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
Mr Allen Wheat, 43, who has headed the Pacific operations for the past two
years, as well as running the firm's derivatives products business, Credit
Suisse Financial Products, will now concentrate on the latter and take
responsibility for the bank's worldwide foreign exchange business.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp unveils new guidelines
on lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the largest US bank which is struggling to cut costs and contain
loan losses, has introduced a new set of US corporate lending guidelines
that aims to improve loan pricing and reduce concentrations in specified
sectors.
The new lending guidelines, contained in a 50-page spiral-bound set of
photocopied text and graphs known inside the bank as the 'blue book', comes
in the wake of sharp criticism on Wall Street of the bank's credit policies.
Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister who on March 1 takes over
as a new vice-chairman of the bank, will oversee implementation of the new
lending policies, which are to be phased in over the next 18 months.
Mr Ruding will have responsibility for Citicorp's corporate banking
business, which until recently was known as the Japan, Europe and North
America (Jena) division.
Last year, the Jena division suffered losses of more than Dollars 1bn -
nearly four times higher than a year earlier.
At the end of 1991, Jena had Dollars 79bn of total assets, of which Dollars
7.7bn were non-performing loans. The biggest problem area was in US
commercial real estate, where Dollars 4.8bn of the Dollars 13bn loan book
was classified as non-performing.
Mr John Reed, the Citicorp chairman, has taken personal charge of the US
commercial real estate loan portfolio, which is excluded from the new
guidelines. The new lending system is intended to cover some Dollars 55bn of
US corporate loans.
The new Citicorp guidelines - described inside the bank as a new portfolio
management system - may lead some corporate clients to leave the bank.
The guidelines cover 32 industrial sectors and geographic areas in the US
and include a new risk measurement system that is based on a scale of risk
from one to 10.
The heart of the new credit policy is a loan-pricing matrix that is intended
for review on a monthly basis. It requires loan officers to ensure that
loans are priced to exceed one of two standards - an 'analytical hurdle
rate' and a market rate.
The first is based on the cost of funds, historical volatility of the sector
and client and the return to shareholders of the loan.
The second standard is a comparison of the Citicorp loan and the market rate
charged by Citicorp's main competitors.

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has sold Banca Serfin, the country's third largest
bank, to Grupo Financiero Operadora de Bolsa (Obsa) for Dollars 918m.
Obsa, Mexico's largest retail brokerage measured by branches, paid 8,065
pesos (Dollars 2.62) per share, valuing the bank at 2.69 times book value.
The next and only other bid was for Dollars 870m, or 2.55 times book value.
The sale of Serfin puts the proceeds from the 10 bank privatisations so far
at more than Dollars 8.1bn, well above government and independent forecasts.
The Finance Ministry expects to have sold the eight banks still in
government hands by the middle of this year.
All the large banks - including Banamex, Bancomer, and now Serfin  - have
been sold to investors from brokerages. So far, all have formed integrated
financial groups, and Obsa, which narrowly lost out when bidding for
Bancomer last October, is expected to do the same.
Obsa was once Mexico's high-flying brokerage, with a market capitalisation
of Dollars 2bn at the height of 1987's stock market boom. But in the October
1987 crash its stock price collapsed, and at the time its president, Mr
Eduardo Legorreta, was imprisoned in February 1989 for trading abuses, its
share price was just 2 per cent of the pre-crash peak.
Since then, its reputation and market value have recovered, and it is
expected to form with Serfin one of Mexico's stronger financial groups. The
investors are mainly from the industrial city of Monterrey, and are
controlling shareholders in Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate.
Serfin is Mexico's oldest bank, and has assets of Dollars 22.1bn, 16 per
cent of the total held by Mexican banks, 598 branches, and last year profits
of Dollars 122m.

<TEXT>
WERELDHAVE and VIB, the Netherlands' second and third largest property
investment funds, plan to look into the possibility of entering into a
'far-reaching form of co-operation'.
The companies, which are listed on the Amsterdam bourse, are to consider all
options including that of a merger. Their decision is expected in several
months' time.
The announcement yesterday comes at a time of extensive alliance building in
the Dutch property sector.
In December, ABP, the Dutch civil servants' pension fund, said it planned to
buy a 12.5 per cent stake in Rodamco, the country's largest property
investment fund, in order to expand its international property holdings.
Rodamco, which has property holdings of around Fl 8bn (Dollars 4.4bn) and
which is seeking new funds for further growth, is also in talks with PGGM,
another large Dutch pension fund, about possible co-operation.
Wereldhave and VIB have property and other investments worth about Fl 5bn
and are very active on overseas markets, but Wereldhave's portfolio is more
international.
Nearly one-third of Wereldhave's investments is in the UK, a legacy of the
company's successful hostile takeover of Peachey Properties in 1988.
The two companies' shares rose slightly on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange
yesterday following the news of talks on a possible partnership. Wereldhave
gained Fl 1.60 to Fl 120.70 while VIB rose Fl 0.10 to Fl 59.80.
VIB switched from an open-ended to a closed-ended structure in autumn 1990,
in line with Rodamco's decision to stop its daily practice of buying in and
selling its own shares to keep its share price equivalent to net asset
value.
This move forced most other open-ended Dutch property funds to follow suit,
and they now all trade at a discount to their net asset value. Wereldhave,
by contrast, has always been closed-ended.

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, is planning to invest an estimated
NKr4bn (Dollars 641m) to upgrade and expand European refinery capacity, and
is also seeking new capacity outside Europe.
Statoil produces about 1m barrels of crude oil a day, but has just 200,000
barrels a day refining capacity.
The company is to spend about NKr2bn to boost annual refining capacity in
Denmark to 4.8m tonnes from 3.5m tonnes by building a plant - adjacent to
its existing refinery at Kalundborg - to refine condensate, a liquid
hydrocarbon.
Construction of the plant, which will be supplied with condensate from
Statoil's North Sea Sleipner field, is to be completed in the fourth quarter
of 1994.
Statoil, one of the world's leading oil products exporters outside Opec,
spent NKr12bn to expand and upgrade its Mongstad refinery on the west coast
of Norway which came on stream in 1989.
Statoil said the new investments, in the range of NKr1.8bn, were being
planned at Mongstad including a desulphurisation plant and a small
methyltertiary butyl ether (MTBE) plant.
MTBE is used as an additive to boost or improve the octane level of unleaded
petrol, which burns cleaner than leaded petrol. The plants will enable
higher-quality products to be produced in order to meet stricter
environmental requirements in the US and Europe.

FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch unveils record
full-year earnings of Dollars 696m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN OUTSTANDING 1991 for Wall Street was sealed yesterday when the biggest US
securities house, Merrill Lynch, unveiled full-year profits of Dollars
696.1m, the highest in the company's history. In 1990, profits totalled
Dollars 191.9m.
Merrill's record performance was achieved in the wake of a spectacular
fourth quarter, when earnings raced up 463 per cent to Dollars 170.7m on the
back of buoyant stock markets and heavy equity and bond underwriting
activity.
The improvement in revenues during the final quarter from all the company's
businesses was mirrored in the full-year figures. The steady fall in
interest rates over the year attracted many investors back to the stock
market and, as a result, revenues from commissions over the year jumped 22
per cent to Dollars 2.1bn. In the last quarter, commissions rose 36 per cent
to Dollars 556.1m.
Earnings from principal transactions also soared in the wake of lower
interest rates, a trend which favours broking houses with a big presence in
equity and fixed-income markets. Merrill's revenues from trading on its own
account reached Dollars 396m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 1.9bn in the
year, well up on 1990.
The company singled out its strong performance in trading high-yield
securities and international equities, while trading in money markets,
derivative products (especially swaps), and over-the-counter stocks also
made a significant contribution to trading revenues.
The most spectacular improvement came from investment banking, where
earnings doubled in the last quarter to Dollars 374.8m and rose nearly 50
per cent in the full year to Dollars 1.175bn.
Merrill benefited from a rush of new corporate stock and bond offerings as
companies took advantage of lower interest rates and high stock prices.
For the fourth consecutive year, the company was ranked the leading
underwriter of debt and equity securities both in the US and worldwide.

<TEXT>
ALCATEL, the French telecommunications equipment group, has sold its postal
franking and folding machine businesses to a group of financial investors
and company staff for an estimated FFr2bn (Dollars 369m).
This is France's largest management buy-out since the FFr7bn acquisition of
Darty, the electrical retailer, four years ago. Alcatel's mailing machine
businesses, known as Satmam in France and Hadewe in the Netherlands, take
second place in the world market after Pitney Bowes of the US.
The division recorded FFr2bn sales last year and employs 3,600 people. About
half its sales are made abroad, mainly in the US, Britain and the
Netherlands.
The deal allows Alcatel to pull out of a non-strategic activity without
selling to a competitor, said Mr Jean-Marie Messyer, a managing associate at
Lazard Freres, the bank which organised the buy-out. The management holds 2
per cent of the equity and will have stock options - still under negotiation
 -which could allow them to go up to more than 5 per cent.
The remainder is held by the financial backers, with 35 per cent owned by a
Lazard investment fund, plus 15 per cent with Baring Capital Investors.

<TEXT>
AUSTRIA's Voest-Alpine Steel, bidding to become the dominant steelmaker in
east-central Europe, yesterday sealed its investment in Hungary's largest
cold-rolling mill.
Voest-Alpine, a subsidiary of Austrian Industries, the state industrial
holding company, is paying Ft2.4bn (Dollars 31m) for half-ownership and
management control of the Dunaujvaros plant in central Hungary.
The Austrian steel company's eastern expansion is made more urgent by
increasing concentration in the European industry. By adding eastern
markets, Voest-Alpine can attain the size to survive alone, according to Mr
Wolfgang Eder, the general secretary.
The stake in Dunaujvaros is seen as establishing access to the Hungarian
market. The venture hopes to win new custom from the Hungarian operations of
multi-nationals, like Suzuki's car plant and Electrolux's refrigerator
factory. Nevertheless, overall local demand for steel has fallen sharply and
competition from Czechoslovak producers has grown fierce.
Although the Dunaujvaros venture will continue to produce mainly for the
Hungarian market, Voest-Alpine is exploring an international division of
labour - basic manufacturing in the east and special steel production in the
west.
The Dunaujvaros plant, which has an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes, was
chosen because it is linked to Linz by the Danube.

BANCA della Swizzera Italiana (BSI), Switzerland's sixth largest commercial
bank, has reported net income of SFr58m (Dollars 41m) in 1991, up slightly
from the SFr57.7m earned in the previous year.
Gross profit at the bank, in which Swiss Bank Corporation has a controlling
interest, was SFr150m, down 5 per cent. However, the previous year's figure
included SFr50m in extraordinary gains on the sale of participations in
banks in Monaco and Luxembourg.
Depreciation and provisions were SFr92m, down from SFr100.6m in 1990.
The bank said the satisfactory operating results were attributable to a
better interest margin and higher income from commissions, foreign exchange
transactions and securities. Net of interest and brokerage paid, total
income was SFr433m, 13 per cent above the level of the previous year,
excluding the extraordinary gains.
At December 31 1991, total assets were SFr9.9bn, up 8 per cent from a year
earlier. Loans grew 4 per cent to SFr5.8bn and deposits were up 8 per cent
to SFr6.4bn. Disclosed shareholders' equity, after the proposed unchanged 16
per cent dividend and allocations to reserves, would be SFr762m.

The end of 1991 was worse than expected. The last four months' result was
weakened by FM250m due to a poor market situation, foreign exchange losses
caused by the markka's devaluation and inventory losses on declining metal

<TEXT>
ABB, the Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering group, has bought a 10 per
cent share in Elektrim, a recently-privatised Polish foreign trade company
specialising in power generation.
Elektrim, whose principal markets are Czechoslovakia, Germany, Turkey and
Austria, reported a profit of Zl 188.1bn (Dollars 16.3m) on turnover of Zl
3,425bn in the first half of last year.
The privatisation valued Elektrim at Zl 210bn, with the government retaining
18 per cent of the company's 3m shares, of which 60 per cent were sold to
individual inves tors and foreign companies.
ABB made its purchases through two of its subsidiaries in Poland, with ABB
Zamech and ABB Dolmel buying 5 per cent each at a total cost of Zl 21bn.
ABB, which exported around Dollars 65m worth of goods to Poland last year,
now has five joint ventures in the country.
These include ABB Zamech, established in April 1990, which produces maritime
equipment and gas turbines, and ABB Dolmel, as well as Dolmel Drives, which
specialises in generating equipment and machine drives and was established
in July 1990.
ABB has also recently set up two small-scale enterprises. One is between
Poland's ZWUS with ABB's railway signal producing subsidiary in Stockholm
and the other a joint venture between Lamina, a Polish factory producing
lamps, and Infocom, an ABB-owned company in Switzerland.
Further plans for more ambitious investments by ABB in Poland have been held
up by Polish fears that the Swedish-Swiss company would soon come to play a
dominant role in the country's power generating equipment and related
sectors.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Demand for refrigerators helps limit fall
at Bullough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULLOUGH, the office products and refrigeration group, yesterday announced
that it would maintain its dividend for the year to end-October 1991 in
spite of a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits.
The decline in profits to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 26m) was less than some
commentators feared, mainly because of a strong performance from
refrigeration. Environmental and health concerns have led to a big demand
for new fridges, increasing the division's operating profit to Pounds 7.4m
(Pounds 6.1m).
The results were also lifted by an exceptional surplus of Pounds 994,000
arising on settlement of insurance claims after redundancy costs.
Earnings per share fell from 14.3p to 11.55p. A recommended unchanged final
dividend of 4.3p maintains the total for the year at 6.05p.
Gearing fell from 28 per cent to 9 per cent. Borrowings were reduced to
Pounds 7.8m from a cash inflow of Pounds 15.7m, after capital expenditure
and net acquisition costs of Pounds 8.7m.
Mr Derrick Battle, chairman, said debt was reduced by slashing costs and
reducing capital expenditure as turnover fell from Pounds 318m to Pounds
293m.
Office products, which continued to suffer from the recession, saw operating
profit fall from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 7.82m as sales fell by 25 per cent.
Store fitting incurred a loss of Pounds 1.78m compared to a profit of Pounds
23,000 as sales by BFN storefitters to the DIY retail sector fell sharply in
the first half.
Severe cut-backs, leading to a reduction in the workforce of 220 to 80,
enabled the division to make a small profit in the second half.
Operating profits at the remaining divisions were: heating Pounds 3.8m
(Pounds 4.1m); electrical Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 2.16m); and engineering
Pounds 2.59m (Pounds 2.13m).
COMMENT
As Derrick Battle put it: 'If you are going to surprise the market there is
only one way to do it: produce better results'. Accordingly the share price
jumped by 15p to close at 140p. Analysts expected a fall in profits; few
companies are in need of office furniture and the recession in the DIY
market is far from over. Yet there was plenty of good news to please the
market: store fitting is already back in profit and refrigeration has proved
recession proof. A significant reduction in working capital has led to a
reduction in gearing from 40 per cent two years ago to under 10 per cent
today. That figure is likely to continue to fall - and with it the Pounds
1.6m interest charge  - as costs are further reduced. Full year pre-tax
profit forecasts of Pounds 22m, reflecting an upgrading from some analysts
after yesterday's results, gives earnings per share of 12p and a prospective
multiple of 11.6. The shares still look cheap.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: L&amp;G suffers sharp reductions in annual
premium business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; General, the life assurance group, yesterday announced substantial
reductions in new regular premium life and pensions business during 1991.
In common with trends for the industry, most of the Pounds 2.16bn taken in
by L&amp;G last year was in single premium business.
Using the industry's standard Equivalent Premium Income yardstick, which
adds one tenth of new single premiums to the total of annual premiums for
the year, worldwide business increased slightly from Pounds 327m to Pounds
332m. The UK's share rose from Pounds 256.3m to Pounds 262.3m.
Annual premium business, affected by the recession with consumers reluctant
to take on new commitments, fell from Pounds 210.5m to Pounds 170.1m in the
UK, and from Pounds 266.5m to Pounds 225.1m worldwide.
New business figures rose from Pounds 463m to Pounds 922m thanks to a strong
increase in UK single premium business. Much of this came in one-off
business from large pension funds.
Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said: 'Legal &amp; General is not immune from
current economic pressures.
'In particular, our regular annual premium business in the UK continues to
be affected by a stagnant housing market - into which we sell our mortgage
related policies - and a struggling business environment into which we sell
out personal pension plans.'
L&amp;G also said yesterday that it was going to reduce its exposure to claims
from building and contents insurance by changes in its reinsurance
programme, writes Richard Lapper.
Following heavy losses in its non-life business from subsidence, theft and
mortgage indemnity claims, Mr Prosser announced last year that L&amp;G wanted to
cut back its involvement in more volatile general insurance business.
The company is still negotiating its arrangements for 1992 with reinsurers
but has already agreed a quota share proportional treaty to cede 40 per cent
of its household property business.
In proportional business insurers cede a share of their exposure for a
proportional share of the premium receiving a reinsurance commission in
exchange.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Return to black at Dale Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DALE ELECTRIC International, the Yorkshire-based power and lighting group,
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 497,000 in the six months to October 27,
compared with a loss of Pounds 146,000 in the corresponding period.
The group said the improvement continued the good work of the second half of
last year, when it moved back into the black after suffering from project
delays.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 24m) but directors said that
continuing rationalisation and the strength the group's export markets had
improved its resilience to recession. The order book stood at Pounds 35m,
enough for seven months work.
Although lower base rates cut interest payments from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds
962,000, gearing remained about 88 per cent. The group is seeking to dispose
of surplus property in Ashford, Kent, but this was being delayed by
uncertainty over the Channel rail tunnel and the present depressed state of
the market.
Sir Tom McDonald, chairman, said that the generating set and battery-based
power system sides of the group showed greater strength than the aerospace
interests, where markets still suffered from the economic downturn and the
malaise caused by the Gulf war, although there was now prospect of positive
change.
He said: 'The group looks forward to a very active trading period in the
traditionally stronger second half.'
Earnings per share of 2.79p compared with losses of 1.76p last time. The
interim dividend is maintained at 2p.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Wace chief acts to stem IRA rumour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WACE Group, the world's largest pre-press printing specialist, yesterday
took the unusual step of denying it was a front for the IRA.
Wace made the statement at noon after market rumours linked it with a report
in the Sunday Telegraph that a listed UK company was under investigation for
laundering funds for the terrorist organisation.
The company's shares fell from 177p to 155p in relatively heavy trading,
wiping Pounds 14.5m from its market value. After the statement, the shares
recovered to close at 166p.
Mr John Clegg, chief executive, said he was 'mystified' as to why some
traders had associated his company with the Sunday Telegraph report, which
referred to an unnamed company with an annual turnover of Pounds 200m.
Wace's brokers, BZW, were routinely contacted by the Stock Exchange after
the sudden drop in price. BZW informed Mr Clegg that Wace was one of several
names about which traders were speculating. Mr Clegg said: 'Our group was
the only one of them which saw its share price fall, so we decided to put
out the statement. It was a very difficult decision.'
Wace has grown rapidly by acquisition in the last six years, mainly funded
from rights issues and placings. About 70 per cent of its shares are held by
financial institutions.
Mr Clegg said Wace had no Irish operations or directors. He has been a
director of the Anglo-Irish Bank for several years, due to an historic
family connection: 'My mother is Irish. I suppose we all have some Irish
blood.'
Wace's shares have fallen sharply from their peak of 284p last year. BZW
said it again suspected that yesterday's rumour came from 'bear raiders',
who at the end of last year had circulated 'totally unjustified' stories
about the group.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho selling MAN truck importing business
for Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, is selling its UK MAN truck
importing business for Pounds 20m. It is the latest in a series of disposals
designed to reduce the group's Pounds 1.1bn net debt.
An agreement in principle has been reached with MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the
second largest German truck maker, which will take responsibility for the
distribution, sales and service of MAN trucks, buses and spare parts in the
UK.
The 25-strong MAN dealer network in the UK would not be affected by the
sale, said Lonrho.
Lonrho added that MAN 'wished to continue and to extend the development of
its UK presence'.
MAN accounted for 4.9 per cent of the UK market for trucks above 3.5 tonnes
last year, which it is relatively small compared with its presence elsewhere
in Europe. It was in eighth place in the UK market, overshadowed by groups
such as DAF, Iveco and Mercedes-Benz.
Lonrho said that MAN would take over the UK operations 'as soon as
practicable' and not later than the end of March.
The acquisition is a further step in the trend for leading car and truck
makers to take over direct control of the importing and distribution of
their products in main volume markets.
Mr Robert Dunlop, deputy chairman of Lonrho, said the company believed that
'the funds currently deployed in the truck business could be better utilised
elsewhere in Lonrho's operations'. The UK new truck market has more than
halved in the last two years with the steepest fall into recession in the
post-war period.
Lonrho has already confirmed the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne
and Nagel, the German freight forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 118.8m). Lonrho
is also understood to be planning the sale of both the Glasgow Herald and
the Evening Times, which belong to the group's George Outram subsidiary. The
sale could fetch up to Pounds 200m.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is bringing forward the announcement of its third
quarter results to coincide with the publication on Thursday of the
consultative document on BT regulation by Oftel, the industry regulator.
The publication of the document starts the process of reviewing BT's prices
during which Oftel will have to decide whether the group's profits are
'reasonable' and how much its prices should be regul-ated.
BT has come under increasing scrutiny for its high profitability which is
seen to be supported by unnecessarily high prices.
The announcement of the third quarter results is being made two weeks
earlier than originally scheduled so that BT will be able to put its case
regarding its profitability without being hampered by Stock Exchange rules
which would have prevented it from commenting on its financial performance
for eight weeks before a results announcement.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Racal reaffirms its forecast of Pounds 50m
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal Electronics yesterday reaffirmed its forecast that it would make
pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 50m for the year to March 31 1992.
The statement, issued after a meeting of the full board, was in response to
the publication of an internal memorandum suggesting that the profit
forecast might not be met.
The forecast was part of the group's successful defence against last year's
hostile Pounds 750m bid from Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate.
The statement said: 'On the bases and assumptions set out in the circular to
Racal shareholders dated December 6 1991, and after excluding results of
Vodaphone Group, operating profit will not be less than Pounds 100m and
profit before tax will not be less than Pounds 50m.'
Racal's internal memorandum warned that the profit forecast would be harder
to meet because of unforeseen delays on several large contracts. Racal said
the memorandum only referred to part of the radio division, where one
contract had been delayed.

health arm

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME Foundation, the pharmaceuticals group, continued its
rationalisation with the sale of its environmental health division to
Roussel Uclaf, the French company, for Pounds 43m.
The division, which sells pyrephrum as an insecticide for household and
environmental public health, and protecting wood and stored grain, had
turnover in 1990 of about Pounds 83m. Wellcome said the net tangible assets
to be sold were worth Pounds 32.5m.
The sale is part of Wellcome's drive to become a pure pharmaceutical
company. Sir Alistair Frame, chairman, announced in 1990 that the company
would be examining all aspects of its business to improve efficiency and
financial performance.
Last year it sold Calmic International, its hygiene services business, to
Rentokil and its vaccines operations to Medeva, the fast-growing UK
pharmaceutical group. Roussel Uclaf was assisted in negotiations by JP
Morgan, the US bank.
Roussel Uclaf would become one of the world's leading environmental health
companies following its acquisition, said Dr Pascal Housset, managing
director of the group's agrovet division.
Sales in the agrovet division should reach Pounds 450m in 1992, he added. In
1991 the division's operations represented 26 per cent of Roussel's
turnover.

FT  28 JAN 92 / French say Nestle can bid for Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, has been given the go-ahead by the French
stock market authorities for its FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) hostile takeover
bid launched last week for Source Perrier, France's leading mineral water
company.
The Swiss group, which is funding the bid jointly with Banque Indosuez, the
prominent Paris bank, now needs to secure the consent of the French
government since it is based outside the European Community.
In recent days Nestle has appeared to be trying to play down the aggressive
aspects of the bid which threatens to turn into a bitter battle with the
Agnellis, the Italian industrial dynasty, for control of Perrier.
Mr Reto Domeniconi, director general of Nestle, stressed in interviews with
Espresso and Il Mondo, the Italian weeklies, that he hoped to reach an
agreement with the Agnellis.
He suggested that his company could keep Perrier's water and cheese
interests while the Agnellis, who are in the throes of a FFr5.6bn bid for
Exor, the French property group that controls 35 per cent of Perrier, could
retain its holdings in wine and property.
Despite Mr Domeniconi's placatory overtures, Nestle is pressing ahead with
its legal battle to prevent the Agnellis from blocking its bid for Perrier.
Nestle is trying to invalidate the FFr1.5bn purchase earlier this month of a
13.8 per cent stake in Perrier by Saint Louis, another company linked to the
Agnellis. The combination of this holding with Exor's 35 per cent would give
the Agnelli camp control of 48.8 per cent of Perrier, making it almost
impossible for Nestle's bid to succeed.
Nestle last week obtained a court order to freeze the voting rights attached
to the Saint Louis shares. The Tribunal de Commerce, the Paris commercial
court, yesterday announced it had set a date of February 25 to deliver its
judgment on the validity of Saint Louis' investment.
The Commission des Operations de la Bourse, another French stock market
regulator, is expected to decide this week whether it will sanction the
Saint Louis share sale.
In the meantime Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has headed his family's drive into
France, has tried to mend the damage to the Agnellis' carefully cultivated
francophillic image by stressing their commitment to long-term investment in
France.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAST-MINUTE talks were being held last night to ensure the Middle East
multinational forum due to open in Moscow today goes ahead as planned,
following demands by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for broader
Palestinian representation.
US and Russian co-sponsors of the forum feared the issue of Palestinian
representation could provoke a walkout by the Israeli delegation.
PLO calls for the Palestinian delegation in Moscow to include
representatives from the diaspora, among them Jerusalem-born Palestinians,
have cast a shadow over the multilateral talks, the third stage of the
latest Middle East peace effort launched in Madrid last October.
Seeking to downplay the argument, US and Soviet officials made it clear the
Palestinian delegation must be restricted to the 'Madrid formula' allowing
only representatives from the West Bank and Gaza strip, occupied by Israel
in the 1967 war.
A two-tier Palestinian delegation was due in Moscow last night. At the
Madrid opening last October, the Palestinian team included representatives
from east Jerusalem, but these did not participate directly in the
discussions with Israel.
Representatives from about 18 countries, including permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council, are expected to sit down today in Moscow's
Hall of Unions to discuss such issues as regional disarmament, economic
development, water and the environment.
Syria and Lebanon are boycotting the talks, claiming Israel has shown no
commitment to a Middle East settlement based on the 'land for peace' formula
outlined in United Nations Security Council resolutions. Radical
Palestinians have condemned Arab participation.
The US wants to use the Moscow meeting - involving Israel for the first time
in discussing Middle East questions with Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey as well
as Arabs from the Gulf and Africa - to lessen the Jewish state's regional
isolation.
Israel and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian
Palestinian team have conducted three rounds of bilateral talks in Madrid
and in Washington marked by procedural argument.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state and originator of this latest
Middle East peace effort is anxious for the Moscow meeting to establish the
framework for tackling multilateral Middle East issues before the general
election in Israel later this year brings the peace process at least to a
temporary halt.

FT  28 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When overseas investors suddenly rush to buy into a UK company whose shares
are on a historic multiple of 48 and a yield of 0.4 per cent, it would seem
foolish for UK shareholders to resist. It would be all the odder if the
company was not a Wellcome or a Glaxo, but a mere retailer. Yesterday's 12
per cent jump in the Body Shop share price was apparently sparked by a
recommendation from an influential US stock picker. The only question is
whether, if overseas investors really are discovering the Body Shop formula
in large numbers, they can push the price to even more improbable levels.
If so, UK investors would plainly be advised to hang on for the ride. But
Body Shop has shown once already that it is vulnerable to the cycle. In
1990, its shares lost nearly half their value as the recession took hold.
And other UK companies - Dixons, Sock Shop and Isosceles, to name but three
 -have learned to their cost that expansion in the US is an extremely chancy
business. The best course for Body Shop's UK investors might be to hand the
shares over and buy them back when they are less fashionable.

FT  28 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Mountleigh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is unusual, not to say dangerous, for any property deal to be announced
these days before the ink on the contract is dry. But assuming Mountleigh's
Merry Hill sale goes through as planned, the company can justly claim that
its disposal programme is on track. The Pounds 125m price tag, moreover, is
a reminder that the market for retail and industrial sites gets stronger the
further north one travels. It is worth remembering that the UK's quoted
property companies, which have underperformed by 30 per cent over the last
12 months, are heavily biased towards London and the south east.
Even so, Mountleigh has a formidable mountain to climb, and investors will
reasonably ask what it plans for an encore. The gap between its interest
bill and rental income is dauntingly wide and can only be significantly
narrowed now by successfully finding purchasers for non-yielding assets.
Last year's rights proceeds will presumably keep the lenders at bay, but it
is hard to escape the conclusion that in practice Mountleigh is another
Rosehaugh-style work-out on behalf of the banks.
Yesterday's 10 per cent slide in the shares to 9 1/2 p offers chairman Sir
Ian MacGregor another opportunity to average down on his personal holdings.
But it will take more than a promise to keep up the attack on costs and an
overdue decision to stop capitalising interest charges to persuade other
investors to follow suit. In particular, there is confusion about the value
of the Spanish retailer Galerias in the light of its persistently poor
trading results. A company which once had the lofty ambition to pay Pounds
2bn for Storehouse can surely do better in explaining itself.

FT  28 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the depths being plumbed by the UK economy that rising
imports are now greeted by some as evidence of a consumer revival rather
than a threat to the balance of payments. In last year's fourth quarter,
import volume, excluding oil and erratics, was up only one per cent on the
year before. But there seems little doubt that after the late summer, the
upward trend is now re-established.
It thus seems likely that the current account deficit, which narrowed last
year from Pounds 15.2bn to Pounds 5.8bn, will this year widen again. The
persistence of the deficit throughout the most prolonged recession since the
war is dispiriting evidence of the UK economy's structural failings. It will
also limit the recovery, whenever it arrives. The problem need not be one of
financing the deficit. It is rather that memories of the Lawson boom are
still too fresh for any government to preside over a collapse in the balance
of payments with equanimity.
If a rising deficit had to be suppressed, the UK could yet again find itself
out of step with Germany. Suppose that sterling were in narrow bands and
that German interest rates had been cut to stimulate the German economy.
Sterling could then be near enough to its ERM ceiling to make raising rates
as difficult as cutting them is now. If that seems far-fetched, it is worth
recalling that as recently as 1987, Mr Lawson's attempts to cap sterling at
DM3 involved slashing base rates even as the current account was plunging.
If base rate rises were ruled out, the obvious alternative would be to raise
taxes. In that case, the market might ask itself what advantage there is in
the Tories winning the election.

<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,539.9 (+29.5)
It is easy to see why Ger-many's inflationary preoccupations stopped it
joining any moves to boost the world economy at last weekend's Group of
Seven meeting. The apparent absence of US/Japanese action needs a little
more explaining. Japan needs a higher Yen to fend off US protectionist
pressures and lower interest rates to float its stock market off the rocks.
An agreement by the US, even behind the scenes, to lower its own interest
rates would have helped meet both objectives. It might also have elicited a
more forthright statement from the meeting.
The missed opportunity prompts the question of whether the Federal Reserve
is actually preparing to cut rates again, as many in the markets believe. Or
has it been deterred by the softness of the Treasury bond market, which is
apparently beginning to take the prospect of economic recovery more
seriously? If a further cut in short-term rates undermined bond prices, it
would be counter-productive. Long-term rates have a significant effect on
demand, not least through their effect on the housing market. A modest
reflationary package in tonight's State of the Union message might reassure
bond dealers, but even that need not point to monetary easing. It could
simply mean that alarm over the economy was abating.
That need not imply that yesterday's dollar bounce heralds a sharper upward
move, but it does raise doubts about whether the Yen can sustain its
relative strength. The D-Mark is at least still underpinned by high interest
rates. Fear of intervention is unlikely to do much for the Yen if the Nikkei
does crash through the 20,000 level and the Bank of Japan is forced to lower
rates again.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter: An unsuitable savings vehicle foisted on public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWARD RIGG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Let us not mince our words. I refer to your article, 'Tied agents 'are
overselling life policies'' and leading article, 'Life policies oversold'.
The big fraud (I am not mincing my words) is that they are sold at all.
Endowment policies have been demonstrably the most unsuitable of all savings
vehicles ever since life assurance premium relief (LAPR) was abolished in
March 1984. Nevertheless the life insurance industry has continued to foist
them on the public with the aid of questionable sales techniques, and by
diverting an outrageously high proportion of savers' cash to its salesmens'
commissions.
From the early days of the Financial Services Act the life insurance lobby
has fought and schemed to defend its practices, which can plainly be
described as designed to 'rip off' the public.
The only surprising feature about the rift that has now developed in the
Unit Trust Association is that it did not happen earlier. The link that
exists between the concept of savings and the concept of insuring one's life
should have been severed many years ago.
At long last there have been signs recently that those in high places,
including Sir David Walker, the chairman of Securities and Investments
Board, have come to realise this and are beginning to question the selling
of such policies. Even Fimbra has begun to realise that its role in
protecting the investor will be better discharged if it checks the selling
of these dubious policies rather than its members' petty cash.
It cannot be stressed too heavily that life insurance policies of the
savings kind, such as endowments, and most of their closely related cousins
such as regular premium personal pension plans, are a most unwise choice for
almost anybody, not just the 30-odd per cent who find they have to cancel
them within two years.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter: Tax reductions that would be misdirected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord VINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A penny off corporation tax in the Budget - as suggested by the
Institute of Directors ('Directors urge Pounds 3bn reduction in taxation',
January 16) - would be money misdirected, besides being of no benefit to the
many small businesses that operate as sole traders, whose cash position has
also been ravaged by 30 per cent inflation over the last four years.
Productivity may not be everything - but in the long run to a trading nation
it is nearly everything. Budgetary concessions for business, then, should be
aimed at stimulating investment in productive plant - to help meet demand
when the upturn comes.
Singularly in this country we penalise investment by not allowing adequate
cost recovery against tax in the year of expenditure - the current 25 per
cent diminishing balance rate is far too low.
So any budgetary concessions should be used in this area to improve the cash
flow of investing companies - both small and large.

financial worst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERRIT JACOBSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, BCCI, Polly Peck, Maxwell. Now the British are expecting the worst from
the single minded Mr Tiny Rowland. The ingredients are already there:
dividend cut, stock price collapse, stock exchange inquiry, 'foreign' chief
executive.
I hope Lonrho is different. Only a week ago the FT was quoting some analysts
as saying that Lonrho should cut its dividend if it was prudent, but with
others saying that they did not expect Mr Rowland to do so because he was a
'contrarian' out to prove he is different from the rest.
Now everyone is up in arms about his dividend cut. What kind of perverted
logic is this? This 'crisis' is caused by the financial industry, which has
fallen into its own psychological trap. What causes a lender to say: 'We
have got to put on our thinking caps to work out why he cut the dividend'?
It seems that the lender has not done its homework and has no idea why it
lent money in the first place.
I would not be surprised if the drop in the share price caused some of
Lonrho's now alarmed lenders to withdraw some of their credit facilities,
thus causing a real crisis. I hope that the FT does not become party to this
mind-twisting game by quoting an increasing number of worried people. I feel
very much reminded of a London storm causing little actual damage but
paralysing the whole city because everyone stops work to stand by the window
and cheerfully wait for something awful to happen. Gerrit Jacobsen,

   From M ANDRE

<TEXT>
Sir, On April 29 1991, there was in the FT an article headed: 'Smoking
diesels blamed as main source of pollution'; on January 22 1992 we learn
('Motor adverts criticised') that the Advertising Standards Authority upheld
complaints against Peugeot Talbot for claiming that diesel engines would be
environmentally 'clean'.
Nevertheless, in your Technology pages, we read regularly calls for more
diesels; for example on September 5 1991 ('Measures to combat dieseL
emissions urged') tax cuts to encourage diesel fuel were urged; or on
January 21 1992 ('Diesel cleans up its act').
Assuredly diesels are somewhat cleaner when well tuned, but when are they? M

FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter (1): Diesel not least polluting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The balance that John Griffiths strikes ('Technology: diesel cleans up
its act' January 21) between diesel and petrol on their 'cleanness' is
slightly misleading. Diesel is cleaner in some respects than present
petrol-driven engines, but much of this advantage disappears from the end of
this year, when all new petrol-driven cars will be fitted with 3-way
catalysts, reducing exhaust emissions by more than 90 per cent. Diesels emit
'particulates' - a fine dust, mostly carbon, which can sometimes be seen as
a smoke. This happens even when the engine is well-tuned. Diesels also
produce a high level of nitrous oxides. The technology to handle these
diesel emissions is progressing but so far is not nearly as well developed
as that for petrol exhausts.
Conventional wisdom on diesels is that they emit much less carbon dioxide
than petrol engines because they are more fuel-efficient and give better
mileage. But diesel contains more carbon per litre than petrol does, and so
produces more carbon dioxide when it is burned in a car's engine. This
offsets much of the reduction in carbon dioxide arising from the better
mileage.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter: Economy needs more effective regional policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERARD LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The cutback in the coal industry, following close on the announcement
of the closure of the Ravenscraig steel works once again highlights this
country's absence of regional and industrial policy. Yet, if the UK is
committed to the ERM and at sterling's current high and overvalued rate, it
is essential that the government make effective use of industrial and fiscal
policy to improve the supply-side potential of the economy.
This potential will not be realised if strategic industries such as coal and
steel are allowed to disappear.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Leading Article: New ideas on nuclear arms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the risks associated with nuclear weapons, the break-up of a nuclear
power was one that nobody contemplated. In recent months, the search for
reassurance on the nuclear front has been a prime focus of east-west
diplomacy.
The subject will be high on the agenda at Friday's UN Security Council
summit and involves ensuring a centralised, trustworthy command system for
the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal; securing the non-Russian
republics in their stated non-nuclear intentions; preventing the leakage of
weapons, parts or expertise to would-be proliferators; and keeping Russia to
the promises and treaty commitments made by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev to withdraw
and destroy much of its stockpile. It is hoped that these plans will be
extended in response to further US arms reductions.
There is scope for western governments to help the republics fulfil these
aims. The cost of some measures would be marginal; even the more expensive
would be cheap compared to the cost of failure. If necessary, the west
should be prepared to make financial aid contingent upon co-operation in
de-fanging the nukes.
The US congress has authorised Dollars 400m of Pentagon funds to help with
storage and destruction of Soviet nuclear arms, a sum not yet taken up. It
is perhaps not surprising that the Russians should hesitate before handing
over responsibility for dismantling their most secret weapons. But there are
other ways in which the US and its allies can help, and which can be made
acceptable to the recipients.
Some 13,000 of the ex-Soviet Union's 27,000 deployed nuclear warheads are
already on the elimination list. Using current Russian facilities, it would
probably take 10 years to cope with them. In addition to these and
subsequent arms-control cuts, there are thousands more old weapons in
storage that need dealing with.
Central storage
The safest first step would be to ship all the weapons due for elimination
to central storage in Russia. The west could assist in setting up a team to
carry out inventories and in arranging for weapons to be transported,
grouped and disabled so that they cannot be fired.
More ambitious would be a western-built plant for the complex business of
disassembling the weapons. This entails dangers both for security - keeping
track of fissile materials and parts such as triggering mechanisms and
guidance systems which proliferating nations would be only too keen to lay
hands on - and for the environment. A programme would also be required for
recycling weapons-grade uranium into civil fuel and for handling the
plutonium warhead cores.
Foolproof precautions
A case can be made for leaving the nuclear materials in the weapons, as a
lesser risk if foolproof precautions cannot be secured.
Either way, there would be a need to place stored warheads or materials
under some agreed form of supervision. This could be done by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, but that would require a big increase in
its Dollars 75m-a-year inspection budget.
A further target for western financial help involves Russia's own nuclear
weapons community. There are reckoned to be tens of thousands who could be
of use to a country seeking nuclear arms, including 5,000-7,000 experienced
in specific weapons-related technology.
Suggestions that the west might pay such scientists and technicians directly
 -for instance in projects for cleaning up pollution from the Soviet weapons
programme - should not be dismissed as madcap. Direct assistance for what
would be tantamount to a selective welfare scheme might raise political
objections in the US, but it could be carried out indirectly through an
international organisation. Russian officials have suggested Dollars 1,000 a
month would be enough to persuade a scientist to stay put. At that rate,
several thousand could be employed for the next 20 years for much less than
it would cost Britain to procure a new sub-strategic nuclear missile for its
air force. In terms of the security it would buy, it would be good value.

FT  28 JAN 92 / A mission to make the polluters pay: A look at the progress
towards a carbon tax in the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European Community's environment commissioner,
calls it 'a turning point in our whole environment policy'. Others see it as
the EC shooting itself not just in the foot but both feet at once.
Mr Ripa di Meana's plan to introduce a carbon tax as part of a package of
measures to combat harmful emissions is one of the most ambitious fiscal and
environmental moves that has yet been contemplated within the EC. If it
succeeds, it will force consumers throughout the Community to cut back on
dirty forms of energy like coal and petrol and, in the process, raise huge
revenues - according to EC estimates, as much as Ecu60bn-Ecu65bn (Pounds
43bn-Pounds 46bn) - which could be recycled to reduce other taxes.
Although the plan has already made much more headway in Brussels than many
people had expected when it was unveiled last year, it still faces huge
obstacles. Large segments of industry are bitterly opposed to it, the EC's
international trade lobby has denounced it as a self-imposed handicap, and
tax experts have criticised it as a regressive step, because poor people
allocate a larger part of their household budgets to fuel. There is even a
body of opinion which doubts that it would work at all.
None the less, Mr Ripa di Meana hopes to secure political backing from his
EC colleagues for a detailed plan by late spring. He is encouraged by the
fact that it has already survived several ministerial councils, through
which policy proposals have to pass, including those of the economics and
finance ministers. Being a fiscal measure, however, the proposal will still
have to go through the EC Parliament and receive unanimous approval from the
Council of Ministers.
An important meeting of the ministers most closely involved - the energy and
environment ministers - in December gave it the green light, although with a
distinct yellowish tinge. The EC had hoped to come up with a statement that
the tax will form the basis for the Community's attack on global warming.
Instead, the best ministers could agree was that it is likely to do so.
The timing for Mr Ripa di Meana is crucial. He wants to be able to attend
the UN 'earth summit' in Rio de Janeiro in June brandishing a piece of paper
to prove that the EC is doing its bit to save the environment. This would
put pressure on the US and Japan to adopt a similar tax and help him pacify
his critics back home. But he also realises that if he fails to win
international support his whole plan could, in his own words, become 'a
fiasco'.
Mr Ripa di Meana's proposal, worked out in conjunction with Mr Antonio
Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, marks a departure from the
earlier trend of tackling environmental problems through rules and
regulations. But the intention is that the tax should be based on the same
principle: the polluter pays.
It would take the form of a combined energy and carbon tax to be introduced
in 1993 at the rate of Dollars 3 per barrel of oil - current price, about
Dollars 18 a barrel - or its equivalent in other fuels. The tax would rise
by Dollars 1 a year to Dollars 10 in 2000. By driving up fuel costs in this
way, the tax would force users to become more efficient.
The tax would be based on both the carbon and overall energy content of
fuel. The carbon element would penalise fuels with high emissions of carbon
dioxide, the gas widely blamed for global warming. The energy content would
encourage greater energy efficiency, and tilt the balance in favour of
renewable forms of energy such as hydro and wind power.
Mr Ripa di Meana concedes that the tax would place a heavy burden on
energy-intensive industry, so he is willing to exempt heavy sectors such as
steel and cement. But special treatment would be removed if leading
industrial countries outside the EC introduced similar taxes.
Another sweetener is Mr Ripa di Meana's proposal that the carbon tax should
be fiscally neutral - that all revenues should be used to offset other
taxes. As the tax would be collected at national level, member states could
decide for themselves how to spend the revenue windfall. Because of this,
the plan is being presented as a 'tax shift' rather than a new tax.
Mr Ripa di Meana's best chances of getting his tax lie in harnessing to the
rising tide of popular concern about pollution and global warming. Not
surprisingly, his strongest supporters include the environmental and energy
conservation lobbies, and these could be marshalled into a powerful - if
rather diffuse  - political force.
But arrayed against him is a large number of the EC's powerful industrial
lobbies and trade groups, which argue that self-regulation would be a better
means to the same end. Among them is Euroelectric, the trade group
representing the EC electricity industry which would be the sector most
affected. According to the group's Brussels lobbyist, Ms Angelika Riedl, the
plan would harm EC growth prospects and distort international competition by
pushing up industrial costs.
The competitiveness issue may prove Mr Ripa di Meana's biggest stumbling
block. By his department's own calculations a Dollars 10-a-barrel tax would
push up the price of industrial gas by a third and of hard coal by nearly 60
per cent. In transport, the price of petrol would rise by 6 per cent and of
diesel by 11 per cent.
At present, Japan and the US do not seem prepared to make more than vague
commitments to follow suit, although they may dress them up in Rio so as not
to appear obstructive. Japan argues that its emissions regulations already
set standards that are at least as good as those that the carbon tax would
achieve, so it does not need a tax. In the US, the imminent election rules
out any fresh taxes by the Bush administration.
The question is whether a future US president might be prepared to break the
long-standing political taboo against energy taxes. Mr Rafe Pomerance of the
Washington-based World Resources Institute, which specialises in climate
change, believes that an EC initiative would ease the US's own concerns
about competitiveness, and add credibility to the concept of a carbon tax:
'1992 could be the year when this concept works its way into the political
debate.' However, this would be too late for Rio.
There is also dissension within the EC itself over the tax.
A big concern in Spain, one of the main opponents of the tax, is the effect
on its languishing coal industry. Other big coal producers, such as the UK
and Germany, have similar reservations. On the other hand, the Netherlands,
which has large deposits of natural gas, a relatively environment-friendly
fuel, is a strong supporter. France, with the largest nuclear power industry
in Europe, also stands to benefit. However, the bargaining over the details
would ensure that the impact was even across member states.
Opponents of the tax are likely to concentrate their fire on remaining
doubts about global warming. Although fears about the greenhouse effect have
gripped the popular imagination, the scientific evidence is still being
reviewed. Earlier this month, the UN's Inter-governmental Panel on Climate
Change revised its forecasts of the greenhouse effect downwards, saying that
the extent of global warming might be 20 per cent less than originally
forecast.
These doubts are shared at high levels within the EC Commission, including
the energy directorate, which is basing its case for the tax on energy
efficiency rather than environmental grounds. Mr Cardoso speaks of the need
to jolt people into better energy habits.
But if energy efficiency is the goal, the EC will still need to persuade
people that a tax is the best way to go about it. The industrial lobbies
have pointed out that there are plenty of other ways of bringing about
energy savings, such as removing subsidies for coal and nuclear power, and
ending tax breaks for car owners.
There are also doubts as to whether the tax would deliver the promised
benefits. Energy consumers have a well-documented capacity for absorbing
price rises. Mr Cardoso admits that he would prefer to introduce the tax all
at once so as to administer the 'price shock' he wants, rather than phase it
in gradually. But this may be politically controversial, and the fact that
the largest energy-consuming industries would be exempted further undermines
the tax's likely impact. The record of Scandinavian countries, which have
already introduced carbon taxes, is inconclusive (see below).
Mr Ripa di Meana, therefore, faces a tough battle. One solution might be to
soothe industry's objections with a commitment that all carbon tax revenues
would be recycled into cuts in corporation tax, or in VAT on insulation and
environment-enhancing materials. In the longer term, EC industry might even
benefit from the changes by becoming more energy-efficient than foreign
competitors.
'This is a chance to update European industry and make it a leader in a
green-oriented market,' says Mr Ripa di Meana. But while broad public
opinion may agree with that view, he will have to convince some powerful
lobbies that his tax is an opportunity as well as a cost.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Tax takes its toll in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's tax on carbon dioxide emissions, introduced last year as part of
wider tax reforms, is being strongly opposed by industry, writes Robert
Taylor.
Already suffering under a recession, the country's industrial groups argue
that the high energy taxes they face put them at a competitive disadvantage
vis-a-vis international rivals.
Among energy taxes, the carbon dioxide tax - aimed at stabilising the amount
of carbon dioxide emissions at the 1990 level until 2000 - is the principal
irritant.
The charge was imposed on carbon dioxide emissions from petrol and diesel
fuel, natural gas, liquefied petroleum and kerosene. The tax amounts to 4
cents per kilogram of CO, in effect a tax increase of 9 cents per litre (22p
per gallon) of petrol. Peat, methanol, ethanol, waste-derived fuel and
biomass have been exempted from the tax. It is estimated that the tax will
raise as much as Dollars 2bn in its first year.
The carbon dioxide tax has added substantially to costs for industrial
consumers: the cost of a cubic metre of heating oil has risen by SKr720, an
increase of 20 per cent; a tonne of coal now costs 40 per cent or SKr620
more; the cost of natural gas has risen by Skr535 per cubic metre, up by 30
per cent; and gasoline costs SKr750 a tonne more, a rise of 20 per cent.
A recent parliamentary investigation into the impact of the energy taxes on
industry recommended that the tax should be cut by as much as 80 per cent.
The study said the tax was costing industry some SKr20bn a year in potential
exports and had already led to the loss of some 10,000 jobs.
But any sweeping reduction of the tax is likely to be resisted by the
pro-environment Centre party, an important member of Sweden's coalition
government.
The government is expected to deliver its response to the parliamentary
committee's recommendations by spring. But a compromise will almost
certainly have to be thrashed out by then to satisfy the competing claims of
industry and that of the Centre party.
The Centre party, whose leader, Mr Olof Johansson, heads the environment
ministry, believes the EC's proposed environmental package itself is not
tough enough.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Facing down the telephone cartel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BLIND SPOT in the UK government's largely enlightened telecommunications
policy has been its failure to introduce competition in international
communications. Last year's White Paper abolished the BT/Mercury
Communications duopoly for domestic communications but did not open the door
to competition for carrying international calls.
Ministers' intentions to open up the international market to 're-sellers' -
which lease telecommunications capacity in bulk and then sell it on to
customers - will go some way to remedy this defect. But the government's
inclination not to allow competitors to build their own networks is
disappointing. The recent licence application by Sprint, the third largest
US long-distance telecommunications carrier, will put this policy to the
test.
The market for international calls, where cartel practices keep call charges
at about three times costs, is more in need of competition than any other
part of the telecommunications sector. Even in the UK, competition between
Mercury and BT has had only a modest success in bringing prices down.
Although re-sale would exert further downward pressure on prices, this is
likely to benefit only large business customers.
Full network competition, on the other hand, would bring benefits to the
whole economy, as well as exerting downward pressure on underlying costs.
The construction of more fibre-optic cables landing in Britain would also
enhance the UK's position as Europe's telecommunications hub.
Paradoxically it is the industry's cartel practices which make it difficult
for the government to open up the market. But doing nothing will only serve
to delay the cartel's demise.
Closed markets
One concern is that most foreign telecommunications markets are closed to
British companies. Rather than use this as an excuse, ministers' response
could be to award licences to those companies which are not able to rig
competition by relying on unfair advantages at home.
Some argue that no foreign governments would pass this test because no
market is fully open. Even the US - and therefore Sprint  - would be barred
because it imposes a heavier regulatory burden on foreign telephone
operators than on US ones.
Such a purist attitude would be a recipe for stagnation. It takes no account
of the fact that the US has recently agreed to change these regulations. It
also ignores the fact that foreign companies are able to operate in the US,
as shown by Cable and Wireless's long distance network and BT's US-based
Syncordia venture which aims to sign up multinational business customers.
Distorting competition
Another concern is that granting a foreign telephone company an
international licence might distort competition in the UK. This is
principally because of the arcane accounting rate system which determines
how much telephone companies in one country pay their counterparts in other
countries for delivering international calls.
The particular fear is that the foreign company would discriminate in favour
of its UK affiliate by charging it less for delivering calls from Britain
than it charges BT and Mercury, and by giving its affiliate all its
international traffic to deliver in the UK, bypassing the British operators.
Again, although such fears have some validity, the response should not be a
blanket ban on new network competition. It is possible to imagine a range of
different safeguards to prevent foreign companies distorting competition in
the UK. Some have already been pioneered in the US market, such as requiring
all international operators to agree the same accounting rates in dealing
with foreign carriers to guard against discrimination.
The government should therefore award full network licences to any
applicants which can show that they will not distort competition. Rather
than being defeatist in the face of cartel practices, it should use its
imagination to open up a part of the market which is crying out for
competition.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: The London Vertigo - Andrew's Lane Theatre, Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What, I wondered anxiously, is Ireland's leading dramatist up to, adapting
an obscure 18th century farce? Do we really need wigs and coxcombs and
cuckolds at a time like this?
It took only a few minutes - up to the moment when John Hurt enters in a
preposterous wig as the outrageously-affected coxcomb - to dispel all
doubts. Brian Friel has cut a bad three-act play down to a very good one-act
play lasting 50 minutes. But why? At first the answer seems to be quite
simply that he is having fun. And why not? The actors enjoyed themselves,
too, and so did the audience, many reduced to tears of laughter.
The London Vertigo is based on a play by the Irish actor and playwright,
Cathal MacLochlainn, alias Charles Macklin, which was warmly received by
Dublin audiences but closed after one disastrous night in London. Born in
the 1690s in a remote part of Donegal as an Irish-speaking Catholic peasant,
MacLochlainn learnt to speak English with an English accent, changed
religion and invented a wealthy, landed background. They loved him in
London, where he was a friend of Garrick and Fielding and his Shylock was
praised by Pope.
The play concerns a less successful effort at changing identity. Murrough
O'Doherty's wife is inflicted with London vertigo on returning from a visit
to that city, has re-named herself Mrs Diggerty, affects an English accent,
covets an English title and is about to cuckold O'Doherty with an English
coxcomb, Count Mushroom. The plot concerns O'Doherty's efforts to cure his
wife and humiliate the coxcomb, a highly-successful endeavour in which he is
helped by his brother-in-law and a maidservant.
The production, by the Gate Theatre, is playing twice nightly in the
220-seater Andrew's Lane while the Gate is being refurbished. The classical
set, by Monica Frawley, makes good use of the tiny stage and the director,
Judy Friel, expands it further by judicious use of 'voices off'. We hear
John Hurt before he enters in an amazing beehive wig which meets its match
only in Mrs Diggerty's monstrous confection. Gemma Craven's fluting voice is
wonderfully suited to the contortions of Mrs B's
more-English-than-the-English accent and slides effortlessly into the
vernacular on demand. Hurt and Craven are an inspired comic duo. The sight
of Count Mushroom, disguised as a laundry-woman attempting to seduce Mrs B,
is funnier, I am sure, than anything in the panto across the road. They are
ably supported by John Kavanagh as the scheming husband, Eamon Morrissey as
his bovine brother-in-law, and Antoine Byrne as the comely serving-wench.
But, in the end, the star of the evening is Friel's adaptation. His
convoluted use of asides adds another dimension to the proceedings and
recalls an earlier success, Philadelphia, Here I Come. And, inevitably, once
the laughing has stopped, one realises that Friel is not simply having fun
but is making another contribution to the age-old, unresolved debate about
the difference between English and Irish identity. Here it is the Irish who
triumph and perhaps that is why the original was such a flop in London. This
version will, I am sure, travel better.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: A man of mystic symbolism - Alan Davie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At well past his 71st, the celebration of Alan Davie's 70th birthday is more
than a little overdue, but none the less welcome for that. He is one of the
most distinguished and significant of painters to emerge in Britain since
the War, perhaps Scotland's outstanding artist of the period. In the late
1940s especially, and through the 1950s, he was as potent as force as any,
as conspicuous as Bacon and Sutherland and yet quite alone in his commitment
to symbolic, expressionist abstraction.
We might well wonder, therefore, why this show does not command the Tate;
and if not the Tate, why not the National Gallery of Modern Art at
Edinburgh, where it was first mooted and then abruptly cancelled. Edinburgh,
where he studied and, for him, a city as long personal association as
Glasgow is short. Yet all has come right in the end, for nowhere but in
Glasgow, close by Macintosh's art school where his father taught just round
the corner into Sauchiehall Street, are there galleries at once so handsome
and spacious enough to do justice to his full life's work.
So Davie's Solo fills the splendid McLellan Galleries until March 22 (then a
gap until Bristol in September). There are several pendant shows: in
Glasgow, of mixed works, at The Compass Gallery (West Regent Street, through
February); and, to be fair, in Edinburgh, of Works on Paper 1959-91 at the
Talbot Rice Gallery (until February 22: a British Council initiative which
tours first to Aberdeen and then extensively around South America), and
Tapestries and Prints at Edinburgh Weavers (until February 29).
He has always shown extensively abroad, most especially in South America;
but in London, had it not been for regular exhibitions with Gimpel Fils, his
dealers since 1950, we should have seen little of him. As for our public
institutions, mixed shows apart, South West Arts gave him a provincial tour
in 1978, the Royal Scottish Gallery a retrospective at the Edinburgh
Festival of 1972. The British Council showed him in Delhi in 1971, the
Graves in Sheffield in 1965. In London the last such show was at the Camden
Arts Centre in 1971, before that a touring retrospective that came to the
Whitechapel in 1959.
Can such indifference have been a mere chance of fashion, a case of a face
not fitting, a body of work suddenly rendered as invisible as the jazz, of
which Davie has always been as devoted a practitioner as he is a painter,
was suddenly inaudible in the cool and raucous, rocking 1960s? Yes, it can.
Davie, like so many prolific and romantic artists, has over-produced
uncritically in his time, and gone through periods of uncertainty and even
failure in his work. Yet good artists are not always the best self-editors,
and a certain unneveness of achievement is hardly surprising in a career now
little short of 50 years.
The truth would seem to be that Davie had the temerity not merely to stick
to a manner, abstract expressionist, that the received wisdom held to be
both out-moded and imitative, but continued with its evolution towards a
specifically symbolic, ultimately figurative imagery. If it is hard to
categorise - ie, if it does not fit  - leave it out. We have only to walk
through this large, splendid show to realise how narrowly mistaken is such a
view.
The earlier work, up to about 1960, is consistently extraordinary and enough
to confirm Davie's importance had there been nothing to follow. Then come
two decades of transition, sometimes tentative, awkward, sometimes sure
enough; and at last, in more recent years, work again of such assurance and
resolution that, its eccentricity notwithstanding, it both validates and is
validated by all that has gone before.
He has always been a mystic and a symbolist, intrigued by sign and totem,
ever drawn into the attempt at sustaining a kind of visual incantation.
Instinctively pantheistic and general in his imaginative references and
associations, he began obviously enough, close to the romantic expressionism
of Chagall and Rouault. By the late 1940s, however, he had abandoned overt
figuration, and while his friendship with Peggy Guggenheim in Venice had
exposed him to the earlier phases of American abstract expressionism,
Pollock especially, he remained firmly European in his sensibility, never
persuaded that the surface, the paint, the mark of itself were ever enough.
Although his own personal and visionary heraldry for a while was subsumed in
the rich paint, the brooding, atmospheric colour and the broad, freely
calligraphic handling - all quite as accomplished as anything of the
Americans of the time - it was never dispensed with altogether. Indeed, it
remained perhaps the more potent in its imaginative charge for being the
more ambiguous, generalised and unspecific. Not by the titles alone, of his
paintings of the 1950s, the Witches' Sabbaths, the sundry creations,
martyrdoms and initiations, do the black paintings of Goya come to mind.
After 1960, even more so after 1970, the colour clears and brightens and
becomes flatter. The pictorial space is now more clearly established, a
curious shallow, somewhat theatrical space or room animated by a strange
menagerie of symbols - a kind of free-floating still-life of moon, snake and
wheel, stripe and chevron. The imaginative source is avowedly Celtic,
Pictish, a conscious evocation of unknowable magic and ancient principle.
And slowly, as it clarifies and becomes specific, so the figuration in the
most recent paintings shifts towards the acknowledged mysticism of the
Buddhist and the Hindu, drawn upon the mannered imaginary landscapes and
gardens of Mughal miniatures and carpets. The later water-colours are
especially strong and beautiful in holding both to the open, general
influence and reference, and the personal integrity. From the pagan Celtic
to the mystical Hindu may seem a strange odyssey, but it is all one.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: The Shadow of a Gunman - Leicester Haymarket Studio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent bombing in Co Tyrone has given a sad, topical edge to Sean
O'Casey's 1923 The Shadow of a Gunman at Leicester. The production carries
its topicality with great tact; it makes the play's issues current yet
preserves the historical moment which O'Casey recorded.
O'Casey based this play, originally On The Run, around a series of raids on
republican 'safe houses' in north Dublin over the Easter weekend, 1921.
O'Casey had links with the IRA through his secretaryship of one of its
constituents, the Irish Citizen Army; and since 1920 the IRA had been
conducting insurgency operations. O'Casey was staying in a dilapidated
Georgian house raided by British forces; he was untouched, but another
tenant was taken away under suspicion of manufacturing bombs.
That real life incident survives in Shadow: a poet and a travelling salesman
share a room in a republican tenement; other inmates drift in and develop
the nationalist cause from various positions: labourers, landlords and
shopgirls. The house is raided, and explosives found in a girl's room.
What emerges is a play about how people make political belief intimate with
their lives, about degrees of activism. O'Casey jokes coolly, bringing the
troubles back home: 'a land mine exploding under your bed is the only thing
that would lift you out of it.' Elsewhere the play's tone alters to a
resigned shrug at the state of Ireland: 'After a bit, a gunman throws a bomb
as carelessly as a schoolboy throws a snowball.' Shadow has the excitement
of Conrad's Secret Agent and the tenderness of Joyce's Dubliners.
Paul Kerryson's scrupulous direction meets the technical demands levied by
O'Casey's staging notes: the poet 'bears upon his body the marks of the
struggle for existence and the efforts towards self expression' and is well
interpreted by John McCormack. Russell Dixon as the salesman, all blarney
and belief, turns in a natural, easy performance, as does Angela Clerkin as
a lovestruck girl willing to hide explosives in her room. Denis Quilligan is
a model of unvarnished respectability as a worried tenant appealing to the
IRA to resolve a domestic broil.
The set follows O'Casey to the letter, creating a decayed room with
collapsible beds; but Charles Cusick-Smith's design successfully
incorporates a bright mural in a rural idyll spattered with blood.
Shadow of a Gunman closed after three nights at The Abbey Theatre, Dublin in
1923. The first night box office was 13. The Irish Times wanted less tragedy
and more satire from the play to increase its longevity. But 70-odd years
on, its plain disillusionment has assumed an aspect of inevitability: 'I
believe in the freedom of Ireland, and that England has no right to be here,
but I draw the line when I hear the gunmen blowin' about dying for the
people, when it's the people that are dyin' for the gunmen'.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: New World Symphony - Barbican Hall/Radio 3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not the Dvorak, but a young Miami-based orchestra - 'America's musical
academy' - inaugurated four years ago by the LSO's conductor Michael Tilson
Thomas: it employs outstanding players who have completed their studies, but
haven't yet joined full-time orchestras. They appeared at the Barbican on
Friday and Sunday. Unfortunately I chose the wrong concert, the second, for
the sake of the advertised Of Men and Mountains by Carl Ruggles (ruggedly
original, almost unknown in Britain). They didn't play it, but replaced it
with Copland's Billy the Kid suite: thin stuff, in all conscience, and not
much of a musical exercise for the band.
It was entertaining to hear, with its gun-battle for percussion near the
end. So was Gershwin's Second Rhapsody, which was a showcase for Tilson
Thomas as solo pianist (hard, brilliant, unrelaxed); the New World players
got to show off their big-band skills. But again, this is little more than
bottom-drawer Gershwin, for all its feverish glitter; and by the interval,
all we had learned about the orchestra was that they are keen and highly
proficient, and that their current first trumpet is quite remarkable.
The serious challenge, and indeed a daunting one, came with the Fourth
Symphony of Charles Ives, in which the London Philharmonic Choir joined. It
is a dense, recklessly inventive work from 1916: plenty of familiar Ives
devices the hymn-tunes, the distorted town bands, the suspended
Impressionism - but used on a grand scale, heedless of performing
difficulties, and to almost supra-musical ends. Certainly it is as much epic
music-theatre as music, for prophetic Transcendentalist fervour supplies its
main drift, in towering waves of sound and fragile, momentary bubbles.
Eddying around it, however, are any number of vivid, disparate musical
ideas, which need to be brought sharply to life if the score is to work.
When I came home and found that the delayed Radio 3 relay was still going
on, I discovered how expertly Tilson Thomas had differentiated Ives'
strands, with ready responses from his players, and how well he directed
them forward. That had been harder to tell at the Barbican. The second and
fourth movements of this symphony pile lines upon lines upon lines, usually
fortissimo; in the bright, up-front acoustic of this hall, they soon clotted
into indeterminate roars. For home listeners, the BBC engineers and their
many microphones sorted that out very well. On the spot, we were impressed
but blankly overwhelmed.

and File
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most significant change in decades to the way UK companies pay tax will
take place next year when the Inland Revenue introduces the Pay and File
system for assessing and collecting corporation tax.
The likely starting date for the new system is September 30, which may
appear a long way off but companies should start preparing now.
Pay and File will have tighter time constraints than the present system, and
will be accompanied by costly fines, according to Paul Morris, senior tax
partner at accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn.
Under the new system companies must pay their estimated tax within nine
months of the end of the accounting period and file returns within 12 months
of that date. There will be no scope to defer settlement, as now, and there
will be no need to wait for the inspector's assessment.
The penalties start modestly but for tax returns which are between six and
12 months late the penalty is Pounds 200 and 10 per cent of the unpaid tax.
Returns which are more than 12 months late will incur a higher penalty
still. There is no need for the Revenue to prove fraud or negligence.
Since few companies will know their exact liability for tax nine months
after the end of the accounting period the Revenue will charge interest on
underpayments and pay interest on overpayments. The new scheme should reduce
the large sums which the taxman is at present unable to collect because the
company has appealed.
Subsidiaries of larger groups will be able to set their tax liability
against losses made elsewhere within the group. Claims against tax must be
made within two years of the end of the claiming company's accounting period
or before its tax liabilities have been agreed, if this is later.
Companies most likely to be adversely affected by these changes are those
which are poor at collecting tax information or which require a great deal
of manual effort to get their numbers together.
Companies should start preparing now to upgrade their systems to take
account of the new tax regime, says Paul James, a director of BDO
Consulting. He recommends:
Do your tax calculations once only. At present many companies do their sums
quickly for the purposes of the audit and then recalculate the numbers more
carefully for tax purposes.
Plan to have 95 per cent of the information you need ready in the first four
months after your year end, so you can plan your tax strategy.
Over the next four months complete the collection of information and
finalise your strategy in time to pay the tax by the nine-month deadline.
Complete your calculations and file your computation with the taxman by the
12-month deadline.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Small firms get clubbed
to death - Is another business network is really necessary?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does Britain need yet another network of business organisations to advise
and comfort its struggling small firms community? Tom Moffat, the energetic
chairman of the Durham Small Business Club,* is convinced it does.
Moffat last week launched a plan for a nationwide network of professionally
managed, commercially run small business clubs. He hopes to have 20 member
clubs by start-up date on April 1 but he is prepared to go ahead with a
dozen.
The idea for Small Business Clubs Nationwide is based on the model of the
Durham club. Established 11 years ago it now has 400 members, a staff of 20
and turnover in its last year of nearly Pounds 1.2m.
There are already several hundred business clubs dotted around the country
but most are voluntary, part-time organisations dependent on the enthusiasm
and spare time of their managing committees. Some have the backing of local
professional firms. Grant Thornton, a medium-sized firm of accountants,
supports 16 business clubs. But most of the local clubs wax and wane
depending on the level of amateur, local support.
Moffat's plan is to put in place a more professionally organised group of
clubs which can pay their own way by providing advice and training services
to small firms. They would employ full-time staff and would not be subject
to the pressures on voluntary organisations.
This plan has not met with unbounded enthusiasm from some of the existing
organisations in this field. The chambers of commerce, which are to beef up
their own national network, have reacted cautiously and are 'watching'
developments, says Moffat.
The chambers currently have problems enough bringing their own organisation
into the 1990s and establishing a working relationship with the newly formed
Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) without an additional challenge from
an aggressive business club movement.
Moffat, who runs a publishing and printing business employing eight people,
believes many small firms find the chambers too formal or too expensive to
meet their needs. 'Mrs Cannybody making cuddly toys is not catered for,'
says Moffat. But the club network he envisages is not just intended to
provide a home for the micro-business. Moffat sees their role as providing
vital support for the 96 per cent of growing businesses employing fewer than
20 people.
He envisages the clubs ultimately forming part of a three-tier support
network with start-ups helped by the enterprise agencies, smaller
established businesses belonging to a club and larger businesses belonging
to a chamber.
The chambers reject Moffat's charge that they do not meet the needs of the
smaller business. 'Well over 70 per cent of our membership employ fewer than
50 people,' says Ronnie Jacobson, marketing manager at the London Chamber of
Commerce.
The London chamber charges a minimum annual subscription of Pounds 295
compared with the Pounds 30-Pounds 35 Moffat envisages for businesses which
belong to a club in his organisation. But Jacobson says this fee represents
good value for money for the chamber's range of services, including a
library, help with exports and trade.
The Moffat plan would involve founder member clubs paying Pounds 2,500 for a
shareholding in Small Business Clubs Nationwide plc. Twenty members are
needed to raise the Pounds 50,000 start-up capital required to obtain plc
status. The organisation could start on an unincorporated basis with fewer
members. Member clubs would also pay Pounds 5 a year for each business
member to the central organisation. In return they would share in any
profits. Moffat believes the idea will appeal to councils, universities and
colleges, TECs chambers of commerce and banks or accountants keen to foster
small business networks in their area.
The idea for a national network received a mixed response from more than 70
representatives of small business organisations at meetings held in London
and Durham last week. About 25 participants said they were interested in the
idea in principle.
Mike Duckett, business enterprise manager of Shropshire TEC, said he could
see few benefits for the end user - the small business  - from the creation
of a nationwide network. Shropshire TEC sees its priority as supporting the
six business clubs set up in the county by providing backing to the start-up
businesses which are club members.
Letchworth Business Club, a voluntary organisation with nearly 400 members,
was also not convinced that there were sufficient benefits from a nationwide
scheme. Regional groupings of clubs might be more appropriate and respond to
the local preoccupations of many small firms, said Philip Harkness,
chairman.
Moffat's plan is ambitious and runs counter to recent trends in small
business thinking which have favoured a simplification of the small business
support network. Too many competing organisations merely confuse small
business owners, this argument goes.
But Moffat, an electrical engineer by training, is a determined man. He
likes to cite the parallel of Durham County Cricket club, for which he once
played and of which he is now a director.
Apart from local enthusiasts few people gave much chance of Durham, for its
108 years a minor cricketing county, winning promotion to the first-class
county league. But a carefully managed campaign in which Moffat was involved
saw Durham win acceptance to first-class cricket in 1990 and its first match
at the top level against Lancashire next April. 'People said that was an
impossible dream too,' he says.

Britain's small firms should be queuing up to raise venture capital. Their
bankers are reluctant to lend and their balance sheets need a boost. In fact
the venture capital industry appears to be struggling to attract new
customers.
3i, the largest UK venture capital group and frequently a bellwether for the
industry, yesterday announced plans to target companies in the London area
with the launch of a Pounds 75m Greater London Growth Fund.
It expects to help 150 companies with sums of between Pounds 100,000 and
Pounds 5m over the next two years. Many growing companies are unaware that
long-term investment finance is available because of the venture capital
industry's emphasis on management buy-outs and the larger deals, 3i said.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology: Added-value fax service under starter's orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yamato Transport, Japan's largest door-to-door parcel delivery company, is
trying to get the most out of its central distribution system by selling
services that operate on the company's distribution mainframe computer.
It has installed a facsimile messaging and information system at retail
outlets. The service was set up just over a year ago and the company has
already installed 5,000 Panasonic fax machines in stores.
Yamato's system is one example of the fax services available to Japanese
users as a result of the growing liberalisation of telecommunications.
The Yamato messaging system enables users to send and receive fax messages
at any of the stores where a machine is installed. Yamato says a typical
customer would be an executive away from the office who needs to get hold of
a document quickly, or to send one.
The service also provides information from a menu including horse racing
results, baseball scores and tourist information - in English or Japanese. A
shopping information sheet, for example, would include details of how to get
to a particular area, a list of shop phone numbers and a map of the
district, including the main stores and subway lines.
The service also operates a central system for companies which need to fax
the same document to several people. Information such as a company's list of
customers, suppliers and their fax numbers is stored on Yamato's computer.
The user can key in a request, from their own fax machine, for a document to
be sent to all of its suppliers, for example. This will be done
automatically. Customers have to register with Yamato as fax users. Personal
codes are keyed in to the fax machine and users are billed later.
At the moment, the service contributes only a tiny proportion of revenues -
less than 1 per cent  - and the company says it will take three years before
it moves into profit.
Yamato is planning for 50,000-60,000 users a day by 1995. The company has
released no figures on the current number of users, although it says 10,000
customers would be a good day.
Setting up the service cost Y3bn (Pounds 13.5m) including installation of
the first 5,000 machines. Running costs include the use of NTT phone lines.
The fax machines are leased by Yamato and most of the information used by
the service is provided free in return for advertising on the fax sheets.
Stores where fax machines are installed receive a commission fee.
Competition is so far limited to only a few small operators. 'It would be a
problem if NTT got into it,' says Katsuhiko Saiki of Yamato.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology: A short life on the shelf - How 7-Eleven in
Japan uses customer information to sell more goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven-Eleven Japan, the convenience store chain, likes to know its customers
intimately. Its recently upgraded point-of-sales (Pos) system helps to
ensure this is the case.
Checkout assistants key into the checkout terminals the age and sex of each
customer as they key in the price of goods. The company says the information
means it can stock the products its customers want to buy.
Establishing a customer's sex should be straightforward. Age is more of a
problem. 7-Eleven's youthful team of checkout assistants must guess a
customer's age within five bands: Under 13, 13-19, 20-29, 30-49 and over 50.
Each is a distinct consumer group with different needs and spending
patterns, according to the marketing theory.
7-Eleven says that analysing the data enables each of the chain's 4,500
stores in Japan to tailor its stock to the local market and compete more
effectively with large retailers. If the store is near a school it will
stock items that students are likely to want; if it is in a residential area
it will stock more household goods.
Mini-computers have been installed in all of the stores (franchises as well
as directly-run outlets). A time-switch on the computer produces two graphs
overlaid every two hours: the age/sex profile is laid over the latest stock
and sales position. The graphics give store managers a snapshot that should
improve their ability to make accurate decisions about what stock to buy.
Slow-moving goods or dead stock are swiftly removed from the shelves.
7-Eleven stores in Japan typically stock about 3,000 products per 100 sq
metres of shop space. The lifecycle for any product can be short - about 70
per cent are changed in a year. The company has increased sales and reduced
inventories as a result of its attention to customer profile and inventory
control.
The latest upgrading also includes graphic ordering terminals. These
hand-held consoles with tiny graphic screens enable swift and well-informed
ordering from the shop floor. Inventory scanners have also been introduced.
Bar codes on deliveries are scanned and the information is fed into the
store's mini-computer.
Before the scanners, a warehouse worker ticked off goods against a computer
print-out. Information can be exchanged between the mini-computers, graphic
ordering terminals and cash registers. The mini-computers are also linked to
the central distribution system.
The company's latest Pos system was installed 14 months ago. It will be
upgraded between April and July this year.
7-Eleven's Pos system has been converted partly to digital technology which
enables the transmission of voice, data and graphic information using phone
lines. Much of the network still operates on a traditional analogue network.
The company is planning to covert the whole system to an integrated services
digital network (ISDN) over the next few years.
7-Eleven's head office, stores and distribution centres were connected to a
central computer in August 1979. Since then, it has exploited the network at
a breathtaking pace. In 1981, the company installed a computerised Pos
system with terminals at each store.
A four-temperature (hot for rice, cool for noodles, chilled for milk, frozen
for ice cream), delivery and distribution system was tagged on to the system
in 1984, linking wholesalers and producers.
In 1986, new checkout terminals were brought in, allowing data
communications between individual stores and suppliers. In 1988, 7-Eleven
customers were able to pay their electricity and gas bills at the
neighbourhood store - bills include bar codes that can be read by terminals
at 7-Eleven stores.
The Pos upgrading to be installed this spring will bring in equipment for
the launch of 7-Eleven's joint venture with Shop America, a US-based direct
mail catalogue sales operation. A nine-inch, double-sided screen will be
attached to existing checkout terminals, one side facing the checkout and
the other the customer.
Customers will be able to order from a range of foreign-made goods direct
from the US at any 7-Eleven check-out. Information about an item  - prices
and availability - will show up on the screen.
The screens would also be able to display, for example, the plan of a
theatre, enabling a customer to choose seats and order tickets at the
checkout.
Investment in 7-Eleven's latest Pos installation and the upgrading this
spring will cost the company Y35bn (Pounds 160m).
7-Eleven Japan's parent company, Ito-Yokado, is eager to export the Japanese
chain's retailing methods to the US, where 7-Eleven was founded. Last year,
Ito-Yokado took control of Southland, the Dallas-based convenience store
group which runs 7,000 shops in the US and nearly 2,000 in 20 other
countries. Ito-Yokado made clear at the time it would want to teach the
troubled US chain (from which the original 7-Eleven Japan licensing rights
were bought) how to run convenience stores.
Don Cowan, publicity manager for 7-Eleven in the US, says tests are under
way to determine what kind of system might work best in America, but it is
'some distance away' from an advanced network.
'No one knows yet whether or not what is effective in Japan would work the
same in the US,' says Cowan.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology: Counting on cellular customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market research predictions in the UK mobile phone business have rarely
borne relation to the eventual size of the business. With cellular radio in
particular, pundits greatly underestimated the number of potential
subscribers.
With this in mind, Unitel, one of the licensees for personal communications
networks (PCNs), which should begin services in 1993, has chosen a novel way
of more accurately evaluating the market.
'All the research in the past has been based on what consumers think they
will do,' points out Andy Sukawaty, Unitel's chief operating officer. 'But
it's impossible to quantify what people will do just by asking them.' In
addition, points out Sukawaty, research in the past has concentrated on how
many people will buy portable phones, not on how many calls they will make.
Instead of asking people what they intend to do Unitel selected some 400
potential domestic and small business users in three areas where the
existing cellular radio was of high quality and gave each of them one of the
latest hand portable cellphones. They then charged them for the subscription
and calls as if they were PCN users.
One of the most striking results of the survey was the number of users who,
once the initial three-month trial was over, wanted to keep the phones -
some 250 of them.
As a result of the survey Unitel has concluded that the potential exists for
1.88m households in the UK to subscribe to PCN and a further 436,000 small
businesses.
Unitel also concluded that PCN would increase the usage of the phone
generally. Before the trial began the customers spent an average 230 minutes
on the phone every month, but that rose to 300 minutes a month with the
mobile phone.
Although the usage of the ordinary BT line went down to 200 minutes a month,
Sukawaty points out that BT's revenues are likely to increase rather than
decrease because most of the calls will use BT lines for part of the
journey.

FT  28 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): NHS accused of sexism over top posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEXIST stereotyping about the abilities and 'natural' role of women is
preventing them from being appointed to top health authority jobs, according
to a report published yesterday.
Only one of the UK's 14 regional health authorities is chaired by a woman
and only 16 per cent of district health authorities are chaired by women. Of
the first 57 newly formed National Health Service trusts, only three are
headed by women.
Earlier this month the Department of Health said that all shortlists for
senior NHS management jobs should include female candidates. Targets were
also set for increasing the number of general management posts held by women
from 18 per cent to 30 per cent.
Yesterday's report from the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts and the King's Fund Centre is being backed by Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
the health minister.
It found that informal procedures and the 'old boy network' worked against
the selection of women. Suitable women could be found if they were sought
out and government ministers should take the lead and set targets for
regions, said the report.
It pointed out that not only were women primary users of public health
services, they also represented 79 per cent of the NHS's 1.2m employees. The
purpose was not to fill quotas but to obtain a better service for those who
worked in and used the NHS, the report concluded.
It found that Department of Health leaflets used to recruit non-executive
directors could put up barriers. Statements such as 'you must be able to
bring . . . up-to-date specialist knowledge on any number of particular
business areas', or 'you will probably still be at work in industry,
commerce, the public sector or the professions' were seen by the researchers
as restrictive.
Where are the 'good' women? NAHAT, Birmingham Research Park, Vincent Drive,

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ULSTER accountant appeared in court in Belfast yesterday accused of
false-accounting offences dating back almost 10 years.
William James Johnston, 50, of Ballygallum Road, Downpatrick, faces charges
of falsifying financial statements and was freed on bail totalling Pounds
60,000.
Among the charges, Mr Johnston is accused of submitting false statements to
the Department of Health and Social Services and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary regarding the registration of four West Belfast social clubs
between 1987 and 1989.
Mr Johnston's lawyer said his client would be vigorously contesting all the
charges against him and he is expected to appear in court again on February
3.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Reports of water pollution double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS OF water pollution in England and Wales more than doubled in the
1980s, according to the National Rivers Authority, David Lascelles writes.
The NRA's first compilation of annual statistics yesterday showed that there
were 28,143 reports in 1990, up from 12,600 in 1981. The biggest increase
came in the Northumbria region, where reports rose 57 per cent between 1988
and 1990.
The largest category of reports concerned oil and sewage spills, with each
accounting for just over 20 per cent of the total. Farm incidents accounted
for 11 per cent and industrial incidents 10 per cent.
The NRA pointed out that only a very small proportion of the reported
incidents - 658 in 1990 - could be classed as 'major', involving extensive
fish deaths or the temporary closure of a public water intake.
Dr Jan Pentreath, the NRA chief scientist, said: 'It is important to note
from the figures that the majority of reported incidents are of a minor
nature and that many are not confirmed when investigating officers visit the
scene. On such occasions no legal action can be taken.'
During 1990 the NRA took 282 incidents to court and secured convictions in
272 of them. Dr Pentreath said prosecution was a 'cat-and-mouse game'
because samples had to be collected at the time of the incident, before the
pollution disappeared - and with it the evidence.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Fraud office to press for court transcript
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office is to challenge a High Court judge's ruling that it
cannot see the transcript of an examination of Mr Muhammad Naviede, head of
Arrows, the Cheshire-based trade finance company that was compulsorily wound
up in December.
The SFO has charged Mr Naviede with obtaining Pounds 10m by deception from
NMB Postbank, a Dutch company. The criminal proceedings before City of
London magistrates court were adjourned last week until June 15.
The ruling was obtained by the liquidators of Arrows - Mr Scott Martin and
Mr Nigel Hamilton, of Ernst &amp; Young - after they had been granted an order
under section 236 of the Insolvency Act requiring Mr Naviede to attend for
examination.
The liquidators asked the High Court to rule that they would not have to
disclose the transcript of Mr Naviede's evidence to the SFO because they
feared that without such a ruling - the SFO having refused to give an
assurance that it would not seek disclosure - Mr Naviede would not
co-operate with them.
The issue required Mr Justice Hoffmann to consider the apparently
conflicting rights and duties of the SFO under the 1987 Criminal Justice Act
and of liquidators under the Insolvency Act.
He held that the SFO's right to demand information for a fraud investigation
could be restricted by the court to the extent that it was outweighed by an
overriding public interest in secrecy.
Mr Naviede is to seek to have the order for his examination set aside,
raising the privilege against self-incrimination. His application has been
deferred until after the Court of Appeal's judgment on Wednesday on an
appeal by Mr Kevin Maxwell against a High Court decision that he has no
right to silence in proceedings brought under the Insolvency Act.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Oil output value falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of UK oil production fell heavily last month in spite of an
increase in production.
The fall is confirmed in the latest Royal Bank of Scotland Oil Index, which
shows that the value of North Sea production was down 14 per cent last month
compared with November.
The decline in revenue resulted from a combination of falling world oil
prices and weakness of the dollar, which left the sterling oil price at
about pounds 10 a barrel.
The average daily value of North Sea oil production fell sharply late last
year from pounds 26.4m in October to pounds 20.3m in December.

SHEFFIELD'S steelmaking and engineering companies have asked the government
to cushion the shock of what they say will be 20 per cent increases in
electricity prices from April, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
Some say they have experienced 40 per cent rises, and higher costs are
forcing them out of tightening markets.
In an open letter to Mr John Major, the prime minister, manufacturers in a
30-mile radius of Sheffield suggest that the government could relieve
Sheffield's intensive industrial electricity consumers of the fossil fuel
levy.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the generating industry's regulator, has

US business confidence rose sharply in January, reversing a three-month
decline, figures indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
Cahners Economics, a Massachusetts-based consultancy group, said its index
rose to 63.2, compared with 56.1 in December. It was the largest increase
since the group began tracking business plans last June, when the index read
62.5.
Mr Kermit Baker, Cahners' chief economist, said confidence was being revived
across the US. 'While the trend is uneven, with consumer product and service
sectors lagging, this is the first hard evidence that a recovery in
manufacturing can begin in early to mid-1992 - earlier than many forecasters
are predicting.'

FT  28 JAN 92 / Jordan keeps a wary eye on the Islamic surge in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVENTS in Algeria are being monitored closely in Jordan, which is itself
taking first democratic steps and which also has an influential Islamic
movement vying for power through the ballot box.
There are already strong indications that the Moslem Brotherhood, the
Ikhwan, will dominate the 80-seat parliament after elections in November -
thanks in part to the disarray of its left-wing and pan-Arabist rivals.
For many political analysts in Amman, Algeria offers a salutary warning to
Jordan's political leaders, who will seek to avoid being caught between
allowing the Brotherhood to take over parliament and a disruption to the
fledgling democratic process.
Two years ago, in the last polls, the Brotherhood rose to prominence by
winning a third of the seats in the parliament. It received a substantial
boost from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) victory in Algeria - the more
so since the military-backed cancellation of Algeria's second round poll is
widely felt to have eroded the credibility of Arab leaders' attempts to
introduce democracy.
Algeria and Jordan cannot be directly compared, however, and some analysts
argue that Amman's system has enough safety valves to prevent outright
confrontation between the Brotherhood and King Hussein.
While the FIS emerged in the 1980s as an alternative movement to the ruling
National Liberation Front in Algeria, for instance, Jordan's King always
allowed the Brotherhood a special status for having supported him during the
1950s against Arab left-wingers and radicals.
Moreover, the Brotherhood's leaders have constantly sought to avoid
confrontation with the state and have opted in the past to use its
privileged status to take influential positions in government institutions.
However, relations between the palace and the Brotherhood have grown
increasingly strained over the past few years as King Hussein has publicly
attacked the movement's efforts to change the country's relatively liberal
lifestyle. The Brotherhood has found itself further alienated from the King
since his reconciliation with former radical opponents and his decision to
enter peace talks with Israel last October.
According to some members of the Brotherhood, the movement's most prominent
leaders are concerned to retain a conciliatory policy towards the King. But
they are coming under pressure from an increasingly militant power base.
In response to events in Algeria, the Brotherhood has found room within
itself for both radical and moderating voices. The movement has attacked the
cancellation of elections in Algeria as 'usurpation of power from
Islamicists', though some officials from the movement have also criticised
FIS for 'confrontational tactics'.
For its part, the palace remains wary about the movement's declared aim of
establishing an Islamic state in Jordan, despite the fact that more radical
members of the Brotherhood criticise its leaders for 'co-option' into the
state.

<TEXT>
MR Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general of the African National Congress
(ANC), yesterday criticised Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president,
for failing to act against security force death squads which have targeted
anti-apartheid activists.
Former members of the South African Defence Force and the police have
alleged that security force members have been involved in hundreds of deaths
of activists in recent years. 'We have reason to believe he (Mr de Klerk)
knows and has known all along. . . and has done nothing to stop it,' Mr
Ramaphosa told journalists in Cape Town.
Mr Roelf Meyer, the defence minister, denied the claims and urged Mr
Ramaphosa to present evidence to a government commission of inquiry.
Mr Ramaphosa took a more conciliatory line on key political issues such as
interim government. He indicated that the ANC was willing to negotiate with
the government over the issue of a proposed white referendum to approve
constitutional changes which would end white domination.
Previously ANC leaders have ruled out the referendum, which would give
whites a veto over political change. He also appeared willing to negotiate
with Pretoria over the issue of electing blacks to an interim parliament.

FT  28 JAN 92 / World Trade News: VW to double capacity at Shanghai factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German car maker, is planning to more than double the
capacity of its joint-venture assembly plant in Shanghai to 150,000 cars a
year by 1995.
VW said yesterday that Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive, in which it holds a
50 per cent stake, would invest around DM1bn (Pounds 300m) over the next
four years to increase capacity and widen its product range.
Output of VW Santana saloon cars at the plant at Anting near Shanghai jumped
last year to 35,000, from 18,500 in 1990. The company is planning to
increase output in 1992 to 60,000 cars, the full capacity of the existing
plant.
The other shareholders in Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive are Shanghai
Automobile Industries Corporation (25 per cent), the Shanghai branch of the
Bank of China (15 per cent) and China International Automobile Industries
Corporation (10 per cent).
At the beginning of January, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive took over the
out-dated Shanghai Car Plant from Shanghai Automobile Industries, and this
facility will be modernised to provide the extra capacity.
The equity capital of Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive is to be increased in
stages in coming years to DM350m from DM105m at present. VW said the company
had now reached a local content level of almost 70 per cent. Shanghai
Volkswagen has a workforce of 3,800 and has invested DM500m between 1985 and
1990. Cumulative output will pass 100,000 this week.

HARD on the heels of Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Rome this week,
Technimont, the plant building subsidiary of Italy's Montedison chemicals
group, has won an Dollars 150m (Pounds 82.8m) order for a new ethylene plant
in Canton.
The contract, signed yesterday with three Chinese state entities, envisages
that the new plant, which will have an output of 130,000 tonnes of ethylene
a year, will begin production in 1995.
Production will be used to supply other facilities on the same site, to
produce a variety of petrochemicals products including polyethylene and
polypropylene.
China's current Five-Year Plan allows for building of 14 petrochemicals and
10 fertiliser facilities and has sparked considerable competition among
specialist contracting groups.
The latest deal, won against French and Japanese competition, consolidates
Technimont's position in China, where it has now either built or won orders
for 14 petrochemicals and fertiliser facilities worth around Pounds L720bn
(Pounds 333m). The latest deal takes the company's order book to around
L1,500bn.
Some 15 per cent of the value of the order has been made as a cash
down-payment, with the balance coming in the form of a 10-year export
credit, dating from the start of production, and guaranteed by SACE, the
Italian state agency which provides medium and long-term risk cover.

power order
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN international consortium including Howden Group Canada, part of the
Scottish engineering company, and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power
engineering group, has won a Dollars 770m (Pounds 425.4m) turnkey contract
to build a 1,100MW power station in western Iran.
The contract is the first important project for GEC Alsthom in Iran since
the end of the Iran/Iraq war, and one of the biggest announced in the Middle
East since the end of the Gulf War. Over the past year, Iran has been
reactivating several projects in thermal and hydroelectric power generation.
GEC Alsthom said it had won 'the major part' of the contract, while Howden
said its share was Dollars 121m. Other members of the so-called Ontario
Group consortium include Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Canada and Italy's Nuova
Cimimontubi.
The project, at Arak, is for Tavanir, the Iranian electric utility.
Construction will begin later this year and the new station is due to be
fully operational by 1996.
GEC Alsthom and Howden will be responsible for design and supply of the
turbine island, which includes two 550MW steam turbines and generators,
air-cooled condensers and a high voltage sub-station.
The steam turbines are specially designed to meet the requirements of the
large air-cooled condensers, which are necessary because of scarce water
supplies.
Delivery of the Howden components will start in the second half of 1993 and
take two years to complete. The GEC Alsthom equipment will be made at
factories in Rugby and Stafford, and in Belfort, France.
Financing and insurance for the project is to come from the export credit
agencies of the consortium's member-countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government is aiming for an exchequer borrowing requirement of
IPounds 546m (Pounds 509m) or around 2.2 per cent of GNP, in its 1992 budget
due to be announced tomorrow. This would be slightly up on 2.1 per cent of
GNP in 1991.
Pre-budget estimates of receipts and expenditure, published by the Finance
Ministry yesterday show a projected increase of 7.7 per cent in total
government spending to IPounds 10.6bn, with revenues rising by 4.7 per cent
to IPounds 9.9bn.
Public pay and pensions is expected to account for IPounds 3.72bn of the
spending total, taking into account a new pay package agreed with public
sector unions earlier this month.
Under existing tax provisions and estimates, income tax revenue is projected
to rise by 9.6 per cent to IPounds 3.54bn, while corporation tax revenue is
targeted to rise by 13.6 per cent to IPounds 673m. A 7 per cent increase in
VAT revenues to IPounds 2.2bn is anticipated.
The government has come under increasing pressure from trade union and
business sectors to launch sweeping tax reforms in the 1992 budget. Earlier
this month, the Industrial Policy Review Group (IPRG), an advisory body to
the Department of Industry, said tax reform was 'a matter of urgency'.
The report recommended the phased reduction or elimination of a wide range
of tax breaks and incentives, in order to bring down personal taxation rates
among the highest in the EC.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, said last month there was little
prospect of any tax cuts in this budget, though his own Fianna Fail party is
recommending a reduction in the lower income tax rate from 29 to 28 per
cent, and a reduction in the top rate from 52 to 50 per cent.
The party is strongly opposed to any reduction in mortage interest relief.
Mr Des O'Malley, the industry minister who set up the IPRG last year, is
strongly in favour of tax reform. As the leader of the Progressive Democrat
party, the junior partner in the coalition government, he last week issued
an ultimatum to Mr Charles Haughey, the prime minister, to resign or lose
his party's support, because of a series of controversies that have
undermined the government. Mr Haughey is expected to announce his intention
to resign this Thursday.
Mr Ahern, who became finance minister last November, is a leading contender
for the succession to Mr Haughey, and the public's reception of his first
budget could have an important influence on his chances of assuming the
leadership.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Socialists suffer in French by-elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S governing Socialist party took a hammering over the weekend in six
by-elections which also saw a sharp increase in the vote for the extreme
right-wing National Front.
The results of the by-elections (one national and five local) indicate that
the Socialists are in deep trouble despite a recent small reduction in the
record unpopularity of President Francois Mitterrand and his prime minister,
Mrs Edith Cresson. The party also faces the prospect of serious losses in
nationwide regional and local elections in March.
The National Front, by contrast, appears likely to make significant strides
in those elections, since in each of the weekend's by-elections its
candidate won between 13 and 16 per cent of the vote. This represents a
large advance over the 9.6 per cent gained nationally in the 1988 general
election. Moreover the consistency of these latest results suggests that the
Front is becoming increasingly established throughout France.
The party's weekend showing is still well short of the 20 per cent which the
Front claims is its national target for the March elections. But few
observers would now dismiss this target as absurd, and in some regions with
large immigrant communities, like Marseilles, it could be quite plausible.
The pattern was most striking in the first round of voting for the
by-election to the National Assembly seat near Lille in northern France.
Support for the Socialist candidate collapsed to under 13 per cent, compared
with more than 31 per cent in 1988; the National Front surged to second
place with 15.7 per cent, compared with 10.4 per cent in 1988. The Front
candidate thus qualified for the run-off in the second round against a
centrist, who won nearly 47 per cent.
In the first round of voting in the local election at Bischwiller near
Strasbourg, two candidates - from the National Front and a dissident extreme
right-wing party - shared more than 22 per cent of the vote. The Socialist
candidate came fifth.
The Socialist party was forced into fourth place at Quesnoy-sur-Deule in the
Nord, behind the National Front and the Greens, and it lost the cantons of
Lons-le-Saunier in the Jura, and of La Verpillere in the Isere.
French unemployment stabilised at 9.8 per cent last month, holding out hopes
that the government is starting to bring its most serious economic problem
under control, adds William Dawkins.
The number out of work rose slightly by 0.05 per cent month-on-month, to
2.82m, representing an 11.7 per cent rise in those seeking a job over the
past year. This was a 'positive result' said Mrs Martine Aubry, labour
minister.
However, the outlook for industry continues to be dull, according to a poll
of senior executives published yesterday by Insee, the state statistics
body. In the six-monthly poll 17 per cent believed their profits were poor
or unsatisfactory at the end of last year.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Commission opposes move to trade airport landing slots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRLINES SHOULD be allowed to buy and sell the rights to land at European
airports, according to an advisory report prepared for the European
Commission. Its suggestions conflict with the views of the Commission, which
favours a more interventionist approach to prevent large airlines dominating
airport landing slots.
The way in which landing slots are allocated is a central part of proposals
for EC airline liberalisation. It is of pressing importance because several
European airports, including London's Heathrow, Frankfurt and Milan, cannot
satisfy the demands of airlines wanting to land there.
Such under-capacity shuts out newcomers to the industry. In the interests of
competition, the UK government last year forced the transfer of slots from
British Airways to a much smaller competitor, Virgin Atlantic, on the
lucrative London-to-Tokyo route.
So-called slot trading, as recommended in the report, could replace a system
of allocations based on scheduling committees and biannual meetings of
international carriers under the auspices of the International Air Transport
Association (Iata).
The report argues that slot trading at four of the busiest airports in the
US 'has had a beneficial effect in securing a more efficient use of limited
airport capacity'. It quotes airlines as saying that the system had helped
them 'fine tune' their schedules, but adds that 'slot trading needs to be
part of a strong pro-competition policy'.
It recommends that independent brokers should be set up to trade slots.
'This would prevent the manipulation of the slots in an anti-competitive
way,' said Mr David Starkie, author of the report, yesterday. 'An airline
would not know who it was selling to and so would not be able to stop a sale
to a particular operator.'
His views have the support, in principle, of British Airways. 'The current
procedure should be amended to allow airlines to buy and sell existing . . .
slots,' says the airline.
However Mr Bruno Julien of the EC's Transport Commission said: 'We do not
favour such a system. The strongest would always be able to get the best
slots. This would not help liberalisation of the market.'
The EC wants, instead, to encourage airports to increase slot capacity and
proposes that under-used slots are re-allocated to other airlines every six
months.
It is not alone in its scepticism about a free market in slots. US airport
operators protest that slot trading might divert attention from other ways
of dealing with under-capacity such as more efficient air traffic control.
The cost of buying slots might also be passed on to passengers through
higher fares.
Proponents of a free market are also likely to face opposition from EC
member states and companies. Last month, the UK parliamentary transport
committee concluded that existing mechanisms were 'a workable, if imperfect
method of allocating slots'. It said that changes would be evolutionary,
suggesting that unused slots could be 'returned to the scheduling committee
for reallocation'.
'The EC proposals have not yet been fully debated,' conceded the Transport
Commission. Advocates for both sides are due to get their chance when the
matter comes up for consideration by the Council of Ministers. This should
happen before the end of the Portuguese presidency of the Commission in
July, the Transport Commission said.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Poland secures vital gas deal from Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
POLAND has won a new agreement with Russia which should guarantee gas
supplies and get Polish heavy industry working again, an embassy official
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Ms Agnes Niszesta, Polish embassy press attache in Moscow, said yesterday
Russia had agreed to provide Poland with 7.6bn cubic metres of natural gas
in 1992, below a previous agreement for 8.1bn but above an earlier offer of
6.1bn.
'It is not as much as we wanted, but enough for our industry,' she said. New
gas supplies would start to arrive from February 1.
All of Poland's heavy industry and most of its chemical plants have been
idle since last week because of gas shortages caused by lower Russian
supplies and higher demand for energy as temperatures fell.
The 180 large-scale idle factories, which account for 70 per cent of Polish
industrial gas consumption, were using just enough gas to prevent damage to
machinery from freezing temperatures.
Household users of gas have not been affected by the cuts but their
increased usage in the cold weather has depleted supplies to industry.
Steel mills and fertiliser plants have been the worst hit, although these
sectors had already sharply lowered production over the past two years as a
result of Poland's recession.
Ms Niszesta said the new deal was sealed in Moscow this week after an
emergency meeting between Russian authorities and Mr Adam Glapinski, the
Polish foreign trade minister
The original deal, agreed in December and worth about Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds
1.5bn), guaranteed Poland supplies of 8.1bn cubic metres of natural gas and
5m tonnes of oil in 1992 in return for food, sulphur, coal and medicines.
But Russia cut gas deliveries on January 1, days after the barter deal had
been agreed.
Poland is sensitive to any disruption of gas supplies from Russia as it
depends entirely on a pipeline network inherited from the now-defunct
Soviet-led Comecon trade organisation.
Gas supplies have been running at some 45 per cent below agreed levels since
the beginning of the year. Gas imports reached 7bn cubic metres last year,
with deliveries restricted to pipelines linking Poland with the Siberian gas
fields.
Alternative supplies are impossible until new pipelines are built to the
North Sea oil and gas fields. Talks with Statoil the Norwegian supplier are
expected soon.
The position on oil is not quite as worrying as the Soviet Union accounts
for just 57 per cent of Polish oil imports. However, deliveries from the
Soviet Union ceased altogether last month after only 125,000 tonnes out of
an agreed 5m tonnes for the year had been delivered.
Poland has alternative supplies of oil from Iran and Saudi Arabia as well as
the North Sea, all of which can come be pumped through the Gdansk oil
terminal on the Baltic. Last year Poland imported 11.5m tonnes of oil, with
6.5m coming from the former Soviet Union.

CUSTOMS brokers, faced with redundancy when European Community frontier
controls are abolished next year, yesterday attempted to focus attention on
their case by refusing to clear freight through customs and tax formalities
at many European border crossings.
Clecat, the brokers' trade association, claimed widespread support for the
industrial action.
Belga, the Belgian news agency, reported severe hold-ups on the French and
German borders with Belgium yesterday morning. There were also traffic jams
at the frontier between Greece and Yugoslavia, where Greek lorry-drivers
took the opportunity to protest against increased duties for the transit of
freight through Hungary.
Clecat said no action had been taken in Denmark and Ireland, and active
support was more limited in the UK and the Netherlands. Dutch brokers are to
meet their government tomorrow.
Brokers are calling for aid from national governments and the European
Commission to help them adapt to the internal market, expected to sweep away
most of the paperwork now handled by the private companies.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner responsible for customs union,
said yesterday the Commission, national and regional authorities were trying
to find ways of retargeting EC funds to assist the 85,000 employees in the
sector.

FT  28 JAN 92 / French nuclear body wants compensation over merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S atomic energy commission (CEA) is pressing the government to
compensate it for the income it expects to lose under the planned merger of
the state's civil electronics and nuclear interests.
The new group is unlikely to be making substantial profits for several years
given the financial needs of the electronics activities, in the view of Mr
Philippe Rouvillois, general administrator of the CEA, which has spearheaded
France's ambitious nuclear energy programme.
This is the first official recognition of the financial challenges facing
the new company, to be called Thomson-CEA-Industries (TCI), plans for which
the government revealed last month. Mr Rouvillois told a French news agency
that he expects the commission to lose around FFr400m (Pounds 41m) a year
from the merger, in the form of dividends now paid to the CEA from its
industrial unit's nuclear plant and fuel operations, which would be moved
into TCI.
In exchange, the CEA would have a 30-35 per cent stake in TCI, which would
clearly be unable to yield substantial dividends while saddled with the
losses of Thomson Consumer Electronics.
The latter reported a FFr2.7bn net loss in 1990.
This stake would incidentally give the CEA a blocking minority in TCI. That
is intended to give it power to veto any attempt break up TCI or fully
privatise it.
This comes at a time when the CEA's budget is already under pressure. It
expects to receive FFr6.2bn from the state this year to fund its huge civil
research programmes, 25 per cent down over five years, say officials. The
state budget covers 65 per cent of the CEA's needs; the rest comes from
commercial revenues.
Despite his financial anxieties, Mr Rouvillois stressed that he was
confident of the CEA's future as an essential body in nuclear research and
policy advice.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Delors seeks to calm budget fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, said yesterday it
would be difficult for Brussels to propose a hefty increase in the Community
budget while the 12 member states were facing recessionary pressures and
public spending constraints.
Outlining his priorities for 1992 - which could be Mr Delors' last year as
Commission president - he stressed the importance of the budget measures
package for the five-year period from 1993. The Commission is due to table
proposals in two weeks, and these are expected to include increased
assistance for the poorest members of the Community.
But the possibility that the EC's overall budget might be substantially
increased from this year's level of Ecu66bn (Pounds 47bn) is already
worrying wealthier member states such as Britain and Germany.
Mr Delors acknowledged that '(national) budgets will be tight', in part
because member states are cutting public spending to meet the strict
criteria for economic convergence imposed by the treaty on economic and
monetary union. The need to rein in EC budget increases would also restrict
Brussels' ability to respond to the growing number of aid demands coming
from outside the Community, he added.
He also alluded to the possibility that the EC's research and training funds
could be used to support European industry, a move which would arouse the
suspicions of the EC's free-market members.
Mr Delors said: 'The globalisation of the economy is continuing and we have
two ways (of reacting) - adapting our research policy and putting our
training resources at the disposal of companies.'
Budget proposals being discussed by the Commission at the moment envisage an
increase in the current statutory limit of 1.2 per cent of EC gross domestic
product to between 1.35 and 1.45 per cent for 1993-97.

The BRC claims to represent 90 per cent of the retail industry, but some big

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tsutomo Hata, the Japanese finance minister, at the weekend tried to put
a good face on Japanese-US relations and called President George Bush's
recent controversial trip to Japan a success, AP reports from Garden City,
New York.
Mr Bush visited Japan earlier this month with the chief executives of
America's leading car makers and other industrialists, to try to get Japan
to open its markets. Many Americans saw the trip as humiliating.
But Mr Hata told reporters after the G7 meeting: 'I am convinced that in the
near future, positive results will emerge' from the visit.
He said that because of the Bush visit the Japanese government told Japanese
parts and components makers they should import more products 'and not simply
emphasise exports of their products'.
He called the Americans on the Bush trip 'our friends' and said their
'candid' opinions were 'quite helpful for us'.
'I was quite impressed by the important effects of the meetings like this
one and in Japan, in seeing and hearing each other directly instead of
merely exchanging information and data,' Mr Hata said.
He dismissed recent scornful words between the two world powers as the views
of a minority. He warned that if the acrimony continued, 'the valuable
discussions that took place between (President Bush and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the Japanese prime minister) would have been wasted.'

FT  27 JAN 92 / Monday Profile: Cagey advocate of labour skills - Tony
Blair, shadow secretary of state for employment, speaks to David Goodhart
and Ian Hargreaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He is no doubt tired of hearing it said, but Tony Blair is the very image of
the would-be modern, eloquent and moderate Labour party. There is a wilted
red rose in a basket on the table of his Holiday Inn style office near the
Commons; there are papers and books in cheerful confusion and steady
interruptions from a young man in big blue braces who seems to be dealing
with media inquiries.
A barrister, educated at public school and Oxford, 38-year-old Blair has
worked hard to get to this point. Since 1989, he has been charged with
distancing Labour from the trade union excesses which so damaged the party
in the 1970s, while developing a policy line with something distinctive to
offer union members. Within the party, his efforts are considered a success.
But the election campaign will demonstrate whether they can withstand ordeal
by fire; it is no doubt the imminence of this ordeal which explains the
number of occasions during a 90-minute interview when Blair pauses lengthily
and begins: 'I must choose my words carefully here.'
The message as he would like it presented is as follows: there was an old
agenda of trade union law, strikes and strife. This has been superseded by
'a new agenda which is about training, skills, dealing with low pay, better
opportunities for women and partnership in the workplace. The individual
should be subject to the full rigours of the market, but should be protected
by certain rules against unfair treatment'.
It is a moral vision in tune with Blair's committed Christian beliefs, but
it is also wordly wise. 'There's no future for this country in being a
low-skill, low-tech, economy. We have to compete on the basis of skills and
quality . . . You can't do that either through the old restrictive practices
or with management's unqualified right to manage,' he says.
Or, more ambitiously: 'The new Keynesianism is in active intervention in the
labour market, not in the belief that you simply pump demand into the
economy, because you are going to be constrained from doing that.'
This emphasis upon individual rights in the workplace is something Labour
finds embodied in the EC social charter, to which it will accede as quickly
as possible upon achieving office. This, says Blair, is a question of
agreeing a European framework, not offering an open door for every
ill-conceived Brussels directive.
Again choosing his words carefully, he risks the view that 'a vibrant and
positive trade unionism is a vital part of a democratic society'. But he
also says: 'Unions need modern methods of communication and clear objectives
 -then people will decide whether they're needed or not, as part of the
service sector.'
There is, as often with Labour, a bright golden haze when it comes to
detail. There will be a minimum wage at half of average male earnings, a
retreat (permanent?) from an initial target of two thirds. And some of the
trade union laws of the last decade will be relaxed: the use of legal
injunctions in industrial disputes will be made more restrictive, certain
kinds of secondary action and picketing will be allowed again and
sequestration of unions will not be allowed to prevent them from
functioning.
Beyond that things get still fuzzier. There will probably be a right to
trade union recognition where 50 per cent or more of the workforce vote in
favour of it. There will also be 'binding rights' for employees to
consultation, although Blair says, 'I'm not insisting on one particular
model'.
Another labour market de-regulation to be reversed is the extension from six
months to two years of the period before employees are covered by unfair
dismissal laws. Will Labour return to six months? 'Not yet decided,' he
says.
The party's lack of clarity on these issues has been obscured by the
inclination of Blair's key adversary and fellow barrister, Michael Howard,
the employment secretary, to focus his attack upon wildly exaggerated
costings of Labour's plans on, for example, the minimum wage. Although in
general, Labour's trade union connection is still considered a likely
electoral liability, it is by no means certain that sound-bite to
sound-bite, Mr Howard will outgun Mr Blair on the hustings.
But the blackest hole in Blair's portfolio of arguments is not the detail of
trade union law, but the unknowable matter of how the party will behave on
wages, especially in the public sector. Mr Blair does not dissent from the
dour 'no promises' line of the shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith, on this
point, but it is a touch disconcerting to find Labour's employment spokesman
declining a view on the structure of public sector pay. Does the Labour
party support the introduction of performance pay in the civil service and
the NHS? Or the extension of pay review bodies? No ready answer.
On training and 'active intervention in the labour market' he does speak
with conviction. 'The central difference between the Labour party now and 15
years ago is that we believe that unemployment must be tackled through
intervention in the labour market rather than relying on expanding demand'.
This points to the 'new Keynesianism's' skills revolution - 'our greatest
single priority' - along with a shorter-term emphasis upon measures such as
reforming the employment service, better training opportunities for the
unemployed and work experience.
Blair supports the nationwide structure of Training and Enterprise Councils
created by the government, but says his adversaries lack a policy framework
for the Tecs. 'They have been seen as a substitute for policy and a means of
disengaging from training,' he says.
The Tecs, he believes, must become central to improving in-company training
and not just delivering government schemes for the young and the unemployed.
That needs money, some of which will be raised from a levy on employers who
do not voluntarily devote sufficient resources to training. Blair says it
will start as 0.5 per cent of the wages bill but, as in France, from where
the idea is borrowed, it is likely to rise.
Having studied Swedish experience, he believes that training and work
experience schemes can, cost-effectively, more or less abolish long-term
unemployment within one parliament; he also thinks this can be achieved
without copying Sweden's benefits regime.
Labour's central problem, however, is that long before any 'active labour
market' measures will have had a chance to work, Britain's ERM-constrained
economy may well be pushing unemployment even higher. With Britain's
wage-setting system already delivering annual increases in earnings at three
percentage points above inflation, Labour's commitments to the low paid, a
more supportive view of trade unions and potential vacillation in the face
of public sector demands, could release a new inflationary surge, with the
unemployed again taking the strain. Tony Blair may be the first post-war
Labour employment secretary to announce unemployment passing the 3m mark.
Or perhaps a new model Labour government would succeed, where others have
failed, in reforming the UK's pay bargaining system to produce a better
trade off between pay and jobs? Blair refers to Labour's proposed national
economic assessment and more open budget-making process, but is cagey about
any attempt to seek consensus on pay guidelines.
'I can see the rational purpose behind ensuring better co-operation in the
management of the economy. What I don't believe is that you can force it on
industry, and at the present time there's enormous resistance, any talk of
it is dismissed as corporatism or semi-Marxism'.
He regrets that. 'If you accept that it is sensible for government and
industry to work out a training policy together it seems an affront to
common sense that with nearly 3m unemployed, a skills crisis, the huge
discipline of the ERM, that the principle actors in the economy are not
allowed to sit down to work out common objectives.'
'Someone of my generation (he was 30 when he entered the Commons in 1983)
can see how sensible some form of social partnership is. But it has to be
said that there are those who have been so badly scarred by the past that
they cannot learn from it'.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Gilts: Tremors over cornucopia of issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A quiet week for the gilt market, the focus switched to what is in store
for investors in the financial year beginning in April. There will be a
cornucopia of new bond issues to pay for the looming deficit on UK public
spending - a fact that is starting to send tremors around the market.
The nervousness about the effects of a big supply of gilts restrained the
general downward pressure on bond yields. Sharply higher bond issues to
finance the estimated Pounds 24bn public-sector borrowing requirement in
1992-1993 are likely to lead to an over-supply of the instruments,
depressing prices and raising yields.
Last week, gilt yields edged down slightly, with short-dated instruments
performing better than those above 10 years.
On Friday night the yield of the benchmark Treasury 9 per cent bond maturing
in 2008 was quoted at 9.23 per cent, while the shorter-dated Treasury 10 per
cent stock maturing in 1994 was 9.53 per cent.
Yields for short-dated securities showed a relatively large fall of up to 20
basis points on the week. This was due to theories that the firmer pound
might prompt a cut in base rates, now at 10.5 per cent.
The pressures on funding will be underlined this Wednesday, when the Bank of
England is to auction Pounds 1.8bn of 9 3/4 per cent Treasury stock,
maturing in 2002. The Bank's announcement last week about the volume of
stock surprised some market participants, and caused some easing in prices
across the yield curve. The largest issue in a run of five similar events in
1991 was restricted to Pounds 1.5bn.
On Friday the Bank said it would issue a tranche of index-linked gilts worth
Pounds 300m. The instruments are in two separate issues, each worth Pounds
150m, with the bonds concerned being the 2 1/2 per cent stocks due 2001 and
2009. Issue prices will be certified later by the government broker.
Assuming the auction and the sales of index-linked gilts go smoothly, it
appears that the Bank will have issued virtually all the stock it requires
to finance the 1991-1992 PSBR, which many economists believe will be about
Pounds 13bn.
There may even be a small amount of over-funding - money that can be held
over to the next financial year. This could be extremely useful for the Bank
and the Treasury, for in 1992-1993 funding pressures are likely to be even
greater.
The deficit is likely to soar due to higher spending on unemployment and
other aspects of social security linked to the recession. Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, may also be tempted, in the March Budget, to push up levels
of government spending in discretionary areas such as transport, while at
the same time government tax income is falling below estimates.
All this may mean total gilt funding - allowing for repayments on maturing
debts - approaches Pounds 30bn for 1992-1993, roughly twice the level in
1991-1992.
Coming so soon after a period of minimal gilt issues - the government ran a
small public spending surplus in 1990-1991 - the large issues are giving
market managers at the Bank a few headaches.
They will have to arrange a programme of funding that is flexible enough to
meet the needs of gilt investors, at the same time as maximising the
potential for selling the bonds at high prices. The Bank may settle for a
programme of auctions roughly every two months - at which Pounds 2bn to
Pounds 3bn of the securities are on sale each time - supplemented by a
tranche of smaller debt issues periodically.
All the signs are that the funding programme ahead will restrain any gilt
price rise generally good economic conditions for bonds.
The subdued state of UK inflationary pressures, a factor helpful for bond
prices, was underlined last week with news of a 1.2 per cent fall in
manufacturing output in the three months to November compared with the
previous three-month period.
This pointed towards flat or negative output for the UK as a whole -
excluding North Sea oil and gas production - for the final quarter of 1991.
If this turns out to be the case, the recession will have lasted for six
quarters, making it the longest UK recession since the Second World War.
With little sign of a recovery, inflation will be one of the few aspects of
the UK economy that policymakers will not need to worry about during the
next few months.

AMERICAN BRANDS, the Connecticut-based tobacco and consumer products
company, reports after-tax profits of Dollars 216.6m in the fourth quarter
of 1991, thanks to strong performances from the tobacco and drinks
businesses as well as hardware and home improvements interests, writes Nikki
Tait in New York.
The figure compares with a Dollars 7.1m net profit earned in the same period
a year earlier, but that was depressed by certain non-operating charges. At
the operating profit level, American Brands made Dollars 442.3m in the final
quarter of 1991, against Dollars 399.1m in the fourth quarter of 1990.
The results leave the consumer products group posting a Dollars 806.1m net
profit for the year, up from Dollars 588.6m in 1990. The shares rose Dollars
1 to Dollars 46 on the news.
American Brands said that the underlying sales and operating profit increase
in the tobacco business was 5 per cent, once the sale of a Dutch business
was excluded. Operating profits here totalled Dollars 1.08bn.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Peter Walker denies any knowledge of MCC
scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER WALKER, the former Secretary of State for Wales who resigned from
Maxwell Communication Corporation last summer shortly before he was due to
become chairman, yesterday stressed that he had no knowledge of the scandals
that have since emerged from within the group.
He also said that his resignation followed a request from the Maxwells -
which reflected his own recommendations - and was not the result of any
confidential information he had gathered on the state of the group's
finances.
Mr Walker confirmed that he had been paid Pounds 100,000 - his first year's
salary under a three-year contract as chairman - and was also allowed to
keep the Mercedes saloon valued at more than Pounds 30,000 that came with
the job and which he had taken in place of his own car.
He said he was offered the job as chairman of MCC at the start of 1991 'much
to my surprise' after an informal dinner he held for Kevin Maxwell and his
wife at his home. Mr Walker believes Kevin probably wanted to assert his
control over MCC.
Mr Walker's conditions were that he could select four non-executive
directors and that Mr Robert Maxwell resigned from the main board and all of
MCC's subsidiaries. Mr Walker wanted a 'totally conventional business with
everything disclosed'.
'The job did not attract me at first,' he said. 'But it was quite an
exciting challenge to de-Maxwellise a vast publishing house . . . there was
a great intellectual attraction.'
He only met the late Mr Maxwell occasionally, and clashed with him on one
occasion when he received a letter summoning him to a board meeting to
discuss the accounts at just 24 hours' notice. Mr Walker could not attend at
such short notice. 'I sent him a sharp note back,' he said.
During the period since joining the board as a non-executive director on
April 2, he spent much of his time travelling to MCC subsidiaries for
presentations in the UK and the US.
He concluded that the US companies were 'marvellous and well run', but that
in the UK there was 'nothing of importance', no cash to make acquisitions
and little scope for growth.
'The idea of managing the group from Holborn seemed absolutely crazy,' he
said. 'I said if I were you, I would turn MCC into a totally American group,
call it Macmillan and reduce the family equity.'
Mr Walker was then told on July 11 last year that Mr Robert Maxwell had
decided to take action along these lines. There was therefore little need
for him to continue as chairman, and he said he was offered one year's
salary and the company car.
He had never seen any figures concerning the MCC pension fund, which did not
fall within his responsibility. He attended one meeting with the auditors to
approve the 1991 accounts and had no reason to doubt them.

FT  27 JAN 92 / EC customs brokers plan action over job cut fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOVEMENT of freight across European borders could be seriously disrupted
today when customs brokers in all but three EC countries plan to take
industrial action.
The brokers - private enterprises which prepare documentation and smooth the
way through cross-border tax and customs formalities - are worried about
inevitable job losses when internal EC barriers to free trade come down at
the start of 1993.
During the one-day go-slow, customs and value added tax paperwork at many
borders will not be completed by the brokers.
'It's not a strike,' said Mr Jean-Marie Parasie, director of Clecat, the
brokers' Brussels-based trade association.
'In most countries, offices will be open, agents will be there but there
will be no customs clearance.'
When the EC's physical frontier controls are swept away at the end of this
year, between 50m and 60m documents - the annual detritus of intra-Community
trade - should also disappear.
Customs brokers employ the 85,000 people who fill out most of those forms,
and they are afraid that after New Year's Eve, 1992, they will be redundant.
The brokers hope to persuade national governments and the European
Commission to come up with an economic support plan for the sector, which
includes small family-run companies and subsidiaries of international
trading groups. Only UK, Danish and Irish brokers are resisting the go-slow
call.
Mr Georges Boulanger, managing director of one of Belgium's largest customs
brokers, said the cost of laying off his 175 broking staff would be
prohibitive. 'There's a real lack of information coming from the
authorities,' he added.
Brussels has already commissioned a study of the business, but says the real
responsibility lies with national governments.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Israel confident of deal over Dollars 10bn US backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Israeli ministers yesterday predicted that the country would reach
agreement with Washington on securing Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan
guarantees to aid Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union - without
surrendering its commitment to build settlements in occupied territories.
Despite a clear signal from the Bush Administration on Friday that it would
link the two issues, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, said Israel was
'not speaking about any freeze of settlements. Please forget about it'. One
of his ministers claimed that US terms for the guarantees would allow
'massive' settlement building over the next three years.
This assessment may yet be deflated by Washington. Mr James Baker, the US
Secretary of State, made clear in talks on Friday with Mr Zalman Shoval,
Israel's ambassador, that their meeting was the first of what could be
lengthy negotiations on the terms of the guarantees.
However, the highly sensitive issue could affect the multilateral phase of
the Middle East peace negotiations due to open in Moscow tomorrow, given the
deep Arab hostility to Israel's settlement policy.
Syria and Lebanon have refused to attend, citing Israel's refusal to make
any concession on occupied Arab territories in three rounds of bilateral
talks held so far.
In Tunis last night, an official from the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
which bitterly opposes the loan guarantees to Israel without a strict
settlement freeze, said the Palestinians would not participate in the Moscow
talks unless the composition of their delegation was broadened.
Mr Baker indicated to Mr Shoval that the loan guarantees would depend on
curbing new settlement construction, which the US regards as an obstacle to
peace. But the Israeli government interpreted this as falling well short of
a demand for a total settlement freeze.
'The United States has re-affirmed its readiness to assist us in the
unprecedented task of absorbing the large immigration from the Soviet Union
and other countries,' said Mr Shamir. 'The United States understands that
for us the building and development of all parts of Eretz Israel (including
the West Bank and Gaza) is a matter of principle. We will now engage in a
common effort to find a formula that will not contradict US policy or this
principle of ours.'
Other top ministers, including Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, and Mr
Dan Meridor, justice minister, said they expected an acceptable compromise.
Mr Ehud Omert, the health minister and a close associate of Mr Shamir,
declared that Mr Baker had signalled that Israel could proceed with the many
new houses already under way or budgeted, which would provide for a 50 per
cent increase in the settler population of 100,000.
'They agreed in the coming three years Israel will continue to build
massively in the territories,' he said.
With an election looming in June, Mr Shamir's Likud party is desperate to
show the public it can deliver its dual promise of US economic aid and a
continued commitment to the ideological goal of settling and ruling the West
Bank and Gaza.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Executives take on the task of typing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH executives who would have been shocked just a couple of years ago by
the concept of even touching a typewriter are now happily turning out their
own letters and reports.
Nearly 80 per cent of executives and managers currently do at least some of
their typing, according to a survey of over 500 companies published today
Job demarcations between bosses and their secretaries have been eroded
because of the growth in the numbers of personal computers. An estimated 7m
employees now use computers during the working day; the increase in the
number of PCs on managers' desks has been particularly marked, say experts.
Mr Richard Grace, managing director of the Gordon Yates secretarial
recruitment group, which carried out the survey, says the trend in managers
doing typing is going hand in hand with an increase in 'developmental
training' for secretaries. This includes courses in communications skills
and time management.
'As bosses become more computer-literate, they are working in a more
team-based way with their secretaries. It's no longer simply 'take a letter
Miss Jones',' says Mr Grace.
Younger managers are more likely to consider a PC as simply another consumer
durable, according to Mr David Flint, senior consultant with the Butler Cox
Foundation which syndicates information technology research.
The typewriter may have been seen as inconsistent with managerial status;
the computer is an entirely different matter, he adds.
The demarcations between secretaries' and bosses jobs may have been eroded
but differentials between salaries are likely to remain in place. The survey
finds that central London secretarial salaries have increased by an average
of 5.3 per cent over the past year. A junior secretary can expect to earn
about Pounds 10,500 in the capital, while the secretary of a chairman or
chief executive is likely to earn about Pounds 18,600.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Labour pledges electoral reform debate: Leadership prepares
to endorse proportional voting for a future Scottish Assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR manifesto commit-ment to include the voting system for the House of
Commons in a post-election national debate on electoral reform was
foreshadowed yesterday as the party's leadership prepared to endorse
proportional voting for a Scottish Assembly.
The further shift towards changes in the voting system came as Labour
responded to the third consecutive opinion poll showing a slight
Conservative lead with a new campaign to counter attacks on its tax and
spending policies.
Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, continued to harry the opposition over
the details of its pledges, claiming renewed Labour muddle over the cost of
its immediate commitments. He seized on apparently contradictory comments by
members of the shadow cabinet on the strength of the party's pledge to a
Pounds 1bn economic recovery programme.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign manager and a personal enthusiast for
replacing the 'first-past-the-post' method of electing MPs, suggested wider
debate after the election should involve a constitutional convention or a
Speakers' Conference.
Senior party officials acknowledged pressure on Mr Neil Kinnock to
demonstrate in the manifesto that Labour is ready to consider seriously the
option of radical changes to the electoral system.
In an interview last week with the FT, Mr Kinnock said the constitutional
debate his party had embarked upon was 'a process that will continue into
government.' In spite of the strong opposition of some senior members, a
majority in the shadow cabinet acknowledges the growing momentum behind a
broad manifesto pledge to consider reform.
That momentum will be strengthened when the party's National Executive
Committee is expected broadly to endorse on Wednesday a report from the
committee headed by Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University which
will recommend that the Scottish Assembly proposed by Labour be elected by
the Additional Member voting system - the hybrid used in Germany to combine
single-member constituencies and regional lists.
Mr Cunningham, speaking on BBC television, dismissed any suggestion that a
new voting system could be part of a post-election deal with the Liberal
Democrats. Many colleagues, however, believe an open-minded approach could
gain the support of a group of floating voters in the south-east. A MORI
survey for the Sunday Times gave the Conservatives a 42 per cent share of
the vote, against 39 per cent for Labour and 16 per cent for the Liberal
Democrats. That followed polls on Saturday which had pointed to a 2-point
and 1-point Tory lead respectively.
Labour said it would respond with a campaign designed to highlight
independent evidence that less than 9 per cent of households would lose, 46
per cent would gain, and 46 per cent would be unaffected by its tax and
benefit proposals.

My own table was the only one still occupied by 2.15pm.
There again, perhaps it is explained by the food. Arriving at 1pm, our party

house white wine was finished, and the veal was also unavailable. It seems
Pru Leith is to take charge of the kitchens from the start of February.
Were the existing staff exacting revenge on the decision-makers who had axed

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Isn't it time the UK government stopped shilly-shallying and decided who's
to follow Sir David Wilson as governor of Hong Kong?
People living there would certainly welcome a decision in place of gloomy
rumours such as that the post has already been hawked round Tory
politicians, all of whom said no. And as for the much-tipped David Owen, HK
dignitaries visiting London last week were reputedly told by Labour foreign
affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman that the former SDP figurehead has 'less
chance than a waiter' of getting the job.
A good way of short-circuiting the ditherings about whether it should go to
a politician or a diplomat would be to appoint a successor from business.
After all, Hong Kong is a thriving centre of trade, not least for UK
companies, and a business leader as its last British governor could help to
ensure it continues as such after the 1997 handover.
One - and only one - who might fit the bill is Hongkong and Shanghai Bank
chairman Willie Purves who has just made John Gray chief executive of the
bank, having previously held both posts himself. He remains firmly in
control, but as a vigorous 60-year-old has the leadership strengths and
negotiating skills to take on the new role.

If the German delegation to the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting

The meeting room at the hotel in New York's Garden City overlooked a large
block of unsold appartments. 'That's why we brought you here; to show you
the recession,' joked David Mulford, the US Treasury under secretary for
international affairs. However, the surroundings could have been grimmer
than Garden City with its boulevards and air of fading inter-war gentility.
The US Treasury initially thought of hosting the meeting in a hotel nearer

the US immigration service parked illegal immigrants before returning them
to their homes.

Did you know that the works of Robert Burns, pronounced correctly in
guttural 18th century Scots, sound very like Japanese?
Burns' scholars have Japan's new consul-general in Edinburgh, Seiichiro
Otsuka, to thank for this remarkable discovery. Ichi - as Scottish friends
call him - proved his point beyond doubt when he replied admirably to the
Speech to the Immortal Memory, at a Burns Night Supper in Edinburgh last
week.
After convincingly declaiming a rasping piece of abuse from Burns' poem Tam
O'Shanter, he said: 'To be honest that sounds very close to what my wife
says to me the whole time.' The diplomat says he practises Burns' Address to
a Haggis - 'Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, great chieftain o' the
puddin-race etc' - while bathing his three-year-old son. The boy now runs
round the house shouting the last line: 'Gie her a Haggis.'
He also revealed another trade secret. The dead poet is helping Japan's
pedestrians walk more briskly through life's traffic jams. The tune of
Burns' poem 'Comin thro' the rye', is played at Japan's pedestrian crossings
whenever the lights turn to green.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Observer: Volvo's latest spin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pehr Gyllenhammar's latest industrial power play - merging Procordia with
Volvo - brings the restless, iconoclastic Swedish industrialist back into
the limelight after a time in the shadows.
Some observers had thought that his decision 15 months ago to hand over the
chief executive's job at Volvo to Christer Zetterberg, seven years his
junior, indicated he was moving into semi-retirement. However, nothing could
have been further from the truth as Zetterberg has found to his cost. The
planned merger is just the latest of Gyllenhammar's grand corporate ideas
for Volvo.
The 56-year-old Gyllenhammar was always keen on seeing Procordia under Volvo
control ever since a meeting in September 1989 with the then state-owned
food and pharmaceutical company's chief executive Soren Gyll. At a two-day
seminar at the vineyards of Sweden's state monopoly Vin and Sprit in
southern France, where the then finance minister Kjell-Olof Feldt was also
present, the seeds of a Volvo/Procordia deal were sown.
However, Sweden's ruling Social Democrats had ideological doubts over
selling a state company to Volvo. Instead it was agreed the state and
Gyllenhammar would form a joint partnership. But, as Volvo's boss makes
clear in a recent book of conversations, he never accepted this was the end
of the matter and expected sooner rather than later that Procordia would
find its way into Volvo's hands.

FT  27 JAN 92 / An appetite for acquisitions: Europe's market in food is
being transformed by predators and fiercer competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when the fashion for large cross-border takeovers seemed to be waning,
the battle between Nestle of Switzerland and the Italian Agnelli family for
the French Perrier group, the world's biggest mineral water company, has
brought it bouncing back to life.
The contest is striking evidence that recession has not dulled corporate
appetites for expansion in western Europe's Dollars 700bn-a-year food
market, nor diminished the intense rivalry to wrest control of producers
with world-class brands.
Since the mid-1980s, a wave of restructuring has swept through the industry,
as manufacturers have scrambled to adapt to stiffer competition, changing
tastes and products, faster innovation and the advance of European economic
integration.
The challenge facing many companies is to grow bigger quickly, or to shrink.
None has responded more aggressively than trans-national heavyweights such
as Nestle, the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group and Philip Morris, the US tobacco
giant, which 18 months ago became Europe's third largest food group by
buying Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and coffee company, for Dollars
3.8bn.
A tier below in size, France's BSN has been an exceptionally active
cross-border shopper, followed more recently by manufacturers including
Britain's United Biscuits and Cadbury Schweppes and scores of smaller
companies. All are looking to expand further - and some of those hunting are
also potential prey.
The main limiting factor seems to be the number of prizes available. Many of
the most desirable have already been snapped up or, in most countries except
Britain, are defended against takeover. When a plum comes on the market,
bidding can soar sky-high.
'I admit entirely that there is a lot of opportunism in it,' says Mr Floris
Maljers, co-chairman of Unilever. 'Something is for sale and everybody
begins to think feverishly, how does it fit into my strategy?'
The pace of change seems unlikely to slow - though there have recently been
signs of a shift in direction. The 20 largest food manufacturers in Europe
still account for only about 12 per cent of a market peopled by an estimated
100,000 companies. By contrast, 40 of the world's top spirits brands are
controlled by only four groups.
However, the fragmentation of the food industry also reflects genuine
diversity. It is really a cluster of many separate businesses, with widely
varying competitive structures, growth rates, profitability and capital
intensity.
Adding to the complexity are Europe's differing national and local taste
patterns, which make truly standardised products and brands a rarity. Even
as well-established a Euro-brand as Nescafe comes in 50 combinations of
strength, taste and flavour.
Nonetheless, in some product categories supply is already quite
concentrated. Unilever, for instance, accounts for an estimated 60 per cent
of edible fats sales and a big slice of the ice cream business in Europe.
Kellogg holds half the breakfast cereals market, while Mars, Nestle, Suchard
and Cadbury dominate in chocolate. By contrast, there are no clear leaders
in sectors such as cheese, fruit juice or meat-processing.
However, even the biggest food companies do not attempt to compete across
the entire spectrum, but have strengths in a limited number of areas.
Indeed, some industry experts argue that, for all their financial clout, the
majors operate industrially as federations of medium-sized companies.
Of all the factors spurring the race to grow bigger, probably the most
important is changes in food retailing, above all in northern Europe. Though
the trade remains largely nationally-based, the power of large supermarkets
has substantially increased in the past decade. In Britain, France, Germany
and the Netherlands, one or two chains now account for roughly a third of
all food sales.
Meanwhile, the spread of electronic point of sale systems and more
sophisticated management techniques is providing supermarket groups with
up-to-the-minute data about what products they sell, in what volumes, and
how much profit they contribute.
As a consequence, manufacturers, once used to lording it over the retailers,
face fewer, bigger and more knowledgeable customers, who not only bargain
harder on price but are increasingly choosy about what they stock. The trend
seems certain to develop further, particularly as supermarkets in different
European countries press ahead with efforts to purchase and develop new
products jointly.
The increasing competition for precious shelf-space is making life steadily
harder for brands without strong consumer loyalty or powerful promotion. In
the words of Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN: 'In this business, the
number one makes a lot of money, the number two can make a decent living,
the number three just suffers.'
The rapid growth of private-label products, sold under retailers' own names
at prices which usually undercut top brands, has added to the pressure. More
than a third of all packaged groceries sold in Britain - and roughly a fifth
in France, Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland - are now private
label.
'The low and high ends of the market are growing, but the middle ground is
really being squeezed,' says Mr Peter Mensing, a food industry specialist
with consultants Booz Allen. 'Manufacturers have either to trade up or
down.'
Most at risk are second- and third-rank manufacturers which compete mainly
on price and in one national market. Many - particularly in the UK - have
been driven to expand across European borders largely to offset dependence
on a handful of powerful customers at home.
The acquisition motives of the bigger companies are more complex. Broadly,
they fall into three categories:
Extending the power of established brands, the source of profits and market
power. 'Everyone today is trying to get a bigger leverage to the consumer
and a bigger leverage to the trade,' says Mr Camillo Pagano, vice-president
of marketing at Nestle.
Though large groups hold big shares of the overall European market in
certain products, their strengths are often unevenly spread. BSN, though the
world's biggest biscuit-maker, still does three quarters of its total sales
in France and Italy, while two thirds of Suchard's Dollars 4.5bn turnover is
in Germany and France.
Often, the only way to achieve a better geographic balance is through small
acquisitions. Unilever, for instance, made more than 100 at a cost of about
Dollars 2.5bn in the second half of the 1980s.
Filling up costly distribution and manufacturing capacity by adding new
products. That is becoming increasingly important as large food companies
increasingly centralise production in fewer plants designed to serve the
entire European market.
Diversifying into new businesses. Though overall European food consumption
is increasing only slowly, businesses such as fresh, chilled and convenience
foods are enjoying rapid growth and high margins. Innovations in these
markets are often pioneered by smaller companies, which often sell out to
bigger groups.
The dilemma facing all would-be acquirers, however, is that keener rivalry
has driven up the prices of quality targets, while extracting quick returns
is increasingly difficult. Scope for boosting profits simply by cutting the
costs of acquired companies has diminished, because many have already
streamlined their operations and improved efficiency.
'Generally speaking, at today's high prices it may be difficult to consider
an acquisition because you couldn't make it pay unless there were some
unusual synergistic elements which would reduce this non-return calculation
to a more favourable basis,' says Mr Hans Storr, executive vice-president
and chief financial officer of Philip Morris.
But achieving worthwhile 'synergies' can be a tricky proposition in a
business as diverse and fast-changing as food, where scale economies often
lie as much in marketing as in manufacturing. Some industry experts believe
opportunistic acquirers have over-estimated the potential benefits. 'Cost
savings from synergies often prove illusory or fail to cover acquisition
premiums,' says Mr Ian Davis, director of the European consumer industries
practice at consultants McKinsey.
A growing awareness of the risks is prompting a search for other expansion
routes, such as alliances. Nestle, once averse to joint ventures, has
recently teamed up with General Mills of the US to exploit the international
breakfast cereals market, with Coca-Cola in canned coffee and with BSN to
buy Cokoladovny, a Czech biscuit and confectionery company. Nestle also says
it is prepared to settle initially for a partial shareholding in Perrier, if
necessary.
Mr Jim Grover of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, which advises several leading
European food companies, says they are increasingly interested in
collaboration in preference to outright purchases. But he also admits that
only about 10 per cent of joint venture proposals get beyond the ideas
stage.
A further element is the intrusion of anti-trust regulation, particularly
from Brussels. If Nestle's bid for Perrier succeeds, it will probably be the
first big food industry deal to be vetted under the EC merger control
regulation since it took effect 16 months ago.
None of these developments, however, is likely to slow the competition which
is relentlessly bearing down on weaker players. Adding to the pressure are
the ambitions of big US food groups such as Philip Morris, PepsiCo, Sara Lee
and Campbells Soup, all of which see European expansion as a high priority.
Says Mr Maljers of Unilever: 'I see a future for two kinds of food company:
the well-managed specialist with perhaps one product in one country, and the
multinational. Middle-sized companies present in only two or three countries
are in trouble.'
Some in the industry would consider that prognosis excessively stark.
However, it is also a salutary reminder that building a broader
international base is only one - and not necessarily a sufficient -
condition for surviving in the European food markets of tomorrow.
At least as important are the ability to carve out carefully-defined
business segments and to exploit them with single-minded dedication. In a
highly-fragmented industry where even the biggest players have prospered by
focusing selectively on core products and skills, the company which spreads
its resources across a wide range of activities and markets is more at risk
than the small producer committed to doing one thing superlatively well.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Leading Article: City watchdog and the public
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPOINTMENT of a new chairman to the Securities and Investments Board
raises important questions about the role of the UK's chief investment
watchdog. Is its main job to protect the public, or to maintain an orderly
and prosperous wholesale financial market in the City of London? Can these
two tasks be successfully combined within one agency?
The SIB's first chairman, Sir Kenneth Berrill, succumbed to a chorus of
complaints from the City about heavyweight rule books and excessive
bureaucracy, which were seen as a direct threat to London as a competitive
international capital market. His successor, Sir David Walker, restructured
the regulations into a set of broad principles and a limited body of core
rules. As a result, City institutions no longer protest so loudly that the
costs of the system are going to drive them out of business.
The new chairman, Mr Andrew Large, can be expected to continue this process.
An experienced practitioner, he played an important part in shaping a
regulatory system which has proved acceptable to international financial
firms, and he served as first chairman of the Securities Association, the
most important of the self regulatory bodies answerable to the SIB.
Irreconcilable needs
But the SIB's task is a long way from complete, and its main challenges are
in areas where Mr Large - like his predecessor - has no experience. The SIB
has yet to show that it can square commercial pressures with investor
protection in the crucial area of retail financial services. Throughout his
four-year term, Sir David has struggled with investigations into life
assurance, goaded at times by the Office of Fair Trading. The SIB has
attempted to arrive at a consensus, but the conflict between industry
practices and consumer needs has sometimes seemed irreconcilable.
Although the main job is to ensure that the public is not swindled, there is
a requirement which goes beyond that to protect investors against
unscrupulous sales agents and misleading promotions. Recent SIB research
showing that well over a fifth of life assurance and pensions policies are
cancelled within two years demonstrates how far there is still to go in this
respect.
Central issues remain to be tackled: about the disclosure of life assurance
commissions; about the role of independent financial advisers; about the
future of Fimbra, the regulatory organisation responsible for supervising
thousands of advisers across the country. Heads will have to be knocked
together to provide outcomes that meet the interests of consumers as opposed
to those of producers.
Broader balance
As things stand, industry submissions on controversial topics tend heavily
to outgun those from consumer bodies or the public. The SIB has the
responsibility to impose its own broader balance over the framework of
practitioner-led self regulatory bodies which are responsible for different
sections of the investment industry. But in practice this has proved hard to
achieve when board members are often working in a political vacuum and
without the benefit of a strong and clear tradition as a regulatory agency.
Meanwhile, the Financial Services Act, which was passed in 1986 and which
empowers the SIB, has failed to prevent a series of financial scandals or to
build public esteem for the financial markets and their practitioners. In
particular, the looting of the Maxwell pension funds has highlighted
weaknesses in the present structures. Different responsibilities for Mr
Maxwell's activities were attributable to the Securities and Futures
Authority, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, and even the
Department of Trade and Industry. In such circumstances, it seems, a
ruthless operator finds it too easy to divide and defraud.
A knowledgeable and clear thinking practitioner may be the right person to
head the SIB in its existing shape. Whether the present structure can
provide the necessary level of consumer protection in the market for retail
financial services is another matter.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A case of self-congratulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A recession, finance ministers join ordinary mortals in worrying about
job security. This does much to explain the hyperbole poured on what appears
to be rather a banal communique from the finance ministers and central
bankers of the group of seven leading industrial countries. In fact, the
document reconfirms the outlines of global macroeconomic policy, restates
known policies of individual countries and demonstrates a marked lack of
urgency over two immediate challenges: the Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade negotiations within the Gatt and economic reform in the former Soviet
Union.
Yet several countries claim it is a 'major breakthrough'. Mr Pierre
Beregovoy of France, for example, asserted that 'we have rediscovered the
spirit of the Plaza and Louvre accords'. Meanwhile, Mr David Mulford of the
US claimed that there is a 'clear commitment to world economic growth in
this communique', so echoing his boss Mr Nicholas Brady who argued that the
communique represented 'a big change'.
Yet the fundamental G7 stance is the same. 'They believe strongly,' say the
ministers and officials of themselves, 'that the appropriate framework is
one of fiscal and monetary policies geared to sustainable growth with price
stability over the medium term'. Earlier in the same paragraph one finds the
habitual emphasis on 'co-operative efforts to improve the conditions for
non-inflationary growth'.
Wary approach
True, there have been changes, as Mr Brady claims, but the most important
are those in the global economy itself. 'The ministers and governors are
convinced . . . that the forces that have been inhibiting economic activity
in many countries are dissipating and that the conditions for improved
global growth exist.' But the sluggishness was itself not foreseen, which
should make one wary of G7 claims that it knows either whether conditions
for growth are in place or how to establish them, should they not be.
What the G7 has agreed, in effect, is that each country shall do what it
thinks best (except for France, Italy and the UK, which must do what the
Germans think best, and Japan, which feels obliged to pay attention to what
the US thinks best). Half the communique is taken up with what read like
official press releases from each country's finance ministry.
Yet the G7 is probably right to claim that actions already taken and
developments already under way will bring recovery. It is, in any case,
impossible for the G7 to massage economic growth from year to year. It must,
instead, focus on providing a general framework for the world economy and
stand by to deal with crises.
Failed opportunities
Here is where it has failed. Where, for example, was the serious attempt
needed to grapple with the obstacles created by the G7 countries to
completion of the Uruguay Round? The G7 may regret its cowardice. It may
also regret its failure to respond sufficiently to the crisis in Russia.
Mr Norman Lamont of the UK was right to urge action on a stabilisation fund.
Waiting for IMF membership is a flawed strategy, because it will take too
long. Some believe that membership may be agreed by the spring, but that is
very optimistic. It would, in any case, delay provision of needed resources
until later.
Weirdest of all is the view that the G7 cannot even afford a stabilisation
fund for Russia. But Nato defence expenditures were around Dollars 500bn in
1991 and most of this huge sum was devoted to protecting the west from the
Soviet Union.
Now the west enjoys an opportunity to stabilise the former Soviet Union on
the basis of democracy and a market economy. The west also faces threats of
nuclear proliferation from it and even of the use of such weaponry within
it. Yet the response to both the opportunity and the threat is that action
might be too expensive. This is unpardonably nonchalant. Posterity may
conclude that this meeting represented not the resurgence of global
co-operation, but an egregious failure to rise to an historic occasion.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: American symphonists - Andrew Porter reviews much
noisy, angry, well meaning music and has to cover his ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to a recent survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League,
covering five years of programmes by the leading orchestras, John Adams (the
composer of the operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer) is the
living American composer most often played. Kurt Masur began his
directorship of the New York Philharmonic with Adams's Short Ride in a Fast
Machine and Tromba Lontana, two short works, one loud and one soft. El
Dorado, Adams's latest orchestra piece, was given its premiere recently by
the San Francisco Symphony, which commissioned it. It's about 'the greed of
the eighties', we are told, with a first movement, angry and violent, that
is 'my own response to the Gulf War'.
I've not heard El Dorado, but last month in New York there were two
symphonies containing much angry, noisy music. John Corigliano's First
Symphony was inspired by the sight of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, those
thousands of commemorative panels for those who have died. Each movement
recalls a lost musician friend. The first, 'Of Rage and Remembrance', begins
'ferociously' and includes pages on end of slashing chords marked 'tutti as
loud as possible', but in a quiet episode a distant piano is heard playing
the Albeniz Tango, a favourite piece of the pianist friend remembered.
The central movement, a Tarantella, recalls a friend in the music business,
famed for his wit, who became mad; a trivial tarantella tune is put through
increasingly horrible distortions. Corigliano found the motto theme of the
finale, 'Giulio's Song', while listening to 30-year-old tapes of himself and
a cellist friend improvising. Played by a solo cello, it begins with the
whole-tone ascent that in Berg's Violin Concerto spells 'Es ist genug'.
Other themes join it; in the score they are named, and the names are those
of musician friends who have died. The music mounts to a battering funeral
march, with the clash and clamour of bells; in a quiet coda earlier themes
are recalled.
The work was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony, which gave the first
performance, under Barenboim. It was recorded (Erato); the disc has stayed
for months in Billboard's Classical Top Ten; Corigliano won the Grawemeyer
Award, music's 'Nobel Prize'. (Birtwistle, for The Mask of Orpheus; Ligeti,
for the piano Preludes; and Chinary Ung, for Spiral, were earlier winners.)
At the New York premiere, which was given by the Philharmonic under Leonard
Slatkin, panels of the Quilt hung in the lobby of Fisher Hall, and the
audience was invited to inscribe the names of dead loved ones on a new
panel. The emotional charge was high. The critic must steel his heart to say
that, for all the pain and grief and love that it expresses, the musical
means of expression are undistinguished, conventional, obvious. The New York
Times went so far as to call the result 'vulgar'.
Aaron Jay Kernis's Second Symphony, which was given its first performance by
the New Jersey Symphony under Hugh Wolff, addresses even more 'the endless
violence of the Gulf War, the subtle and unsubtle encroachment upon women's
and minority rights, the hovering threat of censorship of artists along with
the economic, social, and medical disasters that plague us daily'. Adams is
45, Corigliano is 54; Kernis is a younger composer, born in 1960, who has
become very prominent. He wrote some good, exuberantly inventive works in
his youth: Dream of the Morning Sky (1983), for soprano and orchestra; Love
Scenes (1987), for soprano (Dawn Upshaw) and cello. But now, as work after
work after work pours out, he seems content to press the conventional
response triggers.
His first symphony, Symphony in Waves, had its premiere earlier this season
from the New York Chamber Symphony, and has been recorded. It included
Adams-like passages of minimalism. The movements of the Second Symphony are
entitled 'Alarm' 'Air/Ground', and 'Barricade'. The first, marked
'aggressively', contains wave upon wave of noisy climax underpinned by
ostinato. In the second, simple melodies wander over 'grounded' harmonies.
While writing the third, Kernis says, 'a recurring image was the building
full of innocent Iraqi civilians under siege which was mistakenly bombed and
obliterated nearly a year ago'; it ends with the loudest noise I have ever
heard in a concert hall - four tam-tams whacked 'at maximum volume' for five
long seconds. Audience and orchestra players covered their ears.
Crash-bang - alternating (but not always) with episodes soft, sentimental,
and soupy - has become the mode of the successful American orchestra works
taken up in city after city. Del Tredici's Alice screams at the top of her
voice; he himself describes his Steps, composed for the Philharmonic, as
'violent and raucous . . . clattering . . . Godzilla battling Megalon'. This
is music for people already half-deafened, responsive only to high-decibel
assault. And he is not the only composer who writes it.
Poster-art is in vogue. American orchestras (and their conductors) -
shunning Carter, Sessions, Wuorinen - embrace it. When not strident, it's
'nostalgic'. In the programme that brought the Kernis, there was a 'new'
Flute Concerto, by Joseph Turrin, in sub-Prokofiev vein. In the Philharmonic
programme after the one that brought the Corigliano, Slatkin championed
Claude Baker's Shadows, a 'Japanese' piece such as many composers have
written: a flower arrangement of exquisite sounds - scratch, patter, tinkle
and ting - based on four haiku but also (with full acknowledgement and
near-quotation) on movements by Mahler, Britten, and Stravinsky. Dainty
working, no harm it in at all - and no sustenance. We might as well have
been listening to Takemitsu.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: Faith Healer - Royal Court Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the delights of his Dancing at Lughnasa, Brian Friel's new play turns
out to be relatively heavy going. Indeed, were it not for his charming Irish
way with the English language and the excellence of the acting, one would be
tempted to say that it is overlong and dangerously thin.
Faith Healer does not have much of a theme. It might be summed up as 'what
is the difference between someone who occasionally achieves miraculous cures
and a quack?' The answer is not a lot. A sub-theme, explored in the second
act, is what is the difference between a faith healer and a music hall
artist. The answer is much the same. Sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't. No-one can say for certain why the act comes off one night, and not
another.
Being Irish, it might have something to do with the drink. Friel, however,
is careful to state that neither the whiskey nor the lack of it give the
full explanation. The mystery of why the same act can fall flat at times and
be a brilliant success at others remains unsolved.
There are sufficient references to Laurence Olivier in the text to suggest a
direct debt to John Osborne's The Entertainer. It was Olivier who played the
old fading comic in Osborne's play and told the audience not to applaud too
much - 'it's an old building'. Teddy, the business manager in the
faith-healing act, explicitly draws the parallels betwteen entertainment and
cure, failure and success. It is all show business.
One of the reasons why it is heavy going is that Friel has chosen to present
the play as a series of monologues. There are only three characters; they
never appear together. First, Frank Hardy, the faith healer, tells the story
of travelling around the Celtic fringes of the United Kingdom practising his
arts and wondering whether he has extraordinary gifts or is no more than a
con man. Strikingly, he never goes to a metropolis. Most of his works take
place in the upper reaches of Scotland or Glamorganshire. The majority of
the people who come to him, he notes, are despairing.
Then Grace, his wife, to whom Frank insists on referring to in public as his
mistress, tells the story again in a slightly different light. The daughter
of a Scottish judge, obviously she adores him. In the second act the story
is told by Teddy, the man responsible for keeping the show on the road. At
the end, Frank returns for a final monologue, Grace having died from an
overdose of sleeping pills in Paddington. The fatal mistake, apparently, was
to attempt to take faith-healing to Dublin: it doesn't work on home ground.
In between times, there is a good deal of Fred Astaire singing The Way You
Look Tonight. It was the great hit song in the year that Frank and Grace
met. How much significance it has beyond that defies me, though the words
might explain why the faith-healing sometimes works.
It is all excellently done, as you would expect in a play by Friel and
directed by Joe Dowling. Teddy, in particular, has a terrific scene at the
beginning of the second act where he tells about his performing dogs. He is
marvellously played by Ron Cook. Donal McCann as Frank is even better when
he appears for his final soliloquy than he is at the start. Sinead Cusack
has some pathos and dignity - perhaps not enough - as Grace. But when you
come down to it, it is not much more than a lot of lovely Irish words. The
Irish have a knack of getting away with it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1.58m contract for the north site barrier works at Bedfont Lakes
has been awarded to the piling division of FAIRCLOUGH CIVIL ENGINEERING.
Bedfont Lakes is a 250-acre site the Rutland Group is developing less than a
mile from Heathrow Airport. Rutland is transforming the majority of the once
derelict former gravel works into a 188-acre country park. Site restoration
costs are being financed by 56 acres of commercial and industrial
development.
The engineering contract involves the execution of an environmental
protection system, which includes Bentonite cut-off walls and gravel venting
to parts of the north site venting system, and ground water drainage
provisions on part of the south site.
Other works include demolition of parts of the north site which have been
used for industrial purposes; excavation of lakes and ponds and formation of
mounds to the north site industrial areas.
A particular aspect of the works is the ground water drainage provisions of
the environmental protection system, designed following a hydro-geological
assessment.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: Teignmouth sewage treatment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN OIL, GAS &amp; PROCESS has been awarded a Pounds 5.65m contract by South
West Water Services to install a major sea outfall at Teignmouth in south
Devon.
The outfall - 2.35km long and 965mm in diameter - forms an integral part of
South West Water's Teign Estuary coastal sewage treatment scheme, which is
being undertaken to improve the environment in the estuary and to bring the
coastal water's bathing quality up to European standards.
The Teign scheme is one of over 30 coastal sewage improvement schemes in the
company's 'Clean Sweep' programme.
The contract will be carried out by Costain Oil, Gas &amp; Process's pipeline
and offshore division - formerly Land &amp; Marine.
Work at the site will start in early February with the construction of a
temporary jetty at Shaldon where the pipe strings will be fabricated. The
pipes will be pulled offshore in a trench which will be dredged in
June/July. Once the pipe is installed, selected stone backfill and
previously excavated material will be placed over it and the trench refilled
to original bed levels.
Ancillary works include a short landline section and valve chambers
connecting into the main collecting system. Consultant for the project is
ACER of Plymouth.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Management: Trading places - Andrew Bolger looks at
Inchcape's attempt to shed its traditional British image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Mackay, the new chief executive of Inchcape, would like to see more
Japanese and Chinese executives in his London headquarters in St James's,
opposite Christie's, the art auctioneer.
The former colonial trading house is trying to shed its traditional British
image. It is setting out on the text-book route of corporate change, and is
on its way to becoming a thoroughly 'global' organisation. It has cut layers
out of its old hierarchical management and is dividing its activities by
business - motors, marketing and services such as insurance and shipping -
rather than by location.
The new 'global' approach mirrors the changes that have already taken place
among Inchcape's customers in the motor and shipping industries. According
to Mackay, who pioneered the change when he was head the group's Far East
operation, it offers focus and specialisation.
Managers in each stream now report to a London-based board director. The
change is meant to make the company more professional. 'You can now attract
specialists. Inchcape used to be a company of generalists - you did not get
to the top if you were a motors person,' says Mackay.'
An aim of the restructuring is to cut the layers of executives above line
managers and speed decision-making. Mackay says: 'In the old days there used
to be five layers of management above the man running one of our industrial
companies in Hong Kong. By the time you got to someone who knew about
industrial products, he was six levels down - and paid accordingly.'
Inchcape believes streaming will speed growth, since people were very
parochial when business was organised on a country or territory basis. 'They
tended to think of Hong Kong, but ignored Taiwan,' says Mackay. 'One reason
that Inchcape Pacific has grown fast is that people were looking at the
whole area.'
Focusing on individual countries also prevented the easy transmission of
best practice across the group. 'Good people in Hong Kong did not pass on
lessons - not because they didn't want to do it, but because there was no
mechanism.'
Business streaming should also counteract the understandable tendency of
managers to cling on to their more talented staff - rather than send them to
a another territory, where they might be needed more.
Despite this move towards running business on a global basis, Inchcape has
recognised the need to retain a 'country manager' - a senior executive who
will try to co-ordinate all Inchcape activities in any given territory.
Mackay says that in communities such as Hong Kong and Singapore, it is
particularly important that there should be a 'Mr Inchcape' - someone who
can speak and act for the whole group in government and business circles.
In most cases, the country manager will be the executive in charge of
marketing, since he is likely to have the best knowledge of the local
trading environment. Mackay says he envisages the country manager keeping a
'fatherly eye' on smaller outfits as well as looking out for development and
opportunities for the group as a whole.
Mackay is in no doubt about the relative importance of these changes.
'Globalisation is 80 per cent of it and the country manager role is 20 per
cent. Global is the watchword.'
He also accepts that success will depend on the personalities of the
individual managers involved. 'It may work perfectly, it may get off to a
rocky start - but we have to try.'
David John, director of the marketing stream, says there is bound to be
tension in some cases: 'If a country manager and an executive have a falling
out, it will be my job to fly in and bang their heads together.'
Before anyone is recruited, prospective executives are introduced to a lot
of people in the group, Japanese-style, to ensure they will fit in.
Mackay is also aware of the need for the group to 'grow' more of its own
managers: 'We're not a big company like Shell - we are a collection of
smaller companies.'
In attempting to foster an international management culture, Inchcape has
used the Euro-Asian Centre of the management school, Insead, at
Fontainebleau in France. John said: 'It's not British. We deliberately chose
it because Inchcape is not British.'
John says the Insead courses are more important in cultural than in
educational terms: 'We could hold courses in the Far East - it would be a
great deal cheaper - but we must get our executives thinking
internationally.'
Inchcape organises two three-week sessions a year for high-flying middle
managers in their thirties, and a two-week course for senior managers.
Despite these efforts, John believes the culture of the group is still far
too British. He says it must start bringing more local managers through,
without going down the road of tokenism, and hopes to make 70 per cent of
appointments through internal promotion.
Mackay says sending in an expatriate can often be unjustifiably expensive,
when that means the group has to pay for leave passages and the education of
children. 'We are trying to move towards a system where people are paid
according to their level, not where they come from.'
The culture of a group with its roots deep in Britain's colonial past cannot
be changed overnight.
Change must also reach to the top - and Inchcape's board has only one member
who is not British, a French non-executive director.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN wage round will continue to attract attention this week, with
markets looking to Friday when the result of the steel strike ballot will be
announced.
With the Bundesbank keen to see a reduction in inflationary pressures,
settlements in the wage round will influence the decision whether to reduce
German interest rates, a move that could lead to lower borrowing costs
across Europe.
The steel section of the IG Metall union needs a 75 per cent vote in favour
to call the industry's 135,000 workers out on strike.
After last week's dismal industrial output figures for the UK, the markets
will focus on today's trade and current account figures and on the
Confederation of British Industry's quarterly trends survey published
tomorrow.
City predictions of an Pounds 800m visible trade deficit in December would
bring the deficit for 1991 to around Pounds 10bn - less than for 1990, but,
in the view of some, worryingly high for a country deep in recession.
Recent CBI surveys have pointed to weakening expectations of economic
recovery, after some improvement in the early autumn.
In the US, President Bush will tomorrow unveil his plans for a fiscal growth
package in his State of the Union address. These are likely to include
measures to encourage jobs, investment and savings.
The economic highlights of the week are as follows. The median of City
forecasts, provided by MMS International, a business information company,
are in brackets.
Today: UK, December visible trade deficit (Pounds 800m), current account
deficit (Pounds 500m). US, December existing home sales.
Tomorrow: UK, first-quarter CBI industrial trends survey. Japan, December
industrial production (up 0.6 per cent on month), retail sales for December
(up 1.9 per cent on year). US, fourth-quarter employment cost index,
consumer confidence in January (53.0), President Bush delivers State of the
Union address. Australia, November manufacturing output price index,
provisional manufacturing production figures for December, November export
price index.
Wednesday: UK, December building society commitments (Pounds 2.8bn), new
construction orders in November. US, 1993 fiscal budget released, Senate
banking committee meets, fourth-quarter advance GDP (up 0.5 per cent on
month). Australia, November manufacturing input price index, fourth- quarter
consumer price index (up 0.8 per cent on quarter, 1.4 per cent on year).
Canada, December raw materials price index, December industrial product
price index.
Thursday: UK, Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes a study on options for
the Budget, new vehicle registrations for December, final money supply data
for December. US, December durable goods orders (down 1.0 per cent on
month), personal income in December (up 0.5 per cent on month), December
personal consumption expenditure (flat), initial claims for week ended
January 18, M1 (Dollars 4.5bn), M2 (Dollars 8bn), M3 (Dollars 10bn), all for
week ended January 20, export and import price indices for December. France,
December consumer price index (up 0.1 per cent on month, 3.1 per cent on
year). Canada, November employment earnings.
Friday: Germany, result of steel strike ballot. US, December leading

given up trying to prosecute rig owner Occidental privately for culpable
homicide.
It attacked the Lord Advocate, Scotland's senior law officer, for failing to
prosecute the company in the wake of the 1988 tragedy, which cost 176 lives.
Legal advisers have told the association the chances of securing a
conviction had been reduced by a failure to obtain all available evidence -
debris and several bodies on the sea bed - and by the sale of the rig
company.
Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) was a subsidiary of Occidental, the US oil
company. Its assets were sold to Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil after the
disaster and its name changed to Elf Enterprise Caledonia.

<TEXT>
MR TOM RUBYTHON, editor and one of the founders of Management Week magazine,
which went into liquidation last month, plans to launch a business magazine
in March.
Business &amp; Fortune is intended to be a monthly with a partly controlled
circulation of 100,000. About two thirds of the copies will be distributed
free to selected company directors and holders of management degrees.
Mr Rubython said he had been promised more than Pounds 700,000 to finance
the project from three overseas investors.
Mr Rubython, who held a 15 per cent stake in the Management Week venture,
insisted that the concept was a success but had been brought down by policy
disagreements.
The magazine was launched last year as a monthly in spite of its name and
went weekly in September. When it went into liquidation last month after
producing 18 issues, the deficit totalled Pounds 1.19m.
Casson Beckman, the liquidators, said Management Week, in spite of failing
to meet advertising and circulation targets because of the recession,
appeared to have the potential to fill a gap in the market. It added that
some of the investors 'became increasingly dissatisfied with the level of
authority and credibility achieved by the magazine'.
The liquidators said: 'Ultimately Mr Rubython was requested to resign as
editor, but since agreement could not be reached on the value of his
shareholding, this resulted in deadlock.'

FT  27 JAN 92 / Lengthening Guinness trial to be adjourned again this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND Guinness trial, in which former merchant bankers Mr Roger Seelig
and Lord Spens deny fraud and false accounting, has progressed only 2 1/2
days since December 20, when it was adjourned for Christmas, Raymond Hughes
writes.
The trial, halted since January 15 by a juror's illness, is expected to
resume at Southwark Crown Court in London today. It will be adjourned again
on Friday, the judge having decided some time ago that the jury should have
the first week of February off.
Only 10 of the 80 potential prosecution witnesses have so far given evidence
and the case is thought likely to last well into the summer.
When the case opened in September it was expected to last three months. In
early December, though, Mr Justice Henry told the jury it might last until
Easter 'and I can't give you a copper-bottomed, 100 per cent guarantee that
it will have finished by then'.
Within little more than two hours of the trial's resumption on January 6 a
juror became too unwell to continue. There were no further sittings that
week because Mr Seelig, who is conducting his own defence, was suffering
from the side-effects of medicine prescribed for treatment he started after
Christmas.
The effect on Mr Seelig of the strain of the lengthening proceedings is
another imponderable hanging over the trial.
Not all the non-jury days have been wasted. Many hours have been spent in
legal argument that might otherwise have delayed sessions in the presence of
the jury.
The whole of the Serious Fraud Office's prosecution arising from Guinness's
Pounds 2.7bn takeover battle for Distillers in 1986 is not expected to be
completed much before the end of this year.
After Mr Justice Henry has completed Guinness Two, he will preside over
Guinness Three, in which the defendant is Mr David Mayhew of Cazenove,
Guinness's broker during the takeover.
Guinness Four is to start at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Turner in
September and is expected to last four to six weeks. That action concerns Mr
Thomas Ward, a US attorney who was a Guinness non-executive director at the
time of the battle for Distillers.
Allowing for appeals, the process might last until early next year - seven
years after the original events.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Spending on TV advertising shows first flickers of life:
Caution is still the watchword from the industry's executives in spite of an
increase in revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS TELEVISION advertising revenue telling us something the government
desperately wants to hear - that the end of the recession can be spotted in
the distance, drawing slowly closer?
No one in the television world is yet prepared to stick a neck out and
announce even the beginning of the end of a long period of gloom. In a
community more given to razzmatazz than analysis, caution is still the
watchword when it comes to forecasting trends in advertising revenue.
Nevertheless, the last month has seen a considerable uplift in television
advertising revenue. Senior members of the Independent Television
Association point out that the level of advertising expenditure has in the
past often been a useful indicator of which way the UK's overall economy is
headed, and that television advertising is a particularly sensitive
barometer.
Mr Malcolm Wall, chairman of the association's marketing committee and sales
director of Granada TV, said that this January's revenue 'will be up on that
for January 1991 by in excess of 12 per cent, taking us, both ITV and
Channel 4, to some Pounds 114m'. He puts that into perspective - the January
1991 figure was historically low at Pounds 102m, far short of the figure for
the same month in 1989 and 1990, which was Pounds 123m in both years. Mr
Wall said the UK's commercial television networks had 'been badly hit by the
recession, although we had a good final quarter in 1991, up 10 per cent on
one year ago'. He added: 'I expect to see a continued recovery in the first
half of this year, with perhaps 3 per cent to 4 per cent growth in real
terms above the retail prices index.'
That is good news, but hardly begins to catch up with declines, in real
terms, of 5 per cent in 1990 and perhaps 3 per cent in 1991.
According to Mr Peter Battle, sales director of Ulster TV and chairman of
the association's revenue forecasting committee, 'there have been two years
of appalling drops in real terms in an area where there was formerly
unbroken, continuous growth'.
But he also detects a notable uplift in TV advertising revenue in the past
nine months. 'Take 1991: advertising revenue in television was down by 6 per
cent to 9 per cent in the first six months; in the third quarter, down
further by about 1.5 per cent. But the fourth quarter was substantially up,
and there isn't much doubt that the first quarter of 1992 will also be
substantially up.'
Mr Battle says the trend is comforting but should not be exaggerated.
Mr Dominic Proctor, managing director of the UK's largest advertising
agency, J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP group, also counsels caution.
He said: 'We are forecasting marginal growth, but we are certainly in for
another hard slog this year. The possibility of a double election is a
horror, since companies tend to freeze their spending during an election
period.'
Mr James Best, chairman of the BMP DDB Needham advertising agency, said:
'March will be the real litmus test. Our feeling is that January and
February this year are special cases since those months last year were so
bad. We have some 50 clients, and the mood we have from them is that they
are not prepared to pump-prime the economy but are instead waiting for the
consumer to set the trend. It's too early to put out the flags.'
If the advertising sector overall is still stuck in the doldrums, some
research published tomorrow by Carat, Europe's largest media planning and
buying specialist and part of the Aegis group, seems to confirm that
television is doing rather better.
It indicates that, across Europe as a whole, television advertising revenues
in 1991 showed a real increase of 5.8 per cent, in a year when total media
advertising fell by 0.9 per cent in real terms. Television's share of total
European display advertising reached 33.4 per cent last year, overtaking
newspapers - which in 1991 had 30.4 per cent of the market - for the first
time.
That gap will probably widen over the next two years.
The growth of television advertising, in the UK at least, may be at the cost
of newspapers. The Newspaper Publishers Association has been conducting an
advertising campaign since October designed to persuade advertisers that
print works more effectively than the small screen.
The NPA's campaign has sniped at television, suggesting that viewers pay
scant attention to screened commercials, more to advertisements in print.
According to the latest estimates of the Advertising Association, total
press advertising fell by slightly more than 7 per cent in the first nine
months of 1991. For newspapers there is, as yet, little sign of the sort of
recovery which television is - momentarily - enjoying.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Stock Exchange completes regional network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange has completed a regional network of five offices
which it hopes will improve relations with quoted companies in the Midlands,
the north, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The process has been completed by the opening of a Leeds office, joining
those in Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Belfast. Leeds and Belfast are
representative offices, while share transfer settlements can be made at the
other three.
The network's completion marks the final transition from the era in which
Britain's largest provincial cities each had its own stock exchange.
The electronic marketplace finally made obsolete the last vestiges of the
local exchanges. The advent of the new Taurus paperless trading system next
year will also end local settlement.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman, said: 'We hope to use our
regional offices to improve relations with listed companies outside London.
In the past we have been a purely regulatory body. We no longer see
ourselves as merely a trade association for stockbrokers.'
Sir Andrew said the new offices would offer commercial services to listed
companies. They would also build contacts with locally based investors and
investment institutions.
The regional offices also run advisory groups of local stockbrokers, who
meet quarterly to hear the opinions of local company chairmen and
commentators. The outcome is then reported to Sir Andrew.
For example, at last week's meeting of the north-west advisory group Mr
Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester Ship Canal, asked for the exchange's
'yellow book' - the rules for quoted companies when reporting potentially
price-sensitive activities - to be made more user-friendly.
The cost of maintaining a Stock Exchange listing was also discussed, as were
the difficulties created for the exchange's marketmakers by the large
numbers of medium-sized or small regional companies whose shares are rarely
traded.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Powers challenge by Tec chairmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUTHORITY of the government to block a radical training initiative for
the long-term unemployed, devised by a training and enterprise council, is
to be challenged today.
The challenge to Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, will be made
at a meeting of G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen. It follows the
withholding of approval by Mr Robert Jackson, the employment minister, for a
pilot project planned for this April by Norfolk and Waveney Tec.
The Tec - the chairman of which is Mr John Lineker, recently appointed by
G10 to lead negotiations with the government over funding - sees the case as
an important test of the authority of Tec boards.
Tecs' relations with the government are already strained, with some
threatening not to renew their contracts this year because of proposed cuts
in funding for Youth Training and Employment Training.
Norfolk and Waveney Tec wanted a two-track scheme to replace ET. All the
long-term unemployed would retain their entitlement to training. That could
include short training for those who wanted to brush up on skills to return
to work quickly and longer training for those with special needs.
Those requiring specific occupational skills training could apply for a Tec
'award', for which they would have to demonstrate that they had identified a
need for the relevant skill and a possible job vacancy. Up to 10 per cent of
the award would be paid back in monthly instalments when the individual
found a job.
A letter from Mr Lineker to Mr Howard described the package as 'thoroughly
researched'. It had received overwhelming support from the jobless and
employers.
A letter from Mr Jackson to Mr Lineker said the ideas might be considered
next year.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): NUCPS may claim MoD guards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUCPS civil servants' union said yesterday that it would expect to
recruit and represent Ministry of Defence security guards if their status
was changed to that of white-collar workers, Lisa Wood writes.
The union's intentions will anger the TGWU and GMB general unions, which
disclosed on Friday that about 2,400 military installation guards were to
lose the right to be represented by unions affiliated to the Labour party.
That is because the force is being reorganised and guards' status is to be
changed from industrial to non-industrial civil servants. The government
says political affiliation by a union representing non-industrial civil
servants runs counter to the Civil Service requirement for political
neutrality.
The NUCPS is not affiliated to Labour.
Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, said: 'We are not looking for a
fight with the TGWU, but if the end result is these grades are
non-industrial and linked to our pay scales, we would expect to recruit and
represent them.'

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Inter-union row simmers at GCHQ - A
Labour election victory might spark a dispute over the intelligence centre's
staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GCHQ, the Cheltenham intelligence centre where the government banned unions
in 1984, might be the centre of an embarrassing inter-union dispute if
Labour won the general election and restored the right of union membership.
The four Civil Service unions, which would again be free to recruit - and
probably to negotiate for - the 3,000-plus staff, would be likely to face a
challenge from the EETPU electricians' union, which has a close relationship
with the GCHQ staff federation.
Mr Brian Moore, chairman of the GCHQ staff federation, said at the weekend
that if the federation faced political pressure to dissolve itself and make
way for the returning Civil Service unions, it would 'seriously consider'
joining the EETPU.
The staff federation receives support from the EETPU for services such as
training and the printing of its magazine. It has been warned by the
government not to create a formal link with the electricians.
If Labour lifted the union ban the staff federation, which claims 54 per
cent of staff as members, would be in a strong position to retain the
loyalty of many GCHQ civil servants, especially if it had the backing of a
highly professional, national union.
The federation has been refused a certificate of independence as a trade
union because its activities have to be approved by the management. If that
no longer applied, it would probably receive a certificate and might try
going it alone with only a 'consultative' relationship with the EETPU. The
EETPU is outside the TUC but is likely to rejoin as part of its merger with
the AEU engineering union.
There is little love lost between the GCHQ staff federation and the
TUC-affiliated Civil Service unions, which on Saturday held their eighth
annual protest in Cheltenham against the union ban.
An inter-union dispute after a Labour victory would be an embarrassment to a
Labour government, especially if the Civil Service unions were given
negotiating rights but then failed to recruit many members.
The Civil Service unions would probably have a better chance of recruiting
more members from the rather conservative GCHQ staff if they could agree
that only one Civil Service union would return to the intelligence centre.
That idea was floated by some of the unions but has broken down after a
disagreement between the NUCPS and IPMS, the two biggest recruiters of GCHQ
grades. Those two unions, the CPSA and FDA will probably all claim
negotiating rights.
The Civil Service unions have also failed to agree whether to offer a
no-disruption guarantee to a Labour government, in spite of having made an
verbal offer to that effect to the Conservatives. Labour remains strongly
committed to restoring union rights at GCHQ.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Companies are told of franchise pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES that consider franchising their activities should not
underestimate the resources needed to establish a franchise network,
according to a report published today by the City University Business
School.
Franchising does not provide a cheap or easy means of expansion and
companies that undertake it should be wary of setting unrealistic goals, the
survey of companies with franchise networks discloses. It was compiled by
the business school's NatWest Centre for Franchise Research
Three of the companies surveyed had developed franchising businesses
relatively easily, four had faced teething troubles and five had experienced
significant difficulties.
Franchising involves one company, the franchisor, providing the use of its
brand name and operating methods to other businesses - franchisees  -
usually in return for a down-payment and a proportion of turnover. Britain's
18,600 franchised outlets made sales worth Pounds 4.8bn in the 12 months to
June last year, according to the British Franchise Association.
The franchisors interviewed emphasised the importance of being able to
support their franchised concerns by having company-owned outlets in which
to train franchisees and to monitor and develop their businesses. The need
to train those awarded franchises to a high standard was also emphasised.
Companies awarding franchises must be prepared to make changes in their
business to accommodate franchised outlets and to educate staff about
franchising, they said.
Selecting franchisees was the most frequently mentioned difficulty. Poor
choices had shown no interest in the business or refused to follow the
awarding company's methods. Others had committed frauds or lacked ability to
run the business.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Employers warned on job-loss selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS whose redundancy programmes focus on part-time workers may risk a
legal challenge, according to a report by Industrial Relations Services, the
pay research group.
It said a breach of the law might arise because part-time workers were more
likely to be women than men.
Their dismissal might therefore contravene sex discrimination laws.
Industrial Relations Services found in a survey of 120 employers that in the
past two years about a fifth of organisations had altered the way they
decided which employees to dismiss. Most had moved to procedures
concentrating on employee performance.
Some had changed to move away from the principle of last-in-first-out
(Lifo), under which employees with the shortest service are first to go.
Lifo was the main criteria for redundancy selection in less than a third of
the 120 organisations surveyed. The main reason among other companies for
not using it was that it did not allow them to retain their most valued
employees.
Manufacturing companies are more likely to use Lifo than others. Some 38 per
cent of manufacturers used it while the proportion among the rest was 22 per
cent.
About 20 per cent of employers said performance made little difference to
redundancy decisions.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Campaign launched to save Devonport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DML, the company that manages Devonport dockyard under contract from the
Ministry of Defence, has launched a campaign to save the dockyard from
closure under the government's Options for Change policy review.
MoD officials say that closure of the dockyard's associated naval base is
ruled out, but that reductions are likely.
Plymouth city council has estimated that closure of the two would cost the
south-west more than Pounds 1bn a year and lead to the loss of some 15,000
jobs in the dockyard, the naval base and the supply industries.
At the centre of the matter is the contest for the contract to refit
nuclear-powered submarines. Devonport handles some 'conventional' nuclear
submarines while refitting work on the Polaris ballistic-missile fleet is
undertaken at Rosyth in Scotland by Babcock Thorn.
Last year the MoD asked the two companies to present proposals for merging
all submarine work at one yard.
The decision has not yet been made, and is thought unlikely before the
election.
There are voices, however, warning the city and company against intensive
lobbying. Dr David Owen, a Plymouth MP, has said that defence decisions will
be taken with national objectives in mind and that pressure lobbying might
be counterproductive.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Man charged with false accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIFTY-year-old man is expected to appear in a Belfast court today charged
with offences of false accounting and other offences relating to financial
transactions.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary last night refused to identify the man or give
details of the offences he is alleged to have committed. The move is taking
place, however, against a background of a continuing crackdown by the
government on terrorist funds gath-ered from racketeering.
The crackdown is being spearheaded by C13, a police squad attached to the
RUC, and a new government unit made up of civil servants with expert
knowledge of the taxation and financial systems.
There was no official confirmation last night of a report at the weekend
that British investigators suspected one British company quoted on the stock
market of having been used as a front for the IRA and of having laundered
several million pounds during the past eight years.
The Stock Exchange would not comment on the report last night. If true, the
action represents a new level of sophistication in the raising of IRA funds
that may require tighter guidelines for financial institutions dealing with
funds that may have been laundered.
A government official said last night that investigators had not yet made 'a
major breakthrough' in neutralising the IRA's complex financial structure.
The RUC meanwhile emphasised that today's court case should not be seen to
have any direct relationship with its drive against racketeering.
New powers under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill include
scope for the courts to seize the assets of anyone who benefits from
terrorist-related activities.

FT  27 JAN 92 / House prices expected to fall 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES are likely to fall by an average of 2 per cent this year
according to a review of the housing market published today.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the firm of stockbrokers, forecasts that prices will
not rise until 1994 even though it expects the number of house sales to rise
by 12 per cent this year.
The firm says that numerous empty, unsold properties on the market will
continue to depress prices even when sales start to recover.
A Financial Times poll last week of estate agents, house builders and
mortgage lenders showed that there had been a sharp increase in interest
from prospective house purchasers since the beginning of the year.
Very few agents and builders felt, however, that the improvement, which
traditionally occurs after Christmas, would lead to a rise in prices.
The UBS study says there were at least 222,000 empty, unsold homes at the
beginning of this year. They included homes repossessed by building
societies, houses and flats which builders had not been able to sell, and a
growing number of inherited homes still seeking purchasers.
UBS expects mortgage lenders to repossess a further 80,000 homes this year.
That is after taking account of the government's 'mortgage-to-rent' rescue
plan, which the study says will apply to about 15,000 homes and 'will have
only a marginal beneficial effect'.
The study cites three factors acting as brakes on the housing market. They
are a more cautious lending policy by building societies and banks, rising
unemployment and concern that a Labour government would increase taxes.
Falling commercial property prices and rents will benefit small businesses,
according to a survey published by National Westminster Bank. The south-east
and south-west are most likely to see an increase in property available,
while the biggest price falls are likely to be in London and the south-west,
the bank says.

FT  27 JAN 92 / LSE director heads second consortium bidding for BTG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN Anglo-American consortium emerged at the weekend as a bidder for the
British Technology Group, the state-owned enterprise destined for
privatisation.
The consortium is headed by Dr John Ashworth, director of the London School
of Economics, and includes the US organisation Research Corporation
Technology and a group of City institutions. It is the second bidder to show
its hand.
Earlier this month BTG's management and staff made known that they had
formed a consortium under Mr Ian Harvey, BTG chief executive.
BTG is a technology-transfer organisation established to commercialise ideas
and inventions originating in Britain's universities and research council
establishments. Its profits come from selling rights to patents and
licences. Last year pre-tax profits fell 32 per cent to Pounds 6.5m. It is
expected to fetch about Pounds 50m.
Universities and the Labour party have expressed concern that privatisation
could damage the exploitation of UK technology and harm long-term academic
interests.
Bidding closed on January 6, and the government has told bidders they must
seek approval before releasing any information about the negotiations. The
sale is being managed by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, which says
the reason for the secrecy is that it increases the pressure for a good bid.
The government has said that no member of a bidding consortium can hold a
stake of more than 15 per cent. Research Corporation Technology, the US
member of the Ashworth consortium, is thought to want 30 per cent. RCT has a
similar role among US universities. The government has said it will waive
the 15 per cent rule in exceptional circumstances.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Row over EC aid returns to centre of poll campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's refusal to release funds earmarked for Britain's
depressed regions returned to the centre of the election campaign at the
weekend, with the government accusing the European Commission of political
interference.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, accused Mr Bruce Millan,
the European commissioner with responsibility for regional aid, of 'ganging
up' with Labour to embarrass the government.
Mr Millan, a former Scottish secretary, was nominated to the commission by
Labour. He indicated last week that some Pounds 139m of aid to ease the
impact of pit closures was threatened by the government's refusal to give
satisfactory assurances that such funds would be additional to the
Treasury's own spending. He warned also that a further Pounds 880m in
regional aid might be in jeopardy.
That brought claims from Labour yesterday that the Conservatives were
depriving depressed areas of vital funds so that the money could be directed
elsewhere.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, said the government should give
the assurances sought by Brussels.
He said: 'All the other 11 European Community countries accept the rules.
Only British Tories are so crooked. The sooner we have an election and a
Labour government, the sooner we will be seen by our European partners as
law-abiding instead of Tory rule-breakers.'
Mr Heseltine has argued privately within the cabinet that it should seek to
avoid a public row with the Commission by offering further assurances that
the money allocated in regional aid would be additional to, rather than a
substitute for, the government's own projects.
The Treasury, however, has refused to change its accounting practices.
Yesterday Mr Heseltine stressed that the system now operating was the same
as the one which applied under Labour governments in the 1970s when Mr
Millan had been a Scottish minister. The commissioner's refusal to release
the funds represented an 'intolerable' interference.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Companies criticised over financial policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL and medium-sized British companies rely too heavily on short-term
finance and are poorly placed to respond to an increase in demand when the
recession ends, according to a survey of businesses with turnover of up to
Pounds 25m.
Companies depend heavily on bank overdrafts, which can be recalled without
notice, and are failing to take advantage of other means of finance open to
them, such as share issues, factoring and invoice discounting, according to
the report by Business Banking Review, a financial consultancy.
Of the companies questioned, 80 per cent used overdrafts, while 40 per cent
had term loans, 38 per cent made use of leasing, and 33 per cent used hire
purchase to buy plant and equipment.
Only 6 per cent had raised equity capital; 4 per cent had used invoice
discounting and 3 per cent had factored their invoices. The study questioned
189 companies in Hertfordshire and Essex.
The emphasis on short-term finance may reflect both a lack of understanding
of sound financing structures on the part of the companies and a desire of
the banks to provide a short-term commitment only, the survey said.
The study noted that there was no shift to longer-term finance as the length
of time the company had been with its bank increased.
Eighty-four per cent of companies that had been with the same bank for less
than one year had an overdraft and 57 per cent had a term loan. By the time
companies had been with their banks for more than five years, four fifths
still had an overdraft but only two fifths had a term loan.
'With overdrafts being repayable on demand, the banks are able to provide a
series of short-term 'fixes' without long-term commitment,' the study says.
The banks do not appear to provide advice on other longer-term forms of
funding when customers ask for an increased overdraft, the study notes.
At head-office level, however, the banks continue to urge small businesses
to take out term loans instead of overdrafts.
A survey by National Westminster Bank of 850 businesses, most with sales of
less than Pounds 750,000, found that 61 per cent of small companies had an
overdraft while just 30 per cent had term loans.
'Owner-managers should match finance to the needs of the business and use
overdrafts only to cover short-term cashflow fluctuations,' the bank said in
comment on the survey results.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Query on Lloyd's contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REINSURANCE contracts that have generated multi-million-pound losses for
Lloyd's Names may be 'voidable', or invalid, according to evidence contained
in a report by Rodney-Smith &amp; Partners, reinsurance consultants.
The report was commissioned by Names - the individuals whose assets back
underwriting at Lloyd's - who were members of syndicates managed by Rose
Thomson Young and Gooda Walker agencies between 1988 and 1990.
The syndicates reinsured the exposures of other Lloyd's syndicates to
catastrophe losses and suffered badly as a result of several natural
disasters and industrial accidents, including the Piper Alpha oil rig
explosion.
The report, which Rodney-Smith expects to complete in the next two to three
weeks, was prepared after a legal opinion offered in October by Mr Gavin
Lightman QC.
Mr Lightman said the contracts might be voidable if they were entered into
for reasons other than for the benefit of Names, and other parties to the
contracts knew about that.
The report provides some hope for more than 3,000 Gooda Walker Names who
were told this week that they face a cash call of Pounds 101m for losses
incurred during 1989 and 1990. Six months ago Gooda Walker Names received a
bill for Pounds 137m for 1989 and 1990 losses.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Managers 'intimidated' by computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS are intimidated by computers although most of them use PCs in their
work, and 40 per cent say they could not do their jobs without them,
according to a survey by the British Institute of Management and Microsoft,
the computer software group. More than 90 per cent of managers questioned
admitted being uncomfortable with computer technology.
The survey results, released today, underline the continuing rift between
managers' perceptions of the benefits of information technology and ways in
which computers are used. The survey also suggests that the progress of
technology is outstripping managers' ability to keep up. The main reasons
cited for managers' unease are the use of jargon and lack of training.
Three quarters of the respondents say computers are fundamental to their
jobs and most think they bring considerable benefits in speeding up the
performance of basic tasks and in enabling managers to do things they could
not do before.
In spite of the potential rewards, however, most personal computers are
still being relegated to the role of glorified typewriters or calculators.
Only 20 per cent of managers uses computers to help focus on priorities.
Managers are not using computers to reduce their isolation, the survey says.
Almost half the regular users work with stand-alone PCs. Only 10 per cent of
managers uses a local PC network to share information with colleagues.
Only 6 per cent of the respondents consider that the computers employed in
their organisations are being used to their full potential and 97 per cent
feel information technology will have a significant impact on their work in
future.
The survey suggests that nearly 60 per cent of managers have to rely on some
self-tuition or to fall back on advice from colleagues.
A total of 58 per cent feel that lack of time to be able to learn is the
biggest deterrent to their use of information technology. However, when
asked if computers were becoming easier to use, 87 per cent felt they were
and 91 per cent cited more user-friendly software as the main reason.
Commenting on the survey, Mr Roger Young, institute director-general, said:
'Managers know that computers can improve their productivity. Jargon and
lack of training prevent them from exploiting these assets. An hour with a
software manual is not enough. If managers are ever going to make full use
of computers as a powerful working tool . . . they need training.
'The message is clear. Organisations must invest in software training. If
they don't, they are squandering their investment in hardware.'

FT  27 JAN 92 / Aquino's choice may hit IMF agreements

PRESIDENT Corazon Aquino's support for the candidacy of Mr Fidel Ramos, a
ruling party outsider and former defence secretary, in Philippine
presidential elections in May could affect economic agreements with the IMF.
The announcement was not a complete surprise but it did disappoint the
leadership of the ruling party, Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), which
had favoured the house speaker, Mr Ramon Mitra.
Mrs Aquino's choice could make the LDP-dominated Senate less enthusiastic
about approving new tax measures that must precede an important
International Monetary Fund agreement. The LDP, which is seen as loyal to Mr
Mitra, evolved from the broad coalition which helped bring Mrs Aquino to
power in 1986. Mrs Aquino's decision not to choose Mr Mitra demonstrates the
fragility of the coalition.
Mr Mitra defeated Mr Ramos in a party straw vote last November, but the
latter accused the Mitra group of cheating.
Some politicians have said Mrs Aquino's move could derail some of her
administration's economic programmes. Among these are the government's
commitments to the IMF in exchange for financial support for Manila's
programmes.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Anxious Asean leaders tighten economic knot: Plans to set up
a south-east Asian free-trade zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX south-east Asian leaders are expected to sign an agreement in Singapore
tomorrow on a mutual reduction of tariffs aimed at creating a free-trade
area within 15 years.
The pact, worked out for this week's summit of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (Asean), which embraces a population of 320m, owes as much to
fears of rising protectionism in world markets as to the regional trend
towards economic liberalisation.
Asean leaders - from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Brunei - are worried the Uruguay Round of trade talks will
fail and that their export-dependent economies could be left out in the cold
by trade blocs such as the European Community and the North American
free-trade area.
Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, said at the weekend that the
Asean free-trade area (Afta) would make the region more attractive for trade
and investment in the face of competition from Europe and America.
The draft Asean agreement calls for a system of common effective
preferential tariffs (Cept) for intra-Asean trade to be introduced on
January 1 1993, starting with manufactured goods, processed agricultural
products and capital goods and leading to the Asean free-trade area, with
tariffs of 0-5 per cent within 15 years.
More than 12 sectors - including cement, electrical items, textiles, rubber
and plastic goods and vegetable oil - have been earmarked for the first
stage, which is expected to set initial intra-Asean tariffs for the products
at 20 per cent or less.
Sceptics point out that Asean is already operating preferential tariff
arrangements which have been notable for their half-heartedness and lack of
success. The latest proposals continue to include an opt-out clause known as
'six minus x' allowing individual countries temporary exemptions.
The private sector, in the form of the Asean Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, has expressed concern over non-tariff barriers and the exclusion
of services from the Afta proposals. But businessmen and officials believe
fear of protectionism in foreign markets and continuing liberalisation in
individual Asean states will be sufficient to ensure progress.
Trade within Asia as a whole is thriving, but intra-Asean dealings have done
no more than maintain a 4-5 per cent share of the association's growing
international trade, if Singapore and its huge re-export trade is excluded,
leaving its members vulnerable to external shocks.
Mr Anand Panyarachun, the Thai premier who has vigorously promoted Afta and
wants it implemented in 10 years rather than 15, says: 'The actual level of
intra-Asean trade and intra-Asean investment has not risen significantly in
the last 20 years.
'Now we find access for our exports to markets abroad being not as open as
before. At the same time our industries have matured and become more
competitive internationally, and this has led us to be more confident about
pursuing policies of economic liberalisation.'
Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's trade and industry minister, put the case
for regional tariff cuts in a statement last week. 'If a company in one
against other Asean countries,' he said, 'what hope does it have on world
markets, where the competition is much fiercer?'
Asean would prefer multilateral world trade liberalisation under the
auspices of Gatt, and Asean officials last week shelved a controversial
Malaysian proposal for an East Asian economic caucus which would have
excluded the US. But, as one minister said, the idea is being put in a
'glass case' from which it can be removed if a battle of the trade blocs
begins.

CHINA'S Prime Minister Li Peng arrived in Rome last night on his first trip
to the west since the 1989 crackdown in Beijing on pro-democracy protests.
The tour takes him to the United Nations and four European countries, Reuter

Li is accompanied by his wife and Qian Qichen, foreign minister. Li Lanqing,
minister for foreign trade, is also in the party, according to the official
New China News Agency. In Rome, hundreds marched on Saturday to denounce the
Italian government for becoming the first western country to receive Li

leader will spend two days in Italy before attending the World Economic
Forum that opens on January 30 in Davos, Switzerland.
On January 31 he will attend a special summit of the United Nations Security
Council in New York. He rounds off his trip with visits to Portugal from
February 2 to 4 and Spain from February 4 to 6.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Why British business remains relatively unprofitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no doubt that the profitability of UK business has fallen sharply
since the recession began; and little doubt that it has fallen further than
in most other large industrial countries. But rather than dwell on the
current gloom, this is a good time to re-examine the relative profitability
of British businesses over the past decade.
Ostensibly the 1980s do not look too good, as was pointed out here in August
(Business profitability and the incentive to invest, August 12 1991).
According to the OECD, the UK had the lowest average gross pre-tax rate of
return on capital in the 1980s and the lowest share of profits in
value-added among the six largest economies. Little wonder that it also had
the lowest annual rate of growth of investment. Nor were the 1980s notably
better for British business than the previous decade: the UK average rate of
return was 9.5 per cent in 1980-87, just 0.2 percentage points up on
1975-79, while the G7 average remained unchanged at 14.6 per cent.
Yet the Confederation of British Industry will argue in this week's Economic
Situation Report that the recent record of British industry is more
encouraging than this cursory glance at the evidence suggests. Both
anecdotal evidence and figures from the UK Central Statistical Office, it
asserts, show that UK profitability rose markedly in the 1980s. The upper
chart, from the OECD, plots an index of the mark-up of output prices over
unit labour costs, which indicates changes in the profit margins of
manufacturing industry, accounting for around a quarter of the business
sector. UK margins do appear to have risen faster than in France or Germany
since 1980.
How can we account for the discrepancy between this evidence and the OECD's
measures of rates of return? The OECD calculates the latter by dividing the
gross operating surplus in each year by national estimates of the value of
the capital stock. But British estimates of the average life of UK machines
and buildings are up to twice as high as in other countries. So the
estimated UK capital stock is inflated and the average rate of return is
depressed.
This difference in national practice may explain why measured rates of
return in the UK are lower than in other countries; but it does not explain
why the UK has failed to make up more of the ground in the 1980s - unless
these international differences in estimated capital lives have grown
mysteriously. Moreover, the OECD removes North-Sea-oil-related capital from
the total UK capital stock, but not North Sea profits. So the rate of return
it calculates for the UK may even be too high.
The CBI is not deterred: what matters is not the return on old capital but
the return on new investments. For this reason, Mr Andrew Sentance and Mr
Duncan McKenzie of the CBI have divided the gross operating surpluses of
British and German manufacturers by the cumulative totals of real investment
over the previous 15 years. Their results are shown in the lower-left chart.
The profitability of new UK manufacturing investment did rise rapidly
between 1980 and 1988, though it exceeded the return on German investments
only briefly.
The OECD has also calculated the marginal return on business sector
investments, using an econometric model. It also finds that the return on
new UK investments in the 1980s rose faster than in all the other G7
countries but remained absolutely lower. Interestingly, the OECD also finds
that the capital-labour ratios of every country, save the UK, remained
approximately stable in the 1980s. So investing in these six countries
became more profitable because the same mix of machines and workers was
being used more efficiently.
In the UK, the rise in the return to new investment has been accompanied by
a relatively sharp drop in the capital-labour ratio. Investing in the UK
became more profitable in the 1980s not only because capital and labour were
being used more effectively but because capital became relatively scarce. By
investing in labour-intensive service industries, companies could obtain a
higher return from a smaller capital investment. So higher profitability was
partly a product of the UK's relatively low rate of business investment in
the 1980s.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Yeltsin pledge to direct missiles away from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, has promised to change the guidance
system of the former Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles so they no
longer target the US.
'We want to change our military doctrine and no longer regard the US as our
potential adversary,' Mr Yeltsin said in an interview with ABC TV, filmed
over the weekend and to be broadcast on Friday.
The Russian president did not say whether other nuclear states - such as
France, the UK and China - were also no longer seen as hostile, nor did he
specify to what targets the missiles would be redirected.
In the US, President George Bush is expected to propose deep new cuts in
nuclear warheads in his State of the Union address to Congress tomorrow. He
is also expected to discuss the plans with Mr Yeltsin at Camp David next
weekend.
The US cuts are likely to focus on multi-warhead missiles at land and sea,
with one option being to scale back the number of warheads on each missile
and phase out other systems such as the land-based MX peacekeeper.
The administration is also leaning towards abandonment of the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, the 1972 treaty signed with the former Soviet Union which
laid down strict guidelines on the development and deployment of defences
against offensive nuclear missiles.
A team of US nuclear arms experts led by a senior state department official
visited Moscow last week and asked Russia and other nuclear-armed republics
to adhere to the Start treaty signed last year which cuts offensive warheads
by 30 per cent, but made no mention of the ABM treaty, the Washington Post
reported.
The break-up of the Soviet Union and the risks of nuclear proliferation have
generated fresh support in the US for scaling back offensive systems and
strengthened defences. This marks a shift in old nuclear doctrine.
Mr Yeltsin said during the TV interview at the weekend that an official
statement on the change of direction for intercontinental missiles would be
made today, and would be repeated when Mr Yeltsin appears before the UN
Security Council on Friday.
Senior military figures and foreign policy analysts in Moscow have
complained that the cuts in weaponry, and defence procurement made by the
Russian budget - passed by deputies in the Russian parliament on Friday -
has left the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Russia with no
coherent military doctrine.
Mr Yeltsin has stressed in meetings with the British and French foreign
ministers that the nuclear forces of the CIS are under a single unified
command, and that he, together with Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov,
commander-in-chief of the CIS forces, have the final decision on their use.
The strategic and tactical missiles based in other republics are due to be
sent back to Russia, or destroyed in situ, over the next few years. Mr
Leonid Privalov, deputy chairman of Belarus's parliamentary Commission of
National Security, said yesterday that the first batch of tactical missiles
had already been sent to Russia.
Mr Privalov said: 'Belarus will get rid of its strategic weapons around 1996
or 1997. . . at present we do not see an adversary, either near our borders
or elsewhere, with whom we would need to fight.'

FT  27 JAN 92 / Cresson, Mitterrand see poll ratings rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STEADY fall in popularity of France's President Francois Mitterrand has
apparently halted as both he and Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister,
experienced a rise in their opinion poll ratings.
The latest Ifop poll, published in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche, shows
that 26 per cent of voters are satisfied with Mr Mitterrand's performance,
compared with just 22 per cent in December, when he registered the lowest
rating of any president in the history of the Fifth Republic. This increase
is the first rise in his ratings after nine successive months of decline.
Mrs Cresson, a controversial figure since she became prime minister last
spring, has also benefited from a slight improvement in popularity. The
proportion of voters who said they were satisfied with her rose to 23 per
cent from 20 per cent a month ago.
Both Mr Mitterrand and Mrs Cresson seem to have arrested their sliding
popularity by winning the approval of previously ambivalent voters, rather
than by converting their critics. Most voters still claim to be dissatisfied
with them. The president's dissatisfaction rating has fallen by just two
points to 63 per cent over the past month and that of the prime minister by
one point to 56 per cent.
This swing in the opinion polls is not strong enough to affect the political
prospects of France's Socialist party as it prepares to fight the regional
elections this year and next year's national elections. However, it does
reflect the lowering of the political temperature in France, where the
Socialists have tried to highlight wider issues such as immigration.
On Saturday some senior government figures - including former prime
ministers Mr Michel Rocard and Mr Laurent Fabius, recently appointed head of
the Socialist party - joined more than 50,000 demonstrators in an
anti-racist march through Paris.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Bush to stress growth in Congress address
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush will unveil a long-awaited US economic growth package
tomorrow, as well as deeper cuts in defence spending, in a speech aimed at
reviving his popularity.
The anti-recession proposals and the promise of a 'peace dividend' are
expected to be the centrepiece of Mr Bush's State of the Union address to
Congress tomorrow night, the launch-pad for his campaign to win re-election
in November.
Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, said yesterday the speech and
the fiscal 1993 budget to be announced on Wednesday would be dedicated to
putting the US back to work and 'getting government off America's back'.
Mr Bush is likely to call for a 90-day freeze on new government regulations.
Mr Skinner blamed environmental restrictions on logging in the Pacific
north-west as a prime example of regulations which had cost 'thousands of
jobs'. The president may also seek the scrapping of a luxury tax on boats,
another hindrance criticised by Mr Skinner.
The White House has given the State of the Union address advance billing
worthy of the Gettysburg Address. It hopes the address will simultaneously
restore public confidence in the economy and mark the turnaround in Mr
Bush's fortunes. The speech comes just three weeks before the key New
Hampshire primary election.
Mr Bush, who has promised 'long-term' solutions to the economy and disavowed
'quick fixes', is nevertheless expected to propose a variety of sweeteners
for the middle-income voters who make up most of the electorate.
These are expected to include a personal tax exemption of up to Dollars
1,000 (Pounds 552) per child, a Dollars 5,000 tax credit for first-time
home-buyers spread over two years, expanded individual retirement and
savings accounts, a health tax credit for the poor and middle class, and
faster depreciation for business investments.
Mr Bush is also expected to press for a cut in the capital gains tax.
However, Democrats signalled yesterday that the price of passage for this in
Congress would probably be a tax on the wealthy - which the president
opposes. Mr Bush is also expected to propose cuts of up to Dollars 50bn,
beyond those already contemplated, in defence spending over the next five
years.
In the coming months the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate will
determine how many of his proposals actually pass into law.
Reuter adds: Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, was
yesterday given an enhanced role as director of communications, as President
Bush moved to halt a perceived failure to put across his proper message.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Clinton gambles on TV appeal over sex claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas and his wife Hillary yesterday recorded an
interview to appear on prime-time television to answer charges of marital
infidelity which have hit his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
The decision to give the interview, to be broadcast last night, was a gamble
for Mr Clinton. But the 46-year-old Yale- and Oxford-educated governor
calculated he had to lay the accusations to rest if he was to remain a
contender for the nomination.
With just three weeks to go until the critical opening primary election in
New Hampshire, Mr Clinton is the media-anointed front-runner, better known
than his rivals (thanks in large part to the sex-scandal rumours) but more
vulnerable to scrutiny and attack.
In the interview with the CBS news programme Sixty Minutes, according to one
of Mr Clinton's advisers who was present at the recording, the candidate and
his wife repeated statements that their marriage has had problems in the
past, but was now solid. They denied reports that Mr Clinton had a 12-year
affair with a nightclub singer.
The Clinton campaign received one welcome piece of news at the weekend; the
Arkansas state employee whose unsubstantiated allegations formed the basis
for tabloid stories that have dogged Mr Clinton's campaign, said he was
dropping the lawsuit in which he made the claims.

<TEXT>
THIS is a partial text of the communique issued by finance ministers and
central bankers of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries.
The finance ministers and central bank governors of Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States met on 25 January in
New York and agreed to intensify their co-operative efforts to strengthen
world economic growth.
The ministers and governors expressed their concern that economic activity
had weakened since their last meeting. In some countries, early signs of
recovery had not been sustained, while other countries were experiencing a
deceleration from high rates of growth, jeopardising gains in employment
achieved during the last decade and raising the danger of renewed
protectionism. Consumer and business confidence has remained weak, thus
delaying a resumption of economic activity.
The ministers and governors are convinced, however, that the forces that
have been inhibiting economic activity in many countries are dissipating and
that the conditions for improved global growth exist. Inflation expectations
have eased considerably and, with the exception of some countries, wage and
price pressures have been declining markedly. Long-term interest rates have
fallen in all countries and, in some cases, substantially. Oil prices have
remained stable.
In order to reinforce the recovery process, the ministers and governors
agreed that in present circumstances there was a need to intensify their
co-operative efforts to improve the conditions for non-inflationary growth
in their economies, thereby strengthening the world economy. Ministers and
governors accordingly agreed that a stable policy framework should be
provided which creates an environment for renewed economic confidence. They
believe strongly that the appropriate framework is one of fiscal and
monetary policies geared to sustainable growth with price stability over the
medium-term. These are the essential conditions for lower interest rates and
productive investment that will support the recovery and lead to a reduction
in unemployment.
Ministers and governors reconfirmed their commitment to the policy
co-ordination process which has contributed to the good performance of the
world economy in the 1980s. They reaffirmed the need to raise world savings.
They insisted strongly on the necessity of maintaining open and efficient
global markets to assist the economies of both industrial and developing
countries. They stressed that a satisfactory conclusion of the Uruguay Round
would enhance private-sector confidence and make an essential contribution
to global economic growth. It was acknowledged that the completion of the
internal market of the EC at the end of this year and the recent decisions
in Maastricht would further strengthen fundamentals for economic growth in
Europe.
As to economic policies in their respective countries, ministers and
governors agreed that each country would implement fiscal, monetary and
structural policies to promote the conditions for sustainable growth with
price stability. The specific mix of policies would vary depending on the
circumstances in each country.
On fiscal policy, ministers and governors noted that in some could be
reallocated through targeted measures designed to improve confidence and to
enhance productivity. They emphasised the need, however, for countries with
large fiscal deficits and high public debt to continue medium-term efforts
at fiscal consolidation as a means of improving national savings and
reducing real interest rates.
On monetary policy, ministers and governors acknowledged the improvement in
inflation performance in many countries over the past year.
Monetary policies should be directed to preserving the gains that have been
achieved in reducing inflation while providing adequate scope to finance
sustainable growth. Those countries which in the future experience better
than expected inflation performance may have a basis for an easing of
monetary conditions and interest rates without jeopardising the commitment
to price stability and exchange rate objectives.
On structural policies, ministers and governors emphasised the need to
continue reforms in order to reduce rigidities, to strengthen market forces,
and to improve the efficiency of their economies and the world economy
generally.
The ministers and governors reviewed their economic policies in light of
these developments and objectives.
The US will announce in the president's State of the Union address a
comprehensive programme to strengthen growth and competitiveness. The
programme will include measures to improve consumer confidence, incentives
for savings and investment and increased research and development
expenditures.
The government of Japan submitted to the Diet the fiscal 1992 budget and the
fiscal investment and loan programme aimed at strengthening domestic demand
by increased public investment through the central government and local
governments.
The Canadian authorities will continue to implement their medium-term policy
of deficit reduction and spending control.
The French authorities will continue to pursue an economic policy geared to
monetary stability and to non-inflationary growth, more productive in terms
of jobs.
In the United Kingdom, with underlying inflation continuing to fall and
interest rates down substantially over the past year, the conditions for a
resumption of growth have been established. The UK government remains
committed to maintaining sterling's parity within the ERM and to moving in
due course to the narrow bands; while fiscal policy continues to be set so
as to achieve budget balance over the economic cycle.
In Germany, growth is expected to remain solid. Continued policies of
medium-term fiscal consolidation, together with a deceleration of the strong
growth in money supply and credit demand as well as an easing of wage
pressures and regaining price stability could create room for lower interest
rates.
Ministers and governors welcome the determination of the Italian government
to contain wages in the public sector within the limits of the budget law,
and to reduce the size of the government in the economy.
The ministers and governors also reviewed developments in foreign exchange
markets. In the context of economic policy co-ordination, they noted that
their efforts in recent years had contributed to more stable currency
markets. They agreed to continue to monitor market developments and
reaffirmed their commitment to co-operate closely in exchange markets, thus
contributing to favourable conditions for stable exchange markets and
economic recovery.
The ministers and governors discussed the situation in the former Soviet
Union and the reform measures recently implemented in some of the
independent states. Economic reforms should be formulated and implemented in
close co-operation with the International Monetary Fund.
The ministers and governors noted the application for IMF membership by the
Baltic States, Russia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Armenia. They
requested the IMF to act expeditiously to finalise by the spring meetings
the arrangements needed to complete membership procedures for those states
with applications under consideration which are able to meet the conditions
for membership.

FT  27 JAN 92 / G7 will act to strengthen world economic growth: Possibility
of interest rate cuts Lamont sees recovery 'delayed, not cancelled'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S leading industrial countries have agreed to intensify their
efforts to strengthen world economic growth in response to a weakening of
the global economy in the past three months.
After meeting for more than seven hours on Saturday, the finance ministers
and central bank governors of the Group of Seven nations said they were
convinced that forces inhibiting economic activity in many countries were
dissipating.
Lower inflation in most countries, lower long-term interest rates and stable
oil prices meant the conditions for improved growth existed. 'The clear view
was that the recovery had been delayed, not cancelled,' said Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor.
However, the G7 - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada
 -agreed that the recovery needed reinforcing. The communique issued after
the meeting raised the possibility of future interest rate cuts and fiscal
measures to boost growth in some countries. But it left individual
governments to determine the scope and timing of policy changes.
The US was alone in making a public promise of fresh action. The statement
said President George Bush's State of the Union address tomorrow would
announce a comprehensive programme to strengthen growth and competitiveness.
The US programme would include 'measures to improve consumer confidence,
incentives for savings and investment, and increased research and
development expenditures'.
While the communique listed the efforts being made by the seven to boost
output, it underlined that the lower inflation rates achieved by many
countries over the past year should not be jeopardised. The statement was a
carefully crafted compromise between the US, which wants greater growth, and
Germany, which fears a return to stop-go policies.
Consistent with a cautious policy approach, the G7 spoke of a 'reallocation'
rather than an expansion of government spending in some countries, and
warned that others such as Italy must focus on reducing their budget
deficits. The statement took a similarly careful line on interest rates,
advocating reductions in those countries which in future have lower
inflation than expected.
German officials made clear that an early cut in the Bundesbank's interest
rates was not to be expected.
However, the meeting marked a change of emphasis in favour of stronger
growth by the G7. 'It is a strong political statement of a consensus to
strengthen world economic growth,' said a senior US Treasury official, who
predicted action by member countries of the group between now and the
meetings of the International Monetary Fund in April.
The weekend meeting also discussed the economic crisis in the former Soviet
Union and developments on exchange markets.
In a characteristicly opaque statement, the ministers agreed 'to continue to
monitor market developments and to co-operate closely in exchange markets,
thus contributing to favourable conditions for stable exchange markets and
economic recovery'.
The G7 made no mention of specific currencies. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the
French finance minister, said the lack of mention of the yen, dollar or
other currencies meant that current parities suited everybody at the
meeting. He indicated that the G7 would keep rates stable 'at the levels
that you have seen in recent days'.
In Tokyo today the dollar opened at Y124.65 after closing at Y124.57 on
Friday. 'The momentum for a higher yen has weakened,' a Tokyo banker said.
The Nikkei average fell about 190 points in early trading.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Yeltsin seeks aid promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   GARDEN CITY, NEW YORK,, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin is this week to tell Mr John Major that the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries must give an immediate
commitment to support Russian economic reform or face the collapse of both
the government and the reform process.
Mr Yeltsin, who is due to meet the British prime minister in London on
Thursday, is expected to ask for support of around Dollars 10bn to Dollars
12bn (Pounds 5.5bn to Pounds 6.6bn) in order to avert deepening economic
chaos throughout the former Soviet Union. Part of the money would be to
assist the Russian balance of payments and to provide currency for imports,
especially of food, and about Dollars 5bn of it would be for a fund to
stabilise the rouble.
This is in spite of the view taken by G7 finance ministers and central bank
governors at their weekend meeting in Garden City, New York, that it was too
early to set up a stabilisation fund to underpin the rouble. They did not
rule out such a fund in the future and British and US sides took opposing
views on the issue.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said he raised and
pressed the question of a stabilisation fund for Russia in the hope that the
G7 would commit itself to providing such a fund at a later date after
suitable economic reforms had been carried out in Russia. The chancellor
warned that the industrialised countries were likely to have to set up a
fund or do something very similar in the longer term.
The G7 did call for Russia and other former Soviet republics to become
members of the International Monetary Fund by the end of April, a move that
would give them access to IMF support programmes.
It 'requested the IMF to act expeditiously to finalise by the spring
meetings (of the fund at the end of April) the arrangements needed to
complete membership proceedings' of those former Soviet republics that have
applied to join. They are Russia, the three Baltic states, Ukraine,
Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The assistance Mr Yeltsin is seeking will be requested to be committed
before Russia is admitted to full membership of the fund. Russian officials
said at the weekend that this timescale was too slow. They would need funds
assembled and available by March at the latest, rather than from May.
A letter of intent from the Russian government to join the IMF is being
thrashed out by both sides and is expected to be completed over the next
four weeks, to go to the IMF board by March.
Officials from the IMF and the G7 are concerned that the Russian government
has not yet gained adequate control over the central bank, which has been
issuing credits and currency freely, and that the fiscal system remains
inadequate.
The ministers came closer to agreement on the size of quota or membership
subscription for the former Soviet republics. According Mr Don Mazankowski,
the Canadian finance minister, the quota size could be 'anywhere from 3.5
per cent to 4.5 per cent' of the fund's total quotas. This would give the
republics access to around Dollars 12bn from the fund to support approved
economic reforms.
It is thought in Moscow that Russia could count on immediate assistance of
little more than Dollars 3bn - a sum far below what ministers there believe
is needed for stabilisation.
The US is strongly opposed to a rouble support fund at present. A senior US
Treasury official said to set up such a fund prematurely would be to create
a conduit for capital flight because there was insufficient confidence in
the rouble.
Mr Lamont admitted that much needed to be done in Russia but he said the G7
should take into account the courage of Mr Yeltsin's reforms in considering
the stabilisation fund issue.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK plans to open market for international telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is close to licensing a new type of international
telecommunications operator which it hopes will undercut prices being
charged on international calls by BT and Mercury Communications.
The new operator could lease cable and satellite capacity in bulk from BT -
previously British Telecom - and Mercury, and sell usage of it to customers.
For example, an operator could lease circuits between London and New York,
and use these to provide a cut-price phone service.
Ministers are unlikely to allow new operators to build and own international
networks.
Sprint, the US telecommunications group, has already applied for a licence.
The moves follow last year's telecommunications white paper which opened the
door to domestic network competition but was vague on international
communications, where BT and Mercury earn their highest rates of
profitability.
The paper said that resale would be allowed on international routes where
the country at the other end had an equivalently open telecommunications
market. No country has yet been considered to be sufficiently liberal.
The Department of Trade and Industry now believes that several countries -
including the US, Japan, Canada, Australia, Sweden and New Zealand - are
likely to pass this test.
Mr John Redwood, the telecommunications minister, has held meetings with US
authorities to try to open up the market. A statement from the US Federal
Communications Commission last month supporting further liberalisation of
the US market is viewed as important by the UK but full clarification is
being sought before resale to the US goes ahead.
The government believes the international network is the part of the market
where prices are most out of line with costs. Observers argue that, although
resale will exert some downward pressure on prices, the full benefits will
only come from network competition.
But the government is concerned that a unilateral opening of the UK market
could put British companies at a disadvantage unless foreign markets were
also opened up. It also fears that foreign telephone companies could abuse
their power in overseas markets to distort competition in the UK, if they
were granted international licences.
Ministers would have had to address similar concerns if American Telephone
and Telegraph, the largest US telecommunications operator, were to take a
stake in Mercury.
The government would consider using its 'golden' share in Cable and
Wireless, Mercury's parent, to ensure that any tie-up did not lead to a
distortion of the market.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Stockholm wary of proposed Volvo merger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, Sweden's largest industrial group, has announced plans to merge with
Procordia, the food and pharmaceutical company partly owned by the Swedish
government, in a SKr38.7bn (Pounds 3.73bn) deal, the largest in the
country's history.
Last night, however, doubts were being cast over the deal by the Swedish
government, which is the second-largest owner of Procordia.
Mr Per Westerberg, the country's industry minister, said that if the
government's recently appointed advisory privatisation commission, which is
examining the deal, advised against the merger today, he did not see how it
could go ahead.
The proposed conglomerate would carry the Volvo name, with assets valued at
SKr130bn, turnover of SKr115bn and 105,000 employees. It would be Sweden's
biggest private employer, with activities ranging from cars and trucks to
health care products, food processing, alcohol, tobacco, hotels and
restaurants.
When the plan was announced on Saturday, it was immediately criticised for
lack of industrial logic by the privatisation commission.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive chairman who will chair the new
company, said it would mean Sweden had 'an enterprise with resources
enabling it to participate in the current process of industrial change in
Europe'. Mr Soren Gyll, Procordia's head, is to be president and chief
executive of the new company. Mr Christer Zetterberg, Volvo's current
president and chief executive, has been named as his deputy.
Volvo already owns 39.5 per cent of Procordia's equity and 42.7 per cent of
the voting shares. The Swedish government, with 34.2 per cent of equity and
42.7 per cent of voting rights, so far has not given its approval to the
deal, which is structured as a reverse takeover of Volvo by Procordia.
Last Friday the privatisation commission rejected the first offer made by
Procordia, arguing that the terms were too favourable to Volvo shareholders.
Under the revised offer, Procordia is offering nine of its A shares for four
of Volvo's A shares, and nine B shares for four Volvo B shares. It is also
bidding for Volvo's convertible debentures on a comparable basis.
The offer is valued at SKr38.7bn based on Procordia's share price at close
of trading on the Stockholm bourse on January 24. After full conversion it
is designed to provide Volvo shareholders with a 22 per cent average premium
to the market price.
Volvo's strategic French partner Renault has agreed to the proposed merger,
although its own stake in the Swedish group will be halved to 4.2 per cent
as a result. The offer is subject to acceptance by 90 per cent of Volvo's
shareholders and to approval by Procordia shareholders.
Volvo and Procordia want the government to sell or reduce its own stake in
the company. Unless ministers agree, the Swedish state would have an
estimated 25.6 per cent equity in the 'new' Volvo , but retain about 45 per
cent of voting rights.
The prospectus will be available on April 20 and the subscription period
will last from May 4 to June 1. It is hoped the new company will be
registered on 22 June.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Justinian: Limits of criminal justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Lord Chief Justice observed that three officers from the Surrey
police who in 1974 were involved in the arrest and questioning of the
Guildford Four 'must have lied' about their recording of the accused's
confessions to the planting of bombs in two public houses in Guildford and
Woolwich, there was a reflex public reaction. The general mood was that the
three police officers should instantly be prosecuted for a wicked offence.
The prosecuting authority responded by charging them with conspiring to
pervert the course of justice.
The decision of a Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate that inordinate delay
 -17 years - in bringing the officers to justice, combined with contemporary
prejudicial publicity, would render any trial unfair was reversed last week
by the High Court. It held that the decision of the magistrate was so
unreasonable that no reasonable magistrate could sensibly have so decided.
It ordered the reinstatement of the charges and directed Bow Street
magistrates' court to go ahead with committal proceedings. If committed for
trial, the officers case should be heard by judge and jury before the end of
1992.
Irrational as the decision of the magistrate might have been, there is no
guarantee that the jury at trial may not share the magistrate's instinctive
revulsion at the prospect of justice being far too long delayed for the
comfort of a civilised society. The jury's verdict - irrational or not -
will be unassailable. The magistrate's decision is judicially reviewable; a
jury's verdict is not. The police officers will face one of two outcomes:
conviction or acquittal. Is criminal justice a sensible instrument to deploy
to find out precisely why the 1974 prosecution produced such a substantial
miscarriage of justice?
Long before there was ever any question of a criminal prosecution of any
police officer, the government had ordered a public inquiry into the
circumstances surrounding the convictions arising out of the bomb attacks in
Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Sir John May, a former Lord Justice of
Appeal, began the inquiry and in July 1990 published his interim report. In
it he concluded that the scientific evidence at the trial was flawed in ways
which seriously undermined the prosecutions.
The prosecution had been based almost entirely on forensic evidence which
sought to establish that there were traces of nitro-glycerine on the hands
of six of the accused, and on the gloves of the seventh. It sought to prove
that the presence of such traces was consistent only with the deliberate
handling of explosives.
Sir John May recommended that the Home Secretary should refer the
convictions to the Court of Appeal. This was done on July 12 1990. When the
case was heard by the Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions conceded
that on the issue of innocent contamination, the convictions could not be
sustained. The appeal hearing led inevitably to the quashing of the
convictions, in the course of which the authenticity of the confessions was
challenged by the appellants. Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice, made the
statement that prompted the prosecution of the three police officers.
Simultaneously, Sir John May re-opened his inquiry. In June 1991 he began
public hearings with a view to identifying areas of potential criticism of
the Home Office in relation to its handling of the case. He pointed to the
requirement of the Home Office to refer cases to the Court of Appeal only
where there was new evidence or a new consideration of substantial
significance. He questioned the practice of limiting any review of alleged
miscarriages of justice. The Home Secretary at the time, Mr Douglas Hurd,
gave evidence last year to Sir John May in which he readily conceded that
the system of executive review by the Home Office was less than
satisfactory.
Throughout the public hearings, and in his own private deliberations, Sir
John was forced to exclude from his inquiries anything that touched on the
criminal investigations which had been undertaken by the Surrey Police in
1974. To have done so would have been regarded as potentially influencing
the outcome of the prosecution of the three police officers.
Sir John was bound to defer any consideration of the serious allegations
about police intimidation of witnesses and the suppression of alibi
evidence. But by the time the police officers are tried, the public's taste
for yet another trawling over the criminal investigations and the final
reporting by Sir John May - by then probably 20 years after the event - will
have been satiated. And if the officers are acquitted, who would favour a
rerun of the events which have been scrutinised by the jury?
Is there not a strong case for the thoroughness of a public inquiry,
uninhibited by the elaborate procedural safeguards of a criminal trial,
rather than the use of the heavy hand of a criminal trial? Criminal justice
is a cumbersome and costly process, designed to punish the perpetrators of
crime. It satisfies a proper public desire to control crime by way of
focusing on defined criminal events, but its function involves only a
limited exercise in determining individual criminal responsibility.
The criminal trial is unconcerned with unmasking the often troubling
circumstances that relate to the conduct of public authorities and agencies
in the prosecution process. Public disquiet about such matters can be
allayed only by processes other than those of criminal justice.
Is there not a strong case for the thoroughness of a public inquiry?

FT  27 JAN 92 / Dr Bush makes a faulty diagnosis: Michael Prowse on America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I'll do it my way,' sang Frank Sinatra. This, in a nutshell, appears to be
President George Bush's approach to health care.
In tomorrow's State of the Union address, Mr Bush is expected to end three
years of procrastination and unveil radical reform proposals. This is a
great step forward for a president who used to 'switch off' when aides
raised questions about escalating costs or the plight of the 35m uninsured
Americans. The problem is that he appears unwilling to heed lessons learned
throughout the developed world.
Governments everywhere have found that costs can be controlled and access to
care guaranteed only by expanding the public sector's role. The US has tried
to buck this trend and ended up with by far the worst record on both costs
and access. Instead of finally recognising the need for tougher public
regulation of the private sector - an option favoured by many Democrats - Mr
Bush is pining his hopes on yet another 'market-oriented' reform. The main
elements are expected to include:
Refundable tax credits to help the poor purchase insurance cover.
Reforms of private health insurance to discourage discrimination against
small business and high-risk individuals.
A cap on tax relief on employer schemes for high earners.
Means-testing of Medicare, the universal public-sector scheme for the
elderly.
Incentives for pre-paid (and thus supposedly economical) health care systems
such as Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs).
Taken individually, a case can be made for all of these measures. But they
do not amount to a coherent strategy. The ideas are mostly drawn from reform
plans put forward by conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation, a
Washington think tank. The conservative diagnosis of the problem lays heavy
stress on misguided tax policies.
Conservatives argue that the US's biggest mistake is to provide open-ended
tax relief for employer schemes. This is allegedly economically inefficient
because employees, regarding health care as an obligation of employers, have
little regard for its cost. It is unfair because the subsidy - worth some
Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn a year - goes disproportionately to the well-paid,
who enjoy the most lavish care.
The solution touted is a 'Robin Hood' reform. Eliminate tax relief for
employer schemes and shift primary responsibility for health care to
individuals. People will then shop around for the best value health
insurance, putting sustained downward pressure on costs. Use the money saved
to provide income-related tax credits for individuals thus ensuring that the
low-paid can afford health insurance. Give the poorest grants sufficient to
pay for a basic level of insurance cover. By rejigging the tax system, the
argument runs, you can control costs and close gaps in health care coverage.
In some proposals, Medicare and Medicaid, the public-sector schemes for the
elderly and poor, disappear altogether. But if they were to continue,
means-testing of benefits for the better off would help finance care for the
poor. And everybody in public schemes would be given an incentive to enter
HMOs and other forms of managed care. Additional incentives to control costs
in the private sector might be unnecessary, enthusiasts claim, if most
individuals personally bore the full costs of health insurance.
These radical free market plans may look appealing on paper. But their
practical relevance is limited. No administration would be likely to attempt
Robin Hood transfers on the scale needed. The Bush plan (which Congress will
probably veto anyway) is expected to cap tax relief on employer schemes only
for the few per cent of families earning more than Dollars 125,000 a year.
Most health benefits even for these families would remain tax free.
The tax credits for poor families are expected to be about Dollars 500 to
Dollars 1,500, nowhere near large enough to cover the cost of premiums,
which averaged nearly Dollars 4,000 last year. The credits will also
probably be phased out a little above poverty-line incomes, meaning that
many uninsured would not qualify for relief anyway.
Fiscal tinkering on this scale will do little either to control health care
costs or extend insurance cover. The logic behind the more radical free
market plans is anyway deeply suspect. It is unreasonable to argue that
health care costs are out of control primarily because of tax distortions.
US workers already bear a much higher proportion of direct health costs than
their counterparts elsewhere. The fundamental causes of cost inflation are
the diffusion of expensive technology and the ability of suppliers of health
care - the medical profession - to determine demand by stipulating the level
of care that is necessary. The only plausible way to control costs is for
public agencies to impose direct budget controls on hospitals and doctors.
The notion that tax credits - however generous - would solve the problem of
access to care is equally misguided. Many people would fail to buy
insurance, just as they fail to save for old age. Administrative costs would
anyway be prohibitive, perhaps absorbing as much as 40 per cent of premiums.
Every other country has guaranteed access to care through some form of
national health insurance financed either through taxes or payroll levies.
Mr Bush prides himself on being an internationalist. Why cannot he accept
that on health care, it is the US, rather than the rest of the world, that
is marching out of step?

FT  27 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Waiting for G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign exchange market will focus on the outcome of weekend's meeting
of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven industrial
countries.
In particular, there is speculation that the meeting could herald a period
of co-ordinated exchange rate policy in pursuit of broader economic
objectives. This would entail a committment to concerted intervention as and
when required.
The most likely target for intervention is the yen, which many governments
would like to see strengthen as a means of capping the huge Japanese trade
surplus - up 50 per cent to Dollars 78.2bn last year.
The US and Japanese authorities have already co-operated in this regard,
selling dollars for yen on January 17 in a surprise bout of intervention. Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, added to speculation that a
broader exchange rate policy may be agreed by commenting last week that a
gradual appreciation of the yen was desirable.
Yet the dollar, in particular, does not seem keen to obey the wishes of its
would-be political masters. Intervention by the US Federal Reserve and the
Bank of Japan pushed the US currency down to below Y123 for a time last
week, but by Friday the dollar bulls were pushing back up to Y125.
Analysts question how long even a concerted exchange rate policy by the G7
countries can cap the dollar and support the yen. Many are predicting a
dollar/yen rate of Y140 by the year end, irrespective of intervention.
The reasoning is that Japanese interest rates will have to come down as the
economy slows, while US rates may have bottomed. The volatility of the stock
market last week was clearly of concern, leading the Japanese authorities
allowed money market rates to slide.

FT  27 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Roaring start may herald record year in
D-Mark sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark Eurobond market could be set for a record year of new issue
volume, judging by the surge of activity in the first few weeks of the year.
New issues totalling nearly DM7bn have emerged so far this year, already
about 20 per cent of last year's total.
The sector stands to benefit from bullish sentiment on German interest rates
and the D-Mark. With last year's poor performance poised for reversal, there
has already been a substantial shift of assets, largely US, into the German
bond market.
Demand for D-Mark Eurobonds seems unusually broad-based, covering retail and
institutional investors in the domestic market and overseas. The average new
issue size has risen from DM160m to DM280m, which could boost liquidity, and
surging demand has attracted a more international range of issuers,
including Norway and Belgium.
Borrowers have also been enticed by arbitrage opportunities enabling them to
swap new issue proceeds into floating rate funds at attractive rates.
However, swap rates shifted abruptly last week, due to a lack of
counterparties willing to pay fixed-rate D-Marks. As D-Mark rates are widely
expected to fall, few banks will at present commit themselves to paying
fixed-rate interest in D-Marks - at least not at a rate attractive to
borrowers.
The market faces other potential handicaps. Although yields are expected to
fall, it will be difficult for Eurobond yields to maintain their tight
spreads relative to bunds. Some Eurobond yields are lower than bund yields,
reflecting the participation of retail investors who often prefer bearer
bonds to registered paper, for tax reasons. Nevertheless, dealers say this
anomaly cannot persist in a widely-traded market.
Illogical trading levels reflect a more serious problem: the market's
well-known illiquidity, which could yet scotch the expansion of the market,
despite favourable portents.
German institutions, as well as retail investors, are less concerned about
liquidity than many of their counterparts overseas. 'A lot of German
institutions, like insurance companies, are still lock-up buyers,' one
trader said.
The market is still largely domestic in character, and overseas institutions
in many cases prefer to buy bunds, particularly when D-Mark Eurobonds offer
little pick-up.
Also, the structure of the primary market is old-fashioned - for example,
the fee structure is not competitive with other Eurobond sectors.
However, there are some favourable points.
Bund market volume no longer seems a serious threat, given the bull market.
Last year, the market was beset by fears that borrowing requirements would
rocket because of the need to fund the development of eastern Germany. But
bund issuance fell well below initial expectations.
The government's handling of its borrowing has also reassured investors.
'The panic selling of bunds (by the government) of two years ago is over,'
said one trader. If the market can absorb government debt, part of any
residual appetite for paper will generate demand for Eurobonds.
Secondly, following the recent securities reforms, Frankfurt's desire to
liberalise is seen as hopeful. The way could soon be open for development of
a medium-term note market, which would broaden Germany's debt markets.
Meanwhile, Frankfurt's growing importance as a financial sector is prompting
international banks, US investment banks in particular, to build up their
presence there. As this shift coincides with a bull market in German bonds,
these banks are likely to renew their efforts in a sector long dominated by
German banks.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Borrowing costs set to rise at Rosehaugh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESTRUCTURING of loans to Rosehaugh, the heavily-indebted UK property
company, and its property joint ventures, looks likely to result in higher
borrowing costs for these companies.
The restructuring of all of Rosehaugh's debts is due to be completed within
a few weeks. As a result, Rosehaugh is expected to have to pay higher
margins on its loans, and to have the maturity of these loans extended.
Bankers may insist on improving the security on those loans currently
unsecured or partly secured.
Rosehaugh and Stanhope, joint owners of the Broadgate office complex in the
City of London, called a halt to their merger talks last week after several
months of discussions.
According to data supplied by Euromoney, Rosehaugh and its associated
companies have the following debts:
A four-year Pounds 350m term loan for Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (phase
8) and Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (phase 11) which matures in 1992 and
has a margin of 100 basis points over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor).
A three-and-a-half year Pounds 36m term loan for Rosehaugh SC, a 50-50 joint
venture between Rosehaugh and Shimizu Corp. The loan matures in 1992. The
funds are secured on the property with the margin set according to whether
the property is pre-let or pre-sold.
A five-year Pounds 100m multiple facility revolving credit for Rosehaugh
which matures in 1993 and has a margin of 15 basis points over Libor.
A four-year Pounds 65m term loan for Rosehaugh Stanhope (Broadgate phase 14)
maturing in 1993. This carries a margin of 125 basis points over Libor
during development, 75 during the let stage and 50 during the pre-sold stage
with the funds secured.
A four-year Pounds 280m term loan maturing 1994 for Rosehaugh Stanhope
Developments (Holborn Viaduct) with a margin of 125 basis points falling to
100 basis points over Libor if the property is let.
In addition, Rosehaugh and its joint venture companies have some bilateral
loans.
Rosehaugh warned its bankers in November 1991 that it was in danger of
breaching the net worth covenants on its loans, due to the fall in property
prices and the decline in its net asset value. Since then, Barclays and
NatWest, joint co-ordinators for the various loans, have held discussions
with the 27 banks involved on how to restructure all the company's
facilities.
So far it looks as though the pricing will have to be increased given that
when the loans were originally launched, pricing was considerably lower than
at present. The maturity of the loans may be extended, since at present the
loans fall due in 1992, 1993 and 1994.
Citibank has arranged a Pounds 50m five-year revolving credit facility for
Laura Ashley with a core group of seven relationship banks.
This replaces an existing three-year Pounds 60m facility signed in November
1990. Laura Ashley wanted to replace it with longer-term funding. The margin
is linked to the company's financial performance. It ranges from 75 basis
points over Libor to 125 depending on the interest cover ratio.

FT  27 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries fall ahead of Bush speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMBINED might of President Bush and America's corporate treasurers has
Wall Street's credit markets unsettled as the US enters a week of great
political importance.
Tomorrow Mr Bush delivers the President's annual state of the union address
and will outline a package of measures to get the US economy moving again.
There are fears in some sections of the credit markets that the resulting
fiscal stimulus could boost inflation, and this has helped push Treasury
bond prices down over the past week.
Corporate treasurers, meanwhile, have continued over the past week with the
avalanche of fixed income and equity new issues which hit the market at the
start of the year. Since dealers often have to sell government securities to
cover their positions in unsold corporate issues, this too has been exerting
downward pressure on government bond prices.
Add in nervousness over the weekend meeting in New York of G7 nations, and
the result last week was a 1 3/16 drop in the price of the benchmark 30-year
Treasury issue, taking its yield back up to 7.71 per cent, compared to 7.61
a week ago and 7.51 four weeks ago.
Long rates are back up around where they were in mid-December, before the
Federal Reserve set in train a powerful rally with its one-point cut in the
discount rate on December 20. Is this a temporary upward blip, as most Wall
Street analysts seem to believe, or are long rates now past their trough for
this economic cycle?
Certainly, a slew of recent statistics suggesting the economy is more or
less 'dead in the water' does not give the bond market too much to fear from
inflation in the short-term. The Fed's latest 'beige book' of regional
economic activity, released this week, described economic activity at the
turn of the year as 'lacklustre'.
That said, the past week has brought some signs of stirring in the housing
market, which tends to be an important leading indicator. Housing starts
were up 2.6 per cent in December, greater than expected, albeit from a low
base.
Banks, meanwhile, have reported a rush of homeowners wanting to remortgage
properties at the lowest interest rates in years. That should eventually
work through into greater consumer confidence and disposable income, giving
a further fillip to the housing market and the wider economy.
In short, the groundwork appears to be being laid for a gradual recovery
which could start to gather momentum around the middle of the year. But the
weakness of the recovery and the historic tendency for inflation to continue
moderating in the early stages of a rebound, suggests that price pressures
may remain weak for months to come.
Nor will President Bush's economic package necessarily have the negative
impact on inflation that the market fears. Inspired leaks over the past few
weeks suggest it is unlikely to add horribly to the budget deficit and will
favour investment rather than consumption - though over the coming months
Congress may try to change that balance.
The Fed's December easing move has certainly helped reduce the head of
political steam for dramatic fiscal action, but where does all this now
leave Fed policy?
The line from the Fed over the past two weeks has been that the economy is
starting a recovery that will become clear by the spring. Mr Gerald
Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, argued this week that he saw
'potential for a strong economic recovery . . . which may surprise us all.'
So the bank might yet hold off the further 25 basis point easing in the Fed
funds rate that much of Wall Street expects in the first half of February -
after the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting at the start of
the month and chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to
Congress.
The market's growing sense that the Fed may not ease again in the near
future was given added force last Thursday, when surprisingly strong money
supply growth figures were released for the week ending January 13. These,
however, may simply be a seasonal aberration, since the underlying growth of
M2 has been weak for months.
All this helps explain the current rush of corporate borrowing. Even if the
Fed does ease again, the effect will be much more powerful at the short end.
The long end has too much to worry about. Long rates may not have bottomed,
but cannot be far from it, making this a very attractive time to lock in
fresh funding.

FT  27 JAN 92 / French Bonds: Stability defies convention after rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVENTIONAL wisdom suggests that two rises in official interest rates in
little more than a month should not be good news for bonds.
But conventions have little or nothing to do with modern markets where
investors are influenced as much by the international environment as by the
exigencies of individual economies. Hence the French bond market has
remained surprisingly stable so far this year, despite France's recent round
of rate rises.
'It's all emotion,' said Mr Christopher Potts, market strategist at Banque
Indosuez in Paris. 'Anyone with any sense knows that French interest rates
cannot come down until the German rate falls in a few months' time. But
investors are looking at the international rather than the domestic context,
and France now seems much more attractive than the US, Canada or Australia.'
As a result French bonds, like their German counterparts, have been buoyed
by the switch of international investment into Europe. Rates on the
benchmark 10-year OAT government bond rose to 8.45 per cent on Friday, from
a cyclical low of 8.36 per cent on Wednesday. This compares to levels of
8.75 a month ago. The Matif's 10-year notional OAT futures contract was
stable beginning the week at 108.72 and ending it at 108.66, against 108 at
the end of last year.
One encouraging sign for the French market was that the spread over German
bunds has been falling. The bund differential is now seen as a critical
indicator of the French market's health given that France's currency and now
its interest rates are effectively tied to those of Germany.
The trend before the Maastricht summit was for the bund differential to
widen. Since then the spread has narrowed. The differential peaked at 70
basis points in early November, slipped to 60 or 65 by mid-December and had
fallen to around 50 basis points last week. Most analysts expect the spread
to fall further.
Meanwhile, the prospects for the French economy are more clouded than ever.
Official forecasts for gross domestic product have growth of 1.4 per cent in
1991 followed by growth of between 2 and 2.2 per cent in 1992. Goldman
Sachs, like most other forecasters, is more cautious, favouring growth of
just 1 per cent to 2 per cent for this year.
Last week's announcement that industrial production fell by 0.6 per cent in
November compared with October highlighted the mood of 'Franco-pessimism' as
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, calls it.
Yet the French can seek solace in low inflation. The December inflation
figures disclosed an increase of 0.1 per cent, producing a total of 3.1 per
cent for 1991, this represents a fall from 3.4 per cent in 1990. Rising
unemployment suggests inflation should stay low for the foreseeable future -
just the way the bond markets like it.

FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: Profits fall at Exxon, Mobil and
Chevron
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION'S impact on oil companies was reflected in the fourth-quarter
results of Exxon, Mobil and Chevron, which all reported sharply lower
earnings for the period.
Very strong oil prices a year earlier, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
made earnings comparisons particularly difficult for the three months.
Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, unveiled a 28 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings but posted a 12 per cent improvement in net income
for the year.
The company blamed the erosion in fourth-quarter earnings on exceptionally
high prices in the corresponding 1990 quarter after the invasion of Kuwait.
The decline also reflects weak gas prices in the US and lower production of
liquids and natural gas.
In the latest quarter, Exxon earned Dollars 1.12bn or 89 cents a share
against Dollars 1.56bn or Dollars 1.23 a year earlier. Revenues fell 12 per
cent to Dollars 30.87bn from Dollars 35.12bn.
Exxon's full-year net income climbed to Dollars 5.6bn or Dollars 4.45 a
share from Dollars 5.01bn or Dollars 3.96. Revenues were flat, at Dollars
116.34bn compared with Dollars 116.94bn a year ago.
Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman, said all the company's earnings growth in the
year and 75 per cent of its profits had come from overseas. 'The company's
foreign refining and marketing operations were well-positioned to respond to
rapidly changing market conditions, particularly in the first quarter when
essentially all of this year's increase in earnings was achieved.'
During the year, crude oil prices fell by Dollars 10-a-barrel, cutting into
Exxon's profits. Earnings were also hit by sluggish natural gas prices in
the US and weak markets for chemicals, coal and copper.
Mobil, the second biggest US oil and gas group, posted fourth-quarter
earnings of Dollars 401m or 97 cents a share, down 38 per cent from 1990's
Dollars 652m or Dollars 1.58 a share. Stripping out one-time items,
fourth-quarter operating earnings were Dollars 389m, down 51 per cent from
Dollars 797m last year.
Mobil's fourth-quarter revenues fell 24 per cent to Dollars 16.63bn from
Dollars 19.38bn. Full-year revenues edged 3 per cent lower to Dollars
62.68bn from Dollars 64.47bn.
For the year, Mobil earned Dollars 1.92bn or Dollars 4.65 a share against
Dollars 1.93bn or Dollars 4.60. Excluding extraordinary items, earnings for
1991 were Dollars 1.90bn against Dollars 1.92bn last year.
Mr Allen Murray, chairman, said Mobil's operating performance helped offset
some of the negative factors in 1991.
Chevron, the fourth biggest US oil company, turned in fourth-quarter
earnings of Dollars 39m or 11 cents a share, including extraordinary items
of Dollars 244m. A year earlier, Chevron earned Dollars 633m or Dollars 1.80
a share, including one-time charges of Dollars 123m.
For the year, Chevron's earnings fell 40 per cent to Dollars 1.29bn or
Dollars 3.69 a share from Dollars 2.16bn or Dollars 6.10 in 1990 in spite of
strong gains from the company's foreign operations. Chevron attributed the
decline to depressed natural gas prices and downstream margins in the US.
Chevron had fourth-quarter revenues of Dollars 10.39bn, down from Dollars
13.76bn. Total 1991 revenues were Dollars 40.95bn from Dollars 42.57bn.
Mr Michael Young, an analyst at Smith Barney, said the results met his
expectations and provided further evidence that the industry would have a
very weak first quarter. 'Clearly oil companies are at the depths of a
recessionary cycle in all of the major segments,' namely chemicals, US and
foreign oil and gas, and US and foreign refining and marketing.
These sentiments were echoed by Mr Murray who said: 'Unfortunately, 1992 is
not off to a good start. There has been no improvement in business
conditions. Crude oil prices have remained weak, as have US natural gas
prices which are below last year's level, and US downstream margins are very
weak.'
Mr Young said he had not changed his earnings estimates for Mobil, Exxon or
Chevron. He expects Mobil to earn 80 cents a share in the 1992 first
quarter, and Dollars 4.15 a share for the full year. He expects Exxon to
earn 85 cents in the first quarter and Dollars 3.90 for the year and Chevron
60 cents in the quarter and Dollars 3.80 in the year.
Imperial Oil, 70 per cent owned by Exxon, and Canada's biggest integrated
oil company, is following Petro-Canada and Shell Canada with heavy cuts in
downstream operations, Robert Gibbens reports from Montreal.
Imperial posted a 1991 operating loss of CDollars 36m (USDollars 31m) on
revenues of CDollars 9.2bn against profits of CDollars 522m on revenues of
CDollars 11.3bn in 1990. But after gains on asset sales and accounting
adjustments, net profits were CDollars 162m or 84 cents a share against
CDollars 256m or CDollars 1.34 a share.
Imperial will probably close two small refineries and several hundred retail
petrol outlets. Staff will be cut from the present 11,500. Details will be
released next month.

FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: Toyota plans to buy minority
stake in French distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the leading Japanese car maker, is planning to buy a minority stake
of about 35 per cent in Toyota France, its privately-owned French importer
and distributor.
The moves follows the acquisition last year by Nissan, the second largest
Japanese car maker, of an additional 72.1 per cent stake in Richard Nissan,
its French importer/distributor, raising its holding to 81.6 per cent.
The leading Japanese car makers are strengthening control of their
distributors in Europe in preparation for the creation of the single
European market from the end of 1992. Tighter control will also help them
cope with the growing supply of cars from their European assembly plants
during the 1990s.
Toyota's first European car plant, located at Burnaston near Derby in the
UK, begins production in late 1992, as does Honda's car plant at Swindon.
Nissan's plant at Sunderland in north-east England, which began production
in 1986, is expected to raise car output to 175,000 this year and to 270,000
in 1993.
Toyota France is currently 98.5 per cent owned by Walter Frey Holding of
Switzerland, the holding company for the Emil Frey motor distributor and
motor retailing group.
Mr Walter Frey, chairman of the family-owned company, said that Toyota had
received permission in December from the French authorities to take a
substantial minority stake in Toyota France.
The timing of the acquisition and the price were still to be negotiated. The
Emil Frey group would remain the Toyota importer/distributor in Switzerland.
Toyota already owns Toyota Deutschland and Toyota Italia, its German and
Italian importer/distributors. It has also acquired a 5 per cent stake in
Toyota GB, its UK distributor, which it will raise in stages to 51 per cent
by 1998.
Nissan took control of its importer/distributor operations in the UK with
effect from the beginning of 1992.
Toyota last year sold 16,631 cars in France, filling its 0.78 per cent quota
of the market.
France maintains a 3 per cent market share quota on direct vehicle imports
from Japan and has limited the Japanese presence to five car makers, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Honda and Mitsubishi Motors.
Toyota yesterday strongly denied reports in France that it had made a deal
with the French authorities to accept special restrictions on its sales
after the end of 1992 in return for French government approval of its plan
to take a stake in Toyota France.
Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, is reviewing the credit of
Nissan Motor in Japan and several units of the automobile maker for possible
downgrading, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
The review of the Single-A-One rating of Nissan's senior credit affects
Dollars 16bn of debt. Moody's cited Nissan's 'disappointing business
performance, especially in its intensely competitive home market' and
concern about the impact on cashflow of plans for heavy investment in plant
and equipment.

FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: American Brands advances to
Dollars 216m
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN BRANDS, the Connecticut-based tobacco and consumer products
company, reports after-tax profits of Dollars 216.6m in the fourth quarter
of 1991, thanks to strong performances from the tobacco and drinks
businesses as well as hardware and home improvements interests.
The figure compares with a Dollars 7.1m net profit earned in the same period
a year earlier, but that was depressed by certain non-operating charges. At
the operating profit level, American Brands made Dollars 442.3m in the final
quarter of 1991, against Dollars 399.1m in the fourth quarter of 1990.
The results leave the consumer products group posting a Dollars 806.1m net
profit for the year, up from Dollars 588.6m in 1990. The shares rose Dollars
1 to Dollars 46 on the news.
American Brands said that the underlying sales and operating profit increase
in the tobacco business was 5 per cent, once the sale of a Dutch business
was excluded. Operating profits here totalled Dollars 1.08bn.
The insurance side saw an 8 per cent rise in operating income for the year
overall at Dollars 151.8m, although fourth-quarter profits were slightly
lower after higher reserves, benefits and expenses.
The spirits arm - which takes in Whyte &amp; Mackay in the UK - saw an 11.9 per
cent operating income improvement for the year, at Dollars 151.6m. During
the year, American Brands failed to bid for Invergordon Distillers but
agreed in November to acquire the trademarks of seven spirit brands owned by
Seagram.
Of American Brands' remaining divisions, hardware and home improvements
showed a sharp advance to Dollars 141.5m from Dollars 78.1m, but operating
profits in the office products sector plunged to Dollars 37.7m from Dollars
87.2m.

FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: Macy's close to filing for
Chapter 11 protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RH MACY, the New York-based department store chain, is widely expected to
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection against its creditors over the
next few days, possibly as early as this morning.
The collapse on Friday night of a last-minute bail-out by Mr Laurence Tisch
and his Loews Corporation appears to leave the heavily-indebted company with
no way of escaping a bankrupctcy filing.
Macy's, which was taken private in a 1986 leveraged buy-out and is
struggling with Dollars 3.6bn of debt and trading losses, declined to
comment over the weekend. However, its officials were believed to be
closeted with financial advisors discussing the mechanics of a bankruptcy
filing.
Mr Tisch, whose interests range from the CBS media group to insurance and
property, offered to inject Dollars 1bn of cash into Macy's. Loews would
have paid Dollars 740m for the group's publicly traded bonds and Dollars 80m
for virtually all the equity. It would have used between Dollars 200m and
Dollars 300m to pay off Macy's suppliers.
The deal collapsed when Prudential Insurance refused to grant better terms
to Mr Tisch on the Dollars 811m mortgage it holds on 70 Macy's stores, about
half the chain's outlets.
Mr Tisch apparently asked for a cut in interest on the loan from 12 per cent
to 9 per cent. Mr Frank McDougal, president of Prudential Mortgage Capital,
told the New York Times that 'we had many discussions with the Tisch
organisation and we were willing to bend and compromise to a certain point,
and beyond that it would not have been prudent for us.'
A Chapter 11 filing could help the group because it would remove the
uncertainty that has surrounded its finances since early this month, when it
deferred payments due to trade suppliers in the hope of meeting the
provisions of its revolving credit agreement with banks.
Suppliers have since been holding back fresh shipments of goods to Macy's
stores.

FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: HK speeds legislation on
paperless trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG took a further step towards paperless share trading with the
government's decision to bring forward legislation to enable the creation of
a central stock clearing and settlements system.
Mr David Nendick, secretary for monetary affairs, said the legislation would
be introduced next month. Legislation is needed to insulate the new system
from Hong Kong's existing insolvency laws - thereby guaranteeing the
integrity of the netting and settlement operations of the system.
The share trading and settlements system, which the Hong Kong Securities
Clearing Company (HKSCC) will operate, works on the basis of continuous
netting of transactions.
Under current law, if a broker were declared insolvent the receiver could
unwind transactions up to six months previous to the insolvency. The change
will prevent this and give the HKSCC a first charge over securities to be
settled.
Hong Kong's new trading system was due to be operational by late 1991 but,
as with London's attempt to introduce Taurus, Hong Kong has faced
technological and institutional problems. Mr Nendick said the system should
be operational by the end of this year.
Questions, however, still dog the HKSCC - 50 per cent owned by the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange, and 10 per cent each by five banks - concerning risk
management and the governance of the company.
It is planned that a fund of HKDollars 200m will be established to guarantee
settlement of share trades in the event of broker default. Some brokers feel
this is insufficient to protect against possible default.
Before the system becomes operational the company has to satisfy the
Securities and Futures Exchange, Hong Kong's financial watchdog, that there
is adequate representation on its board to safeguard the public interest.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Water wars dominate acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international mergers and acquisitions scene was dominated last week by
Europe's water wars, writes Brian Bollen. The offer by Swiss food group
Nestle and French bank Indosuez for Source Perrier, the French mineral water
company, was the biggest bid of the week by far.
The offer is being interpreted as further confirmation of the arrival of the
hostile bid in continental Europe, and as an example of how modern European
takeover strategy is evolving, combining Anglo-Saxon opportunism with
continental structures, attitudes and regulation. It is also being seen as a
setback for the ambitions of Italy's Agnelli family in the European food
industry. The family, which is currently bidding for Exor, Perrier's parent
company, will apparently not be muddying the waters still further by
launching a counter-bid for Perrier.
Elsewhere, UK food and household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman is selling
its low-margin US-based Durkee-French spice and seasoning business as part
of its strategy of concentrating on higher-margin, branded consumer
businesses. Reckitt, which is also to sell its Canadian spice business to
Burns Philp of Australia, will use the proceeds to cut debt.
British Petroleum's sale of its Egyptian oil production assets to Spain's
Repsol Exploracion continues its drive to focus on core exploration areas
and withdraw from countries where it has not reached critical mass.
Acquisitive Birmingham-based architectural products group Newman Tonks is
continuing its policy of expansion and international diversification by
buying Moller &amp; Auster, the Norwegian locks and security systems company.

dithering'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE passing of the three-month standstill agreement between Sea
Containers and The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, Mr Norman Corlett,
chairman of the latter company, has written to shareholders, exhorting Sea
Containers 'to stop dithering and make clear its position'.
He said that it was now some 19 months since SeaCon, the cargo equipment and
ferry company which currently owns 41 per cent of Steam Packet, first
launched its bid. He added that there had been only limited progress on the
extension of trading links and that neither party considered there was a
'reasonable prospect of reaching agreement on the major issues in the
foreseeable future'.
Mr Corlett called on SeaCon to make a bid which reflected fully the value of
Steam Packet. In 1990 it offered 115p per share compared with last Friday's
close of 200p.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Grattan purchase causes problems for Otto
Versand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OTTO Versand, the German mail order group which last spring bought the
Grattan mail order business from Next for Pounds 165m, is struggling to make
the acquisition work in the face of the recession.
Mail order industry sources suggest the Bradford-based company has been
losing agents and market share and is heading for a loss of more than Pounds
30m in the current financial year.
At the beginning of the year, Grattan caused ructions with some of its UK
suppliers by adopting a far more aggressive approach and unilaterally
imposing harsher terms of credit.
Otto is believed to be sourcing an increasing proportion of goods for
Grattan from its existing supplier base in Germany.
Grattan also provoked discontent among its workforce this month when it
announced that it intended to change bonus payments for 600 of its 4,000
workforce, thereby reducing their weekly income by an average of Pounds 20.
This led to a dispute with Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, which will be
referred to Acas today.
Grattan will not comment on its trading performance now it forms part of a
private international group. But Mr Norman Finnigan, Grattan personnel
director, said: 'Like the rest of the mail order and high street retailing
markets we are finding trading very much more difficult than in previous
years.'
In the half-year to July 31 1990, Grattan made operating profits of Pounds
5.7m.
Mr Finnigan added that Otto Versand was operating Grattan on a 'very
decentralised basis'.
'Grattan is making these changes in response to the very difficult trading
conditions. It has nothing to do with being owned by Otto Versand,' he said.
Otto's rivals in the UK believe that although there may be a period of
hiatus while it gets to grip with Grattan the German company will emerge as
a formidable competitor in the UK market.
Otto is a highly sophisticated operator and runs the biggest group of mail
order companies in the world.
Its preference for direct marketing techniques in contrast to the
traditional agency approach is seen by many as being the way forward for the
UK mail order industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Irish Continental Group, the Dublin-based shipping company,
have approved an IPounds 8.5m (Pounds 7.9m) takeover of B&amp;I Ferries, the
loss-making state-run shipping company which operates passenger and cargo
services across the Irish Sea.
The acquisition makes ICG the principal ferry operator between Ireland and
the UK and the continent. In recommending the deal, the board said: 'Because
ICG is predominantly a passenger operation, the acquisition will reduce the
seasonality of the overall business'.
B&amp;I's turnover is divided approximately 40:60 between passenger and cargo
revenues.
Under the deal, the government is to assume IPounds 35m of B&amp;I's debts,
while ICG will obtain assets worth IPounds 18m.
The government turned down a management buy-out offer by B&amp;I's staff last
year in favour of the ICG offer.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Crest Nicholson's Pounds 3.8m sale helps
reduce gearing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CREST Nicholson, the troubled Surrey-based housebuilding and commercial
property development group has made further progress in reducing its gearing
by the sale of two commercial properties for Pounds 3.8m.
The two properties, retail developments at Angel Place in Neath and
Baxtergate in Doncaster were sold for Pounds 1.28m and Pounds 2.5m
respectively.
The latest disposals continue the strategy put in place last year after the
group recorded a near-Pounds 34m loss for the half-year, made provisions
totalling Pounds 21m against falling property values and saw the departure
of Mr Roger Lewis, its chief executive. Crest's plan to turn assets into
cash has been implemented by Mr John Callcutt, who replaced Mr Lewis as
chief executive.
After disposals totalling almost Pounds 50m, Crest's net borrowing has
fallen to around Pounds 50m, down from a peak level last year of Pounds
115m. Gearing is now down to around 45 per cent from a peak of over 80 per
cent.
Building analysts expect Crest to report losses of over Pounds 50m when the
group unveils its preliminary results next month. These are expected to
include more provisions against falling property values.

subsidiary

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL PROTECTION Group, the legal expenses insurer and a subsidiary of Sun
Alliance, is to close all of its five regional sales offices and make 57
people redundant out of a total of 400.
The move follows a recent review of the structure of the company and the
announcement by Sun Alliance last Friday that it plans to cut 800 jobs
across the group as part of a rationalisation programme.
Mr Brian Raincock, who founded the company in 1977, loses his job as group
managing director. He will become a consultant to the parent company on
terms still to be determined.
Mr Malcolm Gilbert, finance director who will become managing director, said
the costs of the reorganisation would be nearly Pounds 1m.
He stressed that the company would continue to operate its existing
services, including commercial and personal legal expenses and indemnity
insurance, and a 24-hour international telephone assistance line.
LPG generated an estimated Pounds 12m of income during the 1991 year but
failed to make a profit.
Mr Gilbert believed LPG would make a small profit in the current year if the
costs of restructuring were excluded.
The company's headquarters in Sutton, Surrey, and administrative offices in
Halifax and the City will continue to operate.

FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Howden pays Pounds 3.4m for two
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howden Group, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, is paying Pounds 3.39m
for two acquisitions in the Netherlands and Hong Kong.
It is acquiring the remaining 50 per cent of Ventilatoren Sirocco Howden for
Fl 6.56m (Pounds 2.03m), subject to adjustment following audit of the 1991
accounts. VSH makes cooling fans and a range of axial fans for the tunnel
ventilation and power markets.
It is also acquiring 70 per cent of HD Engineering and the right to buy the
remaining 30 per cent by 1999. HDE, based in Hong Kong, makes drilling rigs
and other components for the construction industry. The purchase price is
HKDollars 19m (Pounds 1.36m) and a further profit-related cash consideration
of up to HKDollars 13m may be payable.
The consideration will be met by the allotment of 6.66m Howden ordinary
shares, conditionally placed with institutional investors at 52p each.

FT  27 JAN 92 / US savings and loan rescue to cost Dollars 1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government has taken control of Crossland Savings, a small New York
savings and loan crippled by property loan losses, in a Dollars 1.2bn
(Pounds 660m) rescue that is the largest US bank bail-out since regulators
spent Dollars 2.5bn to take over the Bank of New England (BNE) a year ago.
Unlike BNE, however, which was sold within months of its seizure, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said it plans to maintain
control of Crossland for as long as two years before seeking to sell the
bank.
While the FDIC did not portray the Crossland move as a change of policy, the
rescue is more reminiscent of the government's investment in the
Chicago-based Continental Illinois Bank than of last year's BNE seizure.
The decision is understood to reflect the personal judgment of Mr William
Taylor, chairman of the FDIC.
Mr Taylor, who rejected rescue bids for Crossland by Chase Manhattan and
Republic National Bank, claimed the cost of the government owning Crossland
would be less than its immediate transfer to another bank.
Chase and Republic were not willing to acquire Crossland with its portfolio
of bad debts. Some Dollars 1.6bn of Crossland's Dollars 8.7bn of assets are
classified as non-performing.
Around Dollars 800m of the Dollars 1.2bn government money is being used to
cover loan losses, with the remaining Dollars 400m injected as Crossland's
new capital.
Although Mr Taylor has argued that the FDIC's ultimate cost will be less
than Dollars 1bn, some bankers believe the FDIC has seriously underestimated
the size of Crossland's bad debts.
Mr Taylor said that if the bank had been sold rather than placed under
government ownership there would have been a total of Dollars 2.5bn of loans
that the FDIC would have had to accept.
The FDIC moved swiftly to install its own top manager at the bank.
Mr Maurice Reissman, Crossland's chairman, resigned immediately after the
takeover as the FDIC named Mr Richard Kraemer, a veteran of New York savings
banks with a reputation for restructuring commercial property portfolios.
Crossland has 44 branches in the New York area plus another 32 branches in
Florida, five in New Jersey and one in Utah.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYTER Brockbank, the Lloyd's agency group, is to launch a direct response
insurance company to market motor and other personal types of insurance in
the way already pioneered successfully by Direct Line, a subsidiary of the
Royal Bank of Scotland
Policies will be insured by syndicates at Lloyd's of London which are
managed by the agency. Lloyd's already has just over 13 per cent of the UK
motor market but up to now brokers have generated this business.
Hayter Brockbank will invest Pounds 1.8m in start-up costs this year. It
will begin underwriting - initially motor insurance - in January next year -
and hopes to have 50,000 policyholders by May 1994 and 100,000 policyholders
by January 1995.
It hopes to eventually form a consortium with other Lloyd's agencies to
increase the amount of capital it can commit to the business.
Recent regulatory changes at Lloyd's have given agencies greater room for
manoeuvre to write business directly rather than through Lloyd's registered
insurance brokers, while the task force report into Lloyd's future,
published 10 days ago, suggested that the superior cost structures enjoyed
by direct writers might allow them to eat into Lloyd's share of the motor
market. The success of the direct writers, however, has been an important
influence for Hayter Brockbank's in the new venture.
'We are using them as our model, particularly Direct Line', said managing
director Mr George Stevens, referring to the Pounds 10.1m profits recorded
by Direct Line last year.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Securities regulators close to capital rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING and securities regulators meet in Switzerland this week to agree the
first international capital adequacy rules for the securities business.
Protracted discussions over the past three years have brought regulators
close to an agreement designed to protect financial markets from the
collapse of securities companies. However, investment banks in London
continue to warn that the rules could undermine the City's competitive
position.
The framework is due to be agreed at a meeting in Geneva on Wednesday
between representatives of the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (Iosco) and the Bank for International Settlements, which act as
the international co-ordinating bodies for securities and bank regulators.
It will apply both to banks and non-bank securities companies.
The difference in nature between the risks in the banking and securities
businesses has led to disagreements between the two groups over the best
approach to the problem. They are now close to agreement in principle.
The most important, to be agreed this week, are:
How much capital should securities businesses have to back their exposures
to financial markets? Regulators are close to agreeing an 8 per cent capital
requirement for the net exposure of a securities company (that is, after
taking account of off-setting positions and other 'hedges'). In addition,
securities firms will have to have capital equal to either 2 or 4 per cent
of their gross positions. The exact ratio is expected to be agreed this
week.
How much subordinated debt should companies be able to count as capital for
regulatory purposes? Such debt is generally cheaper than equity capital.
Securities firms in London are allowed a ratio of subordinated debt to
equity of 4:1. Regulators this week are expected to agree an international
standard of 2:1 or 2.5:1 - though some banking regulators are pressing for
1:1.
In addition, there remain differences of opinion over what constitutes
effective 'hedging' and whether companies should have an additional
'cushion' of capital over and above other requirements to provide an extra
safeguard.
If a tough stance is taken on these issues, London securities firms stand to
suffer more than those elsewhere. Other centres claim London's current
capital rules allow firms in the City an unfair advantage and expose the
London markets to greater risk. However, London regulators have always
argued that their system is more sophisticated than those elsewhere and
allows capital to be used more efficiently while providing adequate
protection.
If agreement is reached in Geneva this week, the need to refine the rule and
allow a lengthy transition period means that they are unlikely to come into
force for several years. They are likely to be preceded by a parallel set of
rules for the European Community being developed in Brussels.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Economics Notebook: Blunt message with a challenge for
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The message was blunt: 'The money has stopped coming in, but the spending
demands and the habits of the 1980s are still with us.'
With those words, taken from a briefing booklet, the Canadian province of
Ontario last week acknowledged that it has joined the growing list of North
American regional and municipal governments which are having trouble making
ends meet.
Like New York, California and Massachusetts, Canada's richest province finds
itself squeezed between ever-growing demands for public services and the
strictures imposed by stagnant revenues, a tax-weary citizenry and
spiralling debt-service charges.
But Ontario's predicament is different - and in some ways even more
intractable - than that of the US states.
Canadian provinces have wider areas of jurisdiction, which include schools,
universities, hospitals and social welfare.
Finding ways to cut government spending presents special challenges.
Ontario's 9.7m residents have come to expect a level of public amenities
matched in few other parts of the world.
In Toronto, for instance, every bus-stop has its own telephone number whose
computerised message tells a caller in how many minutes the next bus will
arrive.
The province plans to spend CDollars 385m (Pounds 184m) in the coming year
on a pioneering 'pay equity' scheme to ensure that women get the same pay as
men for work of equal value.
Crime and homelessness vie for politicians' attention with garbage recycling
and greater access to public buildings for the disabled.
Welfare payments are unusually generous. The recipients include thousands of
refugees whom Canada has welcomed in recent years from countries as diverse
as Somalia, El Salvador and Vietnam.
On the revenue side, Ontario is suffering its first decline in tax and other
receipts since 1945.
As Canada's wealthiest province, it has been called on to make the biggest
sacrifice towards helping the federal government rein in its own deficit.
Ottawa's contribution to Ontario's health-care and higher education spending
has shrivelled from 52 per cent in 1980 to 31 per cent this year.
But the province is, for the time being, no longer the locomotive of
national economic growth that it was during the 1980s.
It is paying a heavy price for its dependence on the depressed automotive,
steel, construction and forestry industries.
Output shrank by 2.4 per cent last year, the worst performance among
Canada's 10 provinces.
The real rub to the budget squeeze is that the government now facing fiscal
restraint was elected 18 months ago promising just the opposite.
In its first budget in April 1991, the New Democratic Party (NDP), the most
left-wing of Canada's main political groups, proposed trebling the deficit
from CDollars 3bn in the year to March 1991 to CDollars 9.7bn in the current
fiscal year.
'We had a choice to make this year - to fight the deficit or to fight the
recession,' the provincial treasurer Mr Floyd Laughren said last April with
a bow towards Maynard Keynes. 'We are proud to be fighting the recession.'
In an effort to create work for rising numbers of unemployed, spending on
infrastructure projects jumped 22 per cent this year.
Unionised civil servants, a bedrock of the new government's support, were
given a pay increase well above inflation.
Outlays on low-income housing, pay equity and legal aid all ballooned as the
NDP sought to please its social-activist supporters. About the only thing
that went down was the province's credit rating.
The new government crossed fingers that an improving economy would start
bringing down the deficit in 1992-93. But the protracted recession has
shrunk tax revenues and pushed up welfare payments. The 1992-93 shortfall,
estimated last year at CDollars 8.9bn, is now projected to soar to CDollars
14.3bn. Some analysts suspect even that figure is an under-estimate.
Under pressure from foreign lenders and an already-jittery business
community, the government has begun reassessing the priorities which earlier
earned it the nickname of the People's Republic of Ontario.
To the consternation of many of its supporters, it has already scrapped
plans for a public-sector car insurance scheme and an environmental 'bill of
rights'. Last week, it decided that transfers to schools, hospitals and
municipalities will rise by only 1 per cent in the year ahead.
Cutbacks in the vaunted array of public services have begun. The provincial
health insurance plan, often held up as a model of a universal and effective
health care system, has stopped paying for costly treatment in US hospitals
and drug rehabilitation centres. The Toronto Transit Commission wants to run
fewer buses on many routes. The city is using half as much salt to de-ice
roads this winter as it did last year.
But with the treasurer now saying that a CDollars 14bn deficit is
'unacceptable', some tougher choices lie ahead.
Raising taxes risks delaying the economic recovery and further undermining
business confidence.
Businesses in Toronto's financial district already pay the highest taxes in
North America, except for midtown Manhattan.
Toronto and Ottawa are also finding it increasingly difficult to attract
conventions, one of the pillars of any North American city's tourist trade.
Cutting back further on services however, is not much easier for the
politicians.
The measures taken so far have already aroused a host of vociferous lobby
groups, including many of the government's own supporters, like the
teachers' union.
The next budget in April is unlikely to please anybody.
It will probably include both spending cuts and tax increases, but not
enough of either to satisfy the credit rating agencies.
Ontario is one of North America's biggest borrowers on the international
capital markets.
Having lost its Triple-A credit rating last year, it is almost certain that
lenders will now demand an even higher premium for the CDollars 10bn or more
which the province plans to raise at home and abroad in the year ahead.
As the province's premier Mr Bob Rae put it in a television address last
week: 'We didn't get into this mess in a day, and we're not going to get out
of it in a day either.'

FT  27 JAN 92 / The triumph of hope over experience: Volvo's planned merger
with Procordia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man whose past merger record is distinctly patchy, Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar was remarkably ebullient on Saturday as he outlined his latest
alliance.
Unveiling a proposed SKr38.7bn (Pounds 3.73bn) merger of the Volvo vehicle
group he chairs with Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals
company, Mr Gyllenhammar stressed the European dimension.
The deal was 'definitely offensive', he said, giving the merged company
'great possibilities for growth by giving us a presence in many important
markets'.
From Mr Gyllenhammar's point of view, the proposed reverse takeover would
have several advantages:
It would create a large and aggressive conglomerate to meet the challenge of
post-1992 Europe. By creating a company too big to be easily swallowed, it
would protect an important part of Swedish industry from potential foreign
predators now that restrictions on foreign ownership of Swedish companies
have been lifted. The government is likely to remove a further barrier
against takeovers - the distinction between voting and non-voting shares -
next year. If 'we had not acted ourselves,' said Mr Gyllenhammar, 'Procordia
could have become a victim of the market'.
It would fulfil a well-established ambition to own Procordia - in 1989 he
tried to buy this state-owned holding company, but Volvo had to settle for a
minority stake.
And it would give him, as chairman of the merged company, an exhilarating
alternative to the grinding task of rescuing Volvo's car business, which
lost SKr1.5bn in the third quarter of 1991. Volvo as a whole did not lose
money, but its pretax profit of SKr255m was partly due to income derived
from its relationship with Renault, the French state-owned car and truck
group.
That relationship is just one of the complexities with which Mr Gyllenhammar
will have to deal. Others include the lack of enthusiasm of the Swedish
government, and the view of some of Mr Gyllenhammar's Swedish critics that
his time would be better spent on Volvo's SKr5bn cost-cutting programme.
The relationship with Renault, forged only two years ago, was seen at the
time as the key to the group's future. The two companies, linked by
cross-shareholdings, are hard at work on a joint component planning and
development plan for light trucks and engines to last over the next 10 to 12
years.
Despite this nuts-and-bolts progress, there have already been worries in
France about the future of the relationship. These centre round Volvo's
joint venture agreement last autumn with Mitsubishi Motors and the Dutch
government for carmaking at the Born plant in Holland.
The known doubts of Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, about the
Volvo-Renault alliance are likely to be fanned by the Procordia merger,
which will probably be seen as dictated more by the need to protect Swedish
industry than by any European grand design.
None the less, Renault has approved the intended merger, and the ensuing
halving of its stake in Volvo to 4.2 per cent.
No such approval has yet come from the Swedish government, Procordia's
second-largest shareholder with 34.2 per cent of its equity and 42.7 per
cent of its voting rights.
Only minutes after the end of Mr Gyllenhammar's Saturday press conference,
Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's Industry Minister, held one of his own in which
he displayed no enthusiasm for the deal.
Ministers are furious at what they see as the Volvo chairman's pre-emptive
and high-handed action.
At first sight this might seem surprising: the new conservative government
has already promised to sell off its stake in Procordia as part of its
privatisation programme. Mr Gyllenhammar's plan might therefore seem
something ministers would favour.
However, the government argues that Volvo has broken the agreement it signed
when it acquired its minority stake, which says that changes in the
company's share capital require 'unity between the two parties'.
The government is concerned about the terms of the deal. Its recently
appointed privatisation commission - chaired by the veteran industrialist Mr
Curt Nicolin who used to sit on Volvo's board - disliked the initial terms
as too generous to Volvo shareholders.
The 'industrial synergy effects' of the deal 'were not convincing', it said,
with clear 'disadvantages' for Procordia. The terms have since been revised,
but the commission seems unlikely to be satisfied.
The proposal also flies in the face of the government's privatisation
strategy, which aims to create as wide a share ownership as possible in the
former state-dominated companies.
In fact, Volvo's chairman sees no good reason why the government should not
agree to join in the proposed deal and sell off its stake in Procordia at
the same time. He does not want the Swedish state to maintain its current
holdings. Under the proposed deal its equity stake would fall to 25.6 per
cent but it would hold an estimated 44.1 per cent of the voting shares.
Procordia is certainly a prize worth fighting for. Since its creation in
1990 - with interests ranging from health care products and food processing
to tobacco, hotels, alcohol and restaurants - the group has undergone a
successful restructuring, doubled its earnings in two years, and started
acquiring food and drugs companies elsewhere in Europe. In its last interim
results it enjoyed a 23 per cent rise in profits to SKr3.08bn.
There has always been more than a touch of the gambler about some of Mr
Gyllenhammar's past business adventures.
He recently confessed that his wife thinks he is naive and makes thousands
of mistakes. 'Naive perhaps', he added, 'but definitely impulsive'.
It may have been that characteristic which led him into two past
unsuccessful merger attempts. One of these, abandoned just in time, was with
the antibiotics and animal health company Fermenta, run - until he succumbed
to scandal - by Mr Refaat el Sayed in 1986. The other, no less unhappy, was
the merger in 1980 with Beijerinvest, the investment and oil trading
conglomerate. This fell apart within two years, but Volvo suffered losses
from its oil activities for most of the 1980s until selling them off.
There are still difficult negotiations ahead before the new Volvo can take
the place on the European stage which Mr Gyllenhammar envisages for it. He
has confronted the Swedish establishment before, however; it will not be
surprising if he has his way in the end.

FT  27 JAN 92 / What it takes to be chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont made a nice try in his plea for a rouble stabilisation fund
in New York; but not nice enough. He showed a sense of strategic purpose,
which is one requirement for a chancellor, and his proposal was in line with
current specialist thinking, which is another. But he did not get his way,
which shows lack of clout; and he allowed himself to be seen to fail, which
suggests a lack of political cunning. In short, rather much as expected.
The list of required qualities was supplied by a retired Treasury official,
and would be echoed, in my experience, by almost any senior civil servant;
but the order of importance would differ from one department to another. In
a major spending department, clout is probably the key quality, as I
discovered when a gaggle of veterans at the Reform Club rather surprisingly
agreed that the best minister in their long experience was Lord
Duncan-Sandys.
This would not have been a press lobby nomination; Sandys was awkward and
obtuse under questioning. Yes; but the department could supply the ideas and
the answers to questions. What mattered was the result. 'Frankly, my dear
boy, once he had an idea in his head, he went into Cabinet like a programmed
tank. He could bore them into submission.'
Chancellors, it seems from my friends at the Reform, are different. A good
relationship with the prime minister will substitute for clout - at home, if
not at G7 meetings - but not for a sense of strategy. In this most exposed
of jobs the pressures - from the whips, the markets, the Bank of England,
the polls and in Cabinet are such that nothing can substitute for a clear
aim and a pretty quick intelligence. But political guile and good powers of
public persuasion are also needed when the going is difficult, and may even
affect economic performance on their own, by way of confidence.
These conversations at the Reform - with former civil servants, City men and
economists, who had only long experience in common - arose from a suggestion
that Mr Lamont has had an unfairly bad press. He inherited an economic mess
which nobody could sort out quickly, his one Budget showed real ingenuity,
and his over-optimistic forecasts were made on what he thought was the best
advice.
Well, yes; but most chancellors suffer bad luck, and it's a matter of how
you handle it. Mr Lamont got good marks - in the City as well as among
ex-insiders - for many of the things he actually did, especially for his
handling of interest rates; but his public relations have been damaging.
'Doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut' growled a gilts man. That is a
serious handicap, but need not mean that he is a bad chancellor. Mr Lamont
would have to do something much more drastic than pass on bad forecasts or
get flustered on television to join the ultimate roll of dishonour which
emerged. Mr Anthony (now Lord) Barber was the clear majority choice as worst
chancellor in anyone's memory; a regretful judgment, since everybody liked
him a great deal, but seemingly inevitable on results.
It is not clear, though, how far Barber's disastrous policies were his own.
The then prime minister, Mr Edward Heath, leaned heavily on the advice of
Sir William Armstrong, who had moved from head of the Treasury to be head of
the Civil Service, and is blamed by many for most of what went wrong. Mr
Nigel Lawson got one firm nomination as worst, for failing to learn from the
Barber experience.
Other contenders were Mr Reginald Maudling, for actually believing in the
dash-for-growth theory; Mr R. A. Butler, for cutting taxes in 1955 for
electoral purposes, and raising them shortly afterwards (possibly a nasty
precedent for Mr Lamont). There was also one for Mr Peter Thorneycroft, for
resigning in principle when the Cabinet insisted on breaching his borrowing
limit - 'it looked noble, but in practical terms it was fatuous' - and one,
from a former Conservative policy adviser, for Mr John Major, for joining
the EMS at the wrong rate.
It is interesting, surely, that all the contenders for the bottom place were
Conservatives, since none of my witnesses were Labour supporters; the
Conservative reputation for sound management clearly does not extend to the
more august levels of the retired and near-retired. It is also striking that
the clear winner, with no dissent, was Mr Roy Jenkins (now Lord J of
Hillhead), though Sir Geoffrey Howe also got some honourable mentions.
The central Jenkins strategy was to fight excessive wage rises with tax
increases, which was not popular and would not have been sustainable in the
long run; so his win is an odd verdict by objective standards. It looks a
tribute to his elder statesman manner, which certainly inspired confidence;
or perhaps it is a vote of thanks from Conservative supporters for an
unexpected victory in 1970, or evidence that the City and the Civil Service
really do have the hair shirt tendencies of which they are widely suspected.
Of course, steering the economy is not the whole of a chancellor's job. He
also has to get the wrinkles out of the tax system, and get value for money
for taxpayers - indeed, according to quite recent orthodoxy, that is the
whole of his job. Several of the chancellors who got high marks for this
essentially accountant's role - Selwyn Lloyd, for example, and Anthony
Barber - got very poor ratings overall. One analyst simply concluded that
good mechanics make bad drivers. Another possible conclusion is that the job
is too big for one man, as Harold Wilson supposed.
Meanwhile, the unhappy Mr Lamont is stuck with the whole of it.
Industrialists appear to be getting gloomier, and analysts certainly are: Mr
Bill Martin of Philips and Drew is now projecting no recovery at all this
year. But stock market prices continue to suggest that the economy may yet
live up to Mr Lamont's expectations, though not necessarily in time.
The chancellor, now in what could be a fortunate period of pre-Budget
purdah, can only read the few suggestive items of good news and hope that
the market isn't just up to its contrarian tricks again.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: Wasting time on languages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN TOMLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is hard not to share Mr Calvert's surprise at the lack of interest
displayed by UK companies in employing UK nationals with a good command of
the Japanese language ('Does UK Industry speak the right language?' January
15).
No doubt he has taken at face value the repeated exhortations from the
leaders of British industry to master the languages of our chief trading
competitors. As usual, however, actions speak louder than words, as is
illustrated by a glance at the DTI's own publication, Opportunity Japan:
British Company Success Stories in Japan. From Sir Paul Girolami of Glaxo we
learn that '. . .Glaxo management and employees in Japan are all Japanese .
. .' while Richard Giordano of BOC inspires all budding linguists with the
observation that '. . . you must have people on the ground in Japan who
speak the language. You can do it with westerners but it is better to do it
with Japanese . . .'.
The message from British industry is loud and clear Mr Calvert - give up,
you're wasting your time.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: All not lost in family planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MALCOLM POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, How difficult it is to deal sensibly with family planning. The FT
survey on Egypt (January 21) has a story headlined 'Lost: 20m condoms'; but
it fails to mention the progress made in family planning.
Few things are more important for the future of Egypt than slowing the
growth of human numbers; there are 1m more births than deaths every nine
months and the population is likely to double by the year 2020. Fortunately,
Egyptians want smaller families. Fertility is declining and a recent survey
found about half of all couples are now using modern contraceptives. This is
the result of a successful partnership between the government of Egypt,
non-governmental bodies, the private sector and international donors.
Indeed, the demand for contraception in the developing world is so strong
that the lost condoms given such prominence in the FT may have been
illicitly sold to neighbouring countries. This is embarrassing for the
monitors of US Agency for International Development, but the contraceptives
almost certainly continued to save lives and plan families; it is neither
statistically plausible nor culturally likely that every other Egyptian is
playing with an odd-shaped, lubricated balloon.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Personal View: Side effects of deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any radical reform, even if it achieves its objectives, is likely to bring
about unforeseen side effects. This has proved particularly true of
financial deregulation.
Financial deregulation in no way implies the absence of financial regulation
for prudential purposes. If this sounds paradoxical, it is, in fact, no more
so than the well-known interdependence of freedom and the rule of law.
Financial deregulation is a somewhat imprecise term; but it is possible to
identify at least 10 specific events that qualify as acts of financial
deregulation (see box).
From this list, two events stand out as being of particular importance.
The most important was the abolition of exchange controls. At the time a
radical and controversial act, it is now the norm throughout the big
industrial nations. This is partly because of a belief in freedom and
deregulation and partly because the information technology revolution has
made controls on capital movements difficult to police.
The consequences of this for the conduct of economic policy are
considerable. First, it has transformed the foreign exchange markets.
In the past, movement of currency across the exchanges was largely
associated with trade flows, and the external value of currencies was
largely determined by the state of the balance of payments on current
account.
Today the vast bulk of the flow of capital across the exchanges has nothing
whatever to do with trade flows; and exchange rate movements are dominated
by capital flows, often of a speculative nature, as can be seen most clearly
in the gyrations of the dollar over the past 10 years. And for a time these
gyrations can be self-perpetuating, with a move into a currency causing that
currency to rise, and the consequent rise itself generating the expectation
of a further rise and thus a further capital inflow. The resulting currency
instability, unrelated to economic fundamentals, can cause considerable
damage and dislocation to the world economy.
That is why leading finance ministers agreed on the Plaza (1985), and Louvre
(1987) accords, to seek a system of international financial co-operation
designed to introduce greater currency stability.
The other main international consequence of the freedom of capital movements
is the dethronement of current account payments balance as a policy
objective.
In a world of rigid foreign exchange controls, a current account deficit
could be financed only by a country running down its foreign currency
reserves, which could only continue for a short time. Today, by contrast,
any country that can maintain a reasonable degree of confidence in its
currency can finance a current account deficit for many years, as the US has
done by importing capital from overseas.
Looking at it from the other end of the telescope, so to speak, in a world
in which capital is free to move across frontiers, it would be extraordinary
if, for each country, capital outflows precisely equalled capital inflows.
There will be, for each country, either a net inflow or a net outflow of
capital. And since the balance of payments overall must balance, it follows
that those countries with a net inflow of capital will run a current account
deficit, and those with a net outflow will run a current account surplus.
This can be seen in terms of the relationship between savings and
investment. At any given period those countries whose capacity to generate
savings exceeds their indigenous investment opportun-ities will experience a
capital outflow, which will finance the current account deficits of those
countries whose capacity to generate savings falls short of their indigenous
investment opportunities.
But the abolition of exchange controls has not merely rewritten the rules
for the conduct of economic policy. It has also rendered ineffective any
form of direct national controls on credit. For in a world in which capital
can flow freely, the effect of such controls would merely be to drive
lending off-shore.
This other important side-effect of the abolition of exchange controls links
with the second of the two main acts of financial deregulation in the UK:
the collapse of the building societies' cartel.
Unlike exchange control abolition, this was not brought about by any action
by the government. Although philosophically in favour of it, I always feared
the short-term consequences. It happened as a result of growing competition
among the bigger building societies themselves, followed by the invasion of
the mortgage lending business by the banks.
The collapse of the building societies' cartel, under which mortgage rates
were kept well below market clearing rates, and advances were rationed by a
queueing system, thus occurred in a new world in which direct credit
controls were out of the question, and the only checks on excess were the
price of credit, which the government could control, and prudence, which it
could not.
The consequent explosion of lending, and of spending financed by lending,
both for consumption and investment, private and business, on an
unprecedented and unforeseen scale is now a commonplace explanation of the
switchback course the UK economy has followed in recent years.
Compared with the two main acts of deregulation I have identified, the other
eight had little real impact, since the restrictions they abolished were
either ineffectual (particularly, in the case of the corset, following
exchange control abolition) or technical or (as in the case of Big Bang) not
directly connected with the quantum of bank and building society lending at
all.
In looking at this period, it is important not to be parochial. Of the seven
big industrial nations that comprise the G7, three - the UK, the US and
Canada - have been undergoing a recession of a remarkably similar nature.
These are also the three economies that have travelled furthest along the
road to financial deregulation.
There always has been an economic cycle. But with credit facilitated by
financial deregulation, these three economies experienced a particularly
virulent form of credit cycle. In other words, individuals and companies
came to borrow excessively. And while this was bound to be a self-correcting
process (which the authorities can by their monetary policy to some extent
expedite), the correction inevitably involves a period of recession.
Why the degree of excess in the first place, though? One important reason is
that the economic upswing had continued for so long that too many borrowers
and lenders thought that it would go on forever.
Clearly, with hindsight, the UK authorities - and I accept my prominent part
in this, although I was by no means alone - greatly underestimated the
demand effect that deregulation, a supply side reform, was to have.
The banks, for their part, only dimly recognised the extent of their
vulnerability to the credit cycle. As interest rates rose, home buyers
inevitably cut back on purchases in the high street to keep up with mortgage
payments.
Thus by fuelling the housing boom with easy lending, they were inadvertently
undermining the quality of their lending to the smaller, more vulnerable end
of the corporate sector.
What, then, are the lessons?
First, a financially deregulated economy, while more efficient and more
dynamic, is less stable, by virtue of the credit cycle, which will never
disappear completely. Second, recognising this, borrowers need to exercise
prudent self-discipline and lenders to develop a far more sophisticated risk
analysis than they have hitherto found necessary. And third, what we have
gone through in this country is to a considerable extent a once-for-all
occurrence: the change from a financially regulated to a financially
deregulated economy. Others still have this in store.

TEN STEPS TOWARDS DEREGULATION
The unannounced ending, virtually as soon as the new Tory government took
office in May 1979, of the restrictive guideline on building society
lending.
Abolition of exchange controls in October 1979.
Scrapping of the so-called corset, the supplementary special deposits scheme
designed to curb bank lending, in June 1980.
Abolition of the Reserve Asset Ratio Requirement, under which banks had to
hold at least 12.5 per cent of their deposits in a specified range of liquid
assets, in August 1981.
Abolition of hire-purchase restrictions in July 1982.
The collapse of the building societies' cartel in October 1983.
Some aspects of the Building Societies Act 1986.
Big Bang in October 1986.
Withdrawal of mortgage lending guidance in December 1986.
The effective abolition of the Control of the Borrowing Order in March 1989.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: The proper economic observation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID MORRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Observer ('Guru glut' January 23) has clearly developed some new skills
in word manipulation. The column claimed that I remarked: 'It seems like an
inefficient use of time to try to assess economic pressures.' He is
obviously referring to what I wrote on January 16, in an article on exchange
rates, which was: 'It seems like an inefficient use of time to try to assess
economic pressures on the ERM since even if they were analysed correctly
there would be no reason to expect the appropriate movement in a currency's
price.'
The latter and correct quote is a proper economic observation that if you
have a fixed or semi-fixed exchange rate regime in place then underlying
economic pressures will not be reflected fully in movements in the regime's
exchange rates. They may be reflected in the price of bonds and equities or
in the performance of the real economy (and time should be spent analysing
those variables); but the exchange rate cannot move freely if it is not free
to move. Observer's incomplete and, consequently, inaccurate use of my quote
is asinine.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Enhanced prospects by the riverbank: Andrew Adonis on the
LSE's plan for a new home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London School of Economics' bid to move to County Hall, the now-defunct
Greater London Council's palatial home which faces the Houses of Parliament
across the Thames, is likely to move a significant step closer to fruition
today.
If, as expected, the High Court rejects an attempt by Lambeth council, the
Labour-controlled planning authority, to quash a planning consent for the
site granted by the government, the way will be open for Lambeth to consider
the LSE's plans on their merits. And those, most observers agree, are
considerable.
The LSE scheme, masterminded by its ebullient director, Mr John Ashworth,
represents perhaps the boldest university venture of the last decade. If it
succeeds, it will not merely double the existing capacity of the LSE: it
will give The School - as its inmates term it - a prime national site from
which to project itself as Europe's pre-eminent social science university.
Some fairly complex manoeuvring remains before The School can decamp from
its present cramped and tatty premises in Houghton Street, off Aldwych.
Since the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority, County Hall's
last tenant, in 1990, the site has lain with the London Residuary Body, to
dispose of to the financial benefit of the Greater London boroughs.
To maximise that benefit, the LRB continues to look favourably on another
scheme which - the High Court permitting - already has planning consent.
Under it, the grade II* listed Riverside Building would be converted into a
hotel, residential and conference complex, with the rest of the site
redeveloped for office and retail use. Problem: no developer, since a
Japanese-led consortium collapsed in 1990.
Under the LSE's plans, the Riverside Building would accommodate the core of
the LSE. Of the other three blocks on the site, one would house the British
Library of Political and Economic Science, while the other two would be
designated a 'social science park'. The idea is to surround The School with
organisations growing and benefiting from its research activities,
particularly in political, economic and social research and forecasting.
In addition to renting offices to professional firms such as stockbrokers,
accountants and market researchers, Mr Ashworth speculates about prospects
for consulting and spin-off companies. He cites existing activities like the
School's Decision Analysis and Business History units. The concept has been
pioneered in the purely scientific disciplines, such as Cambridge Science
Park: it would be novel for the social sciences.
The LSE's planning application is to be considered by Lambeth in a month's
time. If it goes through, a formal approach to the LRB will follow.
Mr Ashworth is offering well below the commercial price for the site. For
him to be able to move at all, some government financial help will almost
certainly be needed as part of a swap arrangement for Houghton Street. But
for the LRB, the LSE is at least a buyer; and anyway, the LRB ceases to
exist later this year, when (bizarrely) County Hall looks set to revert to
Bromley council to dispose of, if unsold.
By then elections to the House across the river will have taken place. But
even if Mr Neil Kinnock is the new landlord, Labour has been careful to
dismiss ideas of a bloated London bureaucracy. Ms Margaret Hodge, Labour
leader of the Association of London Authorities, talks of a new Greater
London Authority with a hundred or so officials. They could be better
accommodated in smaller premises, perhaps using County Hall's imposing
council chamber.
'If we secure County Hall, our ability to expand and become Europe's leading
social science institution will be immeasurably enhanced,' says Mr Ashworth.
'That ought to appeal to politicians, businessmen and all sections of the
London community.'
His plans for the LSE's future are not without their critics. Some in The
School resent the emphasis he places on postgraduate studies, to which he
intends the bulk of extra resources to be devoted. Furthermore, more than 40
per cent of the students, mainly at postgraduate level, already come from
outside the European Community (LSE: Let's See Europe, goes the gag), and
that's enough, they say.
But most at the LSE recognise that County Hall has one of the greatest
opportunities in its history. As for its prospective near-neighbours, at
least one - the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace - is full of
enthusiasm. Perhaps at The School's centenary 1995 a neigbourly Te Deum
would be in order.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: British red tape a barrier to trade with Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW MICHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'The way ahead for Poland' (January 21), draws attention
to the remarkably quick privatisation of its retail, wholesale and service
sectors. The difference from even one year ago is dramatic and you rightly
pinpoint the Polish entrepreneurial spirit in achieving this.
What is perhaps less understood in the west is that this transformation has
been achieved following the dismantling of Polish import controls and the
lifting of visa restrictions on Polish businessmen in most EC countries.
The effect is visible at Frankfurt airport where one now constantly hears
the Polish language spoken; snippets of conversations about commodity
prices, discounts, transport costs - all the tiny details which are the oil
of a modern retail system. It is also visible on the motorways of western
Europe, where Polish registered trucks move the goods which ultimately
appear on the shelves in Polish shops.
Now, the same entrepreneurial spirit which has transformed the retail sector
is begining to have an effect on manufacturing. By-passing the moribund
state industries, individuals and groups are setting up factories to produce
industrial and consumer goods which a modern society needs. Everything from
satellite TV dishes to electric power cables, plastic bottles and petrol
pumps. To do this, they need modern production equipment.
Where do these entrepreneurs buy their equipment? Naturally, they buy from
suppliers to whom access is easiest. A Polish businessman intent on
establishing a plant for making plastic bottles for soft drinks, gets into
his car and drives, without hindrance, to German, Italian and French
potential suppliers.
To go to Britain, though, he still needs a visa. And to get this, he must
firstly obtain a written invitation from a British company, then he must
submit an application at the British consulate in Warsaw, then he has to
queue for hours to suffer a personal interview and finally weeks, or months
later (or sometimes never) he gets a visa. Why should he bother himself with
the trouble and humiliation? Britain is further away and there are few
products which Britain makes which cannot be bought closer.
Poland is a country of 40m people ranking in size as one of Europe's largest
economies. It has a well-educated industrialised population, it is
investment starved and it has an entrepreneurial business class which is
buying now] Mostly they are not buying in Britain.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: Part time solution for women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARY CLARKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I fear Valerie Amos (Letters, January 21) has too negative a view of
part-time employment in the UK. While child care undoubtedly is a crucial
factor influencing the decision of women to resume work part-time, there is
evidence that demand for part-time work exceeds supply. Even with good child
care facilities, many women find it difficult to combine work demands with
family commitments. Part-time work offers a solution to this dilemma.
Both the IRS report, Recruiting and Retaining Women, and Susan McRae's study
for the Policy Studies Institute, Maternity Rights in Britain, point to a
demand by working mothers for more flexible working arrangements,
particularly part-time and job-share opportunities. Some large retail
companies are now offering part-time work at managerial level to meet the
demand of their female employees returning to work after maternity leave.
To imply that part-time is invariably low-paid and an alternative to a
career will do nothing to increase part-time opportunities for those women,
particularly in managerial and professional jobs, for whom it offers the
only means of continuing their careers.

People who burn poundsworths' of petrol in their Volvo Estates taking little

FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: Milton Keynes, the view from the grid - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cities are dense and difficult places. They both elevate and depress the
human spirit. God and Mammon fight for the city's heart while mere mortals
scurry about their business hoping to find solace from the daily grind.
Cities are more than paper diagrams of imposed order. They flower out of
adversity and take time to establish their character and culture. They need
a purpose higher than mere accommodation, a status beyond statistics.
Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire is celebrating 25 years of birth pangs this
month. It is described as the fastest growing city in Britain - its
population when it was designated in 1967 was 18,350, today it is around
150,000. It is the last new town to be commissioned in England and in many
ways it demonstrates the easy solution to the problems of our declining
cities. It is relatively straightforward to take 22,000 acres of
Buckinghamshire farm land and turn it into an efficient new suburb; it is
much harder to plan and organise the rejuvenation of those English cities
that exploded in the 19th century and have never quite recovered their
equilibrium.
No one underestimates the skill and hard work that goes into persuading
people and businesses to relocate to a new town. But it cannot be denied
that it helps to have a blank sheet, and it certainly helps if your blank
sheet can be laid across some desirable meadows half way between London and
Birmingham and near good motorways and railways.
What does Milton Keynes look like after 25 years? How successful is it? Can
it be described in any way as a city?
When it comes to visibility and civic appearances Milton Keynes does not
score highly. What you see derives strictly from the plan created in the
late 1960s by Llewelwyn-Davies Weekes Forestier-Walker and Bor under the
particular guidance of one partner, Richard Llewelwyn-Davies. He was
described at the time as 'the intellectual leader of the scientific wing of
English architects'. He was subsequently to become a Labour peer.
His plan was for a town dedicated to ease of movement by motor car. The
basis of the plan is a grid of roads; and each kilometre square of the grid
formed the boundary for local development. The grid linked the existing
settlements at Bletchley, Wolverton and Stony Stratford with the new centre
of Milton Keynes. A famous perspective view of the future new city was drawn
early on by Helmut Jacoby, in which a bubble helicopter hovered over a leafy
grid of roads, water and low-rise buildings.
His vision was accurate. You can visit Milton Keynes today and not really
notice the town at all because of the effectiveness of the tree planting and
landscaping. Actually you could just spend your time exploring the double
grid: at one level there is the superior network of landscaped roads for
cars, and below there is another network of 'Redways', landscaped pedestrian
and cycle tracks. In summer, with a bicycle, you could have quite a good day
out on the grid.
Since the inception of the town, some 15 million trees have been planted,
wide planted verges are everywhere and there must be hundreds of planted
roundabouts. Because all the buildings are low rise - indeed there was
apparently a planning instruction that nothing was to be higher than a tree
 -the town is largely invisible.
Because of this strange sense of arboreal limbo it is quite a shock to dive
off the road grid into the housing neighbourhoods. But it is a salutary
shock. Here is written the history of British housing design over the last
two decades. It is also the history of British architecture.
The new town assembled good teams of well known architects. Influenced by
the grid, early housing like Netherfield ran long, low, flat roofed terraces
across half a mile of landscape. Netherfield was designed by Jeremy Dixon,
Ed Jones, Chris Cross and Mike Gold. It had aluminium roofs and plastic fins
dividing house from house in the terrace. As the land dropped so did the
houses, but the long flat roofs continued at one level height throughout,
sometimes leaving large gaps between the houses and the roof.
Norman Foster's office also designed some housing for Milton Keynes in the
early days at Beanhill. The houses had flat aluminium roofs clad with
profiled aluminium panels. This experiment failed and after a law suit,
pitched roofs were added to the terraces.
Today those sorts of terrible architectural experiments would not be allowed
and the idea of regimented workers' housing - however much part of
Llewelwyn-Davies's and others' Leninist dreams - has vanished. A tour of the
housing areas today is, if anything, like a visit to the Ideal Home
Exhibition; 69 per cent of the population are house owners and houses are
largely built by private developers following standard guidelines. There are
good vernacular 'fishing village' designs by architects like Richard Mac
Cormac, Wayland Tunley, Peter Aldington and Ralph Erskine. There are also
mock Tudor houses, Georgian houses, thatched houses, regency houses, and
every conceivable variety of gingerbread houses. Both Hansel and Gretel
would be happy here.
The town centre and almost all the public and commercial/industrial
buildings are in marked contrast to the housing. The enormous shopping
centre, which provides an indoor street almost as long as Oxford Street, is
cool and Miesian. It has a faint air of Mussolini's new Rome about it, but
perhaps that is because of all the travertine. The railway station and
offices are mainly glass boxes, but there are some more interesting, very
new buildings like the polytechnic by Ted Cullinan and the headquarters of
Pharmacia by Hobbs Architects. There is the brand new ecumenical church,
with its dome, at the centre of the town, designed by PDD architects. This
ought to have been much bigger: the dome does not do what domes are meant to
do and sail over the lower buildings. Instead it looks as though it tried to
rise above its surroundings but sighed so deeply that it sank down again.
That somehow sums up what I feel about Milton Keynes - it ought to have been
wonderful but it isn't. None of our really good architects worked on any of
the public buildings - and although all the trees are splendid, the built
fabric of Milton Keynes is not of the calibre needed to make it a city. It
is the garden suburb adapted for the car, and oh so carefully planned.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: St Matthew Passion - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The programme-book for the London Philharmonic concert on Saturday had an
informative interview with their conductor, young Franz Welser-Most, about
his approach to Bach's St Matthew Passion. 'Basically the big pulse in the
entire piece comes from the recitatives, and the other numbers just have to
fit in,' he said, and that was exactly how it turned out. Yet one mightn't
have foreseen just how swift that would be: the result was quite possibly
the speediest performance of the Passion ever heard. Twenty minutes before
the announced ending-time, it was over.
The evangelist-narrator was the young tenor Kurt Azesberger, admirably clear
and communicative, who allowed himself more dramatic involvement as the
story proceeded. As promised, the work swept along without a pause or
hesitation. In that sense at least, there was all the narrative urgency one
could want.
The pious gravity long favoured by British choral tradition went out of the
window; the young Mozart Choir of Linz had been imported for the occasion,
and (with choirboys from St Alban's Abbey) they sang lightly and trippingly.
If there is pathos or tragedy in the work, it had to be deduced from the
text.
The voice of Jesus was Jeffrey Black's light, romantic bass. The soloists
Welser-Most chose were a young quartet as distinguished as could be found
today ' Lynne Dawson, Anne Sofie von Otter, John Mark Ainsley and Olaf Baer
' but they were kept on a very tight leash. The notion that the solo arias
are the windows on to personal feeling got short shrift: in their first
arias soprano, alto and baritone all sounded hustled, though they coped
bravely.
Even Miss von Otter's 'Erbarme dich', with a lovely obbligato by the leading
violin, emerged as gracious and pretty, not grief-stricken. In the
circumstances the more energetic arias made the strongest impressions, as
well as the vivid duet for women with chorus, 'So ist mein Jesus nun
gefangen'. The great final chorus became a charming pastoral.
The double orchestra was rather fully manned by the London Philharmonic
players on modern instruments, without pretending to a Baroque sound but
carefully avoiding Romantic manners. The one period touch was a good viola
da gamba, invaluable for Baer's 'Geduld'.
As a whole reading, Welser-Most's treatment of the Passion was impeccably
consistent ' and no doubt his tempi, or many of them, could claim greater
authenticity than any grave Victorian trudge. Yet it seemed not merely
light, but lightweight. Perhaps, after all, such tempi need period
instruments to lend them enough expressive bite.

THE WEEK AHEAD
The Rank Organisation is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of
Pounds 245m on Thursday, down on last year's Pounds 312.1m. Holidays and
bingo are expected to have held up reasonably well, but hotels, casinos and
amusement machines are expected to show the wear and tear of recession.
Particular attention will focus on the dividend; maintaining last year's
final payment of 20.75p would give investors confidence that the group
expects to profit from a consumer upturn.
The elimination of loss-making businesses is likely to allow W H Smith to
post reasonable interim pre-tax profits when it announces its half-year
results to December 1 on Wednesday. The City is looking for a figure in the
range of Pounds 46m to Pounds 50m, reflecting weakness on the high street
but huge savings in interest payments.
The interest charge will be down from Pounds 15m to Pounds 5m after a Pounds
148m rights issue in May and the sale of its travel and television interests
last year.
Book sales, however, were affected by the recession on the high street,
which persisted through the Christmas season, while profits from the DIY
business are likely to have been dull as well.
Growth in the W H Smith book chain is also expected to have been countered
by a slightly higher rise in costs.
Waterstones, however, has done extremely well, with double digit
like-for-like growth.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Probe of Gulf troop charters under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATION is under way into suspected irregularities in the shipping
of British troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf campaign,
David White writes.
The Ministry of Defence said at the weekend that documents were seized last
month from premises in London and the south-east by MoD police.
The documents related to the chartering of ships for Operation Granby - the
British contribution to forces in the Gulf.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Appointments: Strategic questions for the Pru
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the PRUDENTIAL, has named Laurel
Powers-Freeling, an American who detested her very first job peddling
policies for Prudential of America, as the new head of corporate strategy at
Britain's biggest insurance company.
Powers-Freeling, at 34 probably the most senior woman at the Pru, will head
a team of some 15 strategists. She joined last April at manager level, and
has now been made a director reporting directly to Newmarch. She came from
Morgan Stanley International - where 'I discovered deal-making was not my
forte' - following spells specialising in insurance at McKinsey and Price
Waterhouse.
The Pru had had a nominal head of strategy before, she says, but her
considerably more senior appointment reflects Newmarch's desire to 'be much
more aggressive with strategy. Mick is committed to a complete
re-examination of how we do our business.'
The energetic Powers-Freeling, whose promotion coincides with the arrival of
her first baby, is shortly returning, after just six weeks' leave, to embark
on a four-month review of global strategy.
Newmarch himself, who made his mark on the investment management side, has
yet to prove he can make a real success at the helm of the giant retail
financial services concern. The big question - and one which is hardly
likely to be dealt with in 16 weeks - is how the organisation brings its
distribution techniques into the 1990s. Perhaps the woman from the Pru will
tell him.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Appointments: Smyth to help Fiat rev up its dealers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT has appointed Geoff Smyth as operations director of Fiat Auto (UK), its
British importer/distributor subsidiary.
Fiat, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, is planning to invest around
Pounds 100m over the next three years in order to strengthen its UK dealer
network and improve its poor market share. Smyth, who was previously Fiat's
area director for Scandinavia and Austria based in Turin, will be
responsible for managing the dealer networks of the three marques in the UK.
Smyth, 39, has worked his way up through Fiat since joining the company in
Ireland in 1979, and has been based in Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.
There are currently around 300 Fiat dealerships in the UK along with 69 for
Alfa Romeo and 56 for Lancia. Although Fiat is the second largest west
European car-maker, in the UK the group has languished far behind its
rivals. Smyth says that 'it will be my job to ensure that the group's
position in the UK more accurately reflects the company's successes in other
markets.'
Alec Murray, managing director of QUICKS Group, the Manchester-headquartered
vehicles distributor, is taking the corporate name to heart. Just three
months after he moved in, the Quicks board has been reshuffled and a
loss-making leasing subsidiary, Trafford Vehicle Leasing, closed down.
James Quick, nephew of chairman Norman, and Michael Davis have left their
positions as executive directors of the group board to assume responsibility
for the group's main operating subsidiary, dealers H &amp; J Quick.
A third group director, James Olroyd, has left the group altogether. He is
said to have successfully completed 'specific tasks for which he was
appointed in 1990', understood to relate to his management of Ford
dealerships within the group.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Campaign launched to save Devonport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DML, THE privately owned company that manages Devonport dockyard under
contract from the Ministry of Defence, has launched a campaign to save the
dockyard from closure.
Mr Mike Leece, managing director, has warned the 5,000 workforce 'there is a
real possibility that the Devonport dockyard could close'.
He is supported in the campaign by Mr John Ingham, Labour leader of Plymouth
City Council, who has said that 'Devonport can stand the strictest
comparison with Britain's other naval facilities. It fully deserves to
flourish'.
If the dockyard were to close under the ministry's Options for Change policy
review, it might lead to serious doubts over the future of the associated
naval base itself, which employs some 4,700 people. MoD officials say that
closure of the base is ruled out, but that reductions are likely.
The city council has estimated that closure of the two would cost the
south-west of England more than Pounds 1bn a year directly and indirectly
and lead to the loss of some 15,000 jobs in the dockyard, the naval base and
the supply industries.
'We are fighting for the survival not just of the dockyard but for Plymouth
and the whole south-west,' Mr Leece said.
At thecentre of the matter is the contest for the contract to refit
nuclear-powered submarines. Under present arrangements, Devonport handles
some 'conventional' nuclear submarines while refitting work on the Polaris
ballistic-missile fleet is undertaken at Rosyth in Scotland by Babcock
Thorn.
Last year the MoD, as part of Options for Change, asked the two companies to
present proposals for merging all submarine work at one yard.
The ministry has been holding the two reports since last November and there
are fears in Plymouth that after the outcry over the closure of the
Ravenscraig steel works in Lanarkshire the government will throw Scotland a
bone before the election and place all its submarine work in Rosyth. The
decision on whether to concentrate all the nuclear submarine work at a
single site has not yet been made, and is thought unlikely before the
election.
A report commissioned by Plymouth City Council from Mr Eric Grove, an
independent consultant, concluded that 'Devonport offers the greatest
efficiency and scope for growth of all the naval base/dockyard complexes'.
There are voices, however, warning the city and company against intensive
lobbying. Dr David Owen, a Plymouth MP, has said that defence decisions will
be taken with national objectives in mind and that pressure lobbying might
be counterproductive.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS Sikh militants fired guns all day in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, a
small group from the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party, led by its
president, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, yesterday unfurled the national flag in
the Lal Chowk area of the state capital.
The ceremony, intended to demonstrate the country's unity, served instead to
show that the militants fighting for an independent Kashmir had the upper
hand. Though Srinagar was under curfew and streets were heavily patrolled,
guns crackled all day.
The ceremony at which the flag was hoisted yesterday, India's Republic Day,
brought to a climax Mr Joshi's 45-day ekta yatra (unity tour), which took
him through 14 states at the head of a caravan of vehicles. Mr Joshi was
able to accomplish the mission's final ceremony only with the connivance of
the authorities.
He was flown from Jammu to Srinagar on Saturday evening by the Indian Air
Force when the road was declared closed, reportedly because of a landslide.
The 'unity' cavalcade, in effect, ended at Jammu. The 60,000 people who were
meant to accompany Mr Joshi were left behind there.
In place of the planned huge gathering, the national flag was hoisted at a
brief ceremony at which less than 200 were present amid the tightest
security Srinagar has seen.
Despite the curfew and the security, militants kept up a steady fire all
day. Mr Joshi flew back to Jammu yesterday after the ceremony and survived
an attempt to shoot down the aircraft carrying him.

FT  27 JAN 92 / The European Market: Single market spells a re-think on
logistics - Technical aspects of European business are more vital than ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON two floors of a 300-metre-long building in a busy industrial district of
Frankfurt, hundreds of workers shift thousands of items daily from racks to
trolleys, from trolleys to a moving multi-decked box rack, and from boxes
into parcels.
The building is where Neckermann, one of Germany's big three mail-order
companies, sorts out and packs the contents of 130,000 parcels a day. Large
mail-order companies have been using similar methods for 30 years.
But not for much longer, at least at Neckermann. A team from Miebach
Logistics, one of Europe's largest logistics consultancies, has completed a
feasibility study which could lead to the introduction of a new, faster
item-picking process using modern computerised machinery.
It is one example of how the dramatic changes in the European market are
prompting an increased interest in logistics among manufacturers -
Neckermann is a 'manufacturer' of parcels, every one of which is different.
One of the most important driving forces is the single market, which is
encouraging many companies to think for the first time not only about
pan-European manufacturing and marketing, but also about more humdrum but
equally essential issues such as warehousing, organisation and distribution.
Alternatively, as in Neckermann's case, it is the reunification of Germany
which has prompted a fresh look at many aspects of its logistics policy.
As European industry moves into the later stages of its planning for the
single market, the more technical aspects of pan-European business are
assuming a new significance.
Many of the companies that have decided they want or need to be pan-European
players will already have made the key acquisitions and reorganised
manufacturing accordingly, but that in turn requires nitty-gritty decisions
on logistics.
At the same time, the single market is prompting changes in transport
methods throughout Europe, and the logistics consultancies stand ready to
advise manufacturers of the possibilities.
On the Continent, for example, third-party distribution is much less
developed than in the UK.
Companies such as Caterpillar Logistics Services, part of the US
construction equipment group, are experiencing growing demand on the
continent for a sophisticated service covering all a client's needs.
At first glance it might seem odd that logistics consultancies should be
thriving ahead of the single market.
Companies which have spent heavily, and confidently, on acquisitions or
greenfield site investments ought to be able to site and equip a warehouse
and hire a truck fleet, one would have thought.
Not so, says Mr Joachim Miebach, founder of the company that bears his name
and one of the key figures in European logistics consultancy. Warehouse
technology and robotics have been developing so fast that companies which
may rarely be making big decisions on logistics need a helping hand.
And as companies' European business expands in size and scope, the need for
further investment in logistics technology increases accordingly.
'In logistics, there are no economies of scale; large companies are no
faster than small businesses. They need technology to offset the complexity
of their larger operations,' he says.
Consequently, there is plenty of work around. The large broad-based
consultancy companies are often used to advise on distribution network
locations, while the German-dominated warehouse equipment industry also has
consultancies.
In between are a number, such as Miebach in Germany and Haden Technology in
the UK, with differing approaches to technology and to clients' logistics
strategy, but no axe to grind on equipment.
Haden, based in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, has yet to see much benefit from
the single market but has recently done design warehouse work for
third-party distribution companies that need to keep an eye on 1992 and
their clients' changing priorities. It is actively looking overseas from a
UK base, and has formed a number of business associations in Europe.
Miebach, meanwhile, has worked for years with large companies such as SKF,
the Swedish bearings group, for which Europe was an important market long
before the idea of the single market was born.
Mr Miebach says most companies have had ideas about European distribution
already, but these were usually restricted to existing national borders.
As the single market approaches, companies have become aware that 'there
must be something beyond this,' he says.
As long as sales companies are organised on a national basis - a situation
which could well continue in the single market because of language and
legislative factors - logistics has never had an independent role to play.
But this trend is now changing, albeit fairly slowly. A typical move was
Duracell International's announcement on January 2 of a new battery parts
distribution centre in Belgium, to replace existing national warehouse
operations in the UK, Benelux, Germany and France.
The key question for which consultants need an answer from clients is: 'How
good does your logistics have to be to remain competitive in the single
market?'
From this, a total logistics strategy can be drawn up, leading to specific
recommendations on transport, warehousing, stock management and production
logistics.
That might lead to the choice of a single warehousing site, but could
equally involve more than one, or a combination of central and national
locations, depending on the business and its priorities.
Miebach was brought in at Benckiser, the acquisitive German detergents group
which expanded into cosmetics, and into southern Europe, in the late 1980s
as part of its pre-1992 strategy.
The task was to establish whether it made sense for cosmetics and detergents
to share the same distribution network. Eventually, the decision was taken
to build two warehouses in Barcelona and Wiesbaden to serve the European
cosmetics market.
Naturally, the more ambitious logistics consultants such as Miebach are
filling out their own pan-European networks to exploit the single market
more effectively - as well as to take better advantage of German
reunification.
Logistics consultancies, too, have their own logistical challenges.

FT  27 JAN 92 / R-R faces US challenge over jet trainer engine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ST LOUIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE is facing a challenge from Garrett, the US aero-engine maker,
for a slice of the Pounds 400m business to power the US Navy's new T-45
Goshawk jet trainer built by McDonnell Douglas and BAe.
The UK engine maker is providing its Adour engine, jointly produced with
Turbomeca of France, for the T-45 programme. The first T-45 aircraft, a
modified version of BAe's Hawk trainer, was rolled out at McDonnell-Douglas'
St Louis plant last Thursday.
The US Navy needs 268 T-45 aircraft, which, with a complete training and
support system, represent about Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) worth of
business for the partners in the programme. These include McDonnell-Douglas,
the prime contractor; BAe, principal airframe sub-contractor; Rolls-Royce,
the engine supplier; and Hughes, providing the simulators.
The programme is one of the biggest Anglo-US collaboration ventures in
military aircraft, at a time of decline in the defence aerospace sector.
Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca seemed secure as the engine suppliers for the
T-45. But Garrett has proposed supplying a new version of its F-124 turbofan
as an alternative to the Rolls-Royce-Turbomeca Adour engine.
Garrett's proposal is to introduce the F-124 engine variant it is
considering developing for the US Navy's new trainer on the T-45 production
line from the 97th aircraft by mid-1996.
Rolls-Royce successfully fought off an earlier attempt a few years ago by
Garrett controlled to develop an engine for the Hawk in competition with the
Adour. While not under-estimating the latest challenge, the UK company
appears confident it will again be able to fend off its US competitor on the
T-45 programme.
Mr David Marshall, commercial director for Rolls-Royce military engines,
said one of the big advantages of the Adour engine was its proven track
record. He confirmed that the T-45 programme was expected to lead to Pounds
200m in engine sales for the Rolls-Royce-Turbomeca Adour partnership and a
further Pounds 200m in spares and support.
France has shown interest in the new US Navy trainer. BAe and McDonnell
Douglas have put a proposal to the French Navy including an option to supply
40 T-45 aircraft with another, involving 15 aircraft. Under heavy defence
budgetary pressures, Paris is unlikely to take a decision before next year.

FT  27 JAN 92 / New push to end impasse on Efta-EC treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH efforts will be made in Brussels today to break the judicial deadlock
that is the only remaining obstacle to signing of the European Economic Area
(EEA) treaty, creating a 19-nation common trading zone, David Buchan reports
from Brussels.
The European Court of Justice threw the EEA deal into doubt last month by
effectively striking down the agreement on a mixed EEA court, composed of
European Court and European Free Trade Association (Efta) judges. Such a
court would pre-empt the European Court in interpreting Community law, it
said.
EC and Efta negotiators have failed to find a compromise legally acceptable
to the EC and politically tolerable to Efta states. The deadlock arises from
the EC's view that the only way in which laws governing the 19-nation zone
can be kept uniform is for its own court to predominate in disputes. Efta
states have resisted rule by foreign judges.
Efta negotiators will today offer a compromise. They will propose that the
Luxembourg court deal with all competition cases involving EC and Efta
companies or where any sizeable business turnover in the EC is concerned.
This would be the majority of competition cases in the EEA zone. Purely Efta
cases would be dealt with by a new Efta court.
Efta also proposes that all disputes arising out of those EEA laws special
to the pact, not just a mirror reflection of EC legislation, should be
subjected to outside arbitration.
Such special provisions include exemptions and transition periods for Efta
countries to adjust to standard EC rules which will be the basis of the EEA
arrangement.
A first bid to resolve the issue failed earlier this month.

<TEXT>
MR Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister, is expected to announce his
resignation on Thursday, following last week's ultimatum from his
Progressive Democrat coalition partners to restore the credibility of the
government or lose their support.
Backbenchers in Mr Haughey's Fianna Fail (FF) party expect him to announce
that he will step down as party leader at a meeting of the FF parliamentary
group on Thursday, the day after the presentation of the 1992 budget.
There are three main contenders to succeed Mr Haughey. Mr Albert Reynolds, a
former finance minister, is the strongest. He was sacked by Mr Haughey last
November after leading an attempt to oust the prime minister. He has strong
backbench support, although many of his former cabinet colleagues are likely
to oppose him, as will Mr Haughey himself. Mr Reynolds said last week he
intended to be a candidate 'once the prime minister's post is vacant'.
Mr Bertie Ahern, who replaced Mr Reynolds in the Finance Ministry, would be
Mr Haughey's preferred choice. He commands respect in the party as an able
negotiator, and is trusted by the country's trade union leaders. Mr Ahern
may be seen as the best candidate to steer the economy through a difficult
year ahead. However, he has consistently disavowed any leadership ambitions.
He said he would make his intentions known 'before Thursday's vote'.
Mrs Mary O'Rourke, the minister for health, is the only other serious
contender to have emerged since the leadership issue came to the fore at the
end of last year. Mrs O'Rourke is seen as a strong reformer on social issues
and could win support from an electorate that increasingly sees Irish
legislation on issues such as divorce and women's rights as outdated.
Mr Haughey's succession will hinge on whether Mr Ahern decides to stand
himself, or to back one of the other contenders.
Intense lobbying can be expected, in which Mr Haughey will play a central
role.
The possibility of Mr Haughey deciding to fight on as prime minister cannot
be ruled out. He could ask the president, Mrs Mary Robinson, to dissolve the
government after the budget is approved, and call a snap general election.
There is considerable resentment within Fianna Fail that the Progressive
Democrats have been able to force the leadership issue in Fianna Fail by
threatening to pull out of the government. The PDs hold only six seats in
parliament, against Fianna Fail's 77.
Fianna Fail backbenchers, especially those in marginal seats, would rather
not face an immediate election. The party could lose support because of its
failure to deal decisively with its internal problems.
'We could expect to lose at least eight seats,' said one backbencher. 'A
general election must be avoided.'
If Mr Haughey resigns, the coalition government could hope to hold together
until the next general elections, which must be held before June 1994.

A SPECIAL envoy of the United Nations yesterday began a five-day mission in
Yugoslavia to determine whether it will be possible to deploy 10,000
peacekeepers.
Mr Marrack Goulding, UN under-secretary in charge of peacekeeping forces,
will decide whether the 23-day-old UN-brokered ceasefire is stable enough
for peacekeeping forces to enter Croatia's war zones.
The ceasefire yesterday appeared to be holding in most battle zones.
Croatian radio said a three-year-old Croatian boy was killed when a bomb
exploded in Karlovac, central Croatia. Serbian media reported sporadic
shooting in eastern Croatia and in Zadar, an Adriatic port.
During his mission, Mr Goulding, a Briton, will talk to Serb leaders from
Krajina, a Serb enclave in Croatia, who oppose the UN plan calling for the
Serb-dominated federal army to withdraw from Croatia. He will also meet
federal, Serb and Croat government officials and army leaders.
In a sign of the economic devastation caused by the seven-month-old war, the
Yugoslav dinar, the national currency, was devalued yesterday by 80 per
cent. The Serb-controlled federal government said the new rate would be 65
dinars, instead of 13, to DM1, reported Tanjug news agency. The new rate is
closer to the thriving black market rate of up to 110 dinars.

<TEXT>
VOTING began yesterday in the strike ballot of 100,000 trade union members
in the German steel industry to decide whether to call their first stoppage
since 1979.
One of the two big unions in the German banking industry will also decide
today whether to hold a similar strike ballot, after the breakdown of wage
negotiations last week.
The threat of the two strikes, combined with the prospect of a stormy pay
negotiation opening in February for the 3m government workers and a hefty
pay claim from 4m engineering workers, leaves Germany facing its most
troubled industrial relations period in recent years.
Officials in IG Metall, the union representing both the steel and
engineering workers, insisted over the weekend the mood was running strongly
in favour of a steel strike.
Wage negotiations in the industry broke down after nine sessions, with the
difference between the employers and unions reduced to barely 1 percentage
point: according to various calculations, IG Metall was ready to settle for
6.5 per cent, down from the 10.5 per cent original claim, while the
employers are offering between 5.3 and 5.7 per cent.
A 75 per cent vote is needed in the ballot to call a strike.
Wage negotiations for banking workers broke down last Wednesday, and today
the white-collar workers' union, DAG, will decide whether to hold a strike
ballot. The HBV, the other trade union representing banking workers, is also
threatening a ballot, rejecting the bank employers' latest offer of five per
cent as 'outrageous' after a year of record banking profits.
Negotiations for government workers begin on February 7. They want a 9.5 per
cent rise, the figure recommended by IG Metall to regional branches as the
maximum demand for engineering workers.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, whose increased taxes to finance German
unity have helped fuel the wage demands, warned trade unions that any
stoppage would be 'a blow to the economic re-unification of Germany'.

FT  27 JAN 92 / Optimism flourishes in Garden City: Group of Seven meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GARDEN CITY, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY publicly christened the latest statement by the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations 'the Garden City accord', writes Peter Norman,
Economics Correspondent, in Garden City, New York.
But there was little doubt among the meeting's US hosts that the 7 1/2 hours
of talks among finance ministers and central bank governors and the
comparatively lengthy 4 1/2 page communique represented a significant
improvement on recent efforts at economic policy co-ordination.
Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, said the US government had secured
an 'unequivocal commitment' from the seven to concentrate more on growth.
'When you have the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7
changing their view and changing the way they talk about growth. . . then
that's a big change,' he said.
His assessment was upstaged by that of Mr Pierre Be're'govoy, France's
finance minister. 'We have rediscovered the spirit of the Plaza and the
Louvre accords,' he said, harking back to 1985 when the big industrial
democracies agreed at the Plaza Hotel in New York to push down the
overvalued dollar and to 1987 when they decided at the Louvre to try to
stabilise exchange rates.
The communique issued on Saturday was the 'most important in years', the
French minister said. By making a commitment to do everything they could to
accelerate the recovery of world growth, the G7 had sent a message of
optimism to the international community.
Even Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who rarely
enthuses about such international gatherings, sounded hopeful. It was, he
said, a 'very successful meeting indeed' which had reached agreement that
the right policies were in place for resumed growth in G7 countries this
year.
The US and French enthusiasm for the meeting was to be expected.
President George Bush faces elections later this year, with his handling of
the US economy under fire. Washington has been pressing its main trading
partners for nearly a year to adopt more active growth policies and France
has been its most constant supporter.
But hyperbole aside, the weekend marked a shift in the policy priorities of
the G7. The communique stated clearly that the group's members had 'agreed
to intensify their co-operative efforts to strengthen world economic
growth'.
However, this does not mean the G7 will embark on reckless expansion. The
text stressed efforts should be devoted to achieving 'sustainable growth
with price stability over the medium term.'
In policy terms, they decided to hold to the so-called Sinatra doctrine
which leaves countries to pursue actions best suited to their own conditions
and not move in lockstep. In some countries this could mean reallocating
public spending to areas that would improve confidence or boost
productivity. But such an option would not be open for Italy, for example,
because of its large public debt.
The communique also held out the hope of monetary easing in countries with
better-than-expected inflation performance.
Mr Don Mazankowski, Canada's finance minister, said there was scope for
monetary easing in Canada. But Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of
Japan, said this passage did not refer to his country and Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, made it clear it was too soon to think of
German interest rates falling. As long as German rates stay high, it will be
difficult for France and Britain to cut theirs.
Moreover, sceptics can argue that most of what the ministers agreed to do
was already in train. While the US pledged in the communique it would
announce a 'comprehensive programme to strengthen growth and
competitiveness' in Mr Bush's State of the Union address tomorrow, the
sections on the other six countries simply detailed existing policies.
In the case of Germany, the text suggested that room might be created for
lower interest rates. But this would depend on the fulfilment of a number of
conditions, including 'a deceleration of the strong growth in money supply
and credit demand as well as an easing of wage pressures and regaining price
stability'.
With German money supply growing at 9 per cent annually in the most recent
three months, compared with the Bundesbank's target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent,
and strikes in prospect in support of double digit pay claims, there is
little hope of an early easing in monetary policy. Both Mr Theo Waigel,
finance minister, and Mr Schlesinger made this clear with a robust defence
of their policies.
However, the mood of the meeting was clearly different to recent acrimonious
G7 gatherings. Mr Be're'govoy said afterwards there was a 'different tone'
about the way the German delegation discussed interest rates. 'Rome wasn't
built in a day and attitudes don't change overnight,' he said. But the
meeting was 'an important step forwards'.
A senior US Treasury official said the US expected to see 'evidence of
action' to promote growth in its G7 partners by the time of the
International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee meeting in
Washington at the end of April. Both Britain and Canada were inhibited from
disclosing what action they planned because they were preparing budgets, he
suggested.
If action results, it will be a sign the Garden City meeting has put the
co-ordination process back on track. But the final judgment on the weekend's
events will depend on the millions of consumers and investors in the G7
member countries.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Week Ahead): Rank expects downturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rank Organisation is expected to report full year pre-tax profits of
Pounds 245m on Thursday, down substantially on last year's Pounds 312.1m.
Holidays and bingo are expected to have held up reasonably well but hotels,
casinos and amusement machines are expected to show the wear and tear of the
recession.
Particular attention will focus on the dividend; maintaining last year's
final payment of 20.75p would give investors confidence that the group
expects to profit from a consumer upturn.
The elimination of loss-making businesses is likely to have helped WH Smith
post reasonable interim pre-tax profits when it announces its half year
results to December 1 on Wednesday. The City is looking for a figure in the
range of Pounds 46m to Pounds 50m reflecting weakness on the high street
countered by a huge savings in interest payments.
The interest charge will be down from Pounds 15m to Pounds 5m after a Pounds
148m rights issue also in May and due to the sale of its travel and
television interests last year.
Book sales, however, were affected by the recession on the high street,
which persisted through the Christmas season, while profits from the DIY
business are likely to have been dull as well.
Growth in the WH Smith book chain is also expected to have been countered by
a slightly higher rise in costs.
Waterstones, however, has done extremely well, with double digit
like-for-like growth.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: Smaller companies still hope for big revival - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE who believe in the smaller companies revival have had a long wait.
At the end of 1990, it was widely remarked that small company shares, as
measured by the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index, had lagged behind the
market for the second year in a row. This had only happened once before, in
the mid-1960s; at no time since records began in 1955, had small company
shares underperformed for three years. Surely this was a sign that small
companies had to revive?
It was not to be. In 1991, the total return on the FT-A All Share Index was
20.8 per cent; the HGSC achieved a respectable, but lower, 18.5 per cent.
The reason is simple: the recession. Small companies are more dependent on
the UK economy than their larger brethren, many of which have overseas
subsidiaries and substantial export businesses.
Enthusiasts argue that the minnows will be the biggest beneficiaries when
the UK economy eventually revives. Accordingly, small company shares
performed well in the first quarter of 1991, when a recovery seemed
imminent. They lost some of their lustre in the fourth quarter, when it
became clear that the recession had continued.
The impact of the recession was such that a record number of HGSC components
went bust in 1991. In 1987, there were only two companies in the extended
HGSC whose shares became worthless; last year, there were 79.
Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, who produce the HGSC Index, note
that when the economy last emerged from recession, in 1982, the number of
bankruptcies increased. The corollary is that '1992 may well witness a
continued increase in the number of company liquidations even if there is an
early recovery.'
Recent failures have been concentrated among the smallest of the small
companies, and this highlights the unusual nature of 1991. In good years for
the stock market, the convention has been that the smaller the company, the
better, on average, the stocks performed. The average annual return since
1955 of the smallest 10 per cent (by market capitalisation) of companies is
a staggering 35 per cent.
In 1991, by contrast, it was medium-sized companies which performed best;
the smallest 10 per cent actually produced a negative return.
One reason for this, say the professors, is lack of liquidity. The
marketability of small company shares has continued to deteriorate and there
is a widespread expectation that some smaller companies will soon be traded
on a 'matched bargain' basis. This would adversely affect the share price of
many so-called 'shell' companies whose main value is their stock market
quotation.
Whatever the reason, the poor performance of the smallest stocks has helped
those fund managers who specialise in small company investments. They tend
to focus on the larger end of the small company spectrum and thus were able
to outperform the HGSC Index in 1991.
Certainly, the enthusiasm for small company fund launches continues. Last
week, there was an investment trust, with a split capital structure, from
Lloyds; this week, Scottish Amicable followed suit with a conventional
investment trust and Clerical Medical with a unit trust.
It is unusual for a sector to be 'flavour of the month', in fund launch
terms, after it has underperformed. But fund managers, and other small
company enthusiasts, are relying on the long term effects highlighted by the
HGSC.
Over the 37 years since 1955, the index has produced an annualised return of
over 18 per cent, beating the return on the All-Share by 4.5 per cent per
year. The sum of Pounds 1,000 invested in the HGSC in 1955 would have grown
(with gross dividends reinvested) to more than Pounds 512,000 by 1992.
The dividends on HGSC companies have grown, in real terms, at around twice
the rate achieved by larger companies.
Can this long term trend repeat itself? One irony is that, though the HGSC
figures date back to 1955, the index itself was launched in 1987 just as the
long run outperformance of smaller companies was beginning to end. This
seems to confirm the old rule that, as soon as a potentially profitable
market anomaly is noticed, the anomaly disappears.
Nevertheless, there is evidence that small company shares are undervalued.
The average price-earnings ratio on HGSC companies was 12.1 at the end of
1991, against 13.2 for the All-Share. Similarly, HGSC stocks traded on a
slightly higher yield than those in the All-Share - 5.1 per cent to 5 per
cent.
Those figures may not be conclusive proof that the small company revival is
on its way, but try telling that to the sector's enthusiasts.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: It is all go for the Superbowl predictor - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WASHINGTON Redskins will defeat the Buffalo Bills in the Superbowl
tomorrow, and US stock markets will remain bullish all year. No, a
combination of the cold weather and Superbowl hype has not gone to my head.
I am only paying heed to one of Wall Street's most effective forecasting
tools: the Superbowl Predictor.
The theory is simple. Victory for a team from the old National Football
League forecasts a year of rising stock prices, while victory for a team
from the old American Football League (the two leagues merged in 1970)
heralds a year of falling prices. The Redskins are favoured to win in
Minneapolis tomorrow, and because they are an old NFL team, Wall Street
believes it is in for a good year.
You may scoff, but since the first Superbowl in 1967, the Predictor has
worked 22 out of 25 times, a success rate of 88 per cent. There is no other
leading indicator that comes close to matching it.
The theory can also work in reverse. The stock markets have started 1992 in
buoyant mood, and should continue to enjoy solid gains throughout the year,
if you believe the consensus. Thus, the bulls predict the Bills will lose
and the Skins win. Confused?
Investors certainly are. This was a difficult week for the markets, which
posted some of the first significant losses since the rally began in
mid-December. There was a 32-point gain midweek, but that owed more to
late-session program trading than it did to renewed demand from investors.
Profit-taking was the dominant factor, with traders and investors taking the
opportunity to book some of the gains earned in the month-long rally. At the
same time, buyers have been scanning the market for sectors that could offer
a good ride over the next few weeks.
Technical trading aside, investors appear uncertain as to what to do next. A
vast amount of money has flooded into the market since the Federal Reserve
slashed interest rates at the end of last year, most of it from
lower-yielding short-term assets such as bank certificates of deposit and
money market funds.
That initial energy is probably now spent. Since the last rate cut on
December 20, the Dow has risen more than 10 per cent and the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 8.6 per cent, and it is difficult to justify adding to those
gains until some fresh stimulus other than lower interest rates
materialises.
This means any advance in the market from now on must come either from
better economic fundamentals or an improvement in the outlook for corporate
earnings. On the economic front, the news has remained gloomy. This week
contained little that pointed to a brighter future, while one set of
backward-looking figures, the final count for housing starts in 1991,
testified to the depth of the recession last year.
Despite a modest rebound in housing starts in December (they rose 2.6 per
cent), over the full year they posted a 1.1 per cent decline, the worst
showing since 1945. Although stock markets should only pay attention to
leading economic indicators, the housing numbers for 1991 show just how much
ground one of a key sector of the economy has to reclaim before the recovery
can be classified healthy.
As for corporate earnings, the quarterly reporting season continues to
produce an unappetising diet of the good, the bad and the ugly.
For United Technologies, the fourth quarter loss of Dollars 1.22bn was about
as ugly as it gets. In its defence, United Tech's loss was the product of a
Dollars 1.275bn charge to cover the cost of a huge restructuring, which the
aerospace and building group hopes will go toward restoring its good looks.
There is a price for the economy to pay, however, in the loss of almost
14,000 jobs and the closure of a host of United Tech facilities.
Delta Air Lines was another to report an unattractive loss for the final
quarter of the year. The Dollars 237m shortfall was partly a hangover from
Delta's purchase of the failed Pan Am's east coast shuttle operations and
transatlantic routes. The figures were not warmly received by investors who
had been keen buyers of the stocks until recently. Having peaked at over
Dollars 75, Delta ran into heavy selling in the latter half of the week and
by yesterday lunchtime had settled at Dollars 71.
The best corporate news of the week came from a most unlikely source - a
computer manufacturer. Unisys recorded fourth quarter profits of Dollars
80.5m, and reported that orders booked during the last three months of 1991
were the heaviest for five years. The market loved it, and the shares
bounced from Dollars 5 1/2 at the start of the week to Dollars 7 1/2 at the
end, a handsome 36 per cent gain.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Polls indicate narrow lead for Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORIES edged into the narrowest of leads yesterday after a frenetic week
of pre-election campaigning, with two opinion polls giving them leads of 1
and 2 percentage points respectively.
The polls came as the Tories gave a taste of likely manifesto pledges, with
news of plans to extend proposed leasehold reforms in a way that would
particularly help people in London and the south-east.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, is expected to announce the
move next month, although the scheme has not yet received final ministerial
approval.
The plan would enable private tenants with leases of 50 years or less to buy
new leases of up to 99 years at market values. It would be available to
those who did not qualify for the scheme announced last summer to extend
rights for tenants of private flats in blocks collectively to buy leases,
possibly at their market value.
Extending leases would help to ease the difficulties of selling those with
less than 50 years to run because of difficulties of obtaining mortgages for
such properties.
Labour and the Conservatives were poised for more campaigning at the weekend
as the polls suggested there was still everything to play for.
A Harris survey in today's Daily Express shows the Tories on 41 per cent,
with Labour on 40 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 14 per cent. A
Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph gives the Tories 40 per cent,
compared with Labour on 38 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are on 16.5 per
cent.
There is some comfort for Labour, however, in that a similar Gallup poll
published a week ago showed the Tories with a 4 1/2 -point lead on 42 per
cent while Labour was on 37 1/2 per cent. The Liberal Democrats were then on
16 per cent.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, kept up the pressure on the government's
economic management with a further attack on 'the rose-tinted view which put
Britain into recession and will now do nothing useful to foster recovery'.
He also warned that a cut of 1p in the basic rate of income tax in the
Budget would mean little to most earners.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Gardening: How Virtue can learn from vice - Some inspiration
from the Renaissance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN GARDENS, improvements wage a constant battle against idleness. During the
1980s, gardens were being improved everywhere. Conservatories sprouted like
white mushrooms, designer trellis reached for the sky like orderly bindweed,
topiary was back, and neat new house-owners wanted neat little rooms of
green.
I met one of these tidy gardeners only last week. In the 1980s, he had his
garden designed on the strength of his Christmas bonus. In the 1990s,
though, it still needed height and asked for something better than
bullrushes in its central oval pond.
I suggested that he should fill in the pond and start again, but the old
energy failed him. It sounded, he said, like too much work.
As he turned away, I put an immediate image to his answer, probably because
I had just seen it on show in the Royal Academy in London. You can study it
for yourself in one of the further rooms of the exhibition of the
Renaissance art of Mantegna, one of the capital's best art shows in years.
The painting in question has been overshadowed previously by neighbours in
the Louvre, and it does indeed have a Louvre-like combination of yellowing
paint and crowds of figures from myth. Nonetheless, it strikes me as a
frontispiece for gardeners in the 1990s. I have come to see not what
Mantegna meant but what his painting still can mean to us.
On the face of it, the picture is a learned puzzle. The goddess Pallas
Athene is shown breaking in to a garden from the left, and joining her
attendants in driving all sorts of sinful characters out of the light.
On one side, a very slender lady has turned into a tree and her
inconsiderable bosom is sprouting leaves of laurel, although the exhibition
catalogue expresses unjustified doubt. Plainly, she is the unfortunate
Daphne, who was turned into a tree when one of the gods tried to rape her.
This scene, we infer, is a symbol of vice in the absence of Virtue, the
garden-owner. She herself is not shown but is implied, wittily, to be in
captivity (to judge from the Latin message on a little label on the large
painting's right-hand side). Good Athene is winning the battle, meanwhile,
and soon Virtue will be back in her garden, a neat little bower of evergreen
buttresses where trees of orange and lemon have been clipped to form tall
windows, framing the view beyond.
In outline, the painting's theme is obvious, but the details always are
important. There is a good reason to look closely.
Mantegna had been asked to paint it for the private study of a fine young
lady of talent - Isabella, of the d'Este family, who had gone to live in
Mantua at the tender age of 16.
In her private study, she did not want pin-ups, madonnas or raffish
musicians: she wanted puzzling, erudite paintings which she could discuss
and explain to her friends. She ought, of course, to have been swotting for
a place to read classics at Oxford in 1502, but Mantua and Oxford did not
then have an exchange agreement and she had to make do with Mantegna and a
private tutor instead.
The more closely you look, the more Mantegna's mind has run riot and the
more grateful you are to the academy for giving you the chance to see it in
close-up.
At first, you agree with triumphing Athena. The worst of the sins are
wallowing in the foreground in the garden pond. Sloth is tugging at
Idleness, a deformed creature with no arms; Eternal Hatred is wading in the
water, carrying three black bags of seed labelled Bad, Worse and Worst
(which I assume to be the white-flowered bitter cress, giant bindweed and
fluffy Mares Tail in ascending order of awfulness).
On the right-hand side, Ignorance is being carried by Ingratitude and Greed,
who also are leaving the water. How timely, I began to think, is good
Athena's arrival: I would hate to find those vices in my swimming pool,
especially as it seems to encourage them by some natural power of
attraction.
On second thoughts, the certainties waver. In the air above Athena, cupids
with spangled wings are dropping their arrows and fleeing from the Moral
Minority. Some owl-faced flying creatures are bossily arresting an errant
cupid with its armour. The exhibition catalogue says nothing about them, but
these owl-like policemen must be minions of owl-faced Athena, carrying out
her orders.
Below them, a dreamy, golden-haired Venus is preparing to streak for safety
without any more clothes than a bracelet; the naked figure of Lust is making
the same arrangements although scaly, misbegotten babies are crawling on her
fair upper half. What, I wondered idly, would the garden look like when
these revellers were gone?
Too much, I felt, like the designer-patio of my friend with the bonus who
had been decorator-turned-gardener in the richer years of the 1980s. Virtue
is all very well, but she has planted her evergreen hedges too closely. She
has clipped them into arches which are much too tall and has misplaced the
windows in the greenery which frame the view.
In the sky above, there are some sinister, shining presences. Three
Victorian Values are preparing to return to earth - Temperance among them -
while faces have been sketched subtly in the accompanying clouds. Beneath
them, a lady warrior of more than human status is fighting the good fight
for Virtue: in one of the clouds, I began to think I saw the features of
John Selwyn Gummer.
Without some visiting vices, in short, is Virtue's garden really so
excellent? Artfully, Mantegna has scattered inscriptions in curious places,
several in Latin, one in Hebrew and one in a piece of non-writing which the
academy catalogue misdescribes in Greek. Their message, like that of the
painting, came home to me at several levels.
Without constant warfare, you might wish to say, Sloth and Idleness will
always sit in a virtuous garden and help it to go to ruin. True; but they
also stop virtuous owners from improving the mistakes of their own designs.
There is also the matter of vain Venus and her attendant cupids. By driving
out Leisure, says one of Mantegna's inscriptions, you break the bow of
Cupid. You also, I think, lose the wilderness and romance of a garden's
design. Let Virtue loose and she always get it wrong: too neat, too tidy and
somehow lacking the art of abandon.
We tended to lose it in the 1980s but, under the banner of Mantegna's moral
painting, we need to think again and restore it to the gardens of the next
few years.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Japan sidles towards a nuclear future: The Tokyo government
is amassing huge stocks of plutonium. Michael Cross asks: should the world
be worried?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE DAY this autumn, an extraordinary convoy will leave the French port of
Cherbourg. It will comprise the freighter Pacific Crane, owned by a
British-Japanese joint venture, and the patrol boat Shikishima, armed with
35mm cannon and 20mm machine-guns and operated by Japan's Maritime Safety
Agency. The Pacific Crane's cargo will be enough plutonium to build 120
crude nuclear bombs.
The voyage - the first of many over the next 20 years from Cherbourg and the
north-west English port of Barrow-in-Furness - is part of a process by which
Japan seems set to accumulate the world's largest stockpile of the deadly
element. At a time when unpredictable new regimes are taking over the former
Soviet arsenal, the prospect of stable and pacifist Japan becoming a nuclear
power might not sound alarming. But any steps it takes along the road
towards the capability of building nuclear weapons could have profound
international consequences.
Thomas Cochran, head of nuclear affairs at the US Natural Resources Defense
Council, says Japan's activities 'will greatly restrict efforts in the US
and Soviet states to eliminate stockpiles of weapons material.' Meanwhile,
the presence of a Japanese stockpile of plutonium could give the Koreas and
Taiwan an excuse to continue their efforts to develop bombs.
The movement of plutonium is a temptation to terrorists or rogue governments
in search of nuclear weapons. Shipments also raise the possibility of
spilling or otherwise losing plutonium at sea. Such materials can go astray,
as was shown by the disappearance of 10 kilogrammes of enriched uranium from
inventories at the Dounreay reactor in Scotland. With the right knowledge -
perhaps from an unemployed Russian - eight kilogrammes of civil-grade
plutonium is enough to make a bomb.
Of course, the Japanese government has no intention of mishandling
plutonium, much less of building nuclear weapons. It has always complied
strictly with international rules to combat nuclear proliferation. The
government's Atomic Energy Commission, which sets nuclear policy, states
that it is a 'national principle' for Japan not to possess more plutonium
than needed in civil power stations.
Critics say, however, Japan is setting in motion the machinery to obtain
plutonium much faster than it can be consumed. By the most alarming
estimates, more than 100 tonnes will pile up, half of it shipped from
British and French reprocessing plants, the rest produced locally. This is
more plutonium than exists in the nuclear weapons of either the US or former
Soviet states. 'Japan will become the world's number one plutonium country,'
says Dr Jinzaburo Takagi, a former nuclear scientist who runs his country's
most prominent anti-nuclear group, the Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre.
Japan committed itself to the plutonium economy 25 years ago. Most other
rich nations shared the dream. Nuclear pioneers saw the plutonium cycle as
the most efficient way to tap energy from a limited supply of uranium.
Technically their arguments remain sound. But political and economic
priorities have changed. Falling prices of uranium, coupled with fears about
the proliferation of nuclear weapons, caused the US to abandon its civil
plutonium programme. The Soviet Union, after Chernobyl, followed suit and
protest killed Germany's efforts. Britain and France retain a commitment to
reprocessing but have had second thoughts about fast-breeder reactors.
Japan, obsessed with the need to import 80 per cent of its energy - and with
its celebrated ability to plan for the long term - keeps the faith. The
country has in service 39 commercial reactors, almost all pressurised-water
and boiling-water models adapted from US designs. Work is proceeding at a
furious pace on 11 more using giant pipe-laying robots, the world's largest
cranes and armies of workers. But, in Japanese eyes, all this effort has
little point so long as the country needs to import its uranium and send
fuel overseas for processing. To attain true independence, Japan must 'close
the nuclear fuel cycle.'
The centrepiece of this effort is a gigantic plant being built near the
village of Rokkasho, at the northern end of Honshu. The 1,000-acre
(400-hectare) site houses plants to enrich uranium and store and reprocess
fuel to extract plutonium, as well as a dump for low-level nuclear waste. It
will cost about Y840bn (Pounds 3.7bn).
The final link is the fast-breeder reactor, which runs on a mixture of
plutonium and uranium - and contains, in its spent fuel, more plutonium than
went in. Japan's first electricity-generating breeder, named Monju, is
having final tests on the Tsuruga peninsula, 250 miles west of Tokyo. Fast
breeders are powerful but very expensive. An ordinary power station releases
1 per cent of the energy in its fuel; a fast-breeder can, theoretically,
extract 80 per cent. According to the plan, fast-breeders will become the
standard power station in Japan, assuring energy supplies for thousands of
years.
Fuel for the first generation of fast-breeders will contain plutonium
extracted by reprocessing the spent fuel of conventional reactors. Since the
1970s, spent fuel from Japan's power stations has gone to Sellafield in
Cumbria (near Barrow-in-Furness) and Cap de la Hague (near Cherbourg in
Normandy) for reprocessing. During the 1990s, new plants to handle fuel from
light-water reactors come on stream in both countries. They will process
4,500 tonnes of Japanese fuel to produce 37 tonnes of plutonium. In signing
the reprocessing contracts, Japan undertook to remove both the plutonium and
high-level waste.
So far, only one load of plutonium has gone back to Japan, - in 1984, under
the escort of the US and French navies. The original plan was to transport
it by air, but that would have needed permission from the US government
because the fuel originated from US uranium. Washington refused to set
technical standards for airborne containers. In 1988, Congress approved
shipments of plutonium only if they travelled by sea, with an armed escort -
which the US refused to provide.
Sending the Japanese navy around the world would, however, alarm
neighbouring countries and outrage opinion at home. The government decided
it would be unconstitutional, anyway, and gave the job instead to the
Maritime Safety Agency, a coastguard force. It also spent Y20bn on a new
ship, the 6,500-tonne Shikishima. (Ironically, after deciding to build the
Shikishima, the government sent minesweepers to the Gulf).
Ferrying the plutonium is the job of Pacific Nuclear Transport, a company
owned by British Nuclear Fuels and Japanese investors. PNT has five ships
which take spent fuel from Japan to Europe. One of these, the Pacific Crane,
recently was modified to strengthen its cargo hold and Greenpeace, the
environmentalist group, believes this will be the plutonium-carrier.
The question remains: what to do with the plutonium cargoes? Japan already
has enough in stock to start up Monju but, even if the breeder performs
flawlessly, it will be a long way from a commercial plant. Tokyo hopes that
private industry will pay for the next step, a 'demonstration' fast breeder.
The government persuaded the country's nine private electrical utilities to
spend 20 per cent of Monju's Y600bn cost but they have shown little
enthusiasm for funding further work. All this means that fast-breeders will
not contribute significantly to the Japanese electrical grid for at least
another 40 years.
Last August, Tokyo admitted this by announcing a shift in priorities. It
would still bring home its plutonium, but as fuel for ordinary
pressurised-water and boiling-water reactors. The Atomic Energy Commission
says such a policy 'contributes to the preservation of uranium resources and
reduces the environmental effects caused by energy consumption.' The
government intends two light-water reactors to be loaded in the mid-1990s
with fuel containing a mixture of plutonium and uranium. It wants private
industry to take on the task of making the mixed-oxide (Mox) fuel rods.
Takagi says this is unrealistic: plutonium adds to the difficulty of
handling fuel and disposing of waste while Mox is far more expensive than
ordinary enriched uranium. The utilities share this scepticism. The switch
involves operational changes which might jeopardise their exemplary record
of exposing workers to as little radiation as possible. Joining the
plutonium cycle would also make commercial nuclear power stations subject to
the scrutiny of the International Atomic Energy Authority. Power companies
fear that regular visits by foreign inspectors to check fuel-handling would
alarm rather than reassure the public.
Several observers are adding-up the figures of Japan's accumulation and
consumption of plutonium and, predictably, people opposed to nuclear energy
produce the most alarming findings. But one informed analysis is by
Tatsujiro Suzuki, a Japanese nuclear engineer at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's Center for Energy Policy. Suzuki estimates that, by 2010,
Japan will have between 80 and 90 tonnes of fissile plutonium: 30 tonnes
from Europe, six tonnes from an experimental processing plant near Tokyo,
and 50 tonnes from Rokkasho. Over that time, the highest possible
consumption will be 40 tonnes. The Atomic Energy Commission says demand will
be 80 tonnes but the Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre says it will be
only 23.
Japan's quest for the plutonium economy appears expensive and damaging to
its international image. It is also a gift to opponents of nuclear power.
But many Japanese find such concerns trivial compared with the uncertainty
caused by dependency on imported energy.
Tetsuo Kobori, deputy directory of the Monju construction project,
articulates a widespread fear: 'By the year 2010 or 2015, we will have big
international competition, maybe war, over energy. In order to keep peace on
earth, we need to develop new energy resources.' The fast breeder, he
argues, is the only technology on the horizon capable of assuring a
virtually inexhaustible and concentrated supply of power.
Such concerns are fading in a generation that has known nothing but
prosperity. 'Young people here have no sense about energy security, they are
just enjoying daily life,' Kobori says. Greenpeace Japan, which claims 400
supporters in a population of 120m, also complains about youthful apathy.
While there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Kobori and his
colleagues, anxieties must remain that Japan's enthusiasm for plutonium
might at some later date develop into a capacity to build nuclear bombs.
Officially, Japan pledges never to build nuclear weapons, never to allow
them into its territory, and never to contribute to their development.
Adherence to two of these principles has eroded, though. US ships armed with
nuclear warheads visit Japanese ports routinely, although their captains
maintain a diplomatic fiction by refusing to confirm or deny they are
carrying nuclear weapons. And, until 1987, the reprocessing plant at
Sellafield mixed stocks of plutonium from civil and military contracts;
plutonium originating in Japanese reactors has ended up in British or US
warheads.
Japan has a better claim than most nations to be a responsible nuclear
superpower. Thanks to the legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the idea of
building a nuclear deterrent never enters Japan's political agenda. Regular
public-opinion surveys on national defence do not even raise the question.
If Japan were to move towards the bomb, the important first step -
accumulation of a large stockpile of plutonium and advanced rockets - would
have happened without any public debate on the issue.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Slump in sales drives Porsche down market

PORSCHE, the German sports car manufacturer whose vehicles have become
symbolic of conspicuous consumption, is going down market to cope with the
economic squeeze.
A series of cheaper cars, selling below the current Porsche price range, is
to be introduced in an attempt to break into a more modest customer market,
the company announced last night.
At the same time the Stuttgart-based manufacturer is to put 4,000 workers on
short time, following a slump in 1991 sales to 26,200 - 4,000 fewer than in
1990, and little more than half the 50,000 vehicles sold in its golden year
of 1986.
Porsche said its alternative plan to introduce a 'two-plus-two' larger
sports car to complement its two-seater range was being put on ice until the
market picked up.
'This change in direction of model policy is a reaction to the changed
consumer behaviour in the highest price and market sectors,' a sober company
statement said. 'Sharper competition has forced Porsche to examine its work
structure with the aim of making lasting economies.'
On Wednesday, Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive of Porsche, revealed a drop in
net profits to DM17.1m (Pounds 5.9m) to the end of July, from DM57m in the
previous year. He forecast production this year would fall to 25,000 cars,
with no improvement in profits.
The real collapse in the Porsche market has been in the US, where five years
ago 68 per cent of its output was sold. That is now running at just 4,400
cars a year, or 23 per cent of production, with the situation aggravated by
the dollar's weakness against the D-Mark.
Porsche gave no clue last night how its new model would look. But the
official statement said that it would be 'on a technically different basis'
to the present models.
As for the substantial research and development work done on the originally
intended 'two-plus-two', the whole series will benefit from the innovations,
Porsche said.
The suffering of the luxury sports car company coincides with figures
revealing 1991 as the all-time boom year for the German motor industry,
thanks to demand from what was East Germany.
Sales of new cars hit 4.16m for the whole of united Germany, registering a
12.8 per cent increase in the west alone to 3.43m, a record for the second
successive year.
Lotus, General Motors' troubled UK sports car subsidiary, is to shed a
further 70 jobs, bringing the total lost since the middle of last year to
370, or more than 40 per cent of the workforce.
Lotus said Lotus Engineering and Millbrook Proving ground, its research and
development and consultancy engineering subsidiaries, were unaffected.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Steetley's share price declines on fears of MMC
investigation

THE SHARE price of Steetley, the British building materials group, yesterday
fell 37p to 332p on fears that a hostile Pounds 600m takeover offer from
Redland might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The fall occurred after Mr Peter Lilley, Britain's trade and industry
secretary, sought permission from the European Commission to allow UK
authorities to consider the monopoly implications of a rival plan to merge
Steetley's brick, clay roof-tile and concrete products businesses with those
of Tarmac, another large British building materials group.
It is the first time the UK government has made such a request under EC
merger regulations which came into force in September 1990. Mr Lilley told
the EC the Steetley/Tarmac joint venture raised competition issues in the UK
brick and clay roof-tile markets.
Mr Andrew Melrose, London construction analyst for Nomura, the Japanese
securities house, said last night: 'Clearly Mr Lilley is concerned about
monopoly considerations in these markets and it seems unlikely that he would
not regard the Redland bid in a similar light.'
The share price of Redland, which also has UK brick and clay tiles
interests, yesterday fell 5p to 465p, and Tarmac fell 5p to 118p. It was the
announcement in December of the Steetley/Tarmac joint venture which prompted
Redland to announce its bid.
The EC's merger control task force is already looking at the Tarmac joint
venture, which fell automatically under its jurisdiction because of the size
of the two companies. Redland's bid for Steetley, because the combined
turnover of the two companies is smaller, is not being examined.
Under EC merger regulations, a national takeover authority can ask Brussels
for the right to examine a deal itself if it believes the merger affects a
'distinct market' within the member state.
The Commission can override that request, as has already happened in the
case of a merger between two German battery manufacturers.
The UK Office of Fair Trading is currently considering whether to refer the
Redland bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A reference would mean
that the bid would lapse while an inquiry was carried out. This could take
several months.
Steetley told its shareholders this week that the joint venture with Tarmac,
to be called Allied Building Materials, would control 17 per cent of the
British brick market and 13 per cent of the clay tile market.
Redland has said that its takeover of Steetley would leave it with 16 per
cent of the brick market and 60 per cent of the clay roof tile market. It
has indicated to the Office of Fair Trading that it would be prepared to
reduce its market share in the clay tile market.

<TEXT>
MR Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, will meet Mr Gerald
Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, late next month
to discuss international financial issues, including the stability of the
financial systems in the US and Japan.
The meeting, which the New York Fed said would be held at its Manhattan
offices on February 20 or 21, comes amid widespread anxiety about the health
of banks, sharp falls in prices in worldwide property markets and the
weakness of the Japanese stock market.
The New York Fed has responsibility in the US Fed system for relations with
foreign central banks and is the institution that holds Dollars 260bn
(Pounds 145.6bn) of US Treasury securities for foreign central bank and
monetary authorities.
The two central bankers and their deputies are expected to discuss ways to
prevent failure of an institution in one country triggering the collapse of
markets and banks elsewhere in the world and endangering the whole financial
system.
Possible counter-measures include exchanging information on troubled
institutions, improving the foreign exchange settlement procedures in Japan
and New York and greater co-ordination between the US and Japanese monetary
authorities.
The Bank of Japan confirmed that it had received an invitation for the
meeting at the New York Fed.
A Bank of Japan official said that, given the state of the international
financial markets, it would 'not be surprising' if financial stability was
on the agenda.
But he said the exact timing, attendance list, and programme of any meeting
had yet to be decided.
The Japanese press has said the measures for countering financial
instability would include extending the trading hours of the Tokyo foreign
currency markets in the evening and of the New York markets in the morning
so that yen-US dollar currency trades could be settled at the same time.
This would help banks avoid holding positions unnecessarily after the
markets had closed.
In Washington, a spokesman for Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, said a meeting between Mr Greenspan and Mr Mieno about the
same time 'is not now on our agenda' although the two men will meet in
Garden City, New York, at today's meeting of finance ministers of the Group
of Seven leading industrial nations.
Mr Corrigan, who is chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision,
may also discuss with Mr Mieno ways of tightening international bank
regulation in the wake of the scandal over the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
An internal paper on the subject was recently completed and is expected to
be a topic of forthcoming monthly meetings at the Bank for International
Settlements in Basle.

Wall Street
US STOCK markets clawed back some of their recent losses yesterday, but
investors remained hesitant to commit more funds to the market and the
dominant influence on sentiment remained fourth quarter corporate results,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.04 at 3,232.78. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly firmer, up 0.52
at 415.48, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks gained 1.82
to 624.68. NYSE turnover was 214m shares and rises outpaced declines by 899
to 796.
Oils featured among individual stocks, Exxon rising Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
60 1/4 on news of a fourth quarter profit of Dollars 1.12bn, which boosted
full-year earnings to Dollars 5.6bn, the highest in the company's history.
The figures were particularly impressive considering the decline in oil
prices in 1991.
Chevron also unveiled fourth quarter figures, the stock easing Dollars 1/2
to Dollars 66 1/4 on news of a modest final three-month profit of Dollars
39m, which included a Dollars 244m charge to cover workforce reduction and
operational changes. Over the year, Chevron made a profit of Dollars 1.29bn.
Dow Jones jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 30 3/8 , a new 52-week high, after
analysts at two big broking houses, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley,
recommended the stock to clients, citing improved business trends and the
relatively low valuation of the shares. The newspaper and newswire publisher
reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings on Thursday.
Kimberly-Clark rose Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 49 7/8 after the opening was
delayed due to an order imbalance on the buy side. Buyers were attracted to
the stock by the company's strong fourth quarter earnings and by a
recommendation from Bear Stearns, the securities house.
Orion Pictures, the troubled Hollywood film company, jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 3 7/8 on speculation that Turner Broadcasting might make a bid.
Orion, which is operating under the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, has
already received a bid from New Line Corp.
Burlington Northern fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 despite a forecast from
the company that its 1992 earnings should be substantially better than the
1991 pre-tax operating income of Dollars 469m.
Delta Woodside fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/8 after Merrill Lynch
lowered its profits forecast for the company and cut its long-term rating on
the stock from 'buy' to 'above average'.
On the over-the-counter market, Adaptec rose Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 27 5/8
after reporting fiscal third quarter net income of 35 cents a share, well up
on a year ago. Cirrus Logic was also boosted by good quarterly earnings, the
stock adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 19 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO prices closed little changed in moderate trading. ccording to
preliminary data, the composite index gained 6.22 points, or 0.17 per cent
to close at 3630.75. Advances led declines 357 to 277 on volume of 27.996m
shares valued at CDollars 329.8m.
Ten of 14 stock groups gained ground, led by pipelines, up 1.1 per cent.
Consumer products, energy and industrial products also closed higher.
The transportation group had the day's biggest decline, off 1.0 per cent.
Financial services also closed lower. The mining and gold groups finished
steady.
Petro-Canada lost  1/4 to 10 1/2 . The company said it would take a CDollars
369m charge against fourth-quarter earnings for costs related to a
rationalization of its products division.

<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
reported continuing losses for the fourth quarter and its second consecutive
annual net loss, but said it expects to return to profitability this year.
TI said 1991 was one of the most difficult years in its history. Charges
taken for cost cuts, lower semiconductor prices and start-up expenses for
new semiconductor manufacturing facilities were the primary causes of TI's
increased losses.
Fourth-quarter net revenue was flat at Dollars 1.75bn, compared with Dollars
1.76bn in the same period of 1990. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars
85m or Dollars 1.18 a share, against net losses of Dollars 56m or 80 cents
in 1990.
The figures include a charge of Dollars 55m for job cuts and the closure of
older semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The charges cover a planned
workforce reduction of 1,000 in addition to earlier cuts.
Net revenues for the year were Dollars 6.8bn, up from Dollars 6.6bn in 1990.
Net losses for the year were Dollars 409m, or Dollars 5.40 a share,
following losses of Dollars 39m or 92 cents a share in 1990.
The company took charges totalling Dollars 240m during the year as it phased
out older, unprofitable semiconductor plants and reduced its workforce. The
cuts will result in annual cost savings of Dollars 220m, TI said.
'We are planning to return TI to profitability in 1992 through cost
reductions, business process and productivity improvements, and emphasis on
new products,' said Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman and chief executive. Capital
spending will be reduced to about Dollars 425m, from Dollars 504m in 1991
and Dollars 909m in 1990, the company added.

FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Upjohn sues BBC and S. Express
on Halcion allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the US drugs company, and its UK subsidiary, Upjohn Ltd, yesterday
served a series of writs for libel following allegations about the safety of
its sleeping pill Halcion.
Upjohn has served writs against the BBC - which broadcast a programme called
'The Halcion Nightmare' - and the programme's presenter, Mr Tom Mangold.
A second action has been started against the Sunday Express, Miss Eve
Pollard, the newspaper's editor, and Mr Neville Hodgkinson who wrote an
article about Halcion and its possible side-effects on October 6 1991.
A final action is being started against Dr Ian Oswald, a retired Scottish
professor, who, the company claims, made allegations against Upjohn in an
article published in the New York Times. The company said it had no
intention at present of taking action against the New York Times.
Dr Oswald, who was professor of psychiatry at Edinburgh university for seven
years, claimed in a letter to The Lancet this month that Upjohn had not
disclosed all of the side-effects of Halcion when it had applied to the US
Food and Drug Administration for the drug to be licenced.
Dr Oswald is due to speak next month at a public hearing in Berlin at the
German health ministry to discuss the safety of Halcion. The drug was banned
in the UK last October. The French and Spanish authorities have since
forbidden sales of Halcion in doses more than 0.125mg.
Upjohn said it was not prepared to allow allegations attacking the company's
integrity to be published without challenge. It had instructed its
solicitors, Peter Carter-Ruck &amp; Partners, to proceed vigorously to trial to
enable the company to clear its name.
Mr Mangold said last night that as far as he was aware Upjohn had not been
in contact with the BBC from the date of transmission or made any complaint.
The company had, however, walked out of an interview with the BBC when the
programme was being made, he claimed.
Mr Mangold said that the purpose of the programme was to look at a possible
relationship between Halcion and very serious mental illness, suicide and
even murders in the US. The programme also looked at how the drug was
marketed and how Upjohn dealt with complaints.

<TEXT>
MR Laurence Tisch, the US businessman whose interests range from the CBS
media group to insurance and property, last night abandoned plans to acquire
a controlling interest in R. H. Macy, the ailing New York-based retailer -
less than 12 hours after it emerged that he might be riding to the rescue of
the heavily-indebted company.
Loews Corporation, one of Mr Tisch's companies, was reported as saying an
unamed 'major Macy creditor' had rejected the acquisition terms.
Throughout the day, neither Mr Tisch's office, nor Macy itself would comment
on the situation although Macy junk bonds surged on the speculation. In
absence of any firm news, traders were left to speculate on the shape of the
Tisch package and its chances of success. 'It all depends on the board, and
getting bondholders to agree,' commented one at lunchtime.
Mr Tisch is a member of Macy's colourful and prestigious board - which
includes the likes of Henry Kissinger and Mr Alfred Taubman, owner of
Sotheby's - and already held a 15 per cent stake in the retail group. Under
the proposed recapitalisation plan, it was rumoured that Mr Tisch's
interests would have invested heavily - perhaps to the tune of Dollars 1bn -
and taken a controlling stake in Macy. As well as shareholders, certain
debt-holders would have been bought out at well below par value. Macy has
three junk bond issues, with a total face value of Dollars 1.3bn.
In the face of the Tisch withdrawal, there remains pressure on Macy and
further decisions over its future may be made over the weekend.
Earlier this month, Macy delayed payments to trade suppliers, in the hope of
meeting certain 'clean down' provisions attached to a Dollars 587.7m
revolving credit facility. These demanded that Macy cut borrowings under the
facility to Dollars 150m for 30 days between mid-December and mid-February
and to Dollars 75m for seven consecutive days in that period.
When it announced the delay, Macy said it intended to resume payments to its
suppliers on January 25, once it was able to draw down funds under the
facility. But there have been more recent suggestions that Macy and its
banking group - led by Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust - were still in
negotiations.
Macy, believed to have about Dollars 3.7bn of long-term debt, lost Dollars
155m in the three months to early November.

A 10-day deadline has been set for the rescue of La Cinq, the collapsed
French television station which earlier this month filed for bankruptcy.
Mr Hubert Lafont, who, as administrator of La Cinq, is trying to facilitate
a rescue, yesterday announced that all potential rescue bids must be
submitted by 6pm on Monday, February 3.
So far the only potential rescuer to have stepped forward is Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul who is one of the largest shareholders
in La Cinq with 25 per cent.
However, it is not certain that a plan spearheaded by Mr Berlusconi, a
controversial figure whose Italian TV channels are notorious for showing
soft pornography, would be acceptable to the French government.
Mr Angelo Codigoni, who represents Mr Berlusconi's French interests,
yesterday afternoon met with the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, which
regulates French television. The Berlusconi proposals are also being
assessed by Hachette, the French media group which owns 25 per cent of La
Cinq and ran the station before its collapse.

CHESEBROUGH-POND'S, the US consumer products arm of Unilever is
'streamlining' its product line and planning a reduction of up to 10 per
cent in its workforce.
The rationalisation will result in a fourth quarter charge of about Dollars
35m, (Pounds 19m) against operating profits.
On the product side, Unilever said that the emphasis would on reducing the
number of product sizes, rather than cutting out particular product lines.
It said that this was still under review, and declined to give specific
example.
On the employment front, Connecticut-based Chesebrough could shed up to ten
per cent of its workforce, currently put at about 3,400.
The first step in this process would involve a voluntary early retirement
programme. Unilever said that the rationale for streamlining was economic -
a desire to keep costs as low as possible.
Chesebrough products include Pond's cold cream and Vaseline skin care
products, to the Brut brand of men's toiletries and Close-up toothpaste.

RECKITT &amp; COLMAN, the food and household products group, plans to get out of
the highly-competitive spice market in North America through disposals worth
Dollars 88m (Pounds 49m).
The group has agreed to sell its US-based Durkee-French spice and seasoning
business for Dollars 80m in cash to Burns Philp Food, a subsidiary of the
Australian food and hardware group, Burns Philp. Reckitt will also sell its
Canadian spice business to Burns Philp for Dollars 8m.
US supermarkets have in recent years seen a price war between Durkee-French
and the Schwartz brand, which belongs to McCormick, the US group which is
the world's largest supplier of spices.
Reckitt said it was happy to be leaving what had become a low-margin,
commodity of type business. The disposals were part of its strategy of
concentrating on its higher-margin, branded consumer franchises.
The group would retain a strong portfolio of brands such as French's
Mustard, RedHot Sauce, French Fried Onions and Cattlemen's Barbecue Sauces.
Proceeds of the disposals, which are subject to regulatory consents, will be
used to reduce Reckitt's indebtedness. Net debt currently stands at about
Pounds 358m, giving gearing of 55 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Putting on the Ritz: A US presence in the UK video rental
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, NIKKI TAIT and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The takeover of Cityvision of the UK by Florida-based Blockbuster looks, on
the face of it, like good news for the 15.6m British households which own
video cassette recorders.
Blockbuster, the leading US video rental chain, boasts of a wider selection,
longer opening hours and more sophisticated computer systems than its
competitors. It says it will use the expertise gathered in expanding from a
couple of dozen outlets five years ago to more than 2,000 today to transform
Cityvision's Ritz chain, the largest in the UK.
The Blockbuster takeover was opposed, however, by dissident Cityvision
shareholders who claimed that the Pounds 75m takeover, launched last
November, undervalued the company. The objectors were defeated last Thursday
when Blockbuster said it held 50.21 per cent of Cityvision's shares.
Other questions can be raised about the Blockbuster takeover. One is that it
is buying into a declining sector. After growing from Pounds 50m in 1981 to
Pounds 569m in 1989, the video rental market in the UK fell to Pounds 564m
in 1990 and Pounds 544m last year. At the same time, the value of video
tapes sold in the UK has increased steadily from Pounds 15m in 1986 to
Pounds 375m last year.
An additional question relates to Blockbuster itself. To describe the
company as controversial is an understatement. For much of its six-year
history, its shares have oscillated widely. Over the past 12 months, they
have been as high as Dollars 15 1/8 , as low at Dollars 7 7/8 , and now
stand at about Dollars 13.
Blockbuster seems to have all the trappings of a success story. Until the
mid-1980s, it was called Cook Data Services and provided software services
to the oil and gas industry. In 1985, faced with the energy industry slump,
the company switched to video rental. In early 1987, Mr Wayne Huizenga
became chairman and chief executive, positions he still holds, along with a
near-12 per cent stake.
Blockbuster's rapid growth followed Mr Huizenga's arrival. Even before the
Cityvision deal, the company's geographical spread was considerable, with
outlets in Puerto Rico, Canada, Guam and the UK. Spurred by this heady
expansion, after-tax profits have soared from Dollars 3.2m in 1987 to
Dollars 93.7m in 1991. Earnings per share have more than quadrupled over
four years, to reach 56 cents in the last 12 months.
So what is the problem? The first is Mr Huizenga himself. The stocky
businessman, in his early 50s and of Dutch descent, is better-known as a
co-founder of Waste Management, a large US waste disposal group.
Despite its number one industry ranking, Waste Management's 23-year-history
has been a chequered one. It has paid fines after charges of price-fixing.
In 1976, Huizenga signed a consent decree (without admitting guilt) on
charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company made
improper political contributions in Florida.
A rather different concern has centred on Blockbuster and the quality of its
profits, in particular whether its depreciation charges are too low. In the
company's accounts, the videocassette rental stock is recorded at cost, and
then written off over its economic life. The faster the write-off, the
higher the amortisation charge, and the bigger the dent in profits.
In its early days, Blockbuster generally wrote its stock off over three
years. This sparked criticism from analysts that the stock should be written
off more quickly. So, from 1990 onwards, the company switched to writing off
a certain number of 'hits' - new release feature film videos, bought in
large numbers - over 12 months. Some critics are still not satisfied, and
would like an even more conservative stance. The figures are material; in
1990, for example, the amortisation charge for the rental stock was Dollars
91.7m.
The third question is whether the group is basically driven by expansion
alone, or whether it is an effective retailer. Blockbuster's supporters
argue that there has been a good deal of progress on the latter score
lately, partly thanks to the arrival of Mr Joseph Baczko, a former head of
Toys R Us International, as chief operating officer a year ago.
Mr Norman Abbott, director general of the British Videogram Association,
says there is plenty of scope for Blockbuster to improve the management of
the UK rental industry. He estimates that the UK has 6,000 to 7,000 outlets
dedicated wholly to video rental, in addition to the many newsagents and
other retailers who rent out tapes as a sideline. Although some video stores
are well run, many are not.
'There are still a lot of amateurs in video rental. People came into the
business in the early days with no experience of retailing - redundant lorry
drivers, redundant steelworkers, redundant white collar executives,' he
says.
Although Mr Abbott excludes the Ritz chain from his criticisms, Cityvision's
dissident shareholders charged that the Ritz shops were so badly staffed
that they had to close during peak hours to allow the manager to use the
toilet or to catch up on paperwork.
The dissidents also produced photographs of video shops owned by Cityvision
which still carried the logo of the previous owner, despite having been
bought many months earlier. Mr Abbott says video rental has been hit by the
recession, but he believes the arrival of satellite television has eaten
into the market as well.
He does not believe the sale of pre-recorded videos - what the industry
calls 'sell-through' - affects the rental business directly. Many of the
tapes sold are cookery or fitness cassettes or are bought as gifts. But the
sellers of videos - retailers such as Woolworths and WH Smith - do advertise
their products, something which the rental industry has failed to do.
Mr Steven Berrard, Blockbuster's vice-chairman and chief financial officer,
says an increase in advertising will be one of the US company's priorities
in the UK. 'The thing to do first is energise the industry a bit. Part of
the problem with the rental industry in the UK is that it lacks oxygen.' He
plans to widen the range of films available in Ritz outlets and get rid of
the titles which are not being rented.
Mr Berrard does not deny that the UK rental market has been damaged by
satellite television.
'The numbers probably speak for themselves. The recession and competition
have hit the business. The operators have cut back on what they buy and the
customers have become even more frustrated. I think we have to turn that
round a little bit. To rent a video is still the cheapest form of
entertainment.'

FT  25 JAN 92 / Bout of election madness: The controlled panic at
Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tension eased momentarily at the glittering Foreign Office party on
Wednesday evening. Mr John Major moved cheerily between ambassadors,
Whitehall mandarins and journalists. Privately, the prime minister was
fretting: he was worried about his appearance on Desert Island Discs - the
BBC radio programme which had chosen him to celebrate its 50th anniversary
tomorrow.
But the gentle hum of Whitehall small-talk and political gossip offered only
the briefest of respites from the controlled panic which has gripped the
nation's politicians.
The rest of the week saw Westminster engulfed in the most intensive - and
frequently farcical - election campaigning that MPs could recall. No matter
that, even if Mr Major trusts his instincts and opts for April 9, the
campaign proper was still nearly two months off.
A slightly sheepish minister offered eloquent testimony to the atmosphere.
Glumly contemplating a dawn television appearance he confessed: 'I haven't
attacked Neil Kinnock for at least an hour - another black mark, I suppose,
from (Conservative) central office.'
The tone had been set earlier by Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party
chairman, at one of the daily press conferences from which the politicians
now daily hurl vollies of abuse.
Launching (or was it relaunching?) his party's tax offensive, Mr Patten
handed out cardboard slide-rules so that journalists could compute the
personal cost of a Labour victory.
Mr Kinnock's elegantly-named 'tax bombshell' would rob anyone on Pounds
25,000 a year of more than Pounds 2,000 in extra tax. It seemed churlish to
suggest the arithmetic would not meet the national curriculum standards for
seven year-olds.
The black-painted bomb was the symbol of the week, the centrepiece of a
chilling party political broadcast which in less permissive times would have
attracted an X-certificate. Only the Daily Mirror (the figures were 'lies')
and the Daily Telegraph (the Conservatives wanted too big a discount)
refused to carry the accompanying newspaper advertisements.
Mr Patten is one of the more cerebral of our politicians, suspected still of
distinctly leftish tendencies. But his job now is to destroy the Labour
party. And with the help of Saatchi and Saatchi, the advertising firm, he is
setting about it with a boyish enthusiasm that owes nothing to his
intellectual capabilities.
In between press conferences and television appearances Mr Patten was
slamming Labour-controlled Camden council for not cleaning its streets or
reminding waverers that Labour had shamed Britain 25 years ago by selling
off the gold it held in trust for the Baltic states.
At his side an earnest official clutching the party's secret war plan evoked
images of the aide who trails behind the US president with the country's
nuclear codes.
There was no monopoly on hyperbole. If the Conservatives' tax offensive
often drowned out Labour's message, Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign
manager, was never short of his own dubious statistics.
Mr Patten claimed that the Labour party was set on a Pounds 37bn spending
spree. Mr Cunningham produced figures showing the Conservatives had wasted
up to Pounds 30bn by underpricing the sale of state assets.
There were no free slide-rules to check the sums, but instead wooden spoons
for Conservative councils across the country which had also squandered
taxpayers' money.
As the Daily Mirror lambasted the Conservatives and the Tory tabloids
embellished further Mr Patten's press releases, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's
deputy leader, waged a personal war against Sir David English, the editor of
the Daily Mail.
Mr Hattersley, alluding to the 'slugs and worms' who inhabit the garden of a
free society, repeatedly challenged Sir David to a televised debate on
whether he should give a modest slice of his large salary to pay for higher
pensions and child benefit.
Sir David demurred. His tribulations were nothing compared with those of
television journalists attempting to produce balanced reports. After every
news bulletin telephone lines crackled with complaints.
Labour charged that Tory 'lies' dominated the air waves, the Conservatives
that news bulletins occasionally featured an opposition press conference.
The Liberal Democrats demanded they too be allocated 30 seconds or so to
abuse the others.
The madness infected the House of Commons, forcing the Speaker to remind MPs
that their behaviour risked descending to the level of the kindergarten.
Discussion among ministers about Budget options became surreal. One lamented
that the case for 1p off the basic rate of tax had become almost
respectable. Perhaps now he would press the case for a 2p cut. When told
that the Treasury's economists worried about the size of the borrowing
requirement, a colleague suggested 'they should keep their noses out of
politics'.
We are promised some respite. Next week Mr Major is launching a new phase in
his Citizen's Charter. Mr Patten has promised some positive campaigning to
emphasise the Conservatives' commitment to public services. Labour, keen to
move from the back foot, might not feel so obliging.
Either way the outlook is grim. Mr Kinnock's conversion to the market and Mr
Major's retreat from Thatcherism have greatly narrowed the gulf between
their parties. But in personal terms the stakes are as high as they have
been at any election. We can expect more lies, damned lies and politics.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starter motor: Nissan's assembly plant in Sunderland is to be the sole
producer in Europe for its new range of Micra cars, which was announced
yesterday in Tokyo, Kevin Done and Steven Butler write.
Production of the new-generation Nissan Micra, (pictured above) sold as the
Nissan March in Japan, is expected to begin in the UK in the summer. Nissan
is spending Pounds 150m on expanding the plant to produce the car, taking
its investment in the site to Pounds 850m.
The car is expected to go on sale in Europe in the late autumn.
The Sunderland plant will become the sole production source for Micras to be
sold in Europe and will replace exports from Japan of the existing Micra.
Nissan is planning to build 35,000 new-generation Micras at Sunderland this
year, with output rising to 130,000 next year.
The new Micra will be added to the existing output of the Nissan Primera
family car. Total output is planned to rise to 175,000 this year and 270,000
next year.
The launch of the UK-built Micra will form part of Nissan's efforts to
penetrate the southern European markets of Spain, Italy and France, which
traditionally have been dominated by small cars.

<TEXT>
HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society, confirmed yesterday that it is
to impose charges on February 1 on customers with low balances in their
savings accounts, but said its decision was fair to most of its customers.
The society, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 593m last year, said its
margin on interest earned from mortgage-lending and interest paid to its
3.6m savers was being squeezed.
Customers with balances of less than Pounds 250 can have two free
withdrawals a month, but will have to pay 60p for further cash withdrawals
and Pounds 1 for cheques.
People with balances of less than Pounds 50 for 30 days or more in each
quarter will also have to pay a quarterly charge of Pounds 2.50. Account
holders aged 21 or below are exempt.
Halifax said low-balance savings accounts used frequently were run at a
loss.
Abbey National, one of Halifax's main rivals, said it had no plans to make a
similar move.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Peps help recovery in unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POPULARITY of Personal Equity Plans (Peps) helped unit-trust sales
recover last year after a disappointing 1990.
Net investment in unit-trust Peps was Pounds 652.2m last year, contributing
about a quarter of the industry's net investment for the year. Investments
in a Pep are free of income tax and capital gains tax.
Further encouragement was that the industry was attracting retail, rather
than institutional, investors. Net direct investment by individuals in the
first three quarters of last year was Pounds 1.73bn, compared with Pounds
757m by institutions.
The recovery of unit-trust investment last year was helped by the strong
stock market. Yet the industry's overall net investment figure for the year
of Pounds 2.77bn, while up on the Pounds 392m recorded in 1990, was well
down on the Pounds 8.2bn in the peak year of 1987. At the end of the year,
the value of funds under management was Pounds 55.1bn, up from the Pounds
46.3bn reached at the end of 1990 but down from the peak of Pounds 58.2bn at
the end of 1989.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Civil servants to hold one-day strike in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN two thirds of London's civil servants have been ordered by their
unions to strike next Friday in 24-hour stoppages that may close government
buildings including libraries and galleries.
Members of the CPSA and NUCPS Civil Service unions working in the capital
have voted to authorise the strikes in protest against the government's
refusal to raise London weighting in each of the past three years.
The action by up to 45,000 civil servants will affect Jobcentres and the
passport office and may cause difficulties at airport Customs operations.
Union leaders said workers at the Tate Gallery, the Natural History Museum,
the British Museum, the British Library, the Equal Opportunities Commission
and the Commonwealth Institute would be asked to strike, forcing some
institutions to close.
Members of the other Civil Service unions, which have higher-paid and more
senior members, are expected to work normally. Members of the Inland Revenue
Staff Federation voted against a strike.
In the NUCPS ballot 3,867 voted for a strike and 2,770 against. The CPSA
vote was 4,579 to 3,113. The turnouts were 30 per cent and 33 per cent
respectively.
The Treasury stopped increasing London weighting allowances after 1988,
targeting resources instead on increasing basic pay for some London staff
and introducing local pay additions for workers who are hard to recruit and
retain.
The unions are angry because some workers have not received local pay
additions or basic-pay rises for working in London. Some, including support
grades in the NUCPS, have received neither.
Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, said that in some cases London
weighting of Pounds 1,750 for central London amounted to 25 per cent of
salary.
The unions are claiming a central London allowance of Pounds 2,155, Pounds
1,230 for five to 10 miles (the current allowance is Pounds 1,000) and
Pounds 925 for 10 to 18 miles (Pounds 725).

CONSUMERS who want to improve their credit history risk committing fraud if
they give false information to get their records upgraded, Sir Gordon
Borrie, director-general of fair trading, warned yesterday. He said that
consumers should beware of advertisements by 'credit repair' companies.
They offer guidance on making a successful credit application and help in
removing unfavourable credit history information from credit
reference-agency records.
'Consumers who have been refused credit should think twice before paying any
fee to these companies,' Sir Gordon said.
He added that booklets telling consumers how to make successful credit
applications by giving answers that score the most points may be either
misleading or incorrect.
Consumers whose applications for credit are rejected have the right to be
given the names of any credit-reference agencies consulted by a lender and
to obtain copies of any information held about them by the agencies. They
can have their files corrected if the information is wrong.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Irregularities in Gulf troop charters suspected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE

<TEXT>
AN investigation is under way into suspected irregularities in the shipping
of British troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf campaign, it
was disclosed last night.
The Ministry of Defence said documents were seized last month from premises
in London and the south-east by MoD police officers.
The documents related to the chartering of ships for Operation Granby - the
British contribution to forces in the Gulf.
The UK relied on vessels chartered on the commercial market to move its
armoured division with equipment, ammunition and spares. Almost all the
ships were non-British flag vessels.
The MoD said inquiries were continuing, but would not comment on the scale
of the alleged irregularities.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Navy job cuts and closures attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS and Labour politicians yesterday attacked closures and cuts at
Royal Navy support facilities involving 2,500 civilian jobs.
South-west Wales will be seriously affected. The Trecwn armaments depot near
Fishguard is to close with the loss of 500 jobs and the ending of jet pilot
training at Brawdy near Haverfordwest will mean 80 civilian redundancies.
However, overall job losses in naval support have been reduced by more than
300 compared with plans announced last July and discussed with unions. The
jobs saved are at the Rosyth base on the Firth of Forth - where 800
employees are still due to go - and at a stores depot at Copenacre in
Wiltshire. The latter will not now be closed, but 550 jobs are to be cut.
The navy will go ahead with shedding 380 jobs at the Ernesettle armaments
depot near Plymouth and closing the naval air station HMS Daedalus at
Lee-on-Solent, employing 200 people.
The MoD said the cuts should save Pounds 300m over 10 years. It hoped staff
would transfer to other areas, but some redundancies would be unavoidable.
Mr Tom King, defence secretary, accused opposition parties of 'a blatant
attempt at gross deceit' in pretending their proposals would be less harsh.
Mr Allan Rogers, a Labour defence spokesman, said the measures would be
'absolutely devastating' for south-west Wales. He dismissed charges that
cuts would be worse under Labour as 'another Tory lie'.
The Ministry of Defence is to assist the Welsh Office in setting up a 'task
force' to study possibilities for new industries. Mr David Hunt, Welsh
secretary, announced Pounds 2.2m in emergency short-term aid for rural west
Wales. About Pounds 40m is to be spent at RAF St Athan, near Cardiff, which
is due to take on maintenance work from other RAF stations.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Stores weigh benefits of Sunday trading: The virtues and
vices of seven-day opening for the grocery trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE row about the virtues or vices of Sunday trading starts to abate, the
grocery trade is beginning to assess whether the profits from seven-day
trading outweigh its difficulties. The equation is a complicated one; the
early conclusions mixed.
At one level Sunday opening has proved a conspicuous success. Many shoppers
clearly appreciated the opportunity to buy food on Sundays in the run-up to
Christmas. J. Sainsbury, for example, was forced temporarily to shut its
doors at some stores because of the deluge of consumer demand. But it would
be misleading to draw sweeping conclusions from this atypical trading
period.
While it may have been profitable for stores to trade on Sundays in
December, it may not pay them to do so in the slow trading months early in
the new year.
Budgens, the neighbourhood grocery chain which was one of the first food
retailers to open on Sundays, announced this week that it would scale down
its experiment with seven-day trading because of the extra costs and
intensified competition.
Another indication of the trend is that many of the bigger grocery chains
have reduced the number of stores they open. For example, the Safeway chain
opened 229 of its 264 outlets in England and Wales in the run-up to
Christmas but has since settled on a figure of 114.
Nielsen, the market research company, has reported a significant fall in
demand for Sunday shopping following Christmas. Extrapolating from a sample
of 7,100 consumers, Nielsen suggests that 2.4m homes went shopping on
December 22 dropping to 800,000 by January 12. But it suggested that the
Sunday shopper was likely to spend far more on average than those shopping
during the week.
Even though demand may have dropped, it may still be profitable for stores
to open. In a recent stockbroker's report, Mr Bill Myers, food retailing
analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite Institutional Brokers, estimated that the
big grocery chains had only to increase their total sales by 2 per cent to
make Sunday trading profitable.
He argued that the extra labour costs of opening on Sundays represent a
small proportion of the fixed costs of running a superstore. He said that
there were considerable benefits to be gained from more efficient usage of
capital, plant and distribution networks and reduced levels of wastage.
'Just like many things that have happened in the sector in recent years
Sunday trading is another spur to efficiency - but only for the bigger and
better grocers,' he said.
The opportunity to generate additional sales and win market share from
smaller independent operators is crucial for the long-term success of Sunday
trading for the big multiples.
In a recent report on the grocery market, Verdict, the retail consultants,
found that the big food retailers were indeed stimulating additional sales
and were not just spreading the week's sales more thinly over seven days
instead of six. It estimated Sunday food sales at Pounds 50m a week -
equivalent to more than Pounds 2.5bn a year. In total, the UK food market is
worth about Pounds 44bn.
But perhaps the best indication of the shape of things to come on the Sunday
trading front in England and Wales is the example of Scotland, where
seven-day trading has long been legal. Hundreds of grocery stores trade
profitably all week. In the case of the Asda grocery chain, for example,
Sunday sales account for 16 per cent of the total, representing its third
best trading day. But Asda believes it will take a long time to build up a
similar proportion of sales in England and Wales.
One added factor in the cost equation in England and Wales is that of public
perception. None of the directors of the big supermarket chains relish the
adverse publicity associated with 'law-breaking'.
Additional moves by Usdaw, the shop workers' union, highlighting the alleged
pressure that some companies have put on staff to work on Sundays, has
reflected badly on a trade that is highly dependent on fostering a
responsible image with its customers.
But in the absence of government action, the simple answer to whether the
big chains will continue to open on Sundays is that while their competitors
remain open they cannot afford not to do so themselves.
