FT  25 JAN 92 / BBC staff to protest at job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROADCASTING unions at the BBC are planning a 'day of action' in the spring
to protest about increasing job losses at the corporation.
Mr Tony Lennon, joint president of Bectu, the broadcasting production union,
described the move yesterday as a vote of no confidence in Mr John Birt, the
BBC deputy director-general who has been chosen to succeed Sir Michael
Checkland as director-general.
The BBC has announced more than 300 job losses this week. It says 3,000 jobs
are due to go before the end of 1993 as part of the programme of cutting
costs and improving efficiency, and reflecting the move to independent
production.
Two thousand BBC jobs have been lost in the past four years.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Military base guards to lose union rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITY GUARDS at military installations are to lose the right to be
represented by unions affiliated to the Labour party. The TGWU and GMB
general unions have been told by the Ministry of Defence that the rules will
change in April.
The MoD said the decision had been taken because it was 'the government's
view that political affiliation by a trade union would run counter to the
need for the political neutrality of the Civil Service'.
The move led to protests in the Commons from Labour MPs. Mr Gerald
Bermingham, Labour MP for St Helens South, called for an early statement by
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary.
He accused the government of seeking to extend the ban on union membership
already applied to white-collar staff at GCHQ, the government communications
centre at Cheltenham. The eighth anniversary of the ban is to be marked with
a rally in Cheltenham today.
The TGWU and GMB represent 2,400 security guards at military bases and MoD
offices throughout the country.
All security guards at such establishments are vetted for security purposes.
Last April the MoD said it wanted to rationalise its employment of security
guards, many of whom were locally employed on varying terms and conditions.
The MoD said the unions had been consulted over the rationalisation.
Attacking the decision on Labour-affiliated unions, Mr Danny Bryan, a TGWU
national officer, said guards were worried about losing their jobs as a
result of the rationalisation.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said: 'This is a clear denial of
their civil liberties, preventing them from being a member of their chosen
union after they have been members for many years without any complaint.'
The NUCPS civil servants union, which represents a small number of
supervisory guards but is not affiliated to the Labour party, will be
allowed to continue negotiating pay and condition for its members.

FT  25 JAN 92 / New York air fare cut to Pounds 199
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways, American Airlines and United Air Lines of the US cut their
cheapest transatlantic return fares to Pounds 199 yesterday in a battle for
low-season customers.
At the start of the week most tickets cost Pounds 299. All three carriers
reduced their cheapest fares to Pounds 229 on Tuesday.
The price war was officially initiated by American, which applied to the UK
Civil Aviation Authority to sell at the lower prices. It said, however, that
it 'responded to British Airways offering an off-tariff fare to ticket
retailers.' Off-tariff fares are those sold through unofficial discount
outlets, or 'bucket shops'.
British Airways denied selling any tickets at Pounds 199 and called its
mimicking of to American's official price cut 'a prudent competitive
response'.
The Pounds 199 fare applies on Monday to Friday travel to eastern seaboard
cities including New York.
It is available until March 15 and all travel must be completed by April 12.
Tickets can be booked only up to seven days in advance. A Saturday-night
stopover is required and the maximum length of stay is 21 days.
Last night Virgin Atlantic cut its Pounds 269 fare for tickets bought within
21 days of departure to Pounds 199.
Dutch airline KLM, which is discussing a possible link with BA, said
yesterday it would raise capacity on its European route network by 20 per
cent.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Dons divided on university's future: The row over higher
education in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future shape of the century-old University of Wales has become the
subject of a sharp debate among academics which would do credit to CP Snow
and his novels on Cambridge life.
Accusations of 'centralist philosophy' and 'central bureaucracy' are some of
the more polite expressions being bandied about.
The head of University College, Swansea, has warned senior colleagues of the
dire consequences of proposed changes in the university's structure. Five of
the principals of the six colleges have written to Mr David Hunt, Welsh
secretary, telling him of their opposition.
The cause of the imbroglio is debate about the way the university should be
administered after government changes to the funding of universities.
Three years ago the university looked at itself and decided changes were
necessary if Wales, a federal body encompassing five university colleges at
Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, Lampeter and Swansea and a college of medicine
in Cardiff, was to stay in the top rank.
One of the recommendations was the appointment of a deputy pro-chancellor,
Sir John Meurig Thomas, a distinguished chemist, to assist the
pro-chancellor, Lord Cledwyn. Lord Cledwyn is also Labour leader in the
House of Lords. Sir John's proposals for the future have provoked the
dispute among academics.
The University of Wales was established as a loose federal body, awarding
degrees, undertaking some central functions and leaving the colleges largely
autonomous. Sir John says there are flaws in the way federalism is working.
'We now have a wonderful opportunity to take a federal university which is
not really functioning as one in a proper federal direction,' he says.
Opposition to his proposals is supported by a minority who did not want
anyone appointed to a role they saw as undermining their own powers and
influence.
'We are living in a world of increasing financial stringency and also of
increasing sophistication,' Sir John says. 'To meet the new world we need to
be more sophisticated ourselves - to undertake more advanced research, more
effective teaching, more seminars, more tutorials of the sort at which
Oxford and Cambridge are pre-eminent.'
Sir John would like to use the university's video link, for instance, to set
up inter-college teaching, so that a lecturer in, say, Bangor would
simultaneously teach students in the other colleges. 'Many departments in
the colleges undertake world-scale work,' he says. 'Microbiology at
Aberystwyth, advanced materials at Swansea are just two of them.'
Video links would bring this world work in specific departments to the whole
university. Moving along such a course would make Wales a world university.
To Mr Brian Clarkson, principal of Swansea, it all smacks of centralism. In
November he wrote to his senior colleagues accusing Sir John of 'building up
a central bureaucracy and attempting to usurp the planning role of the
colleges'.
Sir Aubrey Trotman-Dickenson, principal at Cardiff, followed with a letter
to Mr Hunt on behalf of the five principals, saying the university should
remain 'primarily as a degree-awarding body, while retaining some general
functions such as management of endowments'. Lord Morris, who was principal
of Lampeter until he retired last month, was not included in the joint
submission.
There is an implied threat that if Sir John's view holds sway, the colleges
might break away from the university and seek individual full university
status themselves. The opposition to tighter federalism is closely linked to
the government's new funding proposals for higher education.
Mr Hunt has announced the setting up of a Higher Education Funding Council
for Wales when the government replaces the Universities Funding Council. The
five principals in Wales believe Sir John will use the opportunity of the
change to ensure money for Wales comes through the university administration
and is then allocated to the colleges. The colleges want to deal directly
with the funding council.
'The removal of the redundant University of Wales machinery could provide a
useful financial contribution towards the running of the Welsh funding
council and save immediate capital expenditure,' Sir Aubrey has stated.
Sir John has counteracted strenuously, calling Sir Aubrey's letter to Mr
Hunt, 'tendentious'.
Not all the staff agree with the principals. Many are concerned that if the
colleges go their own way they might be cut off from finance for research
and the ability to attract outside money.
Sir John is determined to introduce change. He has told the principals that
'my experience tells me an element of central planning - not interventionist
bureaucracy, which nobody wants - is absolutely essential. This is one of
the key facts that I learnt at Cambridge. It is what will improve our
rankings as a university.'
Two meetings this spring should settle the issue. Sir John hopes everyone
will 'work harmoniously together' in the new year. It is about as likely as
any of the plots CP Snow devised about life in Cambridge.

FT  25 JAN 92 / MoD man recalls fears about tubes for Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MINISTRY of Defence scientist told MPs in a private session on Wednesday
that he had been warned in June 1988 of fears that immense steel tubes
ordered for Iraq might be intended for a missile project. His statement was
published yesterday.
The evidence on the Iraqi supergun programme from Mr Bill Weir, a ministry
metallurgist, was given to the Commons trade and industry commitee.
Mr Weir said he had been approached by the Department of Trade and Industry
for advice, but was given insufficient evidence to decide whether the tubes
were for a gun.
He said he had telephoned Mr Rex Bayliss, managing director of Walter
Somers, the Halesowen company asked to produce the smaller of two guns in
the programme.
Mr Bayliss had told of his concern that he had been asked to produce missile
tubes, and six days later he said the tubes were 'probably for Iraq'.
Mr Weir said he had also known that Space Research Corporation had designed
the tubes and was involved in the design of guns.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Council tenants to gain home repairs scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL tenants are to gain the right to have urgent repairs to their homes
carried out at council expense under a Tenant's Charter, published
yesterday.
A consultation paper will be issued late next month setting out proposals
for dealing with urgent repairs needed to make council homes safe or secure,
such as blocked drains or broken water heaters.
The scheme will allow tenants to approach an approved contractor to do the
repairs if the council does not act promptly. The bill would go to the
council, so that the tenant would not have to pay for the work and then
claim the money back.
Councils would have to consult tenants on which repairs were covered by the
scheme and the time to be allowed before the tenant could take action.
In addition to listing tenants' statutory rights, such as security of tenure
and the right to buy, the charter also sets out guidance on good practice
for councils in dealing with tenants.
For example, housing officers should wear name badges, have answering
machines to take messages when offices are not staffed and answer inquiries
promptly.
Launching the charter in Birmingham, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary, said many local authorities had made great strides in recent
years in improving their management performance.
Nevertheless, too much council housing was 'badly maintained and poorly
serviced by bureaucrats who are remote, inefficient and out of touch with
tenants' needs'.
He added: 'The Tenant's Charter aims to improve quality, provide choice, set
standards and give value for money in housing.'
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, said the charter was
merely a pre-election stunt 'to shift the blame for the housing crisis and
massive repairs backlog to local councils, when it is almost entirely
government policy that is to blame'.
He criticised the exclusion of private tenants and housing association
tenants from the charter.
Mr Gould urged Mr Heseltine to allow councils to spend their capital
receipts on new homes and repairs.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Labour awards 'wooden spoons' to authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR AWARDED 'wooden spoons' yesterday to three Tory councils for 'lack of
achievement' to highlight the quality of services provided by local
authorities. The move was intended to pre-empt the government's renewal of
emphasis next week on the Citizen's Charter proposals.
Seeking to upstage Monday's launch by Mr John Major of the 'chartermark' as
a symbol of excellence in public services, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow
environment secretary, published a Labour report contrasting the
performances of the best and worst local authorities in terms of providing
services.
The launch will mark the start of Tory campaigning on the Citizen's Charter
proposals. Charters for specific areas will deal with matters such as how
staff treat the public, rather than in changes to the work organisations.
Mr Gould said that Labour-controlled councils had been implementing their
own plans for quality audits well before Mr Major produced the Citizen's
Charter.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Birmingham wins urban development corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN URBAN development corporation is to be set up for part of Birmingham with
an injection of Pounds 50m over five years.
The announcement yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary, confirmed a report earlier this week that a new corporation would
be established for the Heartlands area of east Birmingham.
The Pounds 50m from the government was described as 'crucial funding' by Sir
Reginald Eyre, chairman of the existing development agency for the area, who
is to chair the urban development corporation. The corporation will also be
equipped with statutory powers, including land-acquisition and planning
responsibilities.
Sir Richard Knowles, Labour leader of Birmingham City Council, will be
deputy chairman of the corporation. Mr Heseltine's readiness to give the
council a significant role emphasises the government's more flexible
attitude to working with Labour councils.
The 11 existing urban development corporations are due to be wound up in the
mid 1990s. The announcement of another one appears to be a pragmatic
response to the particular obstacles to regenerating the Birmingham
Heartlands area, rather than a new lease of life for the corporations.
Heartlands consists of 2,350 acres of industrial estates, low-cost and
council housing, distribution depots and derelict land, criss-crossed by
roads, railways and canals. With a population of about 13,000, it is south
and east of the M6 'Spaghetti Junction' and north-east of the city centre.
Since 1987, the development agency for the area has been Birmingham
Heartlands, a company 35 per cent owned by Birmingham City Council and 65
per cent by five construction groups: Bryant, RM Douglas, Galliford, Tarmac
and Wimpey.
Seen as a model partnership for stimulating economic and social revival in
decayed areas, Heartlands relied on government money to prime development.
Individual projects received grants and the Department of Transport agreed
to provide most of the finance for a Pounds 84.7m road through the area to
open up new sites for development.
The government has recently focused its urban regeneration effort on City
Challenge, in which local authorities draw up development schemes and
compete for government funds. Birmingham City Council was unsuccessful in
last year's first round of City Challenge bidding, leaving a Pounds 37.5m
hole in plans for land reclamation and infrastructure projects.
The recession made private-sector partners increasingly reluctant to commit
funds to speculative property ventures, further reducing development. In
response, Sir Richard and Sir Reginald asked ministers to create an urban
development corporation.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Long campaign to mop up every poll-tax defaulter: Provisions
will be needed to cover many severe budget shortfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY, BETHAN HUTTON and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT says it is determined to close all legal loopholes open to
people who refuse to pay poll tax. But behind the ringing battle-cries from
ministers, a large number of local skirmishes is being fought by an army of
harassed council officers.
A survey of councils by the FT provides further evidence of their
difficulties and highlights the differing degrees of success among councils
in collecting the cash. Haringey: there are about 160,000 names on the
poll-tax register, and of those about 70,000 have not paid this year or are
seriously behind in their payments. A further 30,000 are in arrears. The
Labour-led council has collected Pounds 12m of the Pounds 49m due this year,
and expects to be Pounds 15m short at the end of the financial year. Last
year a shortfall of Pounds 15m meant that Pounds 61.85 had to be added to
the local poll tax. The council is block-booking courts to pursue
non-payers, although only one has been jailed so far.
Lambeth: an officer said the Labour-led authority's finances were in such a
mess because of internal difficulties and snags with computer systems that
it was unable to say how many people had not paid and how much was still
owed.
Kensington: the council could not give figures for the number of defaulters
because the population of the borough has a 50 per cent turnover rate each
year, and many people on the register are no longer liable for the charge.
Nevertheless, the borough had a high collection rate last year.
Westminster: the Conservative-led council has one of the lowest poll tax
levels in the country, at Pounds 36. Yet it also has 25,000 people on the
register who have not paid anything this year. That is almost 17 per cent of
the total number registered, though some may have moved. About 88 per cent
of the total due this year has been collected. The council did not
incorporate any allowances for non-payment into this year's charge and does
not foresee the need to do so when the charge level is set in March.
Southwark: the Labour-led authority has so far collected 58 per cent of the
Pounds 43m it is due to raise this year. Of the 175,000 people registered
110,000 are in arrears. Last year allowance was made for 20 per cent
non-payment, adding Pounds 64 to the charge. 'This year the collection rate
is about the same, and getting harder,' the council said.
Camden: the council has already taken all complete non-payers registered
through the court process, and has secured 58,245 orders, representing 44
per cent of its 131,917 total of people liable to pay poll tax. So far this
year 65 per cent of the Pounds 58m target has been collected. It is likely
that a surcharge of Pounds 60 to Pounds 70 will be added to next year's bill
to cover non-payment. The council added that the surcharge also covered
business rate defaulters. 'There has been a bigger shortfall of business
rates than we expected,' it said. 'It is an index of the recession and the
way businesses have been hit.'
Liverpool: poll tax difficulties have been made particularly acute for the
Labour-led city council because of computer difficulties and a long
industrial dispute. The Labour-led council faces a total of Pounds 45.6m (66
per cent) in uncollected poll tax bills this year and is having to build in
a Pounds 11.3m non-payment provision into its budget target.
Warrington: of 135,000 people liable for the charge, 12,699 have not paid
anything this year and the council has made a 5 per cent provision in its
budget for non-payment. Officials are reasonably confident of achieving 95
per cent collection this year. The poll tax is still likely to increase by
about Pounds 15, however.
Chesterfield: about 6,000 people (8 per cent) have paid nothing this year.
The local authority has made a 5 per cent budgetary provision for
non-payment. Next year the Pounds 263 poll tax is likely to be increased by
5 per cent to 6 per cent to cover non-payment.
Bristol: the city's poll tax of Pounds 369 is among the highest in the
country, and the Labour-led council does not hide the difficulties in
collection. 'The population has proved to be highly mobile . . . a
considerable number have simply disappeared off the face of the earth,' the
council said. Almost 100,000 people have been issued with summonses over the
past two years for non-payment or near non-payment. The figure may rise by
50,000 by the end of the current financial year. The total of 150,000
compares with 596,000 who are registered for poll tax. The council faces
Pounds 25m in accumulated arrears over the two-year period.
Newcastle upon Tyne: the city council says 14,400 of its 220,000 people
registered for poll tax have paid nothing. It has made a 5 per cent
provision for non-payment.
Manchester: 78 per cent of the council's expected figure for this year has
been collected so far. Next year's poll tax will not be increased to cover
the 1991-92 shortfall because the council can borrow for up to two years to
cover this. It will, however, have to be increased to cover the amount
written off from the 1990-91 non-collection - about 11 per cent to 12 per
cent of the total. That will add about 5 per cent to next year's bills.
'There seems to be a general feeling abroad that the poll tax has been
abolished and they don't have to pay, which isn't true, of course,' the
council said. 'We will be going for the money to the death - and beyond. I
can see us still collecting poll tax money in 1995.'
Birmingham: an assistant treasurer responsible for collecting poll tax said:
'The new figure for the poll tax is going to be political dynamite.'

The company said its London nightclub, Stringfellows, would remain open.
Nightclubs in New York, Los Angeles and Miami have sought Chapter 11
protection under US bankruptcy laws. The company said it was unlikely that
they would be able to repay money owed to the London club, by which they had
been funded. The Miami club had closed and was up for sale.
The company said Mr Peter Stringfellow, the nightclub's founder, would
concentrate on his UK business and planned a second club in London.

The show of force by riot police and soldiers backed by water cannon at
fundamentalist strongholds came two days after the new military-backed
rulers banned political activity at Algeria's 10,000 mosques.
The Islamic Salvation Front named a hardline member to replace Abdelkader
Hachani, the party's moderate former acting leader, arrested on Wednesday on
charges of urging soldiers to desert. It was not immediately clear what
changes Othmane Aissani, 37, would bring to the Salvation Front.
Several clerics were arrested yesterday after delivering political speeches
and 'calling for violence' at three small mosques around Algiers, the
official APS news agency reported.
At the Es Sunna mosque in the working-class suburb of Bab el Oued in Algiers
people scurried for the safety of doorways in the narrow streets after shots
rang out.
'Tell everyone they want to kill us. Tell everyone they want to stop us from
having our Islamic state,' an angry woman shouted.
'This is normal here most Fridays,' a youth said with a resigned shrug.
Bab el Oued is one of the two strongholds of the Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS). But yesterday was no normal day.
Supporters of the FIS were determined to use the mosque not just for prayer
but as a focus for their anger and frustration over events of the past two
weeks, which have seen the annulment of parliamentary elections and the
denial of their party's certain electoral victory.
The security forces had surrounded the Es Sunna mosque and the larger Kouba
mosque to enforce tough edicts against political activity at mosques.
'Last week there were two or three thousand people praying in these streets
round the mosque,' said one of the Es Sunna residents. 'They have been
trying to intimidate us since early this morning, when they searched the
flats round the mosque.'
Young men, most with the distinctive long black beards identifying
themselves as FIS supporters and some with rolled prayer mats under their
arms, had gathered early in front of the mosque. They looked sullenly at the
riot police and the display of army trucks and a lone water cannon in an
adjoining street to the small mosque.
But they were careful to avoid provocation, observing the new ban on praying
in the streets.
The firing of blanks in the air, lasting for less than 10 minutes, was
either panic by soldiers or a deliberate attempt at intimidation. If
intimidatory, it had the desired effect. And with the loudspeaker cut, fewer
than 500 heard the imam inside the mosque.
The Es Sunna mosque symbolises the problems which successive Algerian
governments have created for themselves by their ambiguous encouragement of,
and failure to control, the state religion, Islam.
It also helps explain the political success of the FIS.
The construction of this mosque began 10 years ago. It remains unfinished,
like 5,490 others of the total 9,073 known mosques in Algeria. Mosques have
to be completed and possess an imam who has passed official examinations
before being considered a state mosque with official funding.
The FIS has exploited this loophole, keeping the mosques deliberately
unfinished, sometimes by just not facing the concrete exterior with bricks
or tiles, like Es Sunna. In this way they can appoint their own 'free' imam,
and it is these men who have been urging the faithful to establish an
Islamic state in Algeria.
Bab el Oued is fertile ground for such an appeal. Once the centre of mainly
Spanish-speaking poor colonials, since independence it has come to house
many of the city's poorer families, who find themselves at the bottom of the
ladder in terms of jobs and social opportunity.
'I am a trained lathe operator but I have never had a job,' said Mustafa,
aged 25, as he waited in a stairwell for the tension in the streets to die
down. 'I finished 2 1/2 years' military service but in the last three years
I have been unemployed.'
He lives in a two-room flat with a family of nine, of whom only two brothers
are working.
'The government and the FLN (the former ruling party) has done nothing but
rob us. Look at the ministers with their big villas and we are left to
struggle to eat.'
He said he voted for the FIS not out of religious conviction but as a
protest.
'At least they might give me some work.'
Dressed in jeans and black leather jacket, he talked of a pen-friend in
Hull, and seemed not untypical of Algeria's disillusioned youth, who make up
60 per cent of the 25m population.
These are the people Algeria's new military-backed government has to win
over if it is to pose a credible alternative to the FIS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of black South Africans demonstrated yesterday at the opening of
the white-dominated parliament while inside President FW de Klerk reiterated
his offer to bring blacks into the legislature as soon as possible.
Mr de Klerk gave no hint of a timetable for reform, but repeated his
commitment to put big constitutional changes to a referendum, a process the
ANC rejected yesterday as giving whites a veto over plans for an interim
government.
The parliament has separate houses for whites, coloureds (mixed race) and
Indians, but excludes blacks; it is effectively controlled by whites.
Some 20,000 supporters of the African National Congress (ANC), the main
black opposition group, staged what they called a 'people's parliament' in
front of the Cape Town City Hall and then marched on parliament to present a
petition calling for abolition of the legislature and the constitution.
ANC organisers had expected a turnout of at least 50,000. They laid on free
trains to Cape Town from the surrounding black and coloured townships, and
bussed in supporters from rural areas.
The ANC demanded the installation of an interim government within six
months, and elections by the end of the year to a constituent assembly
charged with drawing up a post-apartheid constitution.
Officials of the ruling National party have said it could take at least 18
months before a multi-racial parliament could be elected: reaching political
agreement on the shape of a new parliament could take many months as the two
sides struggle over the Nationalists demand for protections for the white
minority, followed by delays for the registration of voters and delimitation
of new constituencies.
In the meantime, however, the government hopes to bring blacks into the
executive, and plans to establish joint legislative committees composed of
members of parliament and the multi-party Convention for a Democratic South
Africa.
Mr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative party,
rejected Mr de Klerk's appeal to join the convention.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Meticulous journalist who scorned small minds: Obituary -
Wolfgang Luetkenshd
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLFGANG LUETKENS, who died suddenly in London on Thursday night aged 69,
was known to generations of colleagues on the Financial Times as a
meticulous and learned journalist and a kind-hearted mentor and companion.
German-born, but mostly English-educated, Wolf, as he was known to everyone,
had an international background which served him well on a newspaper rapidly
branching out into the European market. Appointed the paper's first
full-time Bonn correspondent in 1958, after several years with Reuters news
agency in the German capital, the objectivity and thoroughness which were
the hallmarks of his German coverage are still remembered in both countries
today.
After more than 10 years as the FT's Bonn correspondent, he became in turn
Foreign News Editor, Deputy Features Editor and Foreign Leader Writer, but
he was always happiest reporting on foreign affairs. His Reuter training
made him suspicious of articles which mixed reporting with comment, and he
was the scourge of writers who split infinitives or took liberties with the
precise meaning of words. No one was more rigorous than Wolf, who became the
paper's foremost authority on grammar and spelling.
How many times did the sight of the approaching dapper figure in a bow tie
send his colleagues scampering for their dictionaries and encyclopaedias.
Wolf was usually right and any touch of pedantry easily forgiven because it
was never malicious. In the years following his retirement in 1987, Wolf was
still writing letters to news editors on spelling and headline errors and
was regularly asked his advice on the FT's style-book.
His most admirable quality, however, was that he abhorred flannel and
pretentiousness. Wolf was always particularly scathing about judgments based
on a lack of knowledge or conventional wisdom, such as blanket condemnations
of Germany, long after the end of the Second World War. Discussions at
leader conferences sometimes left him sighing heavily at some of the things
he heard. 'One must never forget that small minds also think alike,' was one
typical and memorable comment.
His intellectual rigour and moral rectitude were inherited from his parents
and his impish, and sometimes eccentric humour, one suspects, from his
English upbringing. Mr Luetkens senior was a German diplomat based in
Bucharest, married to a German Jewish sociologist, when Hitler came to power
in 1933. Showing unusual courage, Luetkens senior retired from the foreign
service in protest shortly afterwards and brought his wife and son to
England. The teenage Wolf, after having gone to the German school in Milan
and being taught privately in Latvia and Romania, was then sent first to the
Leys school in Cambridge and later to Brasenose College, Oxford.
He certainly had a warm, if critical, affection for England and for
Wimbledon, where he and his wife Martina made their home. He also developed
a close relationship with three other countries - Austria, his wife's
birthplace, Canada and Switzerland - on which he became the newspaper's
principal expert in the last years of his career and where he frequently
went to write surveys.
His greatest loyalty, however, apart from his deep attachment to his family,
was undoubtedly to the Financial Times, as illustrated by his insistence
that he should write a leader on Austria after suffering a heart attack in
Canada. The editorial was written while Wolf was waiting for a by-pass
operation in a hospital bed and duly published.
Wolf Luetkens was born in Berlin on June 9, 1922 and died in Wimbledon on
January 23, 1992. He was awarded the Verdienstkreuz first class by the
German Federal Republic and the Knight's Cross first class by the Austrian
Republic. He is survived by his wife, Martina, and daughters, Jane and Iris.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Busting trusts in Moscow, city of vested interests: Price
rises prompt a new stress on competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trust-busting has become the slogan of the day in Russia, even though the
Anti-Monopoly Committee's remote location - on the outskirts of Moscow - is
a telling indication of the insignificance attached to it until now.
The sharp rise in prices following the abolition of state controls has
prompted President Boris Yeltsin to demand speedy action to introduce
competition in the trade sector and to stop abuses by monopoly producers and
sellers.
In a desperate bid to pad out the still thin domestic market, the government
on Thursday abolished tariffs on all imports - at least until April 1 when
new rates will be published. This means, for example, that computers and
television sets can be imported free of taxes which used to range from 20 to
25 per cent.
Given the freedom to set their own prices, some producers are preferring to
cut back production and keep prices high. Such practice is partly the legacy
of the old state-planning system, which preferred to monopolise where
possible. 'It was seen as a sign of inefficiency if more than two
enterprises produced the same thing,' explains Mr Valery Chernogorodsky, the
anti-monopoly committee's chairman.
With heavy state involvement in every sector of the economy, it is not
surprising that of the 200 'abuses of dominant position' that he
investigated in the last two months, half of them were committed by state
officials. He said this included customs officers who refused to let
importers unload their goods unless they received bribes.
While demonopolising heavy industry will take time, Mr Chernogorodsky says
competition can be rapidly injected into the food, services and consumer
goods sectors through privatisation and the breaking up of distribution
monopolies.
Mr Yeltsin is soon to issue a decree lifting all restrictions on who can
take part in domestic wholesale and retail trading.
'We have a lot of people who milk cows and a lot of people who drink milk,
but only one organisation which is allowed to buy it from producers and sell
it to the shops,' said Mr Chernogorodsky.
Another task will be to combat the criminal mafia that fixes prices and
decides who can sell produce at peasant markets in Moscow. The produce is
plentiful, but beyond the means of most Muscovites.
But as the example of Moscow illustrates, resistance to demonopolisation
lies not just with factory managers, but with state officials who have
traditionally run the economy at every level.
Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the head of the Moscow city government, said yesterday he
would work on opening the wholesale trading system in the capital. But
despite a 'reform-oriented' reorganisation of the government, his deputy, Mr
Vladimir Reisin, is not only retaining control over the building industry
and the supply of construction materials, but also taking on responsibility
for real estate.

<TEXT>
THE leader of the IG Metall union yesterday urged German steel workers to
vote for a strike in the official ballot which starts tomorrow. However, he
said later that the way was still open for a fresh offer from employers.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union president, was loudly cheered as he told a
meeting of about 4,000 members in Duisburg that the time for talking was
over.
Reminding his audience that the outcome of the confrontation would affect
all German pay negotiations this year, he said there would be no more
dealings.
'The cards will be shuffled again on Sunday,' he added.
At a subsequent press conference, however, he said there was nothing to stop
employers from presenting a new offer between ballot and strike.
Workers at the meeting appeared to be enthusiastic about possible action.
'It's strike weather,' one said, although the mood was more subdued earlier
in the day when the town was shrouded in fog and ice.
While there was some anger about the employers' offer of about 5.5 per cent,
there was also concern that the union had lowered its official 10.5 per cent
claim to around 6.5 per cent, and worry about job security.
Duisburg is one of several north-western towns likely to be hit this year by
a renewed wave of steel industry job losses.
The ballot of union members - 100,000 out of a total industry workforce of
135,000 - will end on Thursday, with the result expected to be announced on
Friday.

FT  25 JAN 92 / EC unemployment climbing
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community unemployment rate rose more sharply last year than in
any year since Brussels started compiling comparative figures in 1983, but
inflation is now at its lowest rate for three years.
A report published yesterday by Eurostat, the EC's statistical office,
singled out Britain as the country with the fastest growing unemployment
rate in the Community.
Jobless Britons made up 10.2 per cent of the working population, seasonally
adjusted, in November, against 7.4 per cent in the previous year.
At the same time, the report pointed out that Ireland, where 18 per cent of
the workforce is now out of work, had overtaken Spain as the country with
the highest unemployment rate in the Community. Spain's rate appears to be
static at about 16 per cent.
The seasonally adjusted EC unemployment rate - which excludes the old East
German lander - rose steadily over the 12 months from November 1990, from
8.4 to 9.3 per cent. The number of people registered at employment offices
across the Community jumped from 14.1m in November 1990 to 15.3m last
October, more than 8 per cent.
A separate report on prices paints a more optimistic picture of the
Community's economy, with annual EC inflation down from 5.7 per cent in 1990
to 4.8 per cent last year. That is still higher than Japan (2.5 per cent)
and the US (3.1 per cent), both of which have cut inflation since 1990, but
it is the lowest EC figure since 1988, when it was 4.4 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Air crash prompts German safety fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Federal Office for Air Safety yesterday joined the ranks of those
questioning the sheer quantity of high technology confronting the modern
pilot, in the wake of the Airbus A-320 crash in the Vosges mountains.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Ohl, spokesman for the air safety body, said pilots were
'under-stretched' by having too much technological assistance.
He added this led to 'boredom, which then means that mistakes are not
spotted in time'.
He argued that pilots now had to relearn everything before flying new
aircraft. 'If someone has been flying a machine for 40 years, where the
steering is still done by hand, and not electronically, then obviously he
has to adapt to the new situation,' he said.
His remarks echo suggestions by a number of French pilots this week that the
A320's fly-by-wire computer control system can lull pilots into a false
sense of security.
The crash on Monday, in which 87 people died, has rekindled the controversy
over the aircraft's advanced computerised systems.
However, the cause of the tragedy remains a mystery. An initial examination
of the aircraft's flight recorders recovered in the wreckage had yielded no
reason to ground other A320 aircraft for technical checks, Mr Pierre-Henri
Gourgeon, France's director of civil aviation, said this week.
A study of the cockpit voice recorder also appeared to rule out the icy
weather as the cause of the aircraft's sudden loss of altitude on its
approach to Strasbourg airport.
The French government agreed yesterday to appoint an independent pilot to a
commission investigating the crash.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar lost ground against the D-Mark yesterday in trading dominated by
speculation about possible accords on currency levels at the G7 meeting. The
dollar in London closed at DM1.5875, down  3/4 pfennig on the day, and in
New York at DM1.592, down nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs.
One theory in the markets was that the US might try to push through an
agreement to restrain the dollar's recent rise, to aid the US recovery by
helping exporters. There was also the perception that Germany might want to
put a floor under the D-Mark to damp domestic inflationary pressures.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Police warn of 'super-dollar' forgeries in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COUNTERFEIT 'super-dollars'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dollars 100 bills virtually indistinguishable from the genuine article - are
circulating in Britain and several other countries.
The forgeries are of such high quality that some police sources suspect they
are produced by a government, possibly in the Third World.
Because the 'super-dollars' are so difficult to detect criminals are
reported to be paying distributors up to 70 per cent of their face value for
the notes before passing them in shops and banks. Ordinary forgeries change
hands at less than a third of face value.
Scotland Yard this week confirmed the existence of the notes in Britain,
saying they were an international problem and did not appear to have been
produced in Britain.
When similar high-quality forgeries surfaced in Egypt in December, it was
suspected that they might have origiEast. The US Treasury Department's
secret service representative in Britain said there was a continuing
investigation into the 'super-dollar'.
In Washington a US Treasury official said the distribution of some series of
notes had been traced back as far as Middle East terrorist groups, but they
might not be producing the forgeries themselves. Tho-mas Cook Travel said
staff at its foreign exchange bureaux first spotted the 'super-dollars'
about a year ago.
Their suspicions were aroused by a 'gut feeling' based on experience of
handling thousands of notes rather than relying on the signs that normally
give away counterfeits - fuzzy printing, paper quality or the lack of
watermarks. Mr Charles Black, an expert former counterfeiter who is
consulted by the police on new finds and has been shown a sample of the
'super-dollar', said: 'It looked identical to the real thing.'
The forgers had reproduced all the dollar's security features including
small red and blue fibres in the paper, magnetic ink and ultra-violet dull
paper. The US dollar is the most frequently counterfeited currency
worldwide. A US embassy official in Paris said: 'Our currency really only
involves two colours. Its popularity as well as the lack of more colours and
the lack of additional security features is the reason why it tends to be
popular with counterfeiters.'
The Dollars 100 bill in particular is the object of forgers' efforts. 'In
some American states Dollars 100 notes are not very easily spent, and yet
over here they seem to be one of the most common dollar notes,' said
Superintendent Chris Newman of Scotland Yard's counterfeiting squad.
He advised anybody with a suspect Dollars 100 bill to consult an expert at a
bank. Sophisticated and accessible new technology has been blamed for recent
increases in the amount of counterfeit currency in circulation leading to
more discoveries, such as a record quantity of forged Dutch banknotes seized
in London last week.
Mr Black said forgery had become 'a thousand times easier' with the advent
of high-definition four-colour photocopiers. The IRA is thought to use
colour photocopiers to forge tax exemption certificates which are used to
defraud the Inland Revenue, and it may also be involved in currency
counterfeiting.
To combat the rise in counterfeiting, many countries have been introducing
notes with design changes intended to deter forgers. An improved Dollars 100
bill with a polyester security thread and microscopic printing was launched
last summer, but it will not come into full circulation for a number of
years.

FT  25 JAN 92 / G7 to lay ground for aid to former Soviet republics: US
unlikely to win unanimous support for expansionary shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS and central bank governors from the world's seven most powerful
industrial democracies meet today in Garden City, near New York, to prepare
financial assistance for the states of the former Soviet Union and to
discuss how to bring stronger growth to the world economy.
The issues on the G7 agenda are of great importance but the meeting is more
likely to prepare for the next scheduled gathering of the group at the end
of April than being a decision-making session in its own right.
While there is a general realisation that the world economy is not
performing as was hoped at the time of the G7 ministers' last meeting in
Bangkok three months ago, the US is unlikely to win unanimous support for a
general shift to more expansionary policies.
Germany, which last month pushed up its interest rates to levels last seen
in the 1930s, may be able to hold out the hope of monetary easing if a
satisfactory result is achieved in the current wage round.
This is heading for a showdown, with steelworkers expected to vote tomorrow
in favour of strike action in support of a double-digit pay claim.
Bundesbank officials have indicated that if wage settlements finally turn
out at no more than 6 per cent, and German money supply growth slows to
safely within the central bank's target range, the way could be open for a
cautious lowering of interest rates later this year.
Following this week's Washington conference on humanitarian assistance for
Russia and the other ex-Soviet republics, it is expected that the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will start discussing the
possibility of large-scale financial assistance for the countries of the
former Soviet Union.
There will be no final decision today on financial support, because there is
general agreement that the republics have not yet implemented adequate
economic reforms to make such aid effective.
The G7, however, will try to reach agreement on how to admit the republics
to membership of the International Monetary Fund as quickly as possible.
Here too there are problems. The lack of reliable statistical data, the
rapid decline of the former Soviet economies, Russia's size and the large
volume of trade among the republics could cause difficulties when it comes
to fixing their quotas, or membership subscriptions, to the fund.
Another problem will be to ensure that Russia and the others are given
adequate representation on the IMF's executive board without upsetting any
European countries by pushing them down the IMF pecking order.
As always with G7 meetings, the ministers will discuss the state of currency
markets and recent US-Japanese moves to curb the dollar's rise against the
yen. However, it is unclear whether Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new Japanese
finance minister, will agree to a statement urging a stronger yen on
currency markets.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Signs of recovery seen in housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE practice of gazumping could be back, according to reports from an estate
agent in Orpington, Kent, after a would-be house-buyer whose offer of Pounds
138,000 was accepted was later outbid by an offer of Pounds 142,000.
The estate agent said this was its first case of gazumping 'in ages'.
A West Yorkshire estate agent announced that it just had the busiest
Saturday for 18 months for clients making appointments to view homes.
A Pounds 230,000 town house at Newmarket, Suffolk, was recently sold in just
two weeks. According to one agent a similar sale last year would have taken
at least four months.
While no one is suggesting that the UK housing market is returning to the
frenzy of several years ago, there are tentative signs that the worst of the
slump may be over.
A straw poll of housebuilders, mortgage lenders and estate agents, conducted
this week by the Financial Times, has revealed a sharp rise in interest from
potential buyers since the start of this year.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, Britain's second-largest
housebuilder, says traffic through the company's show houses is about 10 to
15 per cent higher than during the first three weeks of last year. Some
other builders and agents report similar increases.
The number of people agreeing to make purchases has also risen although
sellers warn that deals have still to be completed. A common feature of the
housing market during the recession has been a high number of buyers
withdrawing from deals before completion.
Sellers warned against over-optimism in a market which during the last 18
months has seen several false dawns.
Mr Dennis Webb, managing director of Beazer Homes, the third-largest
housebuilder in the country, says: 'Sales during the first few weeks of this
year are up by 10 per cent. This, however, is compared with last January
when sales were depressed during the run-up to the Gulf War. We are
encouraged. I do believe the bottom of the market has been reached but it is
still too early to talk of a recovery.'
Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, says that the increase in
activity is no more than might be expected at this time of year. But it adds
that an improvement in the economy is required before there will be an
increase in confidence in the housing market.
Sir Lawrie Barratt, executive chairman of Barratt which last year announced
a Pounds 106m pre-tax loss, is more optimistic, however.
'Visitor rates through our sites are up 40 per cent on a year ago and sales
are up 10 per cent,' he says. 'House prices in relation to earnings are at
the lowest level since the early 1980s. Confidence is returning and we are
forecasting that house prices will rise by about 5 per cent this year.'
Estate agents say that falls in mortgage interest rates and the government's
decision to abolish stamp duty on most house purchases for eight months may
have helped stimulate interest.
Mr Malcolm Duffey, residential manager of Jackson Stops &amp; Staff in East
Anglia, reports increased regional demand for houses priced between Pounds
200,000 to Pounds 300,000. He says: 'This may indicate that professional
managers able to afford these homes are taking the view that prices will not
fall any further.'
Other agents say that while falling prices and interest rates have made
homes more affordable, fears of job losses make it more difficult to achieve
sales. Most say that prices are unlikely to rise even if the sales
improvement is sustained - such is the backlog of properties to be sold.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Stock Exchange to probe market in Lonrho shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange is investigating whether there was a false market
in Lonrho shares on Thursday, during which it was difficult for investors in
the international trading group to assess the proper value of the shares.
This emerged yesterday as Lonrho revealed that it is planning another Pounds
400m worth of disposals which it hopes to complete within three months.
Although it has given itself a year to reduce net debt from Pounds 1.1bn to
Pounds 600m, Lonrho said negotiations over a series of sales were at an
advanced stage and could be completed by the end of April.
Institutional investors, meanwhile, said they wanted the company to explain
its unexpected dividend cut.
Exchange investigators are focusing on Lonrho's announcement early on
Thursday that it was selling 50 per cent of its interest in Kuhne &amp; Nagel,
the German freight forwarder. This was followed, after the stock market had
closed, by a separate announcement of its full-year results and the decision
to cut its final dividend.
The announcement of the disposal was regarded as good news by the market and
Lonrho's shares rose 9p to close at 163p.
However, Lonrho's shares then plunged in after-hours dealing, when the
company disclosed its annual profits were well below most forecasts.
By yesterday's close thay had fallen 43p to 120p.
An official with a close knowledge of the inquiry said the exchange would be
trying to find out why the announcements were not made at the same time.
Lonrho said it would use most of the DM340m (Pounds 118.4m) proceeds from
the sale of its stake in Kuhne &amp; Nagel to reduce borrowings.
Three of Lonrho's directors - Mr Philip Tarsh, Mr Robin Witten and Mr Paul
Spicer - have arranged a series of meetings with institutional shareholders
next week.
These include the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society, Phillips and
Drew Fund Managers, Legal and General, Robert Fleming Investment Management
and Postel Investment Management.
Fund managers contacted by the Financial Times yesterday said that they
would be pressing the directors of Lonrho to explain why the group cut its
final 1991 dividend by 3p to 5p and withheld its first 1992 interim
dividend.
One said: 'Given that the banks did not force the group to cut its dividend,
Lonrho must obviously be feeling pressure from another quarter.'
Mr Spicer said: 'I wish people would accept that we are in the middle of a
recession. We have prudently decided to cut the dividend. This year is going
to be a good housekeeping year for us.'

FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: So near but so far to Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING UP through Courtstown Forest, the Way was steep.
A hot spell had turned the pine needles into blonde scented sawdust rather
than the grey sludge it normally resembles. Yet expectation made light of
the incline. At the stile marking the 1,550-ft crest of the hill, the views
were as exhilarating as the map had promised.
Dublin, the Bay and Howth stretched out to the north, virtually beneath
one's feet. What makes the Wicklow Way unique among long-distance footpaths
is the final section down into the city. How many European capitals could be
surveyed from a wilderness mountain peak barely an hour's stroll from the
restaurants and shops of a great metropolis?
These are no tame, well-manicured uplands landscaped for the urban
adventurer. Glencullen is the last east-west valley before one reaches
Dublin itself. Whitewashed farms dotting the lower slopes, huge boulders
littering the sheep pastures and the heather-clad slopes of Glendhu and
Cruagh mountain remind the traveller remote Scottish glens. Yet as the crow
flies it measures just seven miles to O'Connell Street, Trinity College, and
the heart of the city.
Country ways predominate here. An old boy in battered thorn-proof trousers
and, despite the sun, thick tweed jacket, ambled up Glencullen with me for a
mile or two, curious that anyone in possession of his wits should should
walk for pleasure.
As the Irish tourist board admits in its literature, the concept of hiking
trails is relatively new in Ireland. The 81-mile Wicklow Way, from Dublin to
Clonegal, Co Carlow, was opened in 1981 and was the first long-distance
footpath in the republic.
My aged companion was anxious about how I would accomplish the journey back
from central Dublin to my parked car. 'You'll want to take the bus to Bray,
it's cheaper than the train,' he advised. 'But the hell with the money.
You're on holiday.'
In fact, those enjoying part of a holiday walking on the Way would be hard
pressed to spend very much. Despite its proximity (in motoring terms) to
major urban centres such as Dublin, Bray and Wicklow, the well-marked track
can feel as remote as the Himalayas.
The sense of distant timelessness may be linked to the geological history of
the region. The Wicklow mountains, an area approximately 30 miles by 25, are
nearly six times older than the Alps.
Probably the best-known peak is Sugar Loaf mountain, south of Dublin. Its
almost perfect conical shape is visible almost throughout the 20 miles of
walking closest to the city, although the Way never directly touches it.
Sugar Loaf has always been some sort of a focal point. Following the death
of Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party and home
rule advocate, his followers devised a novel lighthouse to be built on the
summit.
Considerable sums were donated but eventually, in the 1950s, the money was
used to provide books for the children's library at nearby Bray.
A more understandable historical project are the gardens of the Powerscourt
estate, skirted by the Wicklow Way as it ducks beneath the 300 ft
Powerscourt waterfall and edges around the deerpark. The Italian and
Japanese gardens were started in the 18th century by the Viscounts Wingfield
and are considered by some critics as the final flowering of the formal
aristocratic garden in Europe.
Back on the Wicklow Way, the serious walker is more likely to be interested
in the vegetation underfoot than the borders of Powerscourt. In the
mid-section much of the ground cover consists of heather. To the the south,
from Aghavannagh to Clonegal, the hills are lower and possessed of wondrous
green turf. But remember that the legend of the 'hungry grass' is prevalent
across Ireland.
Doctrine has it that when pedestrians tread on this fierce vegetation they
succumb to sudden weakness and hunger. Tradition explains that the grass
occurs where a famine victim died or a coffin was placed during a pause in a
mountain funeral procession.
The ITB (150 New Bond St, London W1, tel: 071-493-3201), publishes numerous
pamphlets on walking in Ireland, including a detailed guide to the Wicklow
Way.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: The jolly 'Swiss' of Argentina - Tom Lynch crosses
the Andes, European style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAN CARLOS de Bariloche is a make-believe Swiss chocolate-box resort in the
Andes, an Argentinian town that makes woollen goods and chocolate, takes
fondue and strudel seriously and has a natty line in log architecture.
The town square is a confident, dark-brown Swiss pastiche overlooking Lago
Nahuel Huapi. The concrete hotels have chalet-style wooden roofs and
shutters and telephone boxes on street corners have steep-pitched roofs.
However, yodelling is not encouraged.
Images of jolly Swiss peasants in costume are used to sell everything -
especially chocolate, fondue and woollens - to the tourists who are the
town's reason for existing. Bariloche is Argentina's main skiing resort, and
is busy with sightseers and hikers when the snow melts.
Whatever an architect might think of Bariloche, it is one of the best bases
to explore the Argentinian lake district, and the starting point for a
spectacular route across the Andes, using three boats and four buses on a
12-hour trip to Puerto Montt in Chile.
Sidetrips include chairlifts on the Cerro campanario and Cerro Catedral for
views of Nahuel Huapi and Lago Moreno, and drives through dramatic valleys
to cold, green lakes.
Inland is El Bolson, a little town in a deep, gentle bowl among the
mountains, a three-hour drive over high passes on unpredictable gravel
roads, past remote wooden houses - some are shacks like the shanties of
South American cities, some are sturdy cabins like the ones Wild West heroes
used to retire to with their best girl when their days of chasin' outlaws
was done.
El Bolson lies among orchards and trout rivers, and appears to be a refuge
for hippies who sell each other woollen and leather goods, wooden toys,
chocolate cake and wholefood in a street market under the massive, jagged,
gap-toothed Cerro Piltriquitron.
The trip to Chile from Bariloche starts at dawn, with a bus ride along the
shore of Lago Nahuel Huapi to Puerto Panuelos and a large catamaran across
the lake to Puerto Blest. A bus on a dirt road over a pass meets a more
basic ferry on Lago Frias, a deep, narrow, chilly, green gash in the
mountains, trees clinging to the steep sides.
At the end of the lake is Puerto Frias, no more than the Argentinian
frontier post and a log cabin for the guards. Another bus goes over another
pass, the shoulder of Cerro Tronador, a three-peaked extinct volcano - one
peak in Chile, one in Argentina and one split by the border - and runs down
to the Chilean frontier post on the edge of the village of Peulla, in an
altogether more pastoral landscape.
In winter, the trip cannot be done in one day. Peulla is the only place
where non-campers can stay the night, in B&amp;B's or in the wooden hotel, where
a brightly-painted traction engine is parked incongruously in the forecourt
 -made by Mitchells of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, in 1909.
About 300 years ago, a bunch of Jesuits, looking for people to convert,
reached the top of a ridge in the Andes and looked down on a long green-blue
lake, calm and cold between the snow- capped mountains and volcanoes of what
is now the Chilean Lake District.
It was All Saints' Day, so they called it Lago Todos los Santos, though the
more secular Lago Esmeralda is now gaining ground.
The lake steamer from Peulla to Petrohue doubles as local ferry and
post-bus. By the time the area became a national park, some people had
settled to graze livestock on the rich volcanic fields and take fish from
the clear lake. Their houses are still there.
The steamer stops to meet small boats, to pick up or drop parcels and
people. All the time, Osorno, the first of the great volcanoes of the
Chilean firebelt, grows larger, snow-covered with a plume of white smoke
drifting into the blue sky, steam escaping from a fissure on the slope. At
the end of the lake, where the boat pulls in to a pier beside a national
parks cabin, the cone of Osorno fills the sky and the road west is blasted
through red and black layers of cooled lava.
Travellers can turn north into the lake district, with its forests, and
volcanoes, or continue west past black volcanic beaches, through the forests
of alerces, the slowest-growing trees in the world, weird-shaped, as if
struck by lightning, which take up to 1,800 years to reach maturity.
The Germans who settled the area around the turn of the century
enthusiastically chopped the alerces down to build their cabins, until they
discovered how long it would take to renew them. Now the trees are protected
and forests of conifers are grown to build the wooden houses.
The little towns of the lakes still carry the German stamp, with houses,
shops and hotels straight out of inter-war central Europe. Fritz, who flies
the flag of Berlin outside his guest house in Villarica, tells with relief
how he was sent to Chile to work in early 1939.
The end of the road south and west is the fishing port of Puero Montt, with
the gloomy Club Alemane drinking den and a neo-brutalist concrete railway
station.
By the harbour, beyond the craft market, is a row of canteen shacks. Outside
each, a pot bubbles, full of mysterious seafood. The women shout at
passers-by, inviting them to taste the brew and come inside and eat.
Travellers with less than absolute confidence in their digestions should
head for the more recognisable seafood in the town's traditional cafes and
restaurants.
The cross-Andes trip was undertaken during a round-the-world journey
arranged through Trailfinders. London-Rio, overland to Santiago, Easter
Island, Tahiti, Sydney, Darwin, Cairns, Bangkok and London. Pounds 2,393.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: An encounter in Peshawar with Afghan men of war -
James Henderson watches buzkashi, a test of skill and a battle for power and
influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSIA AND INDIA have long been known for their horseback sports. Polo was
played there for centuries before it made its way to Britain. At their
centre, Peshawar (now in the North West Frontier of Pakistan) has seen
countless waves of horseborne raiders and polo players pass through.
Recently it has seen another sport, brought by the Afghan refugees fleeing
the war in their country.
Driving along the old Charsadda Road out of Peshawar on a Friday morning, we
passed a stream of horsemen trotting after one another. Dressed in huge
coats, they sat deep in fleece saddles, their legs thrust forward in leather
stirrups. They were Afghans; by their Mongol features we could tell that
many were from the central Asian steppes.
They congregated on a patch of open ground where there was a frenzied crush
of horses, constantly shuffling and kicking up billowing clouds of brown
dust. Suddenly a horse emerged at the gallop, knees and hooves flailing, its
rider high in the saddle. He spurred his horse away, chased by other riders
who grappled at him, but eventually he broke free and charged off.
It was a game of buzkashi, a traditional Afghan pastime, uprooted from the
highland valleys and the northern plains of Afghanistan and brought to
Peshawar by the refugees. In a time of war, this is one of the few pleasures
that they allow themselves. These men are the descendants of the central
Asian hordes - Mongol horsemen at play.
Originally, buzkashi evolved as a test of skill for the horseman, leisure as
an extension of work, in which the players competed for the control of a
dead calf. It may seem like a rough business (just as you hear lurid stories
of polo games played with the heads of war victims, so buzkashi was
reputedly played with their bodies), but it is also a clear and subtle
expression of the Afghan way of life. Superficially, the riders are
struggling for control of the calf, but beneath the breathtaking spectacle
there is a parallel struggle for local power and influence.
As each rider makes a successful run, wresting the calf free and charging
off, he drops the carcass back in the centre of the press and rides over to
one of the older men watching on horseback a little away from the main
action.
These are the khans, the patrons of the game. They hand over money to the
skilled rider (the khan is perhaps the owner of the horse that he is
riding). The rider becomes famous but his khan gains even more in stature.
In a country where political power may only stretch for a few miles within a
fertile valley, a successful buzkashi will extend a khan's influence.
A crowd of spectators had gathered, clustered on high ground above the field
of play. Vendors plied up and down with plastic bags of nuts and sliced
sugar cane, a sweet thirst-quencher in the heat of the Pakistan winter.
The word buzkashi means 'goat-dragging,' but generally the riders use the
carcass of a calf. Its head and hooves are chopped off, making it more
difficult to grab, and it is gutted. It can weigh as much as 100lbs, so it
is a vast weight to lift with one hand (the other hanging onto the saddle),
particularly when feet, stirrups and horses hooves are thrashing about in
the dust.
When it has been hauled up into the saddle and the rider is trying to make
his way out of the crush, other riders will try to grab it from his hands by
pulling at another leg. It is so heavy that the rider has to lean over to
counterbalance the weight. Horses are even trained to ride in a circle to
make the balancing easier.
As with the rest of Afghan life, there are few formal rules. The riders
simply congregate and when there are enough of them to make a game, they
start to play. There are no referees and no limits to the pitch. It is a
violent crush, but the riders rarely seem to come unseated. Just as in real
life, informal alliances are struck between riders as they reach for the
calf. A 'run' is made when a rider breaks free, carrying the calf, and
outpaces the others. Early on, a new calf is unwieldy and difficult to catch
hold of, but it softens as the game hots up; the game continues until it
disintegrates.
We stood as close as we dared, about 50 yards from the centre. I have a
picture of a friend running at full stretch with a posse bearing down on
him. He nearly had to jump into the river to get clear, but he survived
unscathed; one man we saw was carted off to hospital.
The frenzy of the game is compelling. In the shifting melee the horses move
against one another, bulk against bulk, in a fearsome merry-go-round. Whip
clenched between his teeth, a rider on the fringes who wants to get into the
centre will rear his horse and jump it forward, forcing his way into the
middle. In the crush, a horse's head rears and for a split second it freezes
against the skyline, mouth open wide and eyes staring wildly. The riders are
manoeuvring, trying to get above the calf, looking for an opportunity to
reach down and grab it.
In the confusion a space opens and a man drops from the saddle, just keeping
his grip in the stirrups, leaning to grasp the calf from among the stamping
hooves. He heaves himself back into the saddle and hooks the calf under his
thigh. He kicks his horse on, cutting a path out of the crush, looking to
break free. But another man is at his side, also grappling for the prize. He
lunges and grasps the calf by another leg. Their horses cut free and gallop
side by side, followed by a pack of other riders.
The two men face each other, locked in combat over the calf that is slung
between them. But the first man, whose grip is more secure, turns his horse
sharply and the calf slips from the other's grasp. Still galloping, the
victor heaves at his burden, leans sideways again and charges off alone, 100
yards clear. Then he turns back towards the crush. Triumphant, he trots
until he gets within 10 yards and then he spurs horse into the melee,
rearing it up on its back legs to get into the centre. As he comes to a halt
he drops the calf to the ground again, ready for the next play.
A moment later he trots over to the khans to collect his reward. He is
accompanied by a huge man in thigh-length leather boots, coarse woollen coat
open to the waist and Charles Bronson moustache, who addresses the crowd,
shouting how bravely the deed was performed.
The crowd laughs when he describes how, with all that exertion, the rider's
hat flew off. The crier praises the rider and the horse. As the rider
collects his money, the man praises the khan who is the horse's owner.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: Only an earthquake disturbed the peace - David
Pilling visits Tobago, a backwater hoping to establish itself on the
globetrotter's itinerary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AS OUR JEEP shuddered around the twists and turns of Tobago's churned-up
roads, a small earthquake struck. Tectonic plates collided, lights went out,
and buildings shook in the capital, Scarborough. In a remote seismological
centre, the Richter scale needle edged its way towards 4.5. The passengers
of our jeep, however, remained blissfully unaware of this momentous event.
Tobago's roads are so rutted and our vehicle was in so advanced a state of
stuttering and clattering that the mere convulsions of the Earth's crust
were not likely to affect us one way or the other. Tobagonian roads ought
not to be this bad. Only a few miles away, on the twin island of Trinidad,
is one of the world's largest sources of asphalt. Pitch Lake, the planet's
only natural wonder resembling a parking lot, supplies asphalt to smooth the
path of motorists in New York and Paris. Paradise to a hassled New Yorker
may be two weeks in Tobago's beach-fringed serenity. But to a Tobagonian
driver, heaven is a straight road in Brooklyn with no potholes. Not that
bumpy roads should worry the would-be tourist. This is all part of Tobago's
character and serves to confirm its reputation as one of the Caribbean's
least commercially developed islands. Unlike most destinations in the
region, Tobago has not changed much over the past 50 years. Beaches really
are deserted and the tourist still finds himself regarded as an interesting
novelty rather than a walking dispenser of hard currency. Sheltered
economically by oil-rich Trinidad, Tobago has not wooed international
tourists with the same gusto as its more financially fragile neighbours.
With a population of a mere 40,000, it maintains the rural atmosphere of a
bygone, gentler era. The first item of news I heard on local radio was that
a watch with a black leather strap had been found in Scarborough; anyone
claiming it was invited to contact the radio station. This, I concluded, was
an island living in a different age. The fact that Tobagonian advertisements
still promote Guinness as being good for you only served to confirm my
impression.
Although tiny - 26 miles by nine - Tobago is topographically so rugged, so
choked in virgin forest and so sparsely populated that it appears much
larger. Driving around the island it is easy to feel, as one plunges past
verdant hillsides - so green and fecund they resemble mounds of freshly
tossed salad - that one is exploring a country of far greater dimensions.
Tobago has more in common ecologically with the South American mainland
(just seven miles from Trinidad) than with most other Caribbean islands.
Trinidad broke off the Venezuelan landmass thousands of years ago, and
Tobago in turn snapped off its larger neighbour like a fragment of tooth,
before drifting to the north-east.
The islands consequently boast an extraordinary array of bird and plant
life; for instance, there are 17 varieties of hummingbird, the smallest of
which - the tufted coquette - is outsized by some types of Trinidadian bees.
Such is the proximity of the twin-island state with Venezuela,that the
islands' national bird, the scarlet ibis, divides its time between the two.
A tourist official told me that the fighter-plane-shaped birds, as vibrant
as neon lights, leave Trinidad's Caroni swamp in dignified silence (that
being the British heritage) and flock back from Venezuela late at night in a
Latin-like state of raucous revelry.
Tobago itself resembles much of central Africa, its hillsides a matted green
web of palms and trees, lianas and creaking bamboo. The air is heavy with
ooze and sap; all around one hears bleating goats, chirruping birds and
cicadas making such a din they sound like the clattering of a shopping cart
over cobblestones.
Tobago, unlike Trinidad, is almost entirely rural, the majority of its
largely black population garnering some income from fishing or agriculture.
The capital, Scarborough - population 4,000 - is more of a market than a
town; the only event I saw carrying the least hint of frayed urban tempers
was two men arguing over the price of fish.
In one day we managed, at fairly leisurely pace, to circumnavigate the
island, with the exception of one section of road which a Rastafarian
goatherd assured us was too precarious even for our four-wheeled vehicle.
The names of Tobago's hamlets, districts and towns - Auchensklock, Bacolet,
Glamorgan, Mesopotamia, Prince's Bay and Trois Rivieres - conjure up the
island's turbulent history which saw it change hands among colonial powers
no fewer than 31 times in 100 years. Even the Latvians held sway for one
brief period.
Our circuit took us through scores of villages, usually small clusters of
stilted wooden houses strewn higgledy-piggledy on the steep hillsides. Most
boasted a general store, opening hours 'anytime'. Many had a blackboard
nailed by the door with chalk scrawls advertising specials such as oxtail,
shark steaks, cow heel and goat meat. One bore the curious announcement:
'Meat for dogs. Rice for dogs.'
Many hamlets were so small that their stores doubled as watering holes and
gossip shops. 'First and Last Cafe and Bar in Castara,' one banner warned.
Tobago, evidently, was not the place for comparative shopping.
We were tempted into many a local rum shop, most of them dark dens of
alcoholism entered through grimy bead curtains. Their proprietors, evidently
keen to instil an air of respectability, had often tacked up notices
entreating the clientele: 'Discuss don't Cuss.' One had a neatly handwritten
sign on the door of the lavatory beseeching customers: 'Please Don't Soil Me
with Filt.'
We ended up at the eastern end of the island, in Charlotteville, a tiny
horseshoe fishing bay whose forested hills rolled into the sea of cat's-eye
green. While we were there a wooden fishing boat - the No Problem - drifted
to the sandy beach, an event marked by the doleful sound of a conch horn.
As the kingfish were unloaded, weighed and gutted on a stone slab, streams
of people emerged from the surrounding hills to make their purchases. The
sea lapped onto the narrow sandy beach, and a couple of grey pelicans eyed
the scraps of fish with nonchalance.
The tranquility of Tobago, typified by Charlotteville, may not last long.
The runway at Crown Point airport has recently been extended to allow jumbo
jets to land. Tourists from America and Europe will now be able to fly
directly to Tobago without the inconvenience of having to change aircraft in
Trinidad. There are plans to build more hotels on the island, with several
big international chains having shown interest.
The government expresses its determination to pursue an environmentally
sensitive form of tourism, by which it means it hopes to attract
high-spending tourists in relatively low volume.
However, once Tobago has established its place on the globetrotter's
itinerary, it may be hard to control numbers. Next time the ground
reverberates in Scarborough, it may not be an earthquake - just another
jumbo jet rumbling overhead.
David Pilling flew c/o BWIA International (London reservations:
071-839-9333) which operates non-stop flights to Tobago once a week from
Heathrow (Apex fares from Pounds 689 return).
Accommodation was arranged by the Mount Irvine Hotel and Golf Club, Tobago.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Private View: Unrequited passion of the autograph hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO DIE unrequited must be the worst sort of death, a punishment for the
wicked or the wickedly idle.
So I was puzzled when Miron Grindea, in the middle of explaining how he had
persuaded so many famous names to contribute to his literary magazine, Adam,
broke off, shot me a sorrowful look and said:
'I wanted to tell you that I die - because I have to die soon - a very
bitter man.'
Grindea will be 83 next week. He is fighting failing health and faltering
memory to bring out an issue on Joyce Cary to mark Adam's 50th anniversary
last September.
His first Adam emerged two years after Grindea had been left stranded in
Britain by the war, a Romanian music critic on holiday from Paris with his
pianist wife, few possessions and not a word of English. It had an
introduction by HG Wells, a message from George Bernard Shaw and items by
Thomas Mann, Stefan Zweig and Cecil Day-Lewis.
I asked whether his No. 500 would be his last.
'I don't know what to say. I'm very traumatic about it. If I'm strong enough
to write . . . I am a very desperate man.' His desperation seemed to have
something to do with misprints. (The first issue contained a 'derriere
pensee' instead of an 'arriere' one). Then he told me of his afflictions, of
which arthritis and asthma were the least.
'I am haunted by my approaching death,' he said. 'I would like to end not
with . . . what you call in English . . . with a bang, but with a bit of a
confessional. I think Adam story has a few things to leave behind, not so
much about my humble person, because genuinely I am a moderate specimen of
the human race.'
Is he aggrieved because he never made money? He doesn't seem so.
'I crawled along, sometimes with a few benefactors' (they included TS Eliot,
EM Forster, JB Priestley, Rebecca West and Isaiah Berlin). He was too
disorganised to collect from his 500-odd subscribers or to put in for the
occasional Arts Council grants.
For three years in the 1960s he earned Dollars 10,000 a year as an associate
professor at the University of Rochester, New York. ('So my wife had no more
reason to divorce me]') But for most of his life he has been'dancing on the
cord, doing the trapeze'. His wife, Carola, taught at the Guildhall School
of Music for 25 years and still works, advising pianists on avoiding
muscular strain.
If you had been a real businessman would you have continued for so long?
'I don't think so. I don't know if you approve, but I don't think it's right
to run a magazine of this eccentricity if you have a sheltered life. For
instance Mr Cyril Connolly (whose Horizon lived a mere 10 years) had a
millionaire supporter and two secretaries. I never had this luxury. I don't
think the essence of running a magazine of this fantasy, of this
impertinence - because it was always a magazine of great cheek - is to
tremble for its tomorrow from day to day.'
The thought of the pampered and aristocratic Connolly seemed to fill Grindea
with strong emotions. He was breathing heavily.
But the editor of Adam has had his share of worldly recognition. He proudly
showed me his Legion d'Honneur certificate, his MBE and OBE medals. Why then
should he die unrequited?
'I die a bitter man in the sense of sad man. Although I have been married to
this very great woman and I am surrounded by musician grandchildren I would
have loved ADAM . . . my ideal, my conceit . . . I would have loved to reach
the elegance of a Cyril Connolly. I would love to have the talent of Cyril
Connolly. because he would ejaculate on a page, you know. Incidentally, I
hear his punctuation was hopeless. I devoted sacks of blood, of my life.
Every issue I jump from one precipice of research to another.'
Do you feel you haven't achieved what you wanted?
'How can I say? Flaubert would roll on the carpet to pick up the mot juste.
Well, I'm not Flaubert and even now, after 51 years here, I can't go like
you to the typewriter. I write longhand, five, six versions till I find the
mot juste.
'People like Edith Sitwell or EM Forster would pat me on the shoulder and
say 'Oh, Mr Grindea, don't be so neurotic, you coin new words for us.' But I
know the length of my nose, I know the modesty of my editorial gift.
'I think I was quite an impertinent, successful, searcher. But I had only
two elbows and two shoulders, you know. And I die bitter because I would
have loved the magazine to be something really super. One can't create
miracles.'
Did you have any other ambition?
'As a child, I would have loved to be an orchestral conductor, yes. Ja. As a
child in my village, a monkey, in front of the . . . I would conduct.'
Perhaps you are a writer manque?
'No, I don't think so. I never attempted. I never had any ambitions. No, I'm
not manque. I think my only little testament, if the Almighty gives me
another year or two, I would like to write the story of Adam.'
If it is not poverty or frustrated literary leanings, what is it that casts
Grindea down? Literary spite?
He told me he was very upset that he had been left out of the Pelican Guide
to English Literature. He had been very hurt, he said, by Frederick Raphael
(some of whose early stories he published) describing him as a literary
beggar. He was hurt again by Alan Ross, editor of the London Magazine,
writing that people contributed to his review in order to get rid of him.
'A man who is sufficiently lunatic to publish eight numbers on Proust alone,
three on Balzac, or two on Dylan Thomas . . . This is not begging material]'
But you do at least have the gift of being able to talk people round?
'No. This was an idea of the BBC.' (BBC 2 made a programme about him). 'I am
not a sorcerer.'
Were there times when you tried desperately to get something and were
unsuccessful?
'I never try desperately. I persevere in a lyrical way, with great
enthusiasm. And I never became a nuisance. I was never a beggar.'
As proof of diligent research he could have added that among the people he
unearthed were a waiter friend of Marcel Proust's, Tolstoy's last secretary
and Franz Kafka's niece - who was living at Rottingdean on the English south
coast.
His publishing scoops include stories by Chekhov, letters by Dickens,
Berlioz, Andre Gide and Katherine Mansfield, a play by Sartre, poems by
Picasso (whose instant caricature of Adam's editor is shown above), sonnets
by Mozart's cataloguer Kochel, drawings by Cocteau and Henry Moore.
'I met many noble poets. I knew the great Paul Valery and went to see him
after liberation. He said something legendary and I have to boast when I
write my memoirs. It was: Vous etes le microbe dont nous avons besoin. 'You
are the virus which we need.' It was very fine metaphor.'
What exactly did he mean?
'He said that out of nothing I created a little magazine.'
Perhaps 'germ' is a better word, I said.
Grindea says he and his wife went on their knees and wept to persuade Dame
Myra Hess not to lock up her Steinway at the outbreak of war. He persuaded
Shaw to play some Beethoven, sat at Ezra Pound's bedside, bought orangeade
for Dylan Thomas, was encouraged by Graham Greene and Bertrand Russell, was
serenaded with a musical ditty by Darius Milhaud . . . and still he says he
is a desperate man.
Is it because of the way the English literati have treated you? Are they
jealous of your scoops?
'No, because I don't count. Really, I am not sentimentalising. I didn't
belong and I don't belong.'
Although, he said, 'the English shark tank is only small fry', he had never
been able to join the English literary crowd, to stand around in pubs
watching darts and drinking pint after pint. 'For me it's not a
weltanschauung.
'Every civilised Englishman on the Continent drinks his glass of cognac and
sits down like a human being. In this country, including the famous pubs
around Broadcasting House, the same Englishman becomes, not a beast, but a
different specimen.
'So I die an outsider. Just as Adam has been tolerated in this country, I
die as a sort of crank, as a man who doesn't understand cricket.'
Grindea is a magpie, an autograph-hunter in the true sense. He flatters
(women especially), yet in a manner so flowery as to seem quaint rather than
calculating. Naturally, he is feeling his age. But his self-pity and
pessimism struck me as more of a habit than a condition.
What would you like as your epitaph. Have you thought about that?
'No.' After reflection, he said: 'I would like that it be remembered that I
lived in Kensington, opposite the house where Angus Wilson lived and Eliot
in the mews next door; that I also lived for so many years, and that I
produced Adam.
'Adam, I think, will survive, if the atomic bomb doesn't hurt the British
Library or the Bibliotheque Nationale. Adam will survive by the editorials,
because I accumulated material which sometimes I spent three years for
research. This was my type of lunacy.
'Quand meme,' he reflected finally, 'I have done something.'
As I took my leave I thought that Grindea, who had been so perky on my
arrival, so animated by his reminiscences, looked crushed and empty. I felt,
in some obscure way, to blame. Was this ability to inspire guilt, I
wondered, after all the secret of Miron Grindea's seeming failure and
strange success?

FT  25 JAN 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Amis for Tolstoy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IF THOSE poor Russians had had the advantages I've had
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
halibut oil capsules at school, tennis lessons, exotic travel and the joy of
good books - then they would not be in the mess they are now. Which is why I
responded, this week, to Book Aid's invitation to donate books for Russia
and the republics. The MI Rudomino State Library for Foreign Literature is
hoping to receive and distribute 1m English-language books. They especially
asked for works of philosophy, technical manuals, ecological books,
religious books and detective stories. So I skipped to my shelves and
fossicked along them. I am fond of carnal pleasures; but when my youthful
morn hath travell'd on to age's steepy night, and all those beauties whereof
now I'm king are vanishing, or vanish'd out of sight, I will still have my
beautiful books. Minus, that is, those books that I parted with this week,
that I popped into a carrier bag and handed in at Waterstone's bookshop in
Notting Hill Gate so that they could be forwarded to the Russians. I made my
selections carefully. After all, these books are likely to be read by 50,
100, perhaps 500 people. And a book can change a life - or history. I did
not want to fill the carrier bag with any old books. I wanted to pass on to
the Russians only books I would be sad to part with. My first choice was the
handbook from the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, together with Robert
Lenzner's The Great Getty: The Life and Loves of the Richest Man in the
World. My intention was to show those incipient capitalists in Russia that
they, too, could amass unbelievable riches if they got their fingers out.
But I also wanted to warn them. Not for nothing did John Kenneth Galbraith
describe the Lenzner book as 'an eloquent and terrible warning to all who
are struggling to get rich.' Choice No 2 was Blanche d'Alpuget's Robert J.
Hawke, a biography of the man who was until recently prime minister of
Australia. I have a soft spot for Bob Hawke. In earlier times, he drank and
womanised heroically. But so what? Ms d'Alpuget's book will spread
enlightenment and cheer throughout the Russian wastes, and show what fun can
be had in a democracy as pixilated as Australia's.
To balance things up, I also chose John Bryson's Evil Angels, a study of the
Lindy Chamberlain 'dingo baby' case - an appalling stain on Australia's
conscience which showed how, even in a democracy, prejudice, ignorance and a
psycopathic Press can wreak hideous damage.
Choice No 4 was Nicholas Tomalin Reporting, a collection of pieces by the
great British journalist killed on the Golan front line in 1973. Tomalin's
The General Goes Zapping Charlie Kong, from the Sunday Times of June 5 1966,
is one of the most famous examples of British journalism this century. I
want them to read it in Russia. (Just to be honest, I also popped into the
carrier bag a copy of Wednesday's Sun. God, how pitiful).
I have a lot of American books, so choice No 5 was Ian Frazier's Great
Plains for its affectionate portrait of the immense, short-grass
prairie-lands of America. I want them to understand in Russia that there is
more to the US than drugs and guns and ghetto poverty; there is also space
and sky and sparrow-hawks - and (still) a little hope.
I did not want to over-do the sentimentality, so choice No 6 was Frances
FitzGerald's Cities on a Hill: A Journey Through Contemporary American
Culture, wherein the Pulitzer-rewarded Ms FitzGerald shines the searchlight
of her powerful reporter-historian's talent into corners dark and lurid, not
least the New Age community in Oregon founded by one of my favourite
air-heads, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.
Choice No 7 was My Gastronomy by Nico Ladenis, if for no better reason than
to convey the recipe for escalopina de saumon a la creme de ciboulette into
all the little towns of the new republics.
And choice No 8 was Arthur C. Clarke's July 20 2019: Life in the 21st
Century, to show the Russians how we in Notting Hill are heading, pell-mell,
for a life of IQ enhancers, bionic implants, household robots, levitating
cars, holographic movies and zero-gravity sex.
I could have gone on; but I wanted to include some fiction, so I stuffed the
carrier bag full with EL Doctorow, John Updike, Peter Carey, Nicholas
Mosley, Nadine Gordimer, Andre Brink, Patrick White, EM Forster, Kingsley
and Martin Amis, JG Ballard, Robertson Davies, William Burroughs, William
Faulkner, Carolyn Chute, Kazuo Ishiguro, David Lodge, William Golding, John
le Carre, Natalie Zemon Davis, Marguerite Yourcenar and Henry Miller.
I could have wept to see those books go. But they will set some socks on
fire in Mother Russia.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Aids can sell papers, not clothes: All sides are 'united in
revulsion' at the latest Benetton advertisements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BACK page of yesterday's Guardian is dominated by a picture of a man
dying of Aids. He is being comforted by his family. It is, if you go in for
this sort of thing, a moving picture, the sort which I imagine has graced
the pages of the Guardian many times before, and probably of a number of
other newspapers who regard the Aids virus as being of pressing interest to
a large number of their male readership.
But the Guardian, on this occasion, was not in the business of soliciting
sympathy for Aids victims. It was more in the business of soliciting lack of
sympathy for a clothing company, Benetton.
You see, Benetton, an Italian clothing retailer, planned to use the picture,
without comment, as an advertisement for their latest clothes. And, boy, are
people unsympathetic about it.
One newspaper, which devoted most of its front page to the story yesterday
claimed that 'A shocking advertising campaign by clothing giants Benetton
united health officials, the fashion world and a leading charity in
revulsion last night. It features a real-life Aids victim being comforted on
his death-bed by his grieving family.'
Presumably had the picture been of an actor pretending to be dying of Aids,
health officials, the fashion world, and a leading charity would not be
'united in revulsion,' but perhaps united only in slight distaste.
I think rather that Benetton should be praised for producing one of the few
advertisements which are not make-believe, incorporating all the tricks of
the acting profession and the imaginations of highly creative film
producers. I am still reeling from being authoritatively told that all the
products you see in food advertisements are painted. You would probably die
of lead poisoning if you actually eat food prepared in such a way, but it
looks yummy.
The Health Education Authority would prefer that Aids was portrayed by
advertisers as they treat food: very appetisingly.
Its spokeswoman, Lynn Walsh, commented that 'To show such a bleak
pessimistic picture doesn't help anybody. Although Aids is deadly many
people enjoy years of life before falling ill.'
How true. Perhaps if Benetton had superimposed a slogan on the dying man's
shirt which read 'I'm dying of Aids but I've had a good time', the Health
Education Authority would feel that decency had been satisfied. That
admittedly would reduce the advertisement from being merely obscure to being
dishonest - but nobody minds dishonesty when it reassures their own
prejudices.
At the heart of the outrage being expressed against Benetton is the charge
that the Italian company is 'exploiting Aids for profit'.
I have never understood this particular aspect of English puritanism, that
regards the desire to shock and be paid for it, as inherently more sinful
than the desire to shock and be subsidised for it, or, in other words, why,
as Digby Anderson of the Social Affairs Unit once expressed it, 'Exotic,
loss-making homosexual pornography is a cause to campaign for, but highly
profitable mass market, heterosexual pornography is not.'
American Vogue has robustly decided to run the Benetton advertising
campaign. But English magazines have not. Margaret Alderson, The editor of
Elle magazine is to leave blank the double page spread booked by Benetton
for its next issue, and will instead carry a letter from Anderson,
explaining why the ad had been dropped.
She told the Guardian it was 'incredibly insulting'. What I suppose she
means is that the ad would insult so many of her readers that the profit
from selling the space would be outweighed by the losses caused by cancelled
subscriptions. Like Benetton, exactly like Benetton, Alderson is in business
to please her consumers.
You might have noticed that although the press has managed to 'unite in
revulsion' the fashion, health care and charity industries, it has failed in
what must have been its first objective, to gain a 'revolted'
on-the-record-quote from the mother of David Kirby, the Aids victim
portrayed. That is because Mrs Kirby consented to the photograph being used,

FT  25 JAN 92 / Let's hear it for the buskers: Fran Kaplan argues in favour
of entertainment on the Underground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRAN KAPLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JOB description: Be your own boss, get paid cash, plenty of
opportunities to meet people of all different nationalities (be they
snap-happy Japanese tourists or Belgian tap-dancers.) NB: A love of travel
is useful. The job: busking on the London Underground.
To a student unable to find summer holiday work in the present economic
climate, busking presents an attractive option. People-watching is a
favorite pastime, and what better place to do it than at the bottom of an
escalator where I get paid for singing Italian opera.
With such an occupation, I am inviting some reaction. No reaction is
unusual. Raised eyebrows, looks of absolute horror, an occasional Pounds 5
note for showing such guts and too many foreign coins come my way. In the
summer, Italians, who tend to travel in swarms, hover and are quick to
interrupt if my pronounciation of their language does not satisfy them.
Silver-haired old ladies, with hands veined like old china, stop to chat and
try to save me from the street. 'My son's with the London Sinfonietta, you
know.' Yes, and I'm Nigel Kennedy.
Ask buskers how much they take in an hour and you will receive some
colourful accounting. I started singing on the Underground in 1988.
Fellow-performers were earning Pounds 10 to Pounds 25 an hour (tax-free),
depending on their originality. Beaten-out metal drums from the West Indies
were popular, and the tap dancer who requested commuters to stop talking in
'his' theatre also gained quite a following.
But the recession has had an effect. My own experience is that income per
hour from busking in the City, London's financial heartland, is considerably
less than in the West End. Or, to put it differently, City commuters are
stingy] Besides which, how do they know I won't be the next La Stupenda?
It is accepted in the trade that there are 'generosity groupings.' Single
women tend not to give, especially to female performers. I find Asian and
African men are fascinated by the opera and often dig deep into their
pockets, while couples are either embarrassed by my amorous songs or feel
threatened and suddenly find the tiled floor more interesting.
Middle-aged businessmen will give to guitarists only rarely - there are
simply too many strumming out the same tunes and these men are hardened Tube
travellers. When together, however,they are eager to show their
liberal-mindedness and appreciation of music (particularly if it is
classical) and donate their change graciously to 'those poor students.'
I must concede that some of my fellow-buskers harass passengers. Buskers who
perform in the actual carriages often intimidate people into giving them
money. These buskers may be dressed aggressively or have a 'bottler' with
them - an accomplice who does the collecting. This is simply a form of
mugging.
Posters asking passengers not to support buskers have been put up but,
unfortunately for entertainers like myself, they do not specify who are the
buskers who entertain and who are the ones who intimidate. If the profession
gets a bad name my take-home pay is reduced, so I would welcome harsher
fines for these 'performers.'
In other countries, the authorities seem to deal better with Underground
players, often letting the generosity of the commuters decide their fate. In
Moscow, where the subway is a tourist attraction, seven-piece jazz bands may
be found in the station forecourts and the long underpasses. But although
these attract large crowds, people's generosity is fading fast in the
present political and economic climate.
Regie Autonome de Transporte Parisian (RATP), the company which owns the
Paris Metro, has legislated on busking, encouraging performers who entertain
but clamping down on those who block passages and present safety hazards.
Paris is the busking capital of the world and, because of increasing
competition for prime 'pitches,' players must pass an audition with the
Musicians' Union in order to receive an official pass. Buskers without one
are moved on or arrested and may even have their instruments confiscated.
Some may argue that Tube music cannot be avoided (and so imposes a social
cost on passengers, adding to the rising cost of public transport), But
rarely can a performer be heard on the platform. The passengers reserve the
right not to show their appreciation. The irony of the situation is that
London Underground Ltd believes it acceptable to play music through the
public address system.
If you have managed to persuade a wall in the station to accept your money
and give you a ticket, and you have escaped the clutches of the automatic
rottweilers (ie, the new ticket gates), the soothing tones of Italian opera
or the breathtaking skill of three bongo drummers will reassure you that,
whatever LUL thinks, you are a human being and not ticket-machine fodder.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: 'La Duena' resurrected - Max Loppert reviews Gerhard's
tantalising, musically rich opera in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE stage of the Teatro La Zarzuela, a delightful theatre built to house
the eponymous Spanish operetta genre and currently serving as Madrid's opera
house, something unusual is this month under way. At first it does not seem
so: the curtain opens on an 18th-century Seville street scene. Out of the
orchestra pit leap flashing Spanish rhythms and colours, reminiscent of
innumerable favourite zarzuela numbers.
But then beneath them one starts to appreciate a distinctly un-zarzuela-like
harmonic idiom, full of keen 20th-century asperities. A young man dressed
like Rossini's Almaviva picks up a guitar and, after flurries of comic
delay, begins to serenade at a window - but it is in English that he sings,
an 18th-century English graced with lines like 'Unveil those beauteous
eyes'. Spanish surtitles pour out at speed on the proscenium-arch screen.
What is happening is, in fact, a piece of cultural history in the making.
For this is the stage premiere of La Duena, a three-act comic opera closely
based on Sheridan's The Duenna. It is taking place four decades after the
work was first heard, in a 1949 BBC radio performance; and, as it is by
Roberto Gerhard, it represents - as did Gerhard himself - a remarkable,
unrepeatable Anglo-Iberian fusion. Gerhard, born in Catalonia in 1896, came
to England in 1939 as a post-Civil War exile, and died here in in 1970,
having become in his final years one of the most celebrated figures of the
British modern-music scene.
In spite of currently undergoing a patch of neglect, the scores of his
extraordinary late flowering as a modernist - the Fourth and Fifth
Symphonies, the chamber pieces Gemini, Libra and Leo - remain absolutely
fresh, their adventures in form guided by a dazzlingly personal command of
means. But though Gerhard came to consider himself an English composer, he
was more than that: a figure who from his youth concerned himself with both
his native musical inheritance and that of all Europe.
The fact that he could seek to study with the most significant figure in the
20th-century Spanish renewal, Pedrell, and then with Schoenberg in Vienna
and Berlin, suggests the peculiar breadth of his cultural preoccupations. It
is in this light that his single opera (Gerhard always referred to it as La
Duena, and kept the name-forms of Sheridan's characters in Spanish) must be
examined. It is a comic opera that searches out its place in several
distinct traditions: 18th-century comedy of manners, zarzuela, opera buffa,
the Spanish folk-music inheritance, the Second Viennese School musical
dialectic.
Only a mind creatively untrammelled could contemplate such a marriage of
differences. In the post-war world it guaranteed Gerhard the worst of all
possible receptions: in cosy, closed-minded Britain his Schoenberg
connections were a terrible disadvantage, while in Germany (where at a 1951
modern-music festival it was given in concert) the 'accessible', popular
side of the music was viewed with puritan horror. Several Duena stagings
were planned and then dropped; in 1971 it was given in shortened form on
Radio 3.
This Madrid production is in significant part the achievement of the scholar
David Drew, a lifelong Gerhard enthusiast, who has made this amplified Duena
edition and revision (the details of which, and much else about Gerhard, can
be learnt in a fascinating two-part article in the December and January
issues of Opera). At this 'post-modernist' stage in European operatic
history the work's multifaceted nature should cause no parti pris
disapproval: it was certainly time for a Duena re-examination, and touching
that Gerhard's native land should choose to undertake it.
One went to Madrid hoping for a triumphant reversal of fortune. But the
situation seems to me more complicated. Many of the opera's parts - solos,
concerted numbers, finales - are quite marvellously brilliant and beautiful,
bounding with Falla-like rhythmic energy and clarity of sound, vocally and
orchestrally scintillating. As a comic-opera whole it proves misshapen,
fitfully paced, intermittently overscored, strangely numb and unidiomatic in
conversational passages, and - pace Drew - simply too long.
The Sheridan play, though Gerhard lit upon it with fervent appetite, seems
now a liability. Comedy based on physical ugliness is both Politically
Incorrect and, worse, boring; though the hints of Sheridan's anti-Semitism
were sedulously removed, there remains a queasy undertone to the
relationship of the disguised Duenna and the Portuguese Jew Isaac Mendoza.
On Madrid evidence I find La Duena a tantalising, musically rich first-opera
failure, of a kind that ought to have had companies lavishing on Gerhard
subsequent opportunities to perfect his undoubted gift for the medium. That
the opposite happened affords in itself a painful reminder of the wider
20th-century musical crisis.
All this said, I'd now like to see and hear the work in Britain - in Madrid
it was quite mad not to play it in translation - in a production less archly
busy (full of dancing streetfolk) than Jose Carlos Plaza's, and in a theatre
where the music might sound less constantly loud. It was intelligently cast
with notable British singing-actors - David Rendall, Anthony Michaels-Moore,
Richard Van Allan, Anne Mason and Sharon Cooper (a not quite 'finished',
hugely promising young soprano lead) among them - and with two wonderfully
tactful leading performers in Felicity Palmer (Duenna) and the Spanish
baritone Enrique Baquerizo (who sings in excellent English) as Don Isaac.
The admirable conductor, plainly a Gerhard habitue, is Antoni Ros Marba, the
theatre's music director. Radio 3 transmits a live relay from Madrid this
Thursday; the production goes to the Barcelona Liceu next month.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 will be the Anniversary Edition,
though the 50th anniversary is not until January 29. Every paper in the
country must have had a piece about this feature. On Tuesday I went to a
good party given by David Hatch, Managing Director of BBC Radio; yet even
after that I have no private knowledge, no secret scandal, to add (everyone
knows by now that tomorrow's castaway is the Prime Minister.) The fact is
that there is no significant private knowledge to know. Almost childishly
simple as it is, Desert Island Discs, invented by Roy Plomley, remains
compulsive listening. To my mind, this is largely because of the talent of
its current presenter, Sue Lawley, and its succession of directors that
choose the castaways.
Miss Lawley deals with the famous or the modest, the intellectual or the
downbeat, with never a hint of flattery or condescension, and many a BBC
interviewer could learn from her. With respect to Roy Plomley, whose estate
still takes its weekly share, and whom I counted as a friend, he was not in
her class. Michael Parkinson was not in their class either, and knew it. Sue
Lawley spoke at the DID party on Tuesday, with wit and intelligence that
must have impressed the many witty and intelligent ex-castaways who heard
her - politicians, princesses, retired archbishops, retired ordinary seamen,
retired editors of Punch, the lot.
The Sunday Play on Radio 3 was a Marivaux comedy, Successful Strategies.
Fluently translated by Timberlake Wertenbaker, given lively direction
(originally for the World Service) by Hilary Norrish, it fluttered through
the speakers like a butterfly, making only transient impressions and leaving
nothing behind. It concerns the affairs of two pairs of French aristocrats,
Dorante and the Comtesse and the Chevalier and the Marquise. Love is not
seriously involved, just appearances - the Comtesse only 'notices' me,
Dorante complains, but is unfaithful with the Chevalier, that adjective
being socially important. The servants speak, and act, much like their
employers. The Comtesse and the Chevalier are set to marry at the end - as
if it mattered - and Dorante and the Marquise lament that they 'lacked
faithfulness'. Penelope Wilton and Gillian Barge were the Comtesse and the
Marquise, but the director had not ensured enough difference between them,
so one never really cared who was speaking, even if one knew.
The World Service in another aspect is in the middle of six half-hours about
the history of Japan, presented by Michael Diamond. The history, that is,
since Commander Perry anchored his little fleet off their coast in 1853 with
a friendly message from the American President: until then, their relations
with the West were only with the Dutch. In the first three programmes we
have observed the increase in Japanese industrial and military power through
their contacts with France and Britain, and their growingly hostile attitude
to the Russians, culminating in the Russo-Japanes war in 1904.
The Japanese victory led the West to greater friendship. There was actual
talk of Japanese troops on the North-West Frontier, and in 1914 the Japanese
joined the Allied side in the Great War - even, after 1917, escorting
American shipping in the Pacific. Japan already had to be treated as an
equal: in 1921 a treaty rated the world's three major naval fleets in the
proportion of 5:5:3 for US, Great Britain and Japan. In 1931 the Japanese
invaded Manchuria and founded the state of Manchukuo. That takes us to the
end of the third half-hour, though I have barely touched more than the
headlines of the programmes. They go out on Sundays (the third one tomorrow)
at two o'clock and 11.30 pm, and on Mondays at 6.30 and 10 am.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Sanderling's Mahler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER KURT Sanderling's Philharmonia concert on Tuesday, Richard Fairman
wrote: 'To my mind, now that a generation of venerable maestros has gone, he
is one of the great conductors of the day.' To mine, too - assuming that the
predecessors are the likes of Horenstein and Knappertsbusch, rather than,
say, Herbert von Karajan. Still, when Sanderling returned to the Festival
Hall on Friday to conduct Mahler's Ninth Symphony I wasn't expecting quite
what we got.
Since Mahler went international, a kind of cosmopolitan consensus about how
to play him has grown up among thoughtful conductors, at some remove from
Mahler's Austrian roots. It leaves room for many variations, but key points
and passages are recognised as needing to make certain kinds of effect. As a
result, what we most often hear from leading orchestras are variations on a
certain 'basic' reading. The last really satisfying account I heard of the
Ninth, by the Japanese-American Kent Nagano and the London Symphony a couple
of years ago, was a distillation of just that accepted modern wisdom.
Sanderling brought us up against something much less suave, seemingly plain
and innocent of theatrics. The music seemed to play itself, without any
forcing or clever underlining. Towards the recapitulation in the first
movement, I found that there were tears pouring down my face, which hasn't
happened during a concert since Lili Kraus and Colin Davis played K. 466 for
Bertrand Russell's birthday, thirty-something years ago. Not because it was
Terribly Sad; but because every element in that marvellous passage arrived
so easily and inevitably, adding its exact sense without a trace of
conscious manipulation.
Throughout that movement, the 'Andante comodo', Sanderling secured an
illusion of absolute steadiness (in fact, the music demands many swings in
tempo), and thus of unblinking cogency. The three alternating dances in the
Landler movement weren't guyed, grotesque, lumpen or hysterical; they simply
recalled the Biergarten and the Tanzhaus through a fractured lens, with
affection and a sense of homely things irretrievably lost.
The Rondo-Burleske, which everybody now aims to make as angry and sulphurous
as possible, managed to be sour and perverse whilst remaining at home in the
Biergarten. In the final Adagio there was no withers-wringing, though the
full-throated paragraphs were sonorous; only the close was immensely drawn
out, as Mahler prescribed - but simply, without ethereal prettiness, and
thus profoundly moving.
Without doubt the Philharmonia players had given their most devoted
attention to Sanderling in rehearsals, for the many levels of their music
were lucidly shaped and balanced, pungently coloured in ways that owed
nothing to glossy symphonic theatre. Afterwards, when the conductor took his
second bow they refused to stand up with him, and instead joined in the
audience's heartfelt applause. Quite right: there aren't many Sanderlings
about.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: A humanist returns to his roots - Screen / Nigel
Andrews talks to Bertrand Tavernier, the man who put storytelling back into
post-New Wave cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A rainy Paris suburb Bertrand Tavernier is shooting his new feature. His
last film was the acclaimed These Foolish Things starring a pre-knighthood
Dirk Bogarde. L 627 has no stars, no knights and seems a spectacularly
humble project for France's most acclaimed modern film-maker: the man who
put storytelling back into post-New Wave cinema with films like Sunday In
The Country, Round Midnight and Life And Nothing But.
Tavernier's new project could also be a symbol for beleaguered European
movie-making on the brink of 1992: lashed by rain ('Engleesh wezzair]' the
director complains as I hove in view with my Monoprix umbrella); made on a
shoestring; and with a title incomprehensible to anyone outside its native
country.
The bearish, snow-haired director sets me down in the mobile canteen for
lunch and enlightens me. The movie is a crime story about drugs and
delinquency - very accessible - and its title refers to an article of French
law about police treatment of drug offenders.
'I feel I am returning to my roots,' proclaims Tavernier. Having just
finished a four-hour documentary about Algeria, bought by BBC2, he explains
that he was in a mood to do a small documentary-style feature. 'I wrote the
script with a real 'cop', Michel Alexandre, and I spent four months with the
police listening to them, living with them, seeing them make arrests. It's a
small film, it's not The French Connection. It's about the daily lives of a
group of cops and small-time dealers.'
Not The French Connection. But doesn't that sum up French cinema's crisis
today? It was once Europe's flagship movie nation, propelled across the seas
of world fame by the most famous New Wave in history. Now it seems unable to
make French Connection-style box-office hits or even to create much of a
stir at the arthouse.
'I've been hearing ze word crisis since I started,' sighs Tavernier. 'It's
not a crisis of talent. Look at the French films which won awards at Venice.
And in Cannes everyone praised La Belle Noiseuse of Rivette. And we have
Pialat, Doillon. What other country produces this quality of work?'
Yet the names Tavernier picks - an assortment of New Wave veterans and
relative newcomers - pinpoint the uneasy transitional phase France has been
in ever since the Godard-Truffaut-Chabrol heyday. Tavernier is the only
French film-maker to have succeeded consistently, from his first feature The
Clockmaker Of St Paul to his masterpiece to date Life And Nothing But, in
straddling the chasm between New Wave modernism and France's post-modern
return to narrative in films like Betty Blue and Subway.
He is neither a revolutionary nor a reactionary. He is a humanist in the
Renoir tradition and he sees his role as that of a reconciler. 'I don't
believe in 'theory', which was a great part of the New Wave. At the same
time I reject those who label me as a 1950s-style theatrical film-maker like
Autant-Lara or Ophuls. I have never been part of that tradition. I love
location, improvisation; mixing professional and nonprofessional actors.
'The one thing those '50s directors taught me was not to be afraid of
history. The New Wave film-makers would not go near a historical subject; it
was too 'respectable' for them, too inert. But for me when I make a film
like Life And Nothing But it is not a dead subject, even if it is set on the
battlefields of the First War. I made that film out of anger. People are
surprised you can be angry about the past. But much of what is wrong with
France today has its roots in that time: when official truth takes over from
real truth. My anger is like Noiret's (the hero played by Philippe Noiret)
when I fight the government today. It is the same fight, for the same
freedoms, with the same frustrations.'
As a movie storyteller Tavernier is more traditional than his New Wave
forebears. But stories themselves, he insists, are not what cinema is about.
'I hate the idea of 'plot.' I like films that relate more to music, to ideas
of rhythm and counterpoint, films that hesitate or meander.' But within a
precise time-frame surely? Look at the obsession with units of time in
Tavernier's titles: A Week's Vacation, Sunday In The Country, Round
Midnight. 'Yes, I've always resisted stories that are set over months or
years. I can't bear it when actors use make-up to age: I love them too much
to want them to use tricks.'
That creative sympathy with his players is Tavernier's special gift and
gives his films their special humanity. His casts become part of the
film-making process, with the director even handing them earlier reject
drafts of the script so they can trace their characters' evolution.
'French actors make it so easy. They are very analytical, they think about
everything that makes up a person's character. Noiret was for a while my
technical adviser on Life And Nothing But, because he had learned so much
about military laws and customs. Whereas the American actor Harvey Keitel,
when I made Death Watch with him, would say, 'Do I have two shirt-buttons
open in this scene and why?'
'The 'Method'] European actors approach a part responsibly; they are
well-read, they often have a classical theatre background. A Method actor is
lost when he does a historical film. Look at Al Pacino in Revolution. He is
playing a peasant, but no peasant at that time would speak with that voice.
That soft voice, almost a whisper. It is the voice of man brought up in a
city, not one who has to shout across fields and hills to call his son home
to dinner. And yet Pacino studied the part for months.'
But the Pacinos of this world, as the 1990s roll back the frontiers between
European countries and between Europe and America, may more and more be
filling studios in Paris and Rome, London and Berlin. Tavernier sees
cultural imperialism - the spreading empire of Hollywood - as the worst
threat to cinema today.
'There is no doubt that America after 1992 will be able to impose a way of
film-making. Co-productions will have to be in English and few of us will be
able to say no. Half the phone calls I get now from French producers are for
English-speaking films. A third of public TV in France is in English. Worse
 -it is in mid-Atlantic.
'To finance a film you will have to have an American star. Then you will
have to cater to an American audience. I give you an example. When we were
making Round Midnight the producer Irwin Winkler said the French hero could
not give the American jazz player Camembert, which in France is the most
everyday cheese. I said 'Why?'. Winkler said because to Americans it will
seem something special, expensive. They will think these people are
upper-class. Yet Camembert to a Parisian is the most ordinary cheese. Well,
there were memos about this] I should have shrugged and had my hero give him
Kelloggs Corn Flakes.
'These details are tiny but they are part of a mosaic. Cinema is about what
you see even if you see it 'unconsciously.' That is what makes it special as
an art. Certain images catch something in five or six seconds that would
take pages to produce the same effect in a novel. The feeling of Monument
Valley in John Ford's films: the light, the heat, the sand. Certain effects
of movement: of stillness versus action. Or that last charge of Custer in
Raoul Walsh's film, shot from high above when the previous charges have been
shot from low down on the ground. Suddenly, because of that camera angle,
what was heroic has become something stupid, doomed, sad. You cannot
describe this in words, but it is the same effect as a beautiful line of
poetry. It is what cinema alone can do.'

FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: A drama out of a crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLAY billed as Angels in America at the Cottesloe runs for just over 3
1/2 hours and is only Part One. The real title is Millennium Approaches.
Part Two of Tony Kushner's epic Angels has only just been completed and is
called Perestroika.
If you think that sounds pretentious, beware. Part One is not a moment too
long. Right down to the variation on the Faustian ending, it struck me as
one of the most powerful theatrical pieces I have seen for many a year.
The taxi-driver on the way home asked me what it was about. I told him
rather limply that it was about AIDS. 'Where do the angels come in?' he said
pensively.
The answer to his question is that Angels is a play in praise of homosexual
love and with some sympathy for even the most anonymous homosexual
encounters, the problem being that AIDS is getting in the way. Even when the
disease strikes, the love and the lust go on. When one of the victims dies,
the twist to the Faustian ending is that the angel rather than the devil
comes to collect him.
There is, of course, a great deal more to it than that. Millennial it
certainly is; it is also very American. The last line, as the angel comes to
rescue the dying lover, is 'God almighty]', then, as the angel descends:
'Very Steven Spielberg.' This is only millennium approaching; heaven knows
what will happen in Part Two when it comes nearer.
There is a lot of history, some American, some European, some real, some
imagined. The disease of AIDS is juxtaposed to the black death in the 14th
century and the great plague in the 17th. Prior Walter, the good guy victim
in Angels, has ancestors going back to both and who appear to him in his
final hallucinations. The earlier pestilences - or the 'spotty monster' -
seemed much more universal, the people wholly unequipped to deal with it,
though the suggestion is that only time and science will tell. In any case,
life before and after pre-millennial tension goes on.
The recent history concerns Roy Cohn, an extreme right-wing Republican
lawyer who worked for Senator McCarthy and helped send the Rosenbergs to the
electric chair. Cohn died of AIDS just as the disease was becoming widely
identified. Yet just because some homosexuals were villains and hypocrites,
the play suggests, it does not mean that homosexuality should be condemned.
The case is made for coming out of the closet.
Kushner carries the case further. One of the characters is a Mormon,
originally happily married yet having suppressed homosexuality all the way.
He defies the lucrative blandishments of Cohn to go off to be an aide in the
Department of Justice in Washington, where he could protect Cohn, because he
says that would be unethical. In the end, however, he finds solace with
Louis, the surviving Jewish lover of Prior.
Religion, like history, has a strong part in the play. Jewishness is set
alongside Mormonism and occasionally Catholicism. The message is that none
of them know how to cope with homosexual passion. Politics comes in as well.
At the beginning of the third act, there is a marvellous scene between
Louis, the liberal Jewish homosexual, and his black, more radical, former
lover, Belize. Louis says that American politics have nothing to do with
race: that is why America is so different from Europe. Belize politely
dissents.
Not everyone will like the play, nor agree with its thesis. Some of the
physical scenes are very explicit. Having read the text beforehand, I
assumed I was in for a grim evening. Yet if you want an example of vibrant
America, this is it. There is nothing wrong with drawing inspiration from
Spielberg and the best of Hollywood.
Henry Goodman as Cohn gets better and better the closer he is to dying.
Marcus D'Amico (Louis) and Sean Chapman (Prior) play the central lovers with
all the feeling of Antony and Cleopatra. Felicity Montagu, as the chief
female victim of the male urge to prefer males, stands up very well, though
towards the end she disappears to Anartica to inspect the gap in the ozone
layer where no doubt we will hear more of her in Perestroika.
Declan Donnellan directs with the utmost sensitivity. You should see this
play, for even if you loathe it, you will love discussing it afterwards.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Relish a bit of role-reversal - Only a working artist
can review an exhibition by three art critics. We asked Deanna Petherbridge
what she thought of Giles Auty, William Feaver and William Packer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT SHOULD have been carnival-time in Kensington this week as the critics
became artists and the artists critics. One could have expected all the
festive abandon of sanctioned role-reversal, with the kings gleefully
deposed and the motleys enthroned for a day.
Alas, there is little celebration in Critics' Landscape at Cadogan
Contemporary Art, where Giles Auty of The Spectator, William Feaver of the
Observer and the Financial Times's own William Packer are currently in the
vestments of artists. Rather, there is a slightly dreary and
backward-looking exhibition, with a discernible and embarrassing visual
autism on the part of Farmer Giles of the Spectator.
Wiser fellow-critics of Feaver &amp; Co have formed a concerted chorus in their
respective presses in support of this exhibition of madness: a 'brave' act,
is the general opinion, which in no way reflects on the credibility of the
three as critics. However, in spite of knowing that the kings are due to put
the boot into the Lords of Misrule at cock-crow, it is not entirely possible
to go along with this feeble consensus. As everyone in the art world knows,
what ye exhibit is what ye shall be judged by.
The relationship of artists to art critics is rather like that of
intelligent lay people to the medical profession. In times of acute need
(like an exhibition) the vulnerable artist suspends disbelief and seeks an
'expert' opinion from the critical practitioner. In healthier times, he or
she happily ignores the pontifications of a profession adept at
mystification and self-aggrandisement. But, oh dear, what does the
artist/patient do when the doctor is dressing his own wounds in the
consulting rooms, and showing such lamentable lack of skill in applying balm
and bandages?
Critics' reputations depend on their writings, and over the long years of
their tenure in the press we all get to know the colour and composition of
their critical 'humours'. What is revealing about this exhibition is the
extent to which the critic's disposition finds its match in his practice:
apoplectic, jaundiced and phlegmatic.
Giles Auty is known for his deep, sometimes apoplectic conservatism, the
heritage cant that implies loss of some golden and perfect past. His
paintings, of a naive and meticulous realism, are of the sort found
regularly in amateur art-club exhibitions; paintings untouched by the
revolutions and inventions of the 20th century.
Bill Feaver is believed by most artists to have a profoundly depressed and
jaundiced view of art; it is not easy to predict his very infrequent flashes
of approval, or to quite unravel the meaning of his purply passages. His
small paintings reflect a profoundly depressed and jaundiced view of
landscape.
Customarily phlegmatic, Bill Packer regrets in a brief statement that he has
been able to spend so little time being a practitioner because of his need
to earn a living. This rather moving conflict is reflected in his drawings
in a dialogue between gestural, smudged passages of charcoal and the
down-to-earth observation of pencil outline. The drawings have a certain
skill and dignity and are selling very well.
Critics' Landscape continues until February 1; it is bound to attract more
sycophantic coverage than any exhibition this year.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Books: What the authoress said to the abbe - Two friends who
were part of the charmed circle of the French Enlightenment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A WOMAN, A MAN AND TWO KINGDOMS by Francis Steegmuller Secker &amp; Warburg
Pounds 17.90, 280 pages
HUMAN REASON had one of its apogees in 18th century Europe, and Paris was
its capital. Steegmuller's delightful book throws wide a pair of French
windows onto this bright epoch by depicting the friendship between two of
its principal characters, a Parisian authoress, Louise d'Epinay, and a
brilliant Neapolitan diplomat, the abbe Galiani.
These lively figures were in the first circle of those who made the French
Enlightenment. The editor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, was an intimate
friend of both: as were Voltaire, d'Holbach and Rousseau. Most of this
circle adhered to the distinguishing principle of the Enlightenment: that
the unfettered exercise of reason can save humanity by ending the ignorance
which impedes progress and keeps tyrants in power. This view was shared by
many of Europe's intellectuals. It was therefore an age of debate. In London
the bourses of ideas were the coffee houses, in Paris they were the salons.
Paris's preeminence made it a gathering place for the gifted of all Europe,
who met in the apartments of the famous bluestocking hostesses: Madame
Geoffrin, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse, and the latter's one-time mentor, the
blind and formidable Marquise du Deffand, who remarked of St Denis's
achievement in walking to Paris with his head under his arm: 'il n'y a que
le premier pas qui coute.'
Another of the salons, different from these in being more intimate and
relaxed, where guests could kick off their shoes and talk freely, and where
therefore genuine friendships flourished, was provided by the woman whom
Voltaire called 'the eagle in a gossamer cage': Louise d'Epinay.
Louise was the only child of an aristocratic but impoverished family. After
her father's death she was brought up by an uncle, an immensely rich
tax-farmer. She married the tax-farmer's son, who in the required manner
turned out to be a drunkard and a gambler, and who dissipated his father's
estate within a few years of inheriting it. The marriage ended in all but
name when Louise found herself suffering a venereal disease he had brought
home from the Paris stews.
After the fashion of the time Louise established a de facto marriage
elsewhere, which produced two children; later she had a long and happy
liaison with Melchior Grimm, diplomat and polymath, a contributor to the
Encyclopedie and, like his friend Diderot, an adviser to Catherine the Great
of Russia. At La Chevrette. Louise's country estate outside Paris, she and
Grimm entertained members of the charmed circle, among them the
extraordinary Ferdinando Galiani, a tiny man possessed of a towering
intellect.
Shortly before her death Louise became the first recipient of the Prix
Moynton, instituted by the French Academy for works 'beneficial to society.'
It honoured her dialogue Les conversations d'Emilie, a discussion of
education - a topic which, before the breach in their friendship, she and
Rousseau had often debated, for the age's hopes rested on educating future
generations according to Enlightenment principles. But it is her
autobiographical novel L'Histoire de Madame de Montbrillant for which she is
best known. Begun when she was thirty and published posthumously, it was
hailed by Saint-Beuve as the best description of 18th century France.
'Madame d'Epinay's memoirs are not a book,' he wrote, 'they are an epoch.'
Between the little abbe and Louise there grew an enduring and affectionate
intellectual comradeship. Galiani had attracted the notice of Naples when
still very young, with his monograph On Money and his scholarly work on
Italian antiquities. Later he wrote one of the few treatises on economics to
be regarded at the same time as a literary classic, the famous Dialogue on
the Grain Trade. It is a loss to learning and literature that his chief
endeavours as a writer were, for most of his working life, dedicated to
official reports.
When Galiani was first accredited to the court of Versailles he hated Paris:
it was cold, foggy and wet, and he wrote plaintive letters home begging to
be recalled. But when he entered salon society he found himself lionized by
it for his wit and erudition, and an enduring love affair sprang up between
him and the city. Years later, when he was obliged to quit Paris
permanently, he was heartbroken; but his doing so was the occasion for his
correspondence with Louise, who undertook to keep him in touch with Paris
and its doings, and who faithfully honoured her promise. Galiani
reciprocated by writing to her of life at Naples. The resulting exchange
provides the basis for Steegmuller's portrait of their friendship and the
age in which it flourished.
Steegmuller here displays the same gracefully sure touch as in his biography
of Apollinaire. The result is a very good book, full of pleasure and
instruction. It deftly portrays a civilised aspect of history's finer side,
and makes one long to see it restored.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Arts 2000 catches on in the provinces - The
competition is cut-throat to attract specialised festivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Lord Palumbo's more bizarre ideas has turned out to be one of his
most successful. When the chairman of the Arts Council unveiled Arts 2000, a
wheeze through which a different part of the country would hold a
specialised arts festival every year up to the millenium, the media response
was tepid.
But the idea has caught on. Local authorities are increasingly convinced
that the arts are the catalyst to regenerate their economies and although
the Arts Council is only offering Pounds 250,000 to each festival it has
been enough to unleash a flurry of competitive activity.
Birmingham is currently hosting a year long music festival, exploiting its
new concert hall, and next year dance will be breaking out all over the East
Midlands. On Tuesday Lord Palumbo announces the winners of the contests to
present drama in 1994, literature in 1995, and the visual arts in 1996.
The competition has been cut throat and many of the decisions were on a
knife edge, the choice between beguiling opposites. Take drama, where the
contestants are Manchester, with its rich tradition, multi-ethnic diversity
and abunndace of venues, and Sussex, a mainly rural region where, apart from
Brighton, drama has hardly touched the people.
Manchester claims that local councils and the private sector will produce an
extra Pounds 10m if it wins the bid; Sussex says that its campaign has put
the arts on the agenda and the award would trigger a much needed impetus,
including the restoration of the Essoldo in Brighton. The safe decision
would be Manchester; the brave one Sussex. Manchester must be favourite.
For literature the rivals are Swansea, Kirklees and Nottinghamshire, all of
which promise to set up National Centres of Literature. Once again all the
options have attractions. Swansea offers two languages is prepared to
convert one of its abandoned dockside buildings into a sanctury for writers;
Kirkless has a strong tradition of literary out-reach and a council
supportive of the arts; and Nottinghamshire has carefully fostered its
Lawrencian roots and plans to build on its Byronic connections at Newstead
Abbey. Swansea might just get it, to spread the money into Wales.
The visual arts are just as open. Glasgow has a brilliant track record but
perhaps not the need; Bradford, too, has an established committment to the
regenerating powers of the arts; the Northern Region is a large, amorphous,
contender; while Hampshire is almost virgin territory. If Sussex loses out
on drama its southern neighbour may get the visual arts. Otherwise Bradford
could register a win for inner city vitality.
In the event it hardly matters. Arts 2000 has encouraged many councils to
take the arts seriously for the first time and has already released some
extra funds. The hope is that the losers, inspired by the experience, are
now so committed that they will push ahead anyway with their artistic
ambitions.
One town already enjoying a rip roaring love affair with the arts is
Halifax. In the early summer EUREKA], the UK's first Children's Museum opens
there. It has a fairy godmother, Mrs Vivien Duffield, whose Pounds 5m cheque
has covered most of the construction cost, and a fairy godfather, the Prince
of Wales, who, along with the Princess, agreed to act as patron on condition
the Museum was located there.
Judging by the success of other childrens museums overseas, and a glance at
the plans, EUREKA] will have no trouble in attracting its target of 500,000
visitors a year to its blend of educational entertainment, which allows kids
the thrill of working on an assembly line, playing at bank manager,
overhauling a car, watching their food digest, etc. More to the point
EUREKA] puts the seal on Halifax's campaign to regenerate itself by drawing
on the arts and, or as it prefers to call it, 'inheritance'.
Glasgow, Birmingham, Bradford have sold themselves to their citizens, and
potential investors, as latter day Medici's presiding over a cultural
renaissance. It is excellent PR, and probably has some commercial spin off.
Halifax is different in being more desperate in its need, more modest in its
ambitions, and also more obviously successful.
A decade ago the town was tottering. The textile mills were falling silent;
even the rail service was under threat. The place looked like a doomed,
dank, relic of the industrial revolution. Yet Halifax, which was expanded
into Calderdale in local government re-organisation, received no grant aid.
It did however attract the interest of the Prince of Wales. Today Halifax is
the kind of place to warm his heart - small scale, homely, old fashioned,
and apparently thriving.
The Council's 'Inheritance Decade 1985-95' concentrated on smartening up the
place, with the old shops and market halls spring cleaned to a golden brown
and encouraged to adopt the comforting fascias of around 1930. Even
Macdonalds has gone art deco. The Council has shown a Yorkshire caution in
its cash hand outs - spending less than Pounds 1m but, by ensuring that
business gets immediate planning decisions, the private investment in the
city has exceeded Pounds 13m.
It may look like a superficial sprucing up, but the shift in attitude
triggered two far reaching developments, one a happy chance, the other a
gamble. Ernest Hall must be the only classically trained pianist to run a
large property company, Mountleigh. He saw the commercial potential in the
redundant textile mills and was able to acquire the abandoned Dean Clough,
with 1.25m square feet, at a basement price.
He is converting it into a unique mix of commercial offices and arts centre.
Over half the space is already occupied by companies like the Halifax
Building Society and Sun Alliance whose rents enable Hall to offer free
accommodation to over 20 artists, and to drama companies like Compass and
IOU. Other residents include the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust and the Design
Museum's educational programme.
The walls of the former mills are decorated with over 400 works of art, and
there is a gallery with constantly changing exhibitions. The commercial
tenants get a stimulating work place and the artists creative encouragement
from a business environment.
Halifax gave Hall the go ahead to buy Dean Clough in four hours. Its other
coup, bringing Northern Dance Theatre to the town, caused more heartache.
Four years ago the company was in crisis, with the Arts Council threatening
to cut off its grant. It needed a home more supportive than Manchester and
found one in West Yorkshire, with Calderdale providing a base, a mill owners
mansion, and half the Pounds 330,000 subsidy. This vote of confidence
brought back Arts Council funding and nowNDT is about to receive its first
major sponsorship, Pounds 150,000 from British Telecom, which will help
raise orchestral standards.
With Christopher Gable in charge ENB has just finished a successful tour
with its new production of Romeo and Juliet and is steadily paying off its
debts while seeking to raise Pounds 1.5m to move the Central School of
Ballet from London to Halifax to crown its new confidence.
A Halifax swarming with kids, ballet dancers, artists and theatricals might
need some mental re-adjustment, but the town seems to have arrived already
where more pretentious cities are still journeying towards.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Jazz nut to the rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGHT of Sol-swigging hipsters three deep at the bar and waitresses
busily weaving across a packed dancefloor is not one you would naturally
associate with a business in receivership. But this is the Jazz Cafe on a
Monday night and the receivers have been a supporting act since November.
Proprietor and founder Jon Dabner owes his creditors, of which the brewer
Whitbread is the largest, Pounds 1.3m. The receivers, at Messrs Cape &amp;
Dalgleish, say the company is insolvent and will sell the business as a
going concern for upwards of Pounds 300,000. Dabner, who says the place has
no future without him, has brought in a company doctor to negotiate on his
behalf and appointed a new manager to help in the crisis management. The
deadline for tenders is March 31.
Roger Gewolb, lawyer, former merchant banker and public company finance
director and now head of London turnaround specialists Roger Gewolb
Corporate Renewal, is a jazz nut and thinks the Jazz Cafe is a 'very special
place'. This is a special job for him and his team since the club is a
business without any tangible assets but is not in hock to a bank.
Unusually, the receivers' client, Whitbread, could have a vested interest in
the club's resuscitation, Gewolb says. His job is to convince the brewer,
and the receivers, that with a solid management team he can help it move
into profit. 'Jon has built a fine business in a very short time and were it
not for the recession and thin management he might well be prospering
today,' Gewolb says .
Teresa Cesario, whose appointment as manager has been approved by the
receivers, is in her final year of an MBA at London Business School. A
native of Naples, she expresses surprise that British creditors are so quick
to pull the plug on a business with such evident potential. The club has
been open for a little over a year. 'If this club were in Japan lenders
would be looking at a five year probationary period before seeing a return
on their investment.' Her remit, to provide the Jazz Cafe with a marketable
direction, will doubtless inspire her for her examination in strategic
management next week.
All concede that Dabner made some basic mistakes. The conversion of the
building itself, from a Barclays bank branch, was overspecified and Dabner
has been burdened by builders' bills ever since. But if his planning was
awry, the ex-school teacher's programming has been a success. Fusion
merchants have mixed with elderly beboppers and while attendance has been
patchy, it has been generally healthy.
'But we still have to break the myth that jazz is only for the middle-aged
beer monster,' says Cesario. 'Live music is exciting and we have to promote
that idea to Londoners and the tourists that flock to Camden. Young people
pay Pounds 15 to go to a rave, why shouldn't they pay for live music.'
Fair enough, famous American saxophonist Archie Shepp, with his repertoire
of blues singing to straightahead bop filled the tables the night I saw him.
The young but relatively unknown James Taylor Quartet filled floor and
tables the following week. Even as Cesario speaks, JT's enthusiastic young
band, which incorporates a peroxide topped dancer in long leather coat and
velvet hotpants, slides into the 1970s strains of 2001 Space Odyssey, to
squeals of delight from the thronging Monday night ravers.
This stuff is not to Dabner's personal taste but he has initiated changes to
accommodate, and make the most out of, this kind of jazz fan. The menu now
includes meat dishes, once anathema to the brown rice style of the club's
forerunner in East London. The staff that serves up this 'supper club' style
food are now given incentive bonuses to sell more of it.
With the March 31 deadline looming over the Dabner, Cesario and Gewolb trio,
Delroy Chambers at Cape &amp; Dalgleish reckons several offers are already on
the table, and he hopes to have a buyer in February. But Gewolb, who
believes that the club's hi-tech style is unsuitable for much other than
live music, has another card to play. 'We have targetted three potential
investors,' Gewolb explains, 'who have the funds and a love of jazz in
common. Thus we hope that Whitbread will see that they can have it two ways.
Either they are paid something and Dabner goes his own way. Or he, as the
only guy who can make this place work, can cut them a piece of the deal and
they can make money.'

MARCEL PROUST SELECTED LETTERS,VOLUME 3, 1910-1917 edited by Philip Kolb,
translated by Terence Kilmartin Harper Collins Pounds 40, 434 pages
FOR LOVERS of Proust, there can never be too much. His great novel,
Remembrance of Things Past, 1 1/4 million words, fills well over 3,000 pages
in English translation. Now we have a third volume of letters, selected from
six volumes of the comprehensive original French edition which has already
reached Volume 16.
When the present volume starts, Proust is aged 40. He is an invalid,
confined to his room by asthma. Three years earlier, in 1910, he was able to
go out all day in a closed car; after a year this had to stop, but he could
still go to the beach; then it was evenings only; and by now he can only
manage downstairs for an hour or two every few days. In 1912 he is
describing his daily fumigations, a largely ineffectual attempt to help his
breathing, which last seven or eight hours at a time. His single meal is at
five in the morning.
Proust had once been an active man. He had even done national service as a
soldier and was still on the reserve. Now he lived at second hand through
his friends, insisting that they tell him every detail of the parties he
could no longer attend. In his letters he pours out his gratitude and
affection to the literary men and titled ladies whose lives he had shared,
and he carefully husbands his memories of past times. Sometimes he is petty
and conspiratorial. Always he luxuriantly relishes the delights of small
things: flowers, dress, language, writing at unashamed length about the
modulations of his sensibility. There is scarcely a word of self-pity.
Many of the letters are about plans for his book. At this time he had in
mind two volumes only. The first was published at his own expense, and he
conscientiously warned that the second would be a little indecent. When
Swann's Way appeared in 1913, it was at once recognised as something
entirely new. Publishers vied to offer him money but he insisted that he
would keep to the former arrangement and put up the capital himself.
The outbreak of war in August 1914 changed everything. Proust, guilty at
being too ill to fight, spends much of his strength offering comfort to the
bereaved. 'But, and I say this not only for him,' he writes in
characteristically tortuous style about one of his many friends killed in
the fighting, 'not even as much for him as for others, the dead live in me
to such a degree that not being able to find them on this earth seems to me
to be somehow devoid of meaning, and I find myself in the state of mind of a
madman.'
The war ruined the publishing industry and threw all Proust's plans for his
book into uncertainty. Patiently the invalid went back to his desk and to
his memories, revising and expanding and composing until the novel grew to
eight volumes. As Proust himself knew, it was an amazing achievement which
could only have happened as a result of a unique combination of disasters -
although, with his intense experience of suffering and his acute sensitivity
to language, he would have squirmed at the editor's comment that the war was
a 'blessing in disguise.'
For most readers the main interest of the present volume is likely to lie in
Proust's occasional descriptions of what he wanted to achieve in his novel,
especially his ambition to catch in words the strange workings of the
involuntary memory. The voluntary - intellectual - memory, he writes in
1913, gives us only imprecise facsimiles of the past which no more resemble
the reality of the past than paintings by bad artists resemble the spring.
'But if we get a whiff of a long-forgotten smell, we are suddenly
intoxicated, and similarly we think we no longer love the dead because we
don't remember them, but if by chance we come across an old glove we burst
into tears.'
The translation is by Terence Kilmartin, who sadly died a few months ago. He
had earlier prepared the authoritative version of the complete novel,
available from Penguin.

THE FUTURE TELLING LADY by James Berry Hamish Hamilton Pounds 8.99, 147
pages
Starting this week, we plan to feature 'The FT Children's Book of the Month'
 -not necessarily fiction - selected by our critics from the scores of new
children's books.
For January: a distinguished Caribbean poet.
TOWARDS THE middle of Derek Walcott's epic-length poem Omeros Achille, a
poor fisherman named after a hero out of Homer, returns in a moment of
visionary ecstasy to his African roots in order to question his own
identity. Why was he given such a name? Who gave it to him anyway? And can a
descendant of slaves, a no-man amongst no-men, with a dark, unwritten
history, ever hope to have a real identity at all? Walcott, the most
important Caribbean poet of his generation, has wrestled with this theme
throughout a long writing life; and it is a pre-occupation that is shared by
the poet, anthologist and short-story writer James Berry, whose outstanding
new collection of stories for children, The Future Telling Lady, has just
been published.
Berry was born in a small Jamaican coastal village in 1924 and arrived in
London in 1948. For more than 30 years, his adult poetry has explored two
themes - that all Anglo-Caribbean writers seem obliged to wrestle with: the
nature of personal freedom ('freedom . . . is an adventure of a new self');
and the need to achieve some kind of reconciliation between Caribbean speech
patterns and English as it is spoken in England.
It is only relatively recently that Berry has turned his attention to
writing for children, and the books he has published in this field - one
volume of poetry, When I Dance, and two collections of short stories - are
his most assured achievements to date. His adult poetry has often been
marred by odd rhetorical flourishes; the books for children display an
unbridled love for what Berry describes as Caribbean 'nation language'
speech, and seem to be spoken in a wholly authentic voice of his own.
The strongest story of the seven in The Future Telling Lady is, as in
Omeros, preoccupied with the theme of identity. In 'Banana-Day Trip',
Boy-Don, youngest child of the family, prepares to go on a trip to his
granny-May's house where he will stay for a whole week's holiday. All the
necessary preparations have been made: the dog Browndash has been brushed
and brushed again; the grass has been cut and gathered in for Goaty; special
feed has been prepared for Rhino the pig. Now it is merely a matter of
waiting interminably for the sound of Mr Burke's banana-truck to come
spluttering into the village.
And when the journey is finally under way, Boy-Don experiences a marvellous
love for the oceans of yellow bananas that he sees growing in the fields. He
thinks of how they will be carried on to the boats at the port and borne
across the world's seas . . . 'He found he somehow had a funny sort of envy
for the travel and far-away life of bananas. He imagined how the bananas
would travel on a ship on that big, big sea, all landless, touching the
skyline all round.'
Unfortunately, the mood of euphoria doesn't last. Grandmother and her
elderly female friend prove to be uncongenial company - especially when they
both fall asleep after the mid-day meal and Boy-Don, having been instructed
to sit still and rest on the sofa opposite, fears that they may have died on
him. Fortunately for the lonely, cheerful boy, he hears the banana-truck
moving past the house on its return journey, and Mr Burke agrees to give him
a lift back home.
Boy-Don, now an object of ridicule to his brother and sister, salvages his
reputation in the only way he know how: by singing one of his mesmerising
raps. Poetry and song prove to be the necessary healer.
That poetry-as-song has such a healing effect upon the household is a matter
of some significance. James Berry, together with other British-Caribbean
voices of recent years (John Agard, for example), has brought back to
English poetry some sense of the importance of the link between verse, music
and movement. Poems are not merely words on a page. They are triggers for
communal expressions of emotion - joy, togetherness, wonder. Boy-Don finds
himself again through rap.
This story, full of loving evocations of Jamaican life, stands at the
thematic centre of an extremely memorable collection of stories that will be
enjoyed by all children of eight and above.

THE DREAM AT THE END OF THE WORLD by Michelle Green Bloomsbury Pounds 19.99,
381 pages
TANGIER: CITY OF THE DREAMby Iain FinlaysonHarper Collins Pounds 16, 371
pages
WHEN HE first went to Tangier in 1931 with Aaron Copland, the 21-year-old
Paul Bowles seemed to have a great future ahead of him in music. He went,
says Michelle Green, in this new study of the Tangier expatriates, as the
composer's 'angular blond prodigy'. Sixteen years later Bowles set off alone
to Tangier with a novel forming in his head, writing it as he journeyed
through the Sahara. The next year his wife Jane joined him in Tangier.
Apart from occasional holidays and excursions to other exotic places, the
Bowleses stayed put in Tangier for ever after. Jane died in 1973 in a
sanatorium in Malaga to which she had gone with the greatest reluctance
after the first of several strokes had devastated her fine mind. After her
death Bowles stayed on in Tangier. Now, at the age of 82, he is still there,
an internationally famous celebrity thanks to Bertolucci's film of his
cult-novel, The Sheltering Sky.
The Bowles' marriage was a strange one. He was a homosexual Wasp, she was
Jewish and lesbian. For a while they were the darlings of radical chic New
York. In addition to having a surrealist opera, The Wind Remains, performed,
Bowles worked as a music critic and a translator for Broadway of French
plays.
They gave up the glitzy life without a moment's regret. As soon as she
arrived in Tangier in 1947, Jane, whose novel, Two Serious Ladies (1943) had
given her a reputation as writer to rival her husband's, fell in love with
an illiterate young Moroccan woman she discovered in the grain market. After
a long, tortuous, costly courtship, she weaned her away from her natural
environment to come and live with her.
Two years later Paul's fictional masterpiece about an ill-assorted American
husband and wife, whose personalities gradually disintegrate in the glare of
the North African desert, appeared. It was followed, at long intervals, by a
couple more novels, travel books and volumes of stories. And in 1972
appeared Bowles' autobiography, Without Stopping, which William Burroughs
said should have been called Without Telling.
As the Bowleses might have expected, the distractions they had left New York
to escape re-appeared in a more extreme form in Tangier. Other American
escapers had joyfully discovered the permissiveness and inexpensiveness of
the place. Some of these were rich and grand. All used drugs regularly and
most were gay. At the top of the pile was Barbara Hutton and her latest
husband, throwing extravagant all-night parties and galas at Sidni Hosni,
her palace in the Casbah. Her English friends David Herbert, son of the Earl
of Pembroke, and Cecil Beaton, would monitor the list of guests for her.
That ubiquitous scandalmonger, Truman Capote, came out for a while to see
what was going on. 'The Bowlses', he said 'have a sterilised tout confort
apartment in the new quarter and also a refuge hidden away in the darker
Arab neighbourhood: a native house that must be one of the city's tiniest
habitations'.
The Beats were also curious - Allen Ginsberg and his friend Peter Orlovsky
surfaced, and they stayed somewhat longer. So did Jack Kerouac and Gregory
Corso. And from England Alan Sillitoe arrived, trying to discover how
Tangier behaved during a Saturday night and Sunday morning, and his wife,
the poet Ruth Fainlight, who brought with her their newborn baby. She made a
friend of Jane Bowles, and was fascinated to watch her with Cherifa (her
beloved) in the kitchen preparing a meal. Tennessee Williams, on the rebound
from his affair with Frank Merlo and writing The Milk Train Doesn't Stop
Here Any More, was another temporary escaper who found a welcoming refuge
chez Bowles.
As must be abundantly clear by now, Michelle Greene has written a book of
serious gossip. The Dream at the End of the World contains riveting
pen-portraits of all these people written in relentlessly glossy prose; for
example, people rarely simply 'go' somewhere they 'zero in'. Greene's theme,
if she has one, is the relations of the confirmed tangerinos - the permanent
European residents - leading their smashed lives, smoking kif (cannabis
mixed with tobacco) or high on majoun (another cannabis confection) with the
indigenous tanjawis, the local Arab population.
Some amusing but already almost forgotten writers like Alfred Chester and
Brion Gysin are resurrected. After a shaky start Gysin, also a wit, a
painter and a bar-owner, became a collaborator of William Burroughs. The
forbidding, grimly dedicated homosexual author of The Naked Lunch found a
haven in Tangier for a long time.
It was while he and Gysin were there that Gysin discovered the 'cut-up'. A
page of print is divided into four parts and pasted together again in a
different sequence. You then read the lines of print as if they were
coherent sentences. This juxtaposing of texts to create gibberish was
enthusiastically adopted by Burroughs as a significant art form (see The
Third Mind) - an inward escape from the constraints of conventional writing.
Apart from Bowles' smallish sterling output, that would seem to be the main
contribution of expatriate Tangier to literature.
Exactly the same ground is covered by Iain Finlayson in his Tangier: City of
the Dream (which is published on February 13) but in a less frenetic, more
methodical manner. Finlayson has a chapter on Joe Orton and Kenneth
Halliwell's sojourn in Tangier ignored by Green. He also brings the English
tangerinos like Herbert and Rupert Croft-Cooke more into the centre of the
picture, which remains a murky one. He is particularly interesting on the
city's lethal ethnic cocktail, its mixture of races all living under the
same sheltering sky.

ODD JOBS by John Updike Andre Deutsch Pounds 20, 920 pages
UPDIKE'S achievements as an essayist and critic have always complemented his
closely observed fictions. Discussing Updike's Rabbit novels, Martin Amis
once observed that 'there is no stopping him commenting on things', and the
irrepressible critic who lurks beneath the surface of all of his stories
emerges into the full light of day in the wealth of journalism that has
supplemented and shored it up.
Odd Jobs is the third massive selection of Updike's occasional pieces. They
span the period from 1982 to the middle of 1990, and range from the truly
occasional - a reminiscence of Harvard student days, a response to a
magazine request for the 'Book that changed me' (Kierkegaard's Fear and
Trembling surprisingly enough), an answer to 'Why are we Here?' for a book
on the meaning of life - through one-off film reviews of The Name of the
Rose, reflections upon and tributes to the great and good of American
literature, to densely argued essays and lectures upon the nature of writing
itself.
At the heart of this collection and of all Updike's journalism, however, are
his book reviews, which have been supplied regularly to the New Yorker for
much of his working life. They are conceived in what one recognises
instantly as the genteel, supple prose that characterises a certain
generation of that great magazine's contributors, and emphasise how much as
a jobbing journalist Updike pares down his style; the overripe imagery and
oozing descriptions of his novels are replaced with something that is
sharper and more elegant, though just as lively, inventive and perceptive.
Novels of all conditions and nationalities are naturally Updike's main
preoccupation. His taste is catholic and immensely tolerant: he can find
admirable qualities in Margaret Drabble as much as in Vargas Llosa, confront
the nouveaux romans of Tournier, Pinget and Queneau as comfortably as a
piece of resuscitated Hemingway. The novels are grouped by subject: there
are sections on his American contemporaries (though Philip Roth has one all
to himself); 'Britishers'; the French, and the 'Evil Empire'; on
post-modernism in its Calvino and Eco brands; and on magic realism in its
assorted South American forms.
Almost always he finds something to praise, if only faintly, so that the odd
critical blades cut that much deeper. The absence of an authorial
personality in Julian Barnes's Flaubert's Parrot and Staring at the Sun
would predictably trouble a practitioner whose own fiction flirts with the
confessional; one wonders how Updike responded to the conscious piece of
self-confession in Barnes's History of the World, which sadly he seems not
to have reviewed. And the sloppy and underpowered regularly strike raw
nerves - the fiercest notice in the book is reserved for Carlos Fuentes'
Ambrose-Bierce-inspired The Old Gringo - 'Latin-American surrealism has
enchanted the globe, but its freedoms cannot be claimed as a matter of
course. Mere mannerism results.'
Yet other important non-fiction titles were sent his way too, and what in
reviewing fiction is generally a kindly approach tends to develop sharper
teeth and claws when moving into the wider literary world. Of Marion Meade's
biography of Dorothy Parker he describes the writing as 'shoddy, the mood
sour and the subject resolutely unsympathetic', though that does not prevent
him delving into the squalid intricacies of the Algonquin world. He lambasts
the flatness of Peter Ackroyd's prose in his biography of TS Eliot and
launches his discussion of a biography of Bernard Berenson with the
observation that 'It is always a pleasure to see a reverenced reputation
besmirched'.
Yet alongside those is a lucid appreciation of Stephen Jay Gould, admiration
for Ryszard Kapuscinski's artless portrait of Haile Selassie, horror-struck
wonder at the letters and drawings of Bruno Schulz. In surveying what
amounts to much of the significant literature to have been published over
the eight years covered by Odd Jobs Updike is never concerned with
prescriptions, or with offering a map through the styles and ideas of his
contemporaries. Instead he holds up a mirror to the world of letters, one
that is truthful and compassionate, in just the same way that his fiction
has always reflected the hopes, aspirations and disappointments of his other
world, that of middle America.

   CHURCHILL AS WAR LEADER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHT OR WRONG? by Richard Lamb Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 400 pages
'EVERY FIT male should be made to fight and die for victory . . .' Churchill
cabled one of his generals after a setback in the Western Desert. And then
to his resident minister in Cairo: 'Everyone must fight exactly as they
would if Kent or Sussex was invaded. Tank hunting parties with sticky bombs
and bombards . . .'
If most people's impression of Winston Churchill is of a man of great energy
and courage, over enthusiastic in seeking to attack, but lacking patience
and judgment at critical points, then Churchill As War Leader - Right or
Wrong? will confirm it. The 'right or wrong' addendum is a bit flashy: as
this detailed and scholarly sifting of the records makes abundantly clear,
most questions about the conduct of the war admit of no such either/or
answer.
The author elaborates many errors of judgment on Churchill's part but his
overall verdict, as might be expected, is highly laudatory: 'Without him
Britain would have succumbed in 1940. No other British statesman could have
created the same faith in victory and inspired the nation to fight on
wholeheartedly when all seemed lost . . . Despite many blunders and hasty,
impetuous decisions, only one verdict is possible. He was a great wartime
leader.'
What then is the value of Richard Lamb's new account? It is that by
focussing on certain key issues of the war in which Churchill chose to make
a personal intervention, his role and his contribution are highlighted.
Thus, in backing the speediest possible evacuation of British forces from
Dunkirk, in supporting aid to Stalin, in provoking of Japan so as to bring
America into the war, he was 'right'. In the sinking of the French fleet at
Mers-el-Kebir, in the weakening of British strength in Malaya which led to
the fall of Singapore, in encouraging the use of atomic bombs against Japan,
he was 'wrong'.
A minor but revealing case was his support of Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. A
naval hero of the Zeebrugge raid of 1915 in the First World War, Keyes had
the kind of swashbuckling zest for adventure exactly calculated to appeal to
Churchill, who appointed him Director of Combined Operations.
Keyes conceived the idea of seizing Pantellaria, a small island between
Sicily and Tunisia. Churchill was completely swept away by his enthusiasm,
despite the opposition on strong military grounds of the Chiefs of Staff.
In the end the operation never took place, but that did not stop Keyes
constantly importuning Churchill. Other schemes of his included invasions of
the Azores and the Canary Islands, the Channel Islands and Casablanca, and
towing concrete towers out to sea as anti-submarine forts. In the end, and
against his instinct, Churchill was forced to dismiss Keyes. This reads
(now) more as a comic interlude whereas some of the major mistakes of the
conduct of the war have had a lasting effect. The misunderstandings, for
instance, documented at length in so many histories and memoirs, which arose
with the French and General de Gaulle. Their origin stemmed could not rely
on Admiral Darlan's promise that he would sink his ships rather than allow
the Germans to seize them. At Mers-el-Kebir the French fleet was put out of
action and many French seamen lost their lives. 'The French have never
forgiven Churchill and the verdict of history must be that by ignoring
Admiralty advice . . . he prejudiced the Allied cause . . . almost his
biggest wartime error,' says Lamb, adding that official histories are not to
be trusted on this episode.
It is obvious that in the heat of decision-making, as in the heat of battle,
mistakes will be made. When it came to recording what happened, Churchill
himself was often at pains to disguise his role, when he realised he had
been wrong. 'Relentlessly,' he was prepared to suppress minutes and falsify
his own memoirs, claims Lamb. He also put pressure on official historians to
conceal chunks from the archives.
For all this, Churchill's feats are in a sense enhanced by his shortcomings
which were, so clearly, the obverse of his great virtues. Readers of a
generation born after the war, with no direct memory of those cataclysmic
times may wonder why these old battles should be argued over again by
contemporary historians. The answer is that they were extraordinary times,
and Churchill exercised extraordinary leadership. The man met the hour.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Eating Out: Your guide to the guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO YOU long to be a restaurant inspector? The perks include: free lunches
and dinners; travel; being paid for the privilege of eating and drinking;
and the opportunity to pass judgment on those who stand and serve. The
reality is very different. Lunch and dinner may be far from memorable and
there may be a long stretch of motorway in between. At the end of the day,
all that may await is a strange bed, a mountain of paperwork and a creaking
digestive system. Small wonder that many inspectors have shorter lifespans
than Chicago futures dealers. This week sees the publication of The 1992
Michelin Guide to Great Britain and Ireland (Pounds 10), the last of the
four major guides for 1992. The others are The Good Food Guide (Pounds
12.95), The Egon Ronay Cellnet Guide (Pounds 12.95) and the AA guide (Pounds
12.99). They are full of facts, percentages, telephone numbers and ratings.
But do not buy any of them if you are looking for inspiration or a sense of
fun. For those who want a guide containing information, description and a
sense of the real pleasures that may await, the solution could be to ignore
the national guides and invest in new, more particular ones. Harden's London
Restaurants 1992 (Pounds 7.50) is the most practical solution for anyone in
town. And I can recommend John and Sally McKenna's Bridgestone Irish Food
Guide (Pounds 9.95) for those crossing the Irish Sea. However, The Good Food
Guide remains the most readable of the major players. Its editor, Tom Jaine,
a former restaurateur and a knowledgeable food writer, has done a great deal
to rectify the quirkiness indulged-in during the 1980s. But the guide has
not sought to match the increasing professionalism of British restaurateurs
and hoteliers with more professional and precise inspections that rely less
on readers' reports. So, I think the guide, which this year celebrates its
40th birthday, has relinquished pole position.
It is a place the Egon Ronay guide has shown no inhibitions about trying to
fill. It is packed with advertisements: the first 20 pages extol Cellnet and
the cellular society, followed by an exhortation to eat American ice-cream
and then pay for it all with an American credit card. It does seem, however,
to have lost touch with the reality of 1992.
This year's awards go to an hotel where a room for the night costs Pounds
250, and to two restaurants where dinner for two will be not less than
Pounds 130. It adds, condescendingly for those who cannot afford those
prices, that one of the chefs will soon be opening a new restaurant 'to a
larger public of smaller means.'
The Ronay guide and the AA guide are, however, the most comprehensively
descriptive guides to what this country has to offer. Graphically, they both
need a major overhaul; lost at night in a country lane with either of these
guides, you will need a magnifying glass to help find the way to bed.
Michelin suffers from no such faults. Its city centre maps are clear and its
information extensive. Why, then, does it do so little with all these facts?
This year's guide merely tinkers with the starred restaurants. There are no
changes among those with two or three stars, and some strange omissions and
additions to those with one star. But, the biggest change, unexplained, is
the 20 per cent decline in the number of restaurants in England and Wales
with a red M - the category of restaurants 'supplying carefully prepared
meals at reasonable prices.'
Has the quality offered in this category - the type of restaurant to which
you should be able to afford to go more than once a month - declined so much
in one year? If so, Michelin ought to be explaining this, not only to the
general public but also to the catering world.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Wine: Full-bodied winter warmers - Sherries worth the
attention of great wines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST moderately-priced aperitif in summer must surely be fino or
manzanilla sherry; but, in the six or seven colder months of the year, there
is a strong case for fuller-bodied, rich (yet, for the most part, still dry)
sherries: amontillados, olorosos and that comparative rarity, palo cortado.
They have a concentration and depth of flavour that is warming and
comforting in chilly weather and also can be more interesting drinks than
the attractive, light, dry sherries that refresh but do not enrich the
palate. More alcoholic, they have powerful aromas and flavours.
They confirm the traditional British preference for full-bodied sherry
although, apart from a few special wines, they are not sweet as were most in
Victorian times. The 60,000 bottles from the Royal cellars (in Buckingham
Palace, Marlborough House, Windsor Castle and Sandringham) that had been
accumulating since 1863, and which King Edward VII had auctioned at
Christie's on his succession, were mostly 'golden.'
To a public accustomed to consider sherry as sweet (only a maximum of 15 per
cent of sherry produced is fino or manzanilla), it is a surprise to learn
that, if sweetened later, all sherry is fermented-out completely (with the
sugar converted into alcohol) and is, therefore, dry. An element of
glycerine might give a smooth, slightly sweet nuance to an amontillado or
oloroso.
It used to be considered a mystery as to whether the young sherry in a cask
turned out to be a fino or an oloroso, but modern techniques generally can
ensure the result desired. Moreover, certain vineyards in the Jerez area are
noted for one or other: for example, Macharnudo for fino and Carascal for
oloroso.
The finos produce flor: a rather unpleasant-looking thick scum that protects
the sherry from oxidation. But oloroso either has none or very little; what
there might be is killed promptly by fortification with brandy mixed with
must.
Whereas finos increasingly are fortified as little as possible, up to only
15.5 degrees, amontillados and olorosos will be upwards from 19 degrees to
21.5 and even higher for very old sherries in which the percentages of water
have diminished. But these are not sold commercially.
The solera system - which ensures that wines move through a series of
'scales' over the years until they reach the solera from which the finished
wine is drawn - means it is not possible to give an age for a sherry. The
average for finos is six years and true amontillados (finos allowed to
develop in cask) will have been aged for at least eight years and should be
nearer 12. Fine olorosos are older, and special blends from very old soleras
may be from 20 to 40 years in age.
These finer types of sherry are not represented very well in the lists of
some of the more distinguished independent wine merchants in the UK. This
might demonstrate a lack of experience or interest among their customers;
but with lists to hand, they are given when available.
Amontillados, noted for their nutty bouquet and flavour, are lighter and
generally less alcoholic than olorosos. Their fino origin makes them less
concentrated, although they are very smooth and provide easy drinking.
However, those from an old solera which seldom is drawn off are very
different.
A delicious example is Gonzalez Byass's Amontillado dell Duque Seco y My
Viejo (Peatling, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Pounds 15.49) a rich,
concentrated wine with a slightly-smoky nose. A small glass of one of these
old amontillados and olorosos goes a long way. Less concentrated but with a
distinguished flavour is Valdespino's Amontillado Tio Diego (Wine Society,
Stevenage, Herts, Pounds 7.85).
Corney &amp; Barrow, London EC3, has a special blend of Garvey's Old Dry
Amontillado with a clean, dry finish (Pounds 9.99); and Philip Eyres,
Coleshill, Amersham, Bucks, lists an Amontillado de Jerez (Pounds 10.76)
from the high-quality firm of Lustau.
Although all of these are exceptional wines, my favourite for winter
drinking is old, dry oloroso. It has a delicious bouquet, a warming flavour
and a long finish that can contain a hint of sweetness but is not heavy.
Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk, lists Hidalgo's Oloroso Seco (Pounds 6.86);
Harveys of Bristol produces Adorno, a fine old oloroso bottled in 1974
(Pounds 9.50); Peatling has Apostoles Oloroso Abocado (Pounds 15.49), a wine
of great depth with a hint of sweetness; and the Wine Society has the
distinctive Valdespino Viejo Oloroso (Pounds 6.75).
Quite different is the old, sweet oloroso of Gonzales Byass listed by
Peatling: Matusalem Oloroso Muy Viejo (Pounds 15.49, also listed by Adnams).
This is more for dessert or between-meals drinking unless you share the
French sweet taste for aperitifs.
A very rare wine is the 70-year-old Solera Oloroso Extra of Blazques
(Adnams, Pounds 26.25) and the Wine Society's 30-year-old, very sweet
Carascal Viejo Oloroso Dulce (Pounds 7.75).
Palo cortado is a very concentrated dry wine, often claimed to have the
bouquet of an amontillado and the flavour and body of an oloroso although
more delicate. It breeds no flor and is said to have been common before
phylloxera destroyed the Jerez vineyards at the end of the last century.
Then, it became a rarity found in only one in every 3,000 casks. Today,
though, palo cortado obviously occurs much more often as it can be found on
supermarket shelves.
A wine labelled palo cortado that is clearly sweet is not a true one, but
Valdespino's Palo Cortado (Wine Society Pounds 5.75) has a touch of the
rich, raisiny Pedro Ximenez sherry used in cream sherries.
Adnams lists Hidalgo's Jerez Cortado (Pounds 7.35) and the superior Dos
Cortados from Rosario Farfante (Pounds 9.60). Averys of Bristol has a Lustau
Palo Cortado (Pounds 7.39) while Lay &amp; Wheeler also sells Hidalgo's Jerez
Cortado (Pounds 8.30). Finally, from one of the specialist wholesalers,
Almacenistas, comes Lustau's Palo Cortado Cayetino del Pino (Wine Society,
Pounds 5.75 a half-bottle).
All these three types of sherry are to be savoured slowly rather than tossed
off, and are worth the attention given to great wines.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Gardening: . . . and Charity went to seed - The results of a
chance encounter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST spectacular shrub in my garden for some weeks has been Mahonia
Charity, a fine evergreen with long leaves composed of a number of
holly-like leaflets and small yellow flowers in slender spikes, themselves
arranged in large, cartwheel-shaped clusters.
It was a chance hybrid between two wild species named M. lomariifolia and M.
japonica which was picked out of a nursery bed early in the 1950s by Sir
Eric Savill, who was buying plants for the Savill Garden in Windsor Great
Park. When he discovered that, among his plants, he had an entirely new
variety, he thought he had been very fortunate; and so he named his find
Charity.
Since then, a number of seedlings from Charity have been raised in the
Savill Garden and two have been named and distributed. One is called Faith
and the other Hope and both can be obtained from the Savill nursery.
Something like 200 seedlings were raised by the late Lionel Fortescue at the
Garden House, Buckland Monochorum, Devon, by making deliberate crosses
between M. lomariifolia and M. japonica. The idea was partly to test the
theory that this really was the parentage of Charity and partly to find out
if he could produce something different and possibly better.
The theory was proved correct and some seedlings of great merit were
obtained, a few of which were named and two of which, Buckland and Lionel
Fortescue, are available fairly readily.
Finally, the Slieve Donard Nursery in Northern Ireland, the area where the
accidental cross occurred (although this was not the nursery from which Sir
Eric Savill got his plant) also made the cross by hand and gave the name
Winter Sun to what it considered the best seedling. This, too, is available
from a number of shrub nurseries.
Unlike M. japonica, which spreads and sprawls, Charity and its man-made
cousins all grow rather stiffly erect and get to look a little gaunt with
age. But they respond well to pruning in spring and this can be done to keep
them shorter and make them bushier. My own plant has been shortened once and
is now about 9 ft high with many fine flower clusters.
As usual, the first rhododendron to flower in my garden this year was R.
nobleanum. (This is also a hybrid between R. arboreum and R. caucasicum) but
one that has been made deliberately and repeatedly, the first recorded cross
being in 1829. Because of this multiplicity of breeding, with each cross
probably made between parents that were a little different, there are many
variations on the hybrids themselves.
Not that you will find it easy to buy plants of R. nobleanum. Even the Plant
Finder is able to list only nine sources; but one of them is the great
private woodland garden, Leonardslee in Sussex, which has a small nursery.
Inquiries can be sent to Leonardslee Garden, 1 Mill Lane, Lower Beeding,
West Sussex.
Rhododendrun nobleanum has small clusters of funnel-shaped, rose-pink
flowers which pale to white at the throat. For display, it cannot stand
comparison with the splendid Hardy Hybrids that flower in May and early
June, but it is a cheering sight on a winter's day when there is nothing
remotely like it in flower.
Viburnum farreri is flowering exceptionally well this winter and I rate it
ahead of its offspring, V. Dawn, because the stems are more slender and
flexible and the flower clusters, although smaller, are more numerous and
make, I think, a prettier display. They are apple-blossom pink, paling to
white with age, and are scented sweetly; but, on this score, I think there
is little to choose between the species and its offspring. The individual
flower clusters of Dawn are, however, at least three times the size of those
of farreri and they start off a strong rose-pink, paling to near-white with
age.
The full story of Viburnum bodnantense Dawn (to give this fine shrub its
full name) makes piquant reading. It is a hybrid between V. farreri and the
more tender but larger-flowered V. grandiflorum, and the cross was made
first in 1933 in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, by Charles Lamont the
assistant curator. But he did not think any of his seedlings represented any
improvement on either of the parents so he did not even bother to give any
of them a name, let alone distribute them.
About 1935, the same cross was made in Lord Aberconwy's garden at Bodnant,
in the Conwy River valley in north Wales, with a totally different result.
The best seedling was exhibited at a Royal Horticultural Society show in
London, received an award of merit and was named Dawn. Years later,
Nottcutt's Nursery, which now has its headquarters at Woodbridge in Suffolk,
made a similar cross, called its best seedling Deben and got an even higher
award from the RHS - a first-class certificate.
The Edinburgh Botanic Gardens had not abandoned its plants, though, and
called one of its seedlings Charles Lamont. Whether it has ever been put up
for an award, I do not know, but there are good gardeners who consider it
the best of the lot.
The happy ending to this story is that although Dawn and Deben are by far
the easiest to buy, plants of Charles Lamont are available from at least a
dozen nurseries. Consult the Plant Finder for addresses.

(Iris histrioides)
This is the sturdiest of the very early flowering, bulbous-rooted Irises
and, in a mild winter, it can be opening its clear-blue, gold-crested
flowers out of doors without any protection by the end of January. However
its flowers are fairly fragile and easily battered by wind and rain so many
enthusiasts shelter them with cloches or sheets of glass held securely above
them on wire or wooden supports.
The ultimate in refinement is to grown them in pots or pans in an unheated
greenhouse or conservatory, for which purpose they are ideal.
The small bulbs should be planted one to two inches deep in gritty soil and,
if they are grown outdoors, a sunny place should be chosen, preferably
sheltered from wind. A rock garden or a border against a south or
west-facing wall is ideal.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Property: Hertfordshire Tudor Lordship for rent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lordship at Standon is the formal name of the house, but any buyer who
wanted to add the Manorial Title to the village of Standon in Hertfordshire
need only work out a deal with the present owners who bought the Title a few
years ago. The Lordship is a genuine 16th-century manor house built for Sir
Ralph Sadlier, one of the custodians of Mary Queen of Scots. Often in
distinguished houses the owners have added wings as the fancy took and the
purse allowed. Here, the various owners stopped at eight principal and four
secondary bedrooms. The 11-acre estate contains 350 yards of indifferent
fishing on the River Rib, a helicopter pad, a hard tennis court, paddocks
and landscaped gardens. The Lordship was brought to the market by Strutt &amp;
Parker's St Albans office (0727-40285) last autumn with a tentative asking
price of Pounds 1.25m for the freehold. S&amp;P's Anna Rowbottom says: 'The
owners bought The Lordship around ten years ago when it was divided into
two. Now, it is a beautifully restored Manor house, but it doesn't feel at
all overwhelming. They have made it an ideal family house.' Ideal or not,
Pounds 1.25m has proved too steep for the people who have viewed the house
so far. Now, in a set-piece illustration of the new question that must face
any would-be country home buyer in the next few years, S&amp;P is offering to
rent the house for Pounds 3,000 a month. Rowbottom expects rental inquiries
from the usual directions for properties of this size: overseas bankers on a
short stay in the City, companies keen to have a single country retreat for
executives being jetting around the world, or senior business people
travelling with their families who need a British base for from six months
to a few years.
After allowing for tax and other costs, anyone putting the asking price on
deposit and renting instead would be making a large financial saving. On the
face of it, the suggested rent barely equals the capital value of a third of
the asking price. That reflects a demanding asking price and the current
immaturity of the larger country house rental market. But that immaturity
will not last for long in face of these kinds of financial alternatives.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Property: The marina mystery - John Brennan asks why
Britain's 3m sailors do not buy more purpose-built yachting properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SHOULD be a dream for every leisure sailor. Living in a marina home, able
to watch sails pass the window and step from the veranda onto your yacht.
But if that is the case why are there so many leisure sailors in Britain and
so few marina homes?
Equally, why, given that such purpose-built homes are rare, should
yacht-orientated housebuilders be suffering just as tough a home sales
market as their landlubber counterparts?
The number of people who 'mess about in boats' is increasing. The exact
number is not known but the figure of 3m active and occasional boat users in
Britain is commonly used.
On the supply side of the equation the number of marina homes is quite
unrelated to that ostensible demand. In recent years only 1,800 to 2,200
boat-orientated homes have been completed in the south of England.
If 3m boating enthusiasts were in pursuit of a couple of thousand marina
homes, this would be an even more exotic sub-division of the residential
market than it already is. But it is clear that the majority of casual
leisure sailors do not have any special interest in, or the resources to
buy, a home by the water.
Boating tends to call for a greater degree of commitment than most leisure
activities. As such, the gross figures for the number of active amateur
sailors can include a heavy turnover of people who try taking to the water
but never become serious. As far as buying a waterside property is
concerned, we can further eliminate the substantial number of leisure
sailors who use small boats. They may be regulars but for them a permanent
marina berth would be unnecessarily lavish.
Many of the often-cited limitations on the supply of marina homes would have
been overcome if buying demand had been more consistent. But there are
genuine physical constraints on the supply.
The stretches of coastline that the average leisure sailor is happy to set
out from, and to sail around, are largely in the south of England. Any
changes planned within a harbour, river backwater, estuary, or even mud flat
along that coastline is of immense local and, potentially, national
interest. Opportunities to create adequate yacht berths and scope to develop
berth-side residential property have been scarce.
Nevertheless, outstanding planning applications and currently unused
consents for marina properties around the south coast give the lie to the
suggestion that building restrictions, ecological concerns or coastal
protection matters are an absolute bar on new building. Most of south
England's coastal towns are keen to win the extra business that a plush
yacht marina attracts.
Infrastructure costs are also an important block to new marina. Even on a
small scheme it can cost several million pounds for site preparation, sewage
works and water level management before any property is available to
generate cash to offset the financing costs. And when it comes to financing
costs, the City is highly sceptical of anything with a leisure association.
The financial implications of the marina creations have made City investment
funds nervous, not to say terrified. The Brighton Marina fiasco is the main
reason. Immense and costly infrastructure works were paid for without any
hope of the proposed yacht berth rental business alone generating enough
revenue to make the scheme work.
It took George Walker, in his Brent Walker days, to spot the need for more
revenue earning facilities and the scope for creating marina islands giving
the opportunity to sell marina houses to supplement the boat rentals. As the
costly sea walls and water regulating locks had been built and paid for by
the ill-advised city funds, Walker was able to make the necessary internal
changes without too much expense.
This kind of investment story has had a negative effect on fund managers'
willingness to stray into the sector again. Brighton Marina may not be the
sole culprit, but it certainly has been one reason why British leisure
developers have had to lean more heavily on bank finance than their
counterparts in the US or Japan. There, leisure properties are treated as a
viable investment suitable for the most staid of the insurance or pension
funds. Leisure developers can refinance projects without becoming
overdraft-logged like their British counterparts.
Under-financing and corporate death by drowning in an irreversibly rising
overdraft proved to be something of a business standard among would-be
marina developers in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Boat yard and yacht berth owners recognised that change was leading towards
a future where boat owners would insist on a better quality of berth, and
that demand for moorings outstripped the existing supply. Many owners
responded to this with a club house and an in-season shop.
Plans for homes overlooking the boats quickly landed on the authorities'
desks. Many of these multi-phase schemes won permission for the early stages
which involved change of use of existing surplus commercial or old
industrial properties.
A number of landowners and their funders went ahead on this basis even where
their architects argued that the scheme would only make a satisfactory
living area in its entirety. The owners' concerns only surfaced when they
discovered that even boating purists will not pay a waterside premium for a
house on a building site.
The simplistic idea that there are so many leisure sailors and so few
waterside homes inspired a number of small boat yard owners and local
builders to start their waterside cities. A disproportionate number of
individual marina schemes stumbled to a halt because of the classic problem
for a sole developer: slower than forecast initial sales which crippled cash
flow.
Marina Developments' emergence as market leader in the mooring and
development business in the 1980s owes much to judicious mergers and
acquisitions of waterside projects, some of which fell into the
cash-strapped category. Now, five out of the group's 16 coastal and
Thameside yacht and boat mooring sites rate as marina villages with a total
of 450 homes completed.
Like its on-shore equivalents, Marina Developments has stopped building
residential units while it retains unsold stock. The company's spread of
activities means that it has been able to look to its commercial property
and moorings business to help counter the downturn in residential sales.
However, a reported 70 unsold flats and houses is a painfully high
proportion of the 450 total in its five marinas.
If the market leader cannot sell homes, talk of the marina market avoiding
the worst of the sales decline is clearly wrong. But the company reports an
air of 'quiet optimism', after a successful London Boat Show.
A competition offering free moorings for the winners helped attract 700
leisure sailors to sales staff at the Boat Show compared to 100 last year.
Basic information gathered from brief interviews will help the company to
follow up with an appropriate sales story; whether for a short of long lease
mooring, or for one of the marina homes.
The company is active in cross-selling to its wider customer base. Existing
long-lease berth-holders are seen as a source of potential marina
home-buyers. These leaseholders are being shown how the sale of their
mooring rights could generate a good proportion of the cost of a 999 year
lease on a marina flat with its own mooring space.
The company is also trying to persuade marina flat owners to buy a house.
Prices range from two bedroom appartments for Pounds 70,000 in Milford
Haven, west Wales, to large houses with mooring space for the largest
vessels near Plymouth and Southampton for nearly Pounds 500,000. 'There
are,' says Sue Howson of Marina Developments, 'deals to be done.'
But the conundrum remains unresolved. Where are all the leisure sailors with
the time and cash to rest by the sea? At these prices they evidently
represent a far less plentiful species than anyone imagined when first
reviewing marina prospects.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Sport: Edberg sees off young pretenders - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS afternoon Monica Seles, the queen of women's tennis, will face the
20-year-old American, Mary Joe Fernandez, in an attempt to grunt her way to
a second Australian Open crown to retain tenure of three of the four grand
slam championships. Of the major titles, Wimbledon alone lies in other
hands, and this year the 19-year-old Yugoslav double-hander, whose
mysterious last-minute withdrawal from Wimbledon last year caused a row,
says she intends to make a strong challenge at the world's oldest
championship. Only then will we know where among great champions we should
rank this remarkable player. In turn, tomorrow sees an intriguing clash
between the two men ranked 1 and 2 in the world - Stefan Edberg of Sweden
and Jim Courier of the US. This is a repeat of last year's US Open final,
when the 26-year-old Swede lifted his game to undreamt-of heights in 6-2 6-4
6-0 victory that he described as his best-ever tennis. In spite of a
nine-week lay-off, Edberg is almost back to that form under the guidance of
coach Tony Pickard, the British Davis Cup captain. In many ways this has
been an historic Australian Open. As if to underline the rapid rise of so
many talented youngsters, for the first time we had two unseeded men's
singles semi-finalists: Wayne Ferreira of South Africa and Richard Krajicek
of the Netherlands. These two 20-year-olds came to the fore at these
championships last year by reaching the last 16 unseeded at their first
attempt. This time they confirmed their promise. Ferreira had three good
wins. First he beat Karel Novacek (seeded 8) in four sets, then the
Wimbledon semi-finalist David Wheaton (15), also in four, and finally the
rejuvenated John McEnroe in an absorbing match.
Before that McEnroe, unseeded and unfancied, had played vintage '83 tennis
to remind us of his immense talent. First he thrashed defending champion
Boris Becker, who seemed determined to prove that he is now a baseliner (how
arrogant can you get?); then he thwarted Emilio Sanchez in the match of the
championships so far.
After winning the first two sets and being caught at two sets all by the
speedy Spaniard, the 32-year-old US left-hander had looked on the point of
collapse on a sweltering afternoon. When McEnroe saved three match points in
the final set and came through to win it 8-6 after four hours 32 minutes of
sweat and toil, he received an ovation that even in his heyday he rarely
experienced.
This was a new McEnroe. He competed hard but with complete fairness. He
refused to question a single call, and how they loved him. But the effort
had taken its toll. In spite of intravenous re-hydration he had nothing left
to give.
Ferreira was put in his place by Edberg. But the favourite had to save two
set points in the first set before cruising into his fourth Australian final
with a 7-6 6-1 6-2 victory, and he was impressed. 'Wayne showed that he can
really play good tennis; he started fast and didn't seem to be nervous,'
said Edberg.
Krajicek's victories over former French Open champion Michael Chang (14) and
the current Wimbledon champion Michael Stich (4), both in five sets, were
immensely impressive. In the past this 6 ft 3 ins Dutchman has failed in
long matches, most notably against Ivan Lendl at last year's US Open when he
held match point in the fourth set - only to lose it and the next six games
as well.
In both his tests here he was magnificently purposeful. Against Chang he
threw the fourth set to conserve energy and won the decider 6-3, ending with
three aces. Against Stich he could afford no such luxury: he was two sets to
one behind.
The way he held his serve, and his nerve, proved the value of his training
under the guidance of Amsterdam-based coach Rohan Goetzke. This has included
haptotherapy, a means of inducing mental relaxation through touch. The
treatment has certainly transformed a man who, in his junior days, was
notorious for his instability.
Krajicek's decision to default to the No 2 seed Courier was sad but
inevitable after he had retired during his doubles semi-finals with Jan
Siemerink against the Australians Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde on
Thursday. His serving arm was simply worn out.
'Before this I had never passed the second round of doubles in a grand
slam,' he said. 'Suddenly I'm playing every day. I have only just stopped
growing. I haven't got my strength yet, so it's pretty dangerous to play too
much tennis.' But even after the tournament doctor had warned him of the
dangers, he did not find it easy to accept that he should not continue. 'It
was one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make. It was the
chance of a lifetime to play a semi-final of a grand slam. I don't know if
it will ever happen again.'
Seles had been a trifle lucky to win here for the first time last year. In a
tense semi-final against Fernandez she had faced a match point against the
tenacious baseliner.
The 20-year-old American will relish the opportunity to challenge her again
today after an impressive semi-final win against the No 2 seed, Gabriela
Sabatini, that revealed a new, aggressive quality in her play.
Although Sabatini had won nine of their 14 previous meetings, including the
last six, the Argentinian had always lost to Fernandez won five of their
first meeting as seniors, the last occasion occurring at the 1989 French
Open.
Since then, Sabatini has recovered her poise against Fernandez, but on
Thursday she could not cope. 'I was surprised how well she played,' she
admitted.
I doubt if Seles will be taken by surprise today. The champion has looked
better than ever, thumping and grunting her way through relentlessly. Even
the bright new German star, 17-year-old Anke Huber, who had put out last
year's finalist, Jana Novotna, could not detain her long. Nor could the
effervescent Spaniard, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in the semi-finals.
Sanchez-Vicario was blown away 6-2 6-2. I suspect that the same fate will
befall Fernandez.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Motoring: Any colour except red - Stuart Marshall asks what
your car's paintwork says about you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD HENRY Ford once said, unforgettably, that customers could have one of
his Model T 'Tin Lizzies' painted any colour they liked so long as it was
black. That was before the First World War but change came slowly.
Forty years on, more than one-third of the cars at the Earl's Court motor
shows in the years directly after the Second World War were black. If you
wanted a colour, not only did you pay extra - you had to put up with paint
that lost its sheen and faded fast, however busy you were with polish and
dusters each weekend.
Compare the scene today. Fly into Heathrow or Gatwick airports, look at the
thousands of vehicles in the car-parks. What do you see? Most are red, white
or blue, in that order, followed by grey or silver metallics.
There is a pecking order in paints. Sombre shades are posh. The topmost
people choose very dark red (like a glass of Cahors), midnight blue, greens
so dark they could be taken for black and of course, black itself.
ICI, a leading supplier of paint to the car-makers, says the once-despised
black has made a comeback recently and is being chosen for almost one new
car in 10. Surprisingly, it is favoured as a 'boy-racer' colour for hot
hatchbacks. Perhaps the owners think it makes them less conspicuous when the
police are about because, in general, younger motorists go for bright
colours.
Psychologists believe driving a bright red car encourages aggressive
tendencies, especially among the young. Some years ago, Audi dropped red for
that reason. But now you see a lot of new, bright-red Audis. A change of
heart by the company? 'No, I think perhaps we changed our psychologist,' an
Audi man surmised.
Colour can make a big difference to trade-in values, as owners of lavender,
pink, orange or yellow cars often find to their cost. It does not pay to be
too trendy. There is a reward for playing safe.
Still rare in Europe, but tipped by ICI as a rising star, is the pearlescent
finish which sparkles subtly because it contains millions of tiny particles
of mica. Nearly one American-made car in three now has it and the fashion is
likely to cross the Atlantic soon.
Motorists worry less about preserving their car's looks than they used to.
ICI approves. Modern paints, it says, are so tough they will last for years.
Just remove grime with plenty of water and a few drops of detergent. The
whirling brushes of a car-wash will do no harm to the majority of today's
models, although abrasive road grit should be hosed off first. And
polishing? Once every six months should preserve a showroom gloss, says ICI,
reassuringly.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Sport: Bills seek their place in history - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARV LEVY, Harvard graduate, history buff and poetry lover, talks a mean
game of American football.
The silver-haired head coach of the Buffalo Bills analyses the strategies
and tactics of the sport in a precise, elegant manner. His comments in press
conferences can come laced with literary allusions. He uses words like
'inculcate' and 'salient' in pre-game meetings with his team.
Tomorrow in Minneapolis, however, the erudite Levy will leave the talking to
his players, who must play a mean game of football if they are to defeat the
Washington Redskins in Superbowl XXVI.
The Redskins start as favourites, and are expected to win by at least seven
points according to the bookmakers in Las Vegas. Yet for those of us who
have enjoyed watching the Bills this season, it is difficult to think of
them as underdogs.
Under Levy, Buffalo has set the National Football League alight in the past
two seasons with a rapid-fire passing and running game which led the team to
a host of high scoring victories.
At the root of their success is the 'no-huddle' offense - a tactic that
dispenses with the huddle before each play and allows the quarterback to
call his own moves. At its best, the no-huddle offense puts points on the
board quickly and leaves opposing defenses scrambling to keep up with the
pace.
At the heart of the Bills attack are two great players, quarterback Jim
Kelly and all-purpose running back Thurman Thomas. Kelly is an experienced
leader with a sharp tactical brain and a strong arm, while Thomas is a
superb all-rounder, a quicksilver runner and an acrobatic receiver.
Powered by Kelly and Thomas, and supported by receivers James Lofton and
Andre Reed, the Bills topped the statistical tables in a number of key
attacking categories this season, including most total yards gained and most
touchdowns scored.
So with all their offensive firepower, why aren't the Bills favourites to
win?
There are two reasons, and both come down to defense. The Redskins' defense
is strong, against both the running and the passing game, and it ranks third
best in the league for overall effectiveness.
Washington's defense is especially good at 'blitzing' the quarterback - in
the 16 regular games this season they reached opposing quarterbacks and
sacked them 50 times. Kelly has looked vulnerable to the sack in the past,
particularly two weekends ago when the Denver Broncos' blitzed relentlessly,
giving Kelly insufficient time to get his no-huddle offense into gear.
The fragility of their own defense, which ranked next-to-last in the league
this season, is the second reason why the Bills are not favourites tomorrow.
They have shown an improvement in the playoffs (holding Denver to just seven
points in the AFC Championship game), thanks partly to the return of two
powerful players, slashing defensive end Bruce Smith and bulldozing nose
tackle Jeff Wright.
Yet in the Redskins, the Bills defense will be facing one of the toughest
offensive lines in football. This is where the 'Hogs' come in. Hogs is the
collective nickname for the enormous front-line that defends Redskins'
quarterback Mark Rypien.
Not only are the Hogs good at giving Rypien time to throw long passes to
receivers Art Monk, Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders (the protection has been so
effective that Rypien was sacked just nine times all season), but they are
also adept at knocking holes in defensive lines for backs Ernest Byner,
Ricky Ervins and Gerald Riggs to run through.
One big advantage the Redskins have is the versatility of their attack. The
Bills rely heavily, perhaps too heavily, on Thomas's all-round skills. Stop
Thomas, and Buffalo usually struggles.
Washington's three running backs possess different strengths and styles
providing a balance of power and precision. The trio of fleet wide receivers
spread defenses and regularly break open for long yardage. The variety of
attacking options available to Redskins coach Joe Gibbs helps explain why
his team was the highest-scoring unit in the NFL this season.
Yet, as any fan of sports cliches knows, statistics and history mean little
when it comes to one Big Game. The difference may ultimately lie in
motivation, and how badly each team wants to win.
In this respect, the Bills could have the edge. It has been 363 days since
Scott Norwood's potential game-winning kick sailed wide of the right hand
goalpost in the closing seconds of Superbowl XXV against the New York
Giants, and the determination of the Bills to avenge that loss burns just as
bright as it did a year ago.
Both teams have prepared thoroughly, but Buffalo seem to have gone about
their business amid the outrageous hype and publicity of Superbowl week in a
quieter, more purposeful manner.
And while less than half of the Redskins are survivors from the team's last
Superbowl appearance in 1987, the Bills squad is much the same as it was
last year. The memories of that game are still fresh for Jim Kelly, Thurman
Thomas, and Bruce Smith. My money is on Buffalo to win by three points,
courtesy of kicker Scott Norwood.

FT  25 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Stresses and your tresses - Lucia van der
Post gets to the root of hair repair, finds out what it costs to breathe
clean air and visits a furniture showroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are not too many growth industries around at the moment but stressed
hair seems to be one. JF Lazartigue, the Frenchman who is to hair what Jane
Fonda is to aerobics, has seen his sales worldwide go up by 20 per cent
every year for the last 15 years. Al though in France growth last year fell
to 5 per cent from the 15 to 30 per cent he had become used to it is still
growth. When times are tough women, it seems, still find time and money to
invest in their hair. You probably feel you have more than enough to worry
about and are stressed enough already without fresh troubles but, if JF
Lazartigue is right - and he is in a good position to know - then you had
better start worrying now. 'More and more women are coming into my centres
with thinning hair,' he says. Women, it seems, do such terrible things to
their hair. They perm it and tease it, colour it and twist it. They wash it
with shampoos that are too strong and dry it at high temperatures. The world
around them does not help either - the air is polluted and then they lead
such stressful lives. 'All this,' Lazartigue is convinced, 'shows up in the
hair.' He used to be just a simple hairdresser but soon began to specialise
in 'defrisage' (hair-straightening). Most of the women who wanted their hair
straightened had badly abused hair. 'And,' as he puts it so succinctly, 'you
cannot make a nice hairstyle with poor hair and many of my customers had
very poor hair.' He started to make products to deal with the hair
conditions that kept turning up in his salon. 'Everywhere else there were
average products for average hair. Nowhere could I find specialist products
to deal with special problems.' The first he made out of beef-marrow, a
traditional remedy de grand-mere, which he collected from butchers' shops
all over Paris on Saturdays and boiled up at home in stock-pots on Sundays.
As his product range grew he found the women who came to his salon wanted to
buy the products to take home - in other words, they seemed to feel they
worked.
He had never wanted to sell just potions - he wanted to find a way of making
sure he sold the product that matched the problem.
So the concept of the diagnostic and advisory service developed. Women would
have their hair examined - a few hairs would be plucked out and studied
under the microscope by a qualified analyst. Only then would the right
products be prescribed. The first centre opened on the Champs Elysees in
1975 and from the first day women went there with their hair problems. Today
there are 140 centres in some 40 different countries.
Having your hair analysed can be, I warn you, a depressing experience. When
I dropped into the first ever JF Lazartigue Diagnostic and Advisory hair
centre some three years ago, the news was all bad. Only one of the some 20
hairs that the delightful Odile put under the microscope could be said to be
anywhere near normal. All the others were pronounced no good because the
hair was damaged. Baldness stared me in the face. I crept away with a
fistful of potions in a plastic bag. Odile did not see me back. If there was
any more bad news in the pipeline I did not want to know.
Three years on and, against all the odds still with a full head of hair, I
went along to talk, but only to talk, to Jean-Francois Lazartigue as he
opened yet another of his hair and treatment centres, this time at 204
Sloane Street, London SW1. Nothing was going to get any of my hairs near the
microviewer.
There was the lovely Odile again, hair as lustrously shining as ever and,
wouldn't you know, I hardly had my coat off before my hairs were magnified
80 times on the screen.
Odile and I were quite astonished - 'Look,' she says, pointing to the
magnified root on the screen, 'a beautiful pear-shaped bulb. The shaft is
very healthy, too. Everything is brilliant, you just have a little build-up
of oiliness in the roots.' Ah, the relief. I can put off the visit to the
wig shop.
The roots are, of course, where all the trouble begins. Detergent-based
shampoos and stress combine to make the hair bulb produce squalene, an
acidic ingredient in sebum, which can damage the hair. 'We must catch that
now,' said Odile and wrote me a chart of what to do. I was prescribed a
gentle, non-detergent based shampoo, something to help rebalance the
oiliness in the roots, and a conditioner to give everyday body to the hair.
Once a week, she suggested, I should set aside 20 minutes and give my hair
deep conditioning and restore more life to my highlights.
Does it work? It is hard to say. The products feel and smell good. I like
the idea that I am using non detergent-based shampoos, that the products
have an air of quality to them. If they do cost more than the usual
chemists' range (the cheapest shampoo is Pounds 12, the most expensive
Pounds 19, the colour reflecting conditioners Pounds 16 and the most
expensive product, for urgent rehabilitation is Pounds 28) then I am
prepared to pay the difference. Hair products in most stores and chemist
shops are very broadly targeted. Everything in the Lazartigue range, on the
other hand, has been developed for very specific hair conditions. The acid
test seems to me that customers come back.
There are three diagnostic and advisory centres in this country: 20 James
Street, London W1M 5 HN, 204; Sloane Street, London SW1 9XQ; and the JF
Lazartigue counter at Harrods, Knightsbridge, London SW1. For those who
cannot get to the centres the products are sold in good chemists and by mail
order (a questionnaire accompanies the form) from 20, James Street.

A FEW weeks ago when Zeev Aram, the one-time Israeli sailor who for the last
27 years has run London's finest modern furniture showroom, opened the doors
on his latest venture - a brand-new furniture shop in Hampstead's Heath
Street - Aram fans could hardly believe their eyes. There, beside the Eileen
Gray sofa, Shiro Kuramata's curving chest of drawers, Gufram's cactus
hatstand, were a pair of solid yew 18th century Windsor chairs, a fine 18th
century oak German bureau, a Spanish solid walnut table dating from the
early 18th century.
For those who over the years have come to regard Zeev Aram as the high
priest of modern design and his Covent Garden showroom as its temple it was
something of a culture shock, rather like a teetotaller waxing on about the
wonders of Claret or Mother Theresa embracing capitalism.
Zeev Aram admits it is something of a new departure: 'It is the first time I
have had antiques in any of my shops but I hoped that by showing how well
good antiques and good modern designs work together I could encourage people
to be more adventurous in their own homes.' (Good thinking if you aim to
sell modern design to all those Hampstead period houses). 'So often people
see modern pieces and are intrigued and interested by them but they are
frightened to buy because they say it won't go with the things they already
have. I wanted to show them that what really counts is quality - not age.
'Poor quality pieces, whether new or old, will look shoddy beside fine
pieces but if you have fine antiques then the sort of modern pieces I sell
should enhance them. Besides, it is sterile and depressing to pursue one
particular style to the nth degree.'
For Zeev Aram quality has always been what his shop is all about. There is
many a would-be fan who has been priced out of the shop by Aram's refusal to
have any truck with anything not made as finely and well as can be. Nothing
he has sold has ever been cheap - though the less well-heeled design fan
could go for Alvar Aalto's famous wooden stool at Pounds 56 or a Best &amp;
Lloyd classic 1930s light at about Pounds 100.
Aram originally meant to become an architect. When he discovered that he was
endlessly specifying from the same small range of available modern classics
he decided he might as well start importing a wider range himself.
His first King's Road shop introduced names and designs that were then
unknown in 1960s Britain - Breuer's Wassily chair, Le Corbusier's Gran
Confort, Flos's fastidious lighting. The litany of classics brought to the
UK by Aram is long and distinguished - from Breuer's chairs in 1964 to Vico
Magistretti's latest collection for De Padova of Italy.
For those who missed buying some of these when they first became available
the prices make heartbreaking reading - Corbusier's chaise-longue, for
instance, was about Pounds 190 in 1966 and is Pounds 1,480 today, the Breuer
Wassily chair first went on sale in 1964 at Pounds 49 10s. Today it is
Pounds 796 while Shiro Kuramata's irregular chest-of-drawers (above) sold
for Pounds 1,800 in 1981 and is Pounds 8,500 today.
Probably Aram's bravest venture was his decision to take the long-neglected
designs of Eileen Gray, an Irish-born designer who worked mostly in France
before the war, and to negotiate the manufacture and world-wide licensing of
her furniture. He become enthused by an exhibition of her work at the Heinz
Gallery. Today, because of his initiative, her furniture sells all over the
world and I do not know of a sofa I would rather own than Gray's
majestically simple Lota.
It cannot have been easy through the years, carving a niche in what is
certainly an expensive, corner of the design market but there he still is.
Fashions have come, fashions have gone. Blow-up chairs and see-through
sofas, folding paper tables and liquorice-coloured lumps of foam have come
and gone but Aram Designs is still there, insisting on quality, quality,
quality.
There are some who might think that Aram's approach to interior design
smacks of an over-refined austerity - but his championing of Gufram's cactus
hatstand and the Capitello chair prove them wrong. Nobody could ever accuse
him of shoddiness or lack of attention to detail.
Today his range is wider and more eclectic than ever and his shops at Kean
Street, Covent Garden, London WC2 and now at 65 Heath Street, Hampstead,
London NW3 are an essential stopping-off point for anybody interested in
fine modern design. Even those who cannot afford to buy should not neglect
to go and look.

FT  25 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Clean air that costs money - Lucia van der
Post gets to the root of hair repair, finds out what it costs to breathe
clean air and visits a furniture showroom
</HEADLINE>

AS temperatures plunge most of us turn up the heating. Those with antique
furniture, musical instruments or paintings may be nervous about what this
does to their cherished objects.
The answer is likely to be a lot of harm. Many a valuable piano or piece of
inlaid furniture has cracked and split - not so much because of the heat
itself but because of the dryness the heat causes.
But there is no need to panic. Something can be done, and relatively
cheaply. Humidifiers deal efficiently with the problem and the simplest
humdifier in the world consists of a saucer kept filled with water.
Anybody wanting professional advice might like to know that The Air
Improvement Centre at 23 Denbigh Street, London SW1V 2HF, has brought out
two leaflets (with the blessings of Sotheby's and the British Antique
Furniture Restorers Association) filled with advice on how to care for
antique furniture and musical instruments.
Both leaflets are free, both are packed with advice covering everything from
where to put furniture, how to wax it and the range of humdifiers available.
The Air Improvement Centre sells humidifiers so, naturally, it has a vested
interest in the matter but the leaflets do offer sensible advice.
If you decide to opt for a sophisticated humidifier you can always go along
to the centre and buy one.
A simple hang-on radiator humdifier, the Casana 500, for instance, sells for
Pounds 24.60 while a more sophisticated electric model, the Turmis 200,
sells for Pounds 98.
Anyone who suffers from sinus problems or hay fever or who feels the air in
their home should be cleaner might like to bear in mind that The Air
Improvement Centre aims to improve the air you breathe. It has a range of
panaceas - ranging from ionisers to air improvers at prices ranging from
about Pounds 30 to Pounds 400.
One of my favourite mail order catalogues, LL Bean of Freeport, Maine, in
the US, has decided to make a big play for the international customer.
It is making it as simple as possible to do as chic Americans have done for
generations and dress the LL Bean way.
For a copy of the catalogue you either telephone (and LL Bean is famous for
keeping its shop and its telephone lines open 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year (1-207-865-3111, fax 1-207-878-2104).
There is a British address: LL Bean Inc., PO BOX 54, Swindon, SN5 8LB.
For those who have not yet discovered the charms of LL Bean it was the
original purveyor of the much-copied Ivy league look.
It started by specialising in rugged wear for fishing, shooting and other
pioneering activities but these days urbanites are as much addicted to
chinos, cotton seersucker shirts, handsewn shoes, and rugby shirts.
Since those early days the range has expanded and there is a special range
for women which includes sunglasses, walking shorts, canvas shoes, leather
belts, khaki culottes - as well as traditional, outdoor gear.
Prices seem reasonable with wool 'ragg' socks, for instance, selling at
Dollars 7 (Pounds 3.80) a pair and men's stone-washed jeans selling at
Dollars 28.50 (Pounds 15.70). Bear in mind that you also have to pay
postage, packing and any duty.

FT  25 JAN 92 / As They Say in Europe: Watch your tongue]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Germans have been pleading for their language to be given appropriate
recognition in the European Community: it is, after all, the mother tongue
of a quarter of the Community's population. In London, the Daily Mail
newspaper has been waging a campaign to ensure English is the language of
Europe. French President Mitterrand has said he will sack any of his
officials who does not use the 'world's most glorious language' when
addressing international gatherings.
All this adds up to a greater need for Britons to understand more other
languages. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing though, as I found at the
age of 12 in Holland. I asked a friend to tell me the Dutch for 'excuse me'
and he told me 'donder op.' I got halfway down an Amsterdam tram before it
dawned on me that something was wrong. I was actually saying: 'Get out of my
way,' rather rudely. It was silly because the Dutch speak everybody else's
language perfectly; if everyone was like them, there would be no trouble.
Unfortunately, most Britons are not; and there is a ghastly gamut of
pitfalls, misunderstandings and homonyms which, allied to the universal
belief that foreigners are stupid or funny or both, can lead to a lot of
ill-feeling. The English laugh at other people's English while remaining
less aware of how they can generate endless amusement in France. I have lost
count of the number of diet-conscious Britons who have asked if there were,
say, preservatifs dans le gateau. In other words, are there condoms in the
cake? The term 'cul-de-sac' is perfectly good English; but in France for the
past 150 years, it has had to be rendered as impasse. Cul-de-sac manages to
be lavatorial and genital at one and the same time. And this is the great
problem.
Even the sight of certain words in another language can lead to jeering,
contempt and coarse allusions. No red-blooded Briton can be initiated to the
joys of the autobahn without nearly crashing the car on sighting the word
Ausfahrt at the first exit.
The Germans are defensive about their language. They know that the piling-up
of words to make new words, and the minefield of bits of verbs at the end of
sentences, is a source of mirth and irritation to other nations. But I
recall a magnificent defence of the German language in the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung some years ago.
Among other things, it pointed out that other languages lacked German
precision. For example, that well-known thoroughfare in England, Old Fish
Hill Street, was absurd. Nobody could tell whether it was the fish, the hill
or the street that was old. In German, there could be no possibility of any
misunderstanding.
Misunderstandings are the norm between closely-related languages. The
Spanish find the Portuguese entertaining. Voce me deixou embaracada means
'You have embarrassed me' in Portuguese but 'You've made me pregnant' in
Spanish.
The Slavonic languages are where the fun really starts. It is not surprising
that Serbs and Croats are at each other's throats when you know that bulja
means 'head' in Zagreb but 'arse' in Belgrade. Then there are simple
problems, such as the fact that zapominac is the Polish for 'forget.' In
Russian, it means 'memorise.'
The worst difficulties arise between Polish and Czech, as I found out some
years ago when working in that part of the world. I 'phoned a contact in
Prague, but the woman who answered spoke no English or German. Czech is not
my language so, drawing on my slender reserves of Polish, I said, 'I am
seeking Mrs Vesela.' My interlocutor said something like: 'I don't wish to
know that,' and slammed down the phone.
The trouble was that the Polish word for 'to seek' is szukac In Czech,
though, that word is the coarsest way of saying 'to make love.'
For sheer linguistic confusion, though, it is hard to beat the great novel
All Quiet on the Western Front. In German, that is the lapidary Im Westen
Nichst Neues which translates easily into the Polish Nic Nowiny na
Zachodziem. But that title on a book in Czech would mean 'There's no paper
in the lavatory.'

FT  25 JAN 92 / Ivory towers come under siege: The antipathy between the
business world and universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROFESSOR at a large and prestigious business school in a North American
university set his class a question and gave it a list of articles to
consult for the answer. When the the students went to the reference library,
they found someone had got there first and removed all of them with a razor.
They complained to the professor. Instead of deploring what had been done,
he commended it because, he said, it showed the sort of initiative needed in
the business world.
That true story dramatises a feeling shared by many academics in Britain:
that universities and commerce are not good partners. To which the men of
commerce reply: 'Those damned dons . . .'
The damned dons doubtless include some who are in academia because they are
too feeble to do anything else; but an intrinsic fear of change does not
account wholly for their objections either towards business studies as a
subject or else running universities like businesses.
There is a widespread feeling that it is not the business of universities to
teach business; that as soon as you start putting university education onto
a utilitarian basis, its nature is perverted. This is an odd argument: the
instruction of doctors and lawyers was one of the first purposes of our
universities.
When initial moves were made in Cambridge to expand courses in management
studies, one hostile professor declared to the Senate that 'British
management' was as much of a joke as British weather or British Rail. He
said he saw plenty of British university lecturers being lured to work in
the US - but no British managers.
The answer to this sort of hostility is simple. If Britain wants better
managers, it ought to take their education seriously and accept the study of
management as an intellectual discipline in its own right.
Further donnish dismay is caused, I think, by an association between
businessmen and philistines. Again, this depends on ignoring commerce as a
traditional buttress of higher education. The last Cambridge college to be
founded was Robinson: it was made possible by the success of Radio Rentals.
The Cambridge Department of Archaeology is thriving not because of its
student numbers but because the late Daniel McDonald, an engineer obsessed
by the earliest developments in human technology, endowed it with Pounds
10m.
The residual worry to university teachers, though, is whether a
business-like attitude towards higher education might mean that in 20 years'
time the study of, say. Egyptology would be impossible. And this is the crux
of the present debate.
To those involved in it, the situation has become an issue of two cultures:
the pure and the applied (or, the pure and the businesslike). This dichotomy
quite supplants the old two cultures of CP Snow, for the division between
pure and applied affects the sciences as much as it affects the humanities.
To the world of commerce, a degree in pure mathematics is as useless as a
degree in Egyptology. No accountant need be vexed by the concept of an
infinitesimal number; if, in the future, mathematics departments are to
depend upon accountancy firms for their funding, then the fear is that
applied mathematics will bully pure mathematics out of existence.
Snow's two cultures always struck me as a trumped-up thing. It must have
been plain to everyone 30 years ago that the divisions within most
university English literature departments ran much deeper than any divisions
between the 'humanities' and the 'sciences.' And Snow's notion that
novelists and arty types have behaved generically like Luddites towards
industrial progress now looks outmoded.
My revised two cultures' divide works much better. Its obvious features were
satirised neatly in David Lodge's Nice Work: pin-stripes v. corduroys, and
so on. Poles of opposition are easy to identify, especially using the
measure of remuneration. For instance, external examiners - that is, staff
from one university who monitor the examinations of another - have been told
recently by the new Academic Audit Unit to think of themselves as management
consultants.
Fair enough: external examiners perform the task of consultants, reporting
on efficiency of teaching, progress of students, success of new courses, and
so on. But they do so at a rate of something under Pounds 5 an hour. Who has
the right to judge their performance by commercial standards so long as they
work from vocational motives?
It sounds sanctimonious, but it is true: university teachers do not
generally work for the money. So, one can understand the sentiment that when
professors begin to be paid like company directors, then university
departments can be subjected to the same sort of auditing procedures as a
commercial concern.
Resentment against the managerial annexation of the universities ought to be
tempered by optimism: after all, it should suit most dons to be paid at
commercial levels. But while businessmen may feel frustrated at the way in
which the idea of a liberal university education - stated classically last
century by the theologian JH Newman - still dominates British academia, they
must recognise a genuine concern for intellectual standards there.
Imagine that a firm producing canned beans pours money into a nutrition
research unit. Would anyone be surprised if it published a report telling us
that a can of beans a day was the only way to avoid heart disease? The
patronage of university research by private companies always will be prone
to this sort of abuse.
There are, however, signs that men of commerce are coming to terms with a
fact that redeems the whole notion of an ivory tower.
The pure and the applied constitute, in common parlance, the ivory tower and
the real world; what happens in the tower is supposed, commonly, not to
integrate with what goes on outside. The history of the advancement of
scientific knowledge reveals that supposition as foolish.
So it is that many of the most commercially-successful advances in chemistry
came not from directed, applied or 'strategic' inquiries but from what
scientists call 'blue skies' research (or, put another way, the notion that
what drops out of the blue skies might be worthless - or worth a fortune).
One example. Herchel Smith was a lecturer in organic chemistry at Manchester
when he and a colleague, experimenting on methods of synthesising steroids,
came across something which became the contraceptive pill. A patent was
secured and neither chemist need ever have done another day's work in his
life. But Smith has used his fortune to endow a set of professorial chairs
in Britain; and, with his experience of patenting, he has promoted study of
the law of intellectual property.
Every company worth the faith of its shareholders ought to be trying to get
its hands on a stake in that commodity: intellectual property. It is
something which, on the whole, is appreciated better in Germany and the US,
but some sectors of British business are well aware of it.
According to a recent survey* of research and development spending,
companies such as ICI, Shell, Unilever and Glaxo are most generous. Nuances
of emphasis in spending vary; but Michael Elves, director of external
scientific affairs at Glaxo, says spending is by no means confined to the
sort of directed research which guarantees a quick return.
Glaxo supports contractual research for the sake of convenience - when it is
easier to have a particular task assigned to a university laboratory - and
provides for a number of studentships and fellowships aimed at producing
graduates who will be useful to the company. But it also has endowed several
professorial chairs at British universities which are intended solely to
further basic scientific understanding.
Of course, such research ultimately might be very much in Glaxo's interest.
But the Glaxo philosophy is based on an understanding that the future
targets of the company - say, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, parasitic
diseases, Alzheimer's - are difficult and distant. Short-term applied
research is myopic; to see far enough takes time, unrestricted time, in the
ivory tower.
So where, you might ask, does this leave our budding Egyptologists?
They might take comfort from the American paradigm: specialised subjects
within the humanities survive healthily, for the very good reason that they
are fascinating areas of study to some people. If you find a subject
fascinating, you tend to do well in it; and a first-class degree in
Egyptology is, ultimately, worth more than a third-class degree in
economics.
As Newman pointed out: The 'opposite of a liberal education is a servile
education: the education of slaves, not thinking individuals.' In the
tradition of a liberal education, it is as valuable to support Ventriss and
Chadwick working towards deciphering Mycenaean Linear B as it is to support
Crick and Watson on their course to DNA. To quote GM Trevelyan, the
historian: 'Disinterested intellectual curiosity is the life-blood of
civilisation.'
Trevelyan's words might well have been used by Enoch Powell, the classicist
and former politician, as the epigraph of his recent document** deploring
the present government policy of losing the distinction between universities
and polytechnics. He declares: 'If thought and study had been restricted to
whatever held out the prospect of material advantage, that explosive
coruscation of human achievement which is European civilisation would never
have occurred.'
As a former professor of Greek, Powell will know all about Archimedes who is
said to have disdained to write any textbooks on the applications of his
discoveries, preferring to work upon 'speculations whose beauty and subtlety
were untainted by the claims of necessity.' That university dons are
difficult to deal with must be due partly to this Archimedean kind of
high-mindedness - a refusal to meet the humdrum world on its own terms.
The irony however, is that the inventions of Archimedes proved useful,
within his own lifetime and with his own sanction. Despite themselves, the
two cultures of pure and applied can never stay apart for long.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Polo passions split a village: The 'foreigner' whose plans
have caused outrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE IN the village of Shiplake, on the river Thames between Reading and
Henley, west of London, might appear almost as serene and uneventful as it
was in 1850 when Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the poet, married Emily Smallwood in
the village church and wrote about the Thames along the silent
level/Streaming thro' his osier'd aits. It is shaped by the seasons on the
river.
High summer brings the ceaseless motions of boats: sleek gross cruisers,
polished skiffs, stumpy launches and sturdy punts. Come autumn and winter,
the boathouses are closed, the craft disappear. A silent, clammy chill
settles on the water. Scratch Shiplake's surface, though, and strong
passions are revealed. Tension seethes, antipathies flourish.
Two volatile elements are at the heart of the trouble: a foreigner - and a
sport. Between them, they have fractured the village's cherished
tranquillity.
The sport is polo, a game favoured by the well-born - and unusual for being
played at the highest level by people whose chief qualification often is not
talent, but wealth. Imagine that John Paul Getty, having endowed a new stand
at Lord's, should open the batting against Australia.
It is only a little less odd that one of the four players in one of the most
formidable teams in English polo, the Ellerston Whites, should be its
patron, Kerry Packer, reputedly Australia's richest man. Packer has bought
his way into the game with a grandiose disregard for cost. His reward is to
play with the best - for all that he is in his 50s with a near-fatal heart
attack behind him.
It is not Packer's performance on the field that interests the people of
Shiplake, however. It is the subtle but determined way in which he was able
to transform his estate at Stedham, 50 miles away in West Sussex, into a
polo centre, in spite of fierce opposition - and with no more than a nod in
the direction of the planning laws.
Initially he told the local council that he was researching strains of
hoof-resistant turf and, therefore, did not need planning permission.
Eventually, the council tried to check his ambitions and battle was joined.
Packer won. He was allowed to run his estate as a polo centre and,
crucially, to stage official matches, although he was not allowed to put up
grandstands or marquees, instal public address or television equipment, or
land helicopters.
Urs Schwarzenbach, a Swiss financier who owns one of Shiplake's grandest
riverside houses, is another polo enthusiast. Like Packer, he has his own
team, the Black Bears. And he, too, has ambitions for his property - more
modest than those of the Australian, but equally contentious.
In addition to his principal residence, Thamesside Court, Schwarzenbach owns
two adjoining mansions as well as a farm which covers much of the open land
along the river between Shiplake and Henley. He says he was bitten by the
polo bug a few years ago. But it was only last year, when a massive
construction programme began, that the nature of the infection began to dawn
on his neighbours.
It included digging a lake, levelling and sowing two playing fields, laying
roads and building bridges, and erecting nearly 100 stables.
What alarmed neighbours more than the noise and the dust of building,
however, was that no planning permission had been sought. Schwarzenbach's
view - was that what he did on his land was his business.
Matters came to a head one Saturday last June when Schwarzenbach entertained
his polo friends on a grand scale. A temporary stand appeared beside one of
the pitches and a PA system announced itself. Mercedes, Rolls-Royces and
Range Rovers towing horseboxes purred up the drives; helicopters descended;
;security men patrolled.
'This,' says the neighbour who leads the anti-Schwarzenbach movement, 'is
what he calls 'sticking and balling' with a few chums. He has come here and
is flouting our planning laws. I can't believe he would get away with it in
Switzerland, and he's not going to in Shiplake.'
The owners of the villas, bungalows and mock Tudor piles strung along the
bank upstream of Schwarzenbach were, they say, ready and willing to welcome
the newcomer. But they claim he has broken the rules and upset the even
tenor of communal existence.
Schwarzenbach himself remains resolutely in the shadows. Those who speak for
him - architects, planning consultants, flooding experts, noise specialists
and lawyers - have done their best to persuade local people that they have
nothing to fear.
Exhibitions have been staged and brochures circulated. The message is that
velvet lawns, stables, avenues of newly-planted saplings, the distant sounds
of cantering ponies and stick against ball represent a vast improvement on
the unkempt, pick-your-own fruit farm and boat-building business that
disfigured the land previously.
Schwarzenbach also has promised repeatedly that he will not stage tournament
matches but his neighbours remain sceptical, their suspicions fuelled by his
application to build a helipad beside one of the polo fields. The South
Oxfordshire District Council has now has issued enforcement notices
requiring the dismantling of virtually all the polo-related works.
Schwarzenbach has lodged appeals and applied for planning permission. All
sides seem ready for a stern battle.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Too high a Costa?: The 'nursing home of Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK INMAN and CLARA VILLANUEVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'KEEP Gibraltar,' Spain's King Juan Carlos is reported to have said to
Prince Charles. 'Just let us have Javea back.'
A sleepy port on the Costa Blanca, Javea could almost be another Home
Counties borough were it not for the perpetual sunshine. Its gleaming white
houses are fringed by well-intentioned but threadbare lawns and thirsty rose
bushes. There is an English school, an Anglican church, a local Conservative
branch, a tea room and a charity shop.
Javea is typical of Mediterranean Spain. From Valencia to Gibraltar, the
coasts have been taken over by Britons and other northern Europeans. It has
been estimated that 7 per cent of the population of Alicante province are
what are oxymoronically called 'residential tourists.' Some resorts have
more foreign residents than native Spaniards, posing unusual political and
social problems.
According to Francisco Jurdao and Maria Sanchez, authors of a study of
Spain's foreign residents, there are 1.5m foreigners living in Spain
(including 160,000 Britons) - three times the number of officially
registered foreign residents. Exact figures are hard to come by because most
residents seek invisibility for tax purposes.
'Don't use my name or say I live here,' said one man, 'I come for three
months at a time as far as the Inland Revenue and the immigration
authorities are concerned.' These are not film stars and criminals, 80-90
per cent are elderly or early-retired people.
The first settlers arrived in the late 1960s when Spain was a backward
country by European standards and desperate for income. Life was cheaper and
no town hall clerk dared to wave the planning by-laws at a sterling-bearing
foreigner.
Since Spain joined the EC in 1986, the cost of living has soared. Foreign
settlers resent the rise. Some claim that, were it not for the reduced
winter fuel bills, it would be cheaper to live in Britain. A few have gone
home already.
Others would like to but are caught in an expatriate 'poverty' trap. The
money they would get for their villas would not buy them anything comparable
in the inflated British property market.
They are not in Spain because they love it. They have come for the good life
in which it is always afternoon and the booze is cheap enough to substitute
for tea.
The ex-patriates remain determinedly British. They observe English
meal-times; they have their own pubs and clubs, fish and chip shops,
newspapers and magazines. They keep their TVs tuned to satellite channels.
'Their bodies are in Spain but their brains are in England,' said Alan
Lipton, former editor of a local newspaper.
The further away Spaniards ('them') and the real Spain are, the better. The
language and culture are of little interest to the settlers and the natives
are almost an inconvenience: Spaniards, they moan, know all about
bureaucracy but nothing about queuing.
Their lingua franca is English. To talk Spanish is almost unpatriotic.
Twenty-two per cent of foreigners questioned by Francisco Jurdao and Maria
Sanchez on the Costa del Sol did not believe it was necessary to know any
Spanish to live in Spain. 'To solve the problem of communication,' said one,
'the Spanish should learn languages because the majority of us find it hard
to learn Spanish.'
The authorities seem content to leave the foreigners alone in return for
their contribution to the country's crucial tourist industry, which accounts
for 10 per cent of GNP. In fact, the money they bring to Spain is minimal.
Their savings are kept in Gibraltar, Jersey and the Isle of Man - out of
reach of British and Spanish tax men. The rich set up offshore companies
especially to 'buy' their houses and avoid tax.
Until now the two communities - indigenous and settler - have gone their
separate ways. But the day of reckoning is at hand. Spaniards are beginning
to wonder what has happened to their once-beautiful coasts and who all these
people are, living in Spain but refusing to be part of it.
So far, it has been up to each coastal town to cope as best it can. Some
have made a good living from the marks, kronas and guilders; but they may
yet have to pay the price.
Thirty years ago, Alfaz del Pi (population 7,000, more than half of them
foreigners) was a sleepy orange-growing village of dirt roads. Now, it has
modern health and art centres, a multi-lingual radio station and children of
18 nationalities at its primary school.
Improvements have been paid-for largely by the town's disenfranchised
foreigners. Mayor Toni Fuster waxes eloquent about his 'planetary town' with
its 'great international family,' but most of his foreign residents would
rather have their cash than the services.
What do you say to a retired foreigner who does not want to pay for all
these public works? 'It's a question of solidarity,' said Domingo Martin,
Alfaz's director of services. 'No one lives alone.'
The foreigners may not agree when they finally get to vote in local
elections. The Dutch were deprived of the vote last time by a loophole
engineered by the Socialist government, fearful that the 'grey vote' would
be cast in self-interest. It is unlikely that the government will be able to
stop EC citizens voting in the next elections in 1995.
Spain is fast becoming the 'nursing home of Europe': a sunny place where
colder countries 'export' their elderly. Even Japan has flirted with the
idea of creating colonies of pensioners on the Costa del Sol.
In the meantime, someone has to clean up the mess caused by three decades of
unchecked coastal development. Most estates were built hastily in the days
before democracy, conservation and planning. 'Someone's going to have to
sort out the problems of sewage, rubbish disposal, water pollution, soil
erosion and desertification,' said a spokesman for Valencia Community's
Environment Agency.
If, in a borderless Europe, we all decide to end our days in the sunshine,
someone will first have to bring order to the chaos.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A calendar man who aims to sell
sails - The ups and downs of Rick Tomlinson's venture into publishing his
own yachting calendar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICK Tomlinson has no difficulty choosing the source of the photographs for
the glossy calendar his company publishes. All 12 images are shot by
Tomlinson in the course of his work as one of the world's top yachting
photographers.
Calendars with every picture taken by one man are not so unusual. One tends
to think of Lord Lichfield and a portfolio of semi-clothed young women as
being typical of the genre. But Tomlinson does more than take the pictures.
He is also publisher; and in just three years he has created a market he now
dominates.
The first Tomlinson calendar was the 1989 edition, which cost Pounds 9.95
plus post and packing and sold 5,000 copies by mail order. 'It somehow made
a slight profit, largely because the printer managed to foul everything up,
repeated the print run and then gave us a rebate,' recalled Tomlinson, with
the air of a driver thinking back to a nasty car crash that was just short
of fatal.
Inspiration for his project came from the Beken calendar, produced annually
with great success by the Cowes family who have been taking genteel,
graceful pictures of yachts for over a century. Beken's pictures evoke an
endless Edwardian summer. Tomlinson's photos feature more icebergs than
picnics. He felt there might be room in the market for both aspects of
boating.
'I looked around for a publisher or a backer. Neither were forthcoming,'
said Tomlinson, who - at 33 - still has the looks and manner of a modest
choirboy. 'That wasn't too surprising since I was a very naive photographer
who had really only been in the game five minutes.'
This is a little too self-deprecating. Tomlinson trained in his native Isle
of Man as a traditional high street studio photographer whose commissions
included the inevitable weddings. 'They certainly teach you patience and how
to handle people,' he says now.
Early in the 1980s he ran away to sea, becoming a professional sailor on the
big French multi-hull yachts that then dominated grand prix ocean racing. He
crewed on Drum, the maxi-yacht pop star Simon le Bon owned and entered in
the 1985/86 Whitbread round-the-world race. The photos he took - delicate
portraits of owner and crew and green-water excitement in the Southern Ocean
 -led Tomlinson back into full-time photography once the 32,000-mile race
ended.
His work took him to regattas all over the world. As a former competitor he
was welcome on the best boats, put in the best positions and able to exploit
his artistic talents to the full. When the calendar idea took root, he had
few assets other than a fistful of glamorous photos and a well-travelled
kitbag. Tom Power, a Dublin 'yachtie,' marketing consultant and friend
agreed that Rick had a viable project and offered to back it. Thus
reinforced, Tomlinson decided to go it alone.
'My local bank manager gave me a Pounds 20,000 overdraft secured against my
mother's house and we began production in midsummer of 1988,' he recalled.
Early support came from marine industries buying the calendar for client
gifts; but he was unprepared for the mail-order rush produced by
advertisements in the specialist yachting magazines.
'It was a a nightmare in the first year,' he remembered. 'Travelling around
the world to take photos and flying back to St Mary Port to open a snowdrift
of orders on my desk. I had no idea the amount of paperwork a mail-order
business would generate and it's so time-consuming.'
Tomlinson lured his sister, Cathy Kneale, out of her life as a housewife to
help. She works full time on the calendar with part-time help taken on at
the autumn peak.
After the debacle with the printer, Tomlinson became much hungrier about his
print quotes. He found a Dutch company which would print better quality at
nearly half the cost. He also broke the advertising budget in the first
year, following instincts, not the business plan, he says ruefully.
About 60 per cent of the calendars go to corporate customers, overprinted
with company names and personal messages, 30 per cent are sold by mail order
to private individuals in dozens of countries, and 10 per cent are sold
through yacht chandlers and bookshops.
'We're now printing double the number of calendars for half the original
cost, so we must be getting something right,' said Tomlinson. He thinks
there is potential to double the number of units sold to corporate customers
next year. 'It is much more profitable than the mail-order side, although
it's nice to get flattering letters from people in Japan who want the
calendar.'

FT  25 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The frankest guide to Manhattan -
The man who tells New Yorkers where to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULD you buy a guide to London written by a Muscovite? Or, if you were a
publisher presented with the finished manuscript written by one, take the
risk of publishing it?
The answers to both these questions must be 'No.' But in New York (where, as
the sweatshirts declare proudly, many are 'Born to Shop') the most
successful guide - called, appropriately, Find it, Buy it, Eat it in New
York - is written by Gerry Frank, an Oregonian, born and brought up 3,000
miles away from Manhattan.
But if Frank lacks native skills, he has more than made up for them in other
qualities. His guide has sold more than 500,000 copies, most of them to New
Yorkers, and has been published in spite of a string of rejection letters
from publishers there.
Frank comes from an eminent family which controlled Meier and Frank, the
state's largest retailer. As a boy, he worked in its store-room. Then, after
stints in the army, Cambridge and Stanford universities and in the front of
the stores, he rose to become vice-president. Since the company was sold in
1965, Frank has devoted his time and organisational flair to a myriad of
charities, public committees - and to Senator Mark Hatfield, for whom he has
been chief of staff in Washington DC for 19 years.
Frank enjoys Washington's corridors of power but not what the capital had to
offer socially. Soon after moving to the East Coast, he began to spend
weekends in New York. There, like any visitor, he walked the streets. But,
like any born retailer, he did so with pen and paper.
Frank quickly compiled the most obvious lists - where to eat, shop and find
the best breakfast - but then began to show his pedigree. Which 'discount
stores' really were cheaper than the department stores, and where could you
find a dry cleaner open on Sunday? Where could you play miniature golf in
Manhattan? Frank quickly found out.
His large circle of friends soon took advantage of these discoveries and
then suggested, selflessly, that they would make a good book. Frank began to
approach publishers, who failed to see a market for the guide or the
determination of its author.
In 1980, Frank hired a publisher in Oregon and printed 10,000 copies of his
first guide at his own expense. Back in New York, he began the hard sell,
first at Dalton on Fifth Avenue and then at other large bookstores.
Persuaded by his charm (or merely to see the back of him), each ordered a
few copies which began to sell.
Frank made them sell even faster. He went on talk shows; he sold to
executives at ABC-TV and Merrill Lynch, which ordered the book as corporate
gifts, and he worked the more unusual markets. New York Air bought 75,000
copies for a promotion, and one leading hotel a further 5,000.
By 1986 and its third edition, the guide had broken even. Frank had spent
several hundred thousand dollars of his not inconsiderable fortune but the
arithmetic now is more comforting. It costs Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 111,700)
to print 75,000 copies, which will bring him in almost Dollars 400,000. His
biggest investment now is in shoe leather.
Over the years, Frank has visited more than 1,400 restaurants and walked in,
around and out of every store mentioned (plus, he estimates, about 10 times
as many that are not included), while a female assistant does the same for
women's stores and beauty salons. Every other weekend, he picks a different
district of New York and walks the streets.
When he is not collecting data, Frank collects chocolate cakes. Wherever he
travels, he pursues his quest for the perfect chocolate shop. Perhaps he
will write a guidebook.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Standing on his own legs - David
Spark meets John Franklin, who abandoned the safety of the BBC for an
uncertain living making aluminium props which keep yachts steady on the
beach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 22 years, John Franklin designed the images projected behind BBC
election broadcasters and weathermen. When he left the BBC six years ago,
because he could not live with its new management style, he began to work
full time in his private business, making telescopic aluminium legs for
yachts. Before Franklin, sailors who wanted to prop-up their yacht on a
beach had to use lumps of wood, sometimes with disastrous results. Now, if
they have fitted the Franklin system, they have a pair of adjustable legs
which clip into special fittings on the sides of the boat. These legs can be
extended to the sea bottom. When the tide goes out, the yacht can stand
safely on its keel, steadied by the legs, while the sailors sun themselves.
At the BBC, Franklin worked all hours at busy periods and took time off when
work was slack. He used this spare time to start a business in his garage,
making aids for the assembly of printed-circuit boards at EMI, ICL and other
manufacturers. The idea for yacht legs came from his brother, an ocean-going
yachtsman who wanted to buy a ready-made pair and found he could not.
Franklin decided on light, corrosion-resistant aluminium as the best
material but found that no-one stocked seamless tubes of the right strength
and specification which could telescope together. He had to have dies made
for tube extrusion. Even so, the manufacturer proved more adept at raising
prices than extruding tubes to acceptable accuracy. Faced with a choice
between giving up the business and finding a new supplier, he found Stubbs
Metals, which not only supplied cheaper tubes to a better specification but
also absorbed the die costs of Pounds 4,000. 'If there were more companies
like Stubbs,' he says 'the economy of this country would be in better shape.
He now has a new problem: premises. The workshop where he cuts, drills and
coats his aluminium tubes is in a rebuilt barn near Slough, west of London.
Next July, such workshops on farm premises will acquire users' rights under
European legislation. South Buckinghamshire council is getting in first by
issuing stop notices. Franklin says he and the other six small businesses on
the farm can stave off eviction by taking their case to a public inquiry.
But, even if they win, they will have to pay more rent because, for example,
mains drainage will have to be installed. At present, he pays Pounds 3.50 a
square foot - but, if you have no work, anything per square foot is a
problem.
Franklin yacht legs cost Pounds 350 to Pounds 950 a pair, and he sold 120
pairs in 1989. The recession struck in spring 1990. Turnover that year was
Pounds 45,000, yielding no profit above Franklin's salary. Sales in 1991
will probably have been 75 pairs. 'At one period, I was sitting here for
five weeks and didn't even get a phone inquiry.'
Fortunately, he has paid for all his equipment out of income. 'We don't need
high-precision machinery. We want salt water and sand to escape easily from
the leg system.' People will keep treating him like a shop, though, so he
has to keep stocks of expensive aluminium tubes and castings, which he
finances with a Pounds 7,000 bank overdraft.'
Franklin has taken advantage of the recession to design two new products:
cheaper yacht legs, which dispense with two of the three castings in the
standard model; and a frame to support yachts while they are worked-on in a
boatyard.
Since the frame is for use in the dry, it can be manufactured in steel and
he believes there is a world-wide market. A boatyard is keen to take
delivery of his second prototype but he reckons he needs several thousands
pounds to go into full production.
He says: 'It's easy to understand how recession feeds upon itself. We have a
new product of high potential; but, on a reducing order book for our
existing products, I am apprehensive about borrowing more, particularly with
suggestions that interest rates may rise again.'
Franklin displays his yacht legs in the London and Southampton boat shows.
Most sales are direct to sailors but those to the boat trade are increasing.
His terms are cash; no-one gets anything out of the workshop unless the
cheque is in the bank.
He has made some overseas sales but has found them time-consuming and
expensive, with translation and bank charges. 'Freight costs are hard to
estimate before a pair of legs are actually made, and you have to spend up
to one hours with the freight company filling in the documentation.'
Franklin concludes: 'Provided the recession does not become more acute, I am
confident we can survive. Our biggest threat at the moment is premises. It
seems a strange world when small, struggling businesses such as ours are
threatened with eviction to deny us users' rights under EC law. We have
struggled long and hard to produce a viable business.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nationwide Anglia insists (a) that a second year instalment for a Tessa
can only be paid on or after the anniversary of the account opening. I
thought it could be paid after January 1 1992 if the account was opened in
1991 and (b) that the second year instalment can only be Pounds 1,800 less
whatever interest has accrued from the first year. I say it is the full
Pounds 1,800.
The anniversary is the earliest date for the second instalment which can be
the full Pounds 1,800 without interest on first year instalments.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Meeting the cost of care
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OLD woman who is living in a private nursing home is infirm and requires
a lot of attention. Her resources will soon be exhausted. She has a life
interest in a farm and enjoys a small income from it. On her death the farm
passes to her daughter.
When her money is used up will the DSS force the sale of the farm with a
view to increasing the income available to go towards the cost of the
nursing home? Can they touch the capital sum realised.
As the person concerned has only a life interest, and no interest in
capital, the DSS cannot require her to be treated as having such an interest
as would require the capital value of the form to be attributed to her. The
DSS cannot in any even require a sale of assets - it only limits the amount
payable by way of support by assessing the subject to have the value of the
asset, leaving the question of raising funds to the subject (or her family).

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): A matter of fixed interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Inland Revenue notes of guidance for the tax return (1991/92)
paragraph 72 deals with capital gains tax exemptions and in the section on
gilts it also mentions as being exempt 'certain corporate bonds eg
debentures or loan stocks) acquired after 13 March 1984.
Does exemption apply to convertible preference shares or to convertible loan
stocks, with fixed rate of interest? What are the principles governing such
exemptions?
The definition of 'qualifying corporate bond' is complex, and is covered in
clause 117 of the current taxation of Chargeable Gains Bill. The relevant
definitions of 'security' and 'normal commercial loan' can be derived from
clause 132(2) (b) of the Bill and paragraph 1(5) of schedule 18 to the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, respectively.
Convertible preference shares are excluded from the exemption, and so are
convertible loan stocks (except any which are merely convertible into
qualifying corporate bonds or are deep-gain securities).
On balance, the qualifying-corporate-bond legislations probably benefits and
Treasury - more CGT is saved by the disallowance of indexation losses than
is foregone by the exemption of indexed gains.

introduction).

detection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE been asked to allow someone to operate a metal detector on my land. I
am concerned about the rights and liabilities of both the operator and
myself.
Should the operator injure himself could I be made liable for damages?
If anything valuable is unearthed on my land who is the legal owner.
How can I ensure that the land is restored to its original condition.
A written agreement might be desirable but the operator is only pursuing his
hobby and I do not wish to put him to any expense.
Your concerns are justified. It would be wise to have a short written
agreement (informal) signed by both of you in which you are declared to be
not liable in respect of any injury to the operator or his goods arising out
of the state of the land or anything on or in the land, providing for the
operator at his expense to restore the land to its condition as it is before
any operation of his and providing for him to report any finds to you and
covering who is to have the right to anything found; without such agreement
you are the owner of whatever is in your land unless it is treasure trove,
in which case it belongs to the Crown.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: It's go for gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID KAUDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATTERN of post-war years, when inflation eroded conventional
fixed-interest values, could now be changing. At present rates, conventional
gilts offer a positive real yield after inflation. Above all, they offer
security - even the investor of modest means can have certificates issued by
the Bank of England, knowing that it guarantees his income payments and to
repay the face value of his certificate on the due date.
Conventional gilts form the first three groups under the heading 'British
Funds' in the Financial Times' London Share Service pages. All can be bought
through a bank or stockbroker.
If you (or your spouse) are non-taxpayers, you should consider the
restricted range of gilts on offer from the post office; such gilts pay
interest gross. New issues are advertised occasionally and these are the
only stocks on offer direct from the Bank of England.
In the short term, gilt prices tend to fluctuate in the opposite direction
to interest rates. When rates rise, gilt prices fall, and vice-versa. In
long-term planning, concentrate on the maturity and income guarantees rather
than the fluctuations. Plan to make few changes to your portfolio; either
hold the gilts to maturity or replace the stock prior to maturity if
fluctuations have thrown up capital profits.
The chart shows four major options; you can design intermediate ones by
blending different stocks. Since you are dealing with certainty, though,
very few stocks will be needed compared with an equity portfolio. In the
order they appear in the chart, the three usual options are:
Current coupons - bought at about maturity value and enabling you to lock
into interest rates for a chosen time period. At present prices, such bonds
are yielding between 9 and 9 1/2 per cent.
High coupons - taking extra income but at the expense of a capital loss when
held to maturity, since such bonds trade above face value.
Low coupons - exchanging some income into tax-free capital gain.
Provided you respect the guarantees and wait patiently for them, these
options cover many investment needs. If you are fortunate enough to have
sufficient capital to generate more income than you need, then a fourth
option arises:
Surplus income - can be saved and will, therefore, earn extra income in
future. If you can save more than the rate of inflation, then you will
inflation-proof both your capital base and your income.
Conventional gilts are the low-risk home for your capital par excellence.
For longer-time horizons, I also favour US treasury bonds; but the
guarantees are then in dollars and exchange rate movements are, therefore,
an additional risk.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: SIB finds fault with tied agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT consumers have long suspected about insurance sales agents is true, a
new study shows. Those sales agents working exclusively for a single company
are more likely to try to sell you an inappropriate policy than an
independent agent who can offer you the best product from a group of
companies. Research commissioned by the Securities and Investments Board,
the UK's chief regulatory watchdog, examined termination rates of life and
pensions policies of 61 major UK companies for 1990. The study, which was
not given wide circulation by the SIB, found that up to 45 per cent of
policies sold via 'direct' or 'tied' sales agents are terminated within the
first two years of the contract - but only 22 to 32 per cent of policies
sold through independent financial advisers. While the number of early
terminations of policies sold by IFAs is still troublingly high, the data
suggests that sales agents working for one company are even more likely to
encourage consumers to sign up for unsuitable products. Meanwhile, the SIB
appears to be backing down from a proposal which would make it harder for
direct or tied sales agents to pass themselves off as IFAs. The SIB had
considered prohibiting these agents from describing themselves as 'advisers'
or 'consultants.' But in a speech to a life assurance industry group last
week, outgoing SIB chairman Sir David Walker signalled that a ban on that
title is unlikely, although agents may be discouraged from using it on their
business cards or stationery. The SIB has not theorised in public about what
could account for different termination rates among categories of sales
agent. But because the life industry typically offers higher commissions to
exclusive sales agents than to IFAs, consumers must ask themselves whether
tied or direct sales agents are rewarded for pushing products, regardless of
suitability.
Walker has said that high termination rates are a sign of 'unsuitability.'
Because policies are a long-term commitment, often as much as 25 years, they
should not be sold to those who are uncertain that they can keep up premium
payments for that long.
Too often, termination in the first two years of a contract ends in tears
for the consumer. Commission payments to sales agents are 'front ended,'
which means that the life company devotes the initial months - if not years
 -of premium payments to paying off the sales agent and reimbursing itself
for the costs of establishing a new policy. Consumers can lose up to 100
percent of their initial premium payments, and earn very little return on
the portion that has been invested.
The SIB's data - which showed that, overall, a quarter to a third of
policies are cancelled within two years - adds fuel to the debate over what
sales agents should be required to tell prospective customers about their
products and about themselves.
The SIB is considering new disclosure rules that would require sales agents
to spell out for prospective customers how much they would get back if they
cancelled early. It is also considering the best way to tell consumers how
much of their investment return will be eaten up by the cost of operating
the policy.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A plethora of PEPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE MIGHT think there was an election on. With personal equity plans
(PEPs) thought widely to be under threat of abolition by a Labour
government, a blitz of marketing for the products is under way. Many
managers are producing attractive offers and discounts to entice customers
before the end of the tax year.
Do not, however, allow the political hype to force you into buying a PEP if
it is inappropriate for you. If you cannot afford the long-term commitment
(and you should think of a PEP as being at least a five-year investment), or
would need to dig into other savings to fund it, do not go ahead.
But if a PEP is right for you, and you have not bought one already in this
tax year, it would be foolish not to take advantage of the deals on offer.
PEPs are unlikely to be this cheap immediately after the election, whichever
party wins.
Schroders is re-launching its unit trust PEP to aim for income. A full PEP
of Pounds 6,000 will include Pounds 3,000 invested in the Schroder income
unit trust, with the rest put into a managed portfolio of about 10
income-producing equities. A Pounds 50 monthly savings plan is also
available.
The annual management fee is 1 per cent, and a discount of 1 per cent of the
normal front-end fee of 5.25 per cent, plus VAT, is available from February
3 until April 5.
Bank of Scotland's Self-Select PEP has been re-launched, and the bank says
it is the cheapest self-select PEP available. There is now no initial charge
for opening a plan (there used to be a flat-rate Pounds 30 fee), and the
annual management fee is 1 per cent of the value of the portfolio.
Dealing charges are higher: 1.5 per cent for transactions up to Pounds
5,000, 1 per cent for trades between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 12,500, and 0.5
per cent for deals bigger than this. But there is no need to deal if you do
not want to.
The Fidelity Double PEP offers a discount of 1 per cent on the front-end
charge and will, until March 25, accept orders both for this tax year and
for 1992-93.
You can buy both the standard Pounds 6,000 PEP (Fidelity has a range of
four) and a single-company PEP for both years, meaning that Fidelity can
accept lump sums of up to Pounds 18,000 now.
Money invested now for next year's PEP will be put into Fidelity's cash unit
trust, which is earning interest of 10.31 per cent gross. The charges,
including the discount, are 4.25 per cent initially and 3 per cent for the
single-company PEP.
If you are interested in Europe, then the Scottish Widows European PEP could
be attractive. Its European unit trust will receive Pounds 3,000, and the
rest will be invested in 'a carefully-selected portfolio of four or five
companies quoted on a recognised EC stock exchange, other than that of the
UK.' This takes advantage of relaxations in the PEP rules made in the last
Budget.
The discount, of 1 per cent of the front-end charge, is available only until
February 14. Investment must be in lump sums of either Pounds 3,000 or
Pounds 6,000.
The charging structure is complex: excluding the discount, you must pay 6
per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually for the unit trust, and 5.5 per
cent plus VAT initially, and 1.5 per cent plus VAT annually, for the share
portfolio. Stamp duty is also payable.
The same change in the rules lifts the amount that can be invested in the
Edinburgh Investment Trust to Pounds 3,000. The trust, the UK's
second-largest, forms part of the Dunedin Investment Trusts PEP.
The set-up charge is Pounds 24, with annual charges of 0.5 per cent. VAT
must be added to both. People wanting to invest up to the full Pounds 6,000
limit can buy a 'top-up' portfolio of eight to 10 UK shares.
Last, but certainly not least, Scottish Investment Trust is also taking
advantage of the new rules to launch a PEP for the first time.
If you opt for a PEP with just Pounds 3,000 in the investment trust, you pay
only stamp duty. There is no dealing or set-up charge. But there is an
initial fee of Pounds 24, with an annual charge of Pounds 30 plus VAT on a
top-up portion of six FT-SE 100 shares which can be used to bring the PEP up
to the Pounds 6,000 limit.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK, we commented on the volume of selling by directors, and the trend
has continued. Much of this activity has been directors exercising and
selling options.
At Farnell Electronics, which makes and distributes electronics and
electrical equipment and accessories, E. Hall is the second director to sell
stock in the past month. His disposal of 150,000 shares at 240.5p reduces
his total holding by more than two-thirds.
AJ Thomas, the chairman of another electronics company, Diploma, sold 20,000
shares at 263.5p. This follows an announcement accompanying the final
results that trading conditions were the worst for more than 20 years.
Despite the sale, Thomas retains in excess of 1m shares in the company.
Not every electronics company is having similar problems. Director
confidence has been steady and constant at Astec (BSR) over the past three
months. BH Christopher, the chairman and chief executive, bought 100,000
shares at 12.5p, which brings to 750,000 the number acquired by him and two
other directors since last October.
Buying has also been steady at Smith New Court. Two directors, M. Dritz and
PD Roy, bought a total of 70,000 shares last week at prices from 85p to 90p.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The trouble with endowments is . . . -
How to . . . find the right life cover (Part II)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING life cover when you take out a mortgage does not sound all that
controversial. But the question of how best this can be done is at the
centre of the most divisive issue within the UK's financial services
industry today.
Most people, purchase a house as a couple, or with the intention of sharing
the house with someone at some time. This means you need life cover to
protect your partner against liability for the outstanding mortgage should
you die unexpectedly. But you need also to think about how to repay the loan
at the end of its term - usually 25 years.
Over the past decade, the financial services industry has trumpeted the
endowment policy, rather than the old steady repayment method, as the best
way of paying off a mortgage. Around 80 per cent of the UK's mortgages are
backed by endowments, which offer life cover while acting as a savings
mechanism which guarantees a pay-out after 25 years.
But the repossessions crisis has revealed the flaw in the endowment - its
inflexibility. Full pay-outs are made only if you hold on to the endowment
until maturity. While they are often an excellent investment if held this
long, it is impossible to recommend them if there is a serious chance of
surrendering them early.
The heavy costs involved in managing the investment and the life cover, and
the commissions paid to salesmen, mean that in the early years of a policy
you receive less than you have paid in premiums by surrendering early. This
spells disaster if your financial circumstances change for the worse a few
years after taking out the loan. The endowment makes it harder to
disentangle yourself from the mortgage.
Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, puts it this way: 'If I meet another young
person who's lost their job and has poor employment prospects, saddled with
an endowment mortgage, I'll scream.'
He points out that lenders usually would be happy to change a capital
repayment mortgage into an 'interest only', but that is not an option with
an endowment mortgage. Heavy surrender penalties make it impossible to get
rid of the endowment without a loss.
Sadly, most people who take out endowments will suffer these penalties.
Research by the Securities and Investments Board showed that in 1990 37.1
per cent of unit-linked life policies, and 23 per cent of with-profits
policies, were terminated within two years of being started.
Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, points out that this casts doubt over
the worth of tables showing the value of endowments at maturity. He suggests
that as insurance companies make these pay-outs to so few people, it is
scarcely surprising that final pay-outs are strong. Smith notes that
endowments are no longer tax-efficient. At one time, life funds had a
favourable tax position and, until 1984, you received tax relief on life
assurance premiums. Now, endowments are less tax-efficient than the new
investment vehicles created by legislation over the past decade - PEPs,
personal pensions and TESSAs.
Endowments are an expensive way to buy life cover. As last week's article
showed, Pounds 50,000 cover for 25 years costs Pounds 18 via term, and
Pounds 62.50 via an endowment, from Pearl. That leaves you plenty of room
for imaginative saving.
The fact that 80 per cent of mortgages are now backed by an endowment might,
therefore, be more to do with the commissions they pay to salesmen than
their suitability.
These problems suggest that you should forsake the convenience of the
endowment mortgage. If you already have one, you should still get a good
deal - but only if you keep it until maturity.
As the table (taken from Money Management magazine) shows, final pay-outs
last year were healthy. Some offices, including Norwich Union, cut pay-outs
this year but others, such as Commercial Union - which has the best pay-out
announced so far with Pounds 65,596 - increased them. So most endowments
offer similar value this year to last. Full details will not be available
until the season of bonus announcements is over.
The table of unit trust savings schemes shows, however, that an investment
which would not penalise you for stopping early might have done better.
Assumptions - Pounds 30 monthly premiums over 25 years - are held constant
to allow comparisons.
Some caveats are needed. Savings schemes were not available in 1967.
Although the figures are 'offer-to-bid,' and include the dealing spread,
they do not include extra charges managers might add for investing via a
savings scheme. Unit trusts do not include life cover, but term cover in
1967 would not have been dear.
On the plus side, the unit trust figures take no account of PEP tax reliefs
which are now available. They assume that all income was reinvested net. Had
it been reinvested gross, returns would have been boosted considerably.
The unit trust table still tells a powerful story. It shows that you can
have flexibility, and beat endowments, even over 25 years. The average unit
trust savings scheme, according to Planned Savings, would have made Pounds
67,039.50, more than last year's best endowment
However, risk is greater: the worst-performing unit trust, Brown Shipley
Recovery, would have provided only Pounds 14,872.30. Last year's average
endowment pay-out was Pounds 53,646.
Personal pensions offer a tax-efficient way of covering your life and paying
off the mortgage at the same time. You receive tax relief on premiums and
you also receive full tax relief on term life cover up to 5 per cent of 'net
relevant earnings.' The mortgage can be repaid out of the pension lump sum
on retirement.
Pension income will not be affected, but pension mortgages do have the
disadvantage that they commit you to using a fixed portion of your pension
lump sum when you retire.
Term cover should give you adequate protection. Richard Boyton, of Boyton
Financial Services, suggests that cover should be taken out on a joint-life
basis until both partners have reached the age of 60.
He suggests avoiding the 25-year term because 'your house-buying career does
not necessarily last for 25 years.' Taking out cheap term early in your
career relieves you of any awkward decisions later on.
When you buy your house, shop around for the cheapest term assurance and
then take out a long-term savings scheme which allows you to make an escape
if you need to. If your 'adviser' keeps trying to sell you an endowment,
change your adviser.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES hunts for bargains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK saw a further flurry of Business Expansion Scheme issues, and the
1992 BES season is now in full swing.
The rules of the scheme are explained on page 36 of the FT's Quarterly
Review of Personal Finance.
BES companies have now fallen into the pattern established last year and
come in two categories: 'Predators' which go bargain-hunting and attempt to
profit as much as possible from the housing recession, and 'Buy-backs' which
limit risk by obtaining a covenant from a housing association, or
university, to buy accommodation from them for a fixed price.
Disappointingly few schemes have managed to obtain the third party guarantor
which would assuage many doubts about the schemes. Johnson Fry's scheme
launched last week (which is backed by a certificate of deposit), offers the
equivalent of 14.81 per cent annually to a higher rate taxpayer.
This week's new buy-back offer is House the Homeless of London (Westminster)
which has a buy-back agreement from the Peabody Trust. It will buy housing
for the homeless in Westminster, with a covenant to pay Pounds 1.35 in five
years' time for every Pounds 1 raised now. It thus offers the equivalent of
16.5 per cent annually to top rate taxpayers. Further buy-back schemes are
expected.
Schemes with no upper limit on growth include:
Artesian Performer is the fifth issue from the Artesian Group, and will
continue buying property in London and the South East, refurbishing it and
aiming for value.
Midland Predator Assured Tenancies seems to be a hybrid scheme. It will aim
to buy property at cheap prices in the East Midlands and East Anglia region,
and then rent it to students of Northampton College.
Pathfinder Repossessions, which is sponsored by Johnson Fry, will aim to buy
cheap properties in the London area which have been repossessed by building
societies after the owners have defaulted on mortgages. It is similar to
Close Brothers' London Repossessions fund and Neill Clerk's Auction Raider,
both launched last week.
Stephen Bantoft, BES analyst with the Allenbridge Group, said the schemes
are getting more similar, as all sponsors try either to buy very cheap
accommodation, or to provide copper-bottomed guarantees. He says your choice
should be based on your opinion of the managers, and on your reading of the
housing market.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Quicker tax refunds agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 8m people will be able to receive repayment of tax on bank and
building society interest and on share dividends more quickly under new
measures announced by the Inland Revenue this week.
Non-taxpayers and those eligible for partial tax relief against bank and
building society interest income can now claim repayments worth more than
Pounds 50 immediately rather than having to wait until the end of the tax
year.
Those eligible for tax relief against income from share dividends -
including an estimated 2.5m married women who are independently registered
for tax - can also claim back payments on dividends without waiting until
after April 5 1992.
About 15m non-taxpayers have been entitled to register with their banks and
building societies to receive interest gross since composite rate tax was
abolished last April.
However, a large number of those who are eligible have not done so. Only
12.5m accounts, representing an even smaller number of people, have actually
registered for this facility.
The remainder can now apply for repayment directly under the new
arrangements. But the Revenue stresses that it would be simpler for those
who pay no tax to apply directly to their bank or building society to pay
interest gross.
The Revenue has now opened 24 repayment centres ahead of schedule, and will
be able to process any claims for relief above Pounds 50 immediately. Those
with reimbursements below this level must wait for the end of the tax year.
Inland Revenue leaflet IR 112 'How to claim a repayment of income tax'
explains the procedure for repayment of tax on share dividends; and leaflet
IR 111 'How to claim a repayment of tax on bank and building society
interest' explain the procedures required for repayment.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: CGT and assets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE above shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in
December. Multiply the original cost of the assets by the figure shown for
the month in which you sold them. If you subtract the result from the
proceeds of your sale, the difference will be your capital gain for tax
purposes.
Suppose, that you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in July 1985 and sold them
in December 1991 for Pounds 12,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
July 1985 figure of 1.425 gives a total of Pounds 7,125.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 12,000 gives a gain for tax
purposes of Pounds 4,875 - below the annual Pounds 5,500 CGT allowance. If
you realised no other gains during the year, the profit should be tax-free.
If you are selling shares bought before April 6, 1982, use the March 1982
figure.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Work while you travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE HAWTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOUR desire for travel is in inverse proportion to your ability to pay,
the answer might be a working holiday, either abroad or in Britain.
For volunteers aged 18 and over, the International Voluntary Service
Organisation offers two- to four-week holiday projects in Britain and Europe
(including eastern Europe), the US and (to a limited extent) Australia. You
pay your own fare to your destination and food and basic accommodation are
provided, along with health insurance. But you get no salary and there will
not be too much time for beachcombing.
Perhaps the chance to see new faces and places is not enough and you would
like to learn a new activity, but without cost. In this case, vacation
training courses are your best bet.
Working in a training environment helps you decide if a particular career
choice is right for you, or to acquire skills in a job you enjoy. Now that
income support and housing benefit during vacations is no longer available,
such courses can support students without yet another request for a bank
loan.
Pay is around Pounds 145 per week, from which National Insurance will be
deducted - but not tax if you apply for the relevant exemption. Courses last
from five weeks to whatever time is agreed at the interview, but
accommodation rarely is offered. Formal qualifications are not always
specified.
The 7,000 training opportunities available cover all types of manufacturing
and service industries. They include the civil service, British Council
(eight weeks at Pounds 195 per week), local government sponsorships (Pounds
100-Pounds 130 per week) and the Meteorological Office (A-levels for lab
work; eight-12 weeks at Pounds 122.85 per week).
Police and army traineeships are useful for those able to spare only a short
period. Places are available on a two-week course in computer application,
with accommodation and pocket money; or on a six-week workshop practical
course in various engineering modules which contributes to the requirements
for a chartered engineer.
Students get free board and lodging in the officers' mess at the Royal Navy
Engineering College and a weekly allowance of Pounds 25. Application forms
are available at college career offices.
Computers and electronic industries, hit by the recession, offer placements
mainly to undergraduates, but other branches of engineering still have
training opportunities: The Culham Laboratory in Oxford takes post A-level
students for two summer months at Pounds 424-Pounds 525 a month, depending
on age and year of study. The cost of any accommodation required is deducted
from pay.
The Law Society in England (071-242-1222) and Scotland (031-226-7411) offers
general advice on short-term traineeships.
In insurance and banking, vacation work is not always through formal
traineeships. Towers Perrin has seven undergraduates for eight or more
summer weeks, assigns them to actuarial departments and offers 'a
competitive rate of pay.' Scottish Provident takes a few students. Apply in
January or February, but not later than March.
As traineeships abroad are fewer - and, even with leading organisations,
often unpaid - it is better for the indigent traveller to look at other
methods of achieving a paid vacation.
A book called Summer Jobs Abroad (published by Vacation Work, Oxford, for
Pounds 6.95) lists more than 30,000 vacancies in 40 countries at varying
wages. For most, applications should be made between January and March.
Working Holidays Abroad (Pounds 7.95), from the Central Bureau for
Educational Visits and Exchanges (CBEVE), is in its 40th year. It
concentrates on voluntary 'green' opportunities but also lists paid work
opportunities for all ages lasting two weeks to 12 months. The bureau also
provides free information sheets.
Do not be deterred from applying for jobs or projects if you are
handicapped. Tom Sewell, of the CBEVE, says job opportunities and voluntary
projects exist in other areas for those with restricted ability, and are
indicated by B (Blind), D (impaired hearing) or PH (physically handicapped).

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The hidden costs of a mortgage -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu urges borrowers to look closely at the insurance
policies tied to a home loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW interest rates on a home loan may look attractive but beware the hidden
costs. Borrowers often will find they have a host of insurance policies
thrust at them. Some customers have little choice. Many lenders offer a
discount on their mortgages, but only on condition that you take out their
buildings or home contents policy. These include Halifax, Abbey National,
Nationwide, Britannia and National &amp; Provincial. Borrowers should, however,
be aware that even though they get a good deal with the discounted mortgage,
the lender claws back a proportion of it by charging more for the insurance
policies.
Even those who have a choice may be tempted, for simplicity's sake, to cave
in and opt to hold these policies with their lender. But how do you tell
whether you are getting a good deal?
All policies should cover you for loss or damage caused by theft, vandalism,
fire, natural disasters and subsidence. In most cases, your policy will not
cover your possessions if the home has been left empty for more than 30
days. But no two policies are exactly the same, which adds to the headache
of the home purchaser when it comes to deciding which policy is the 'best.'
In its latest survey of contents policies, Which?, the Consumer's
Association magazine, rated Countrywide as its best-buy insurance policy for
the home. So, we asked it for a quotation for a 30-year-old male non-smoker
 -a first-time buyer - who had purchased a three-bedroomed house for Pounds
70,000 in Countrywide's highest-risk area. Countrywide said the combined
rate for buildings and contents insurance would be Pounds 206 a year.
Apart from Countrywide, Lloyds Bank also provides a competitively-priced
combined buildings and contents package known as Mortgage Value Cover. This
would cost Pounds 228.96 a year with a first-time buyer's discount of 20 per
cent included. Contents cover of up to Pounds 30,000 is provided by the
policy.
Using this information, we can make a rough assessment of the offers
available from those lenders who insist that you take out an insurance
policy with them.
A first-time buyer visiting the Halifax for a repayment mortgage would get
1.5 percentage points knocked off the variable rate. Our 30-year-old male is
taking a 95 per cent mortgage on a Pounds 70,000 home, so will benefit from
an additional reduction in the rate of 0.45 per cent. If we assume interest
rates stay at present levels, he will be paying 9 per cent while the
discount lasts (until July 31, 1993). Compared with the present variable
rate of 10.95 per cent, that is an annualised saving of Pounds 951.24. Our
male must, however, take out a Halifax Xtracover combined buildings and
contents policy to enjoy this discount. This will cost him Pounds 434.04 a
year for his high-risk area - Pounds 228.04 more than the amount quoted by
Countrywide. Put another way, the borrower's saving is effectively Pounds
723.20 rather than Pounds 951.24. More than a fifth of his mortgage discount
has disappeared.
First-time borrowers from Abbey National also enjoy a 1.5 percent discount,
bringing the present variable rate down to 9.05 per cent. Instead of paying
Pounds 6,846.84 on a repayment mortgage for the first year, our man would
pay Pounds 6,118.80, a saving of Pounds 728.04 a year on a loan of Pounds
66,500 (95 per cent of the cost of the Pounds 70,000 house).
Once again, the borrower must, to receive this discount take out Abbey's
buildings and contents insurance policy. Not only does this cost Pounds
383.52 a year in a high-risk area, it does not cover 'personal possessions'
including clothes and jewellery. (Borrowers do not have to take out cover
for personal possessions as part of the first-time buyer's deal at Abbey,
but these are included in Halifax, Nationwide and Countrywide's policies.)
Cover for these will cost our male another Pounds 90.96 a year, bringing the
Abbey total up to Pounds 474.48, which is Pounds 268.48 more expensive than
Countrywide's policy. The effective saving on his mortgage from Abbey has
been reduced by more than a third to Pounds 459.56.
First-time buyers might be better off at Nationwide, where they do not have
to take out the society's buildings and contents policy. Nationwide does,
however, offer a package where a discount on larger loans depends on a new
borrower taking out a buildings and contents policy. The mortgage rate is
10.55 per cent on a loan of over Pounds 60,000 instead of the society's
present variable rate of 10.99 per cent, which means a saving of Pounds
218.40 a year on the mortgage. But our male would have to pay Pounds 411.48
for the society's buildings and contents policy. Considering that you could
have secured this insurance for Pounds 206 at Countrywide, that is an extra
cost of Pounds 205.48, which means the saving effectively is reduced to
Pounds 12.92 a year.
In none of these cases are you given any choice in the sort of buildings and
contents policy you take out.
First-time buyers may be better off in the first year through these
packages. But if they do not want to see such savings drain away in higher
premiums in the second or third year of the loan, they will then need to
cancel the expensive policies and opt for one of the cheaper deals on the
market.
A spokesman for one of the societies could not have summed it up better.
'The customer is getting such a good deal with the mortgage discount that we
have to make them take out the policy,' he said.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Rescue details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE Building Society has announced the details of its 'mortgage
rescue' plan, which is designed to keep its beleaguered mortgage-holders
with roofs over their heads.
The Home Rescue Scheme involves the society in lending Pounds 8m to three
housing associations - London &amp; Quadrant, Newlon, and Notting Hill Housing
Trust.
The housing associations will then take over the ownership of houses
belonging to around 100 borrowers in the London area. The borrowers will
then effectively become housing association tenants, and pay rent.
Borrowers can then have their arrears wiped out, if they stay with the
scheme for at least three years. Rents will be lower than mortgage
repayments, and will be set at between 3.5 per cent and 8 per cent of the
value of the house.
Nationwide is also launching from Monday a free mortgage protection policy
which provides one year's cover of mortgage repayments against unemployment,
sickness or accident. You have to buy your home through Nationwide Estate
Agents to qualify.
Citibank is offering free unemployment insurance for two years. BES schemes
currently being used to fund mortgage rescues involve The Mortgage
Corporation and the Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Blow to savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of savers with the Nationwide Building Society, who found that it
closed their accounts to new investors and then put a similar new account on
the market with a better rate of interest, have little cause to rejoice at a
ruling this week by the Building Societies Ombudsman, Stephen Edell.
He asked Nationwide to pay compensation to an instant-access BonusBuilder
account-saver who discovered that CashBuilder, another instant-access
account, offered a better rate.
But he ruled against similar complaints by Capital Bonus 90-day
account-holders who found they were locked out of a better deal from a new
account called CapitalBuilder.
In the first case, the ombudsman decided that the society had not given
adequate publicity to its rates but, in the second, he ruled that the
publicity was sufficient. He felt that people who opened 90-day accounts
consented to be locked into them for that time.
Edell said: 'Investors should be vigilant about their investments, but I
don't think that building societies ought to hide the interest rates paid on
closed accounts.'
Yet, the fact is that closed accounts are not some kind of unfortunate
administrative accident. Building societies and banks use them to ensure
that depositors earn less interest than they would otherwise do.
Banks call the practice 'the recycling strategy' while it is known to
societies as 'harvesting.' The aim is to keep the cost of bank and building
society funds cheaper than they would otherwise be.
It seems slightly ridiculous that savers should be expected to scan
newspaper columns and notice boards in their branches to see if their
building society is playing hide-and-seek with them over interest rates.
That said, many savers are not as energetic in looking after their own
interests as they ought to be.
When Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester wrote to its customers with savings balances
under Pounds 100 in October 1990, telling them they would no longer earn
interest, it was surprised to find that many did not bother to take any
action.
The Nationwide case was a particularly outrageous instance of a savings
institution not standing by its customers, and it is disappointing that
there is not a hint in the ombudsman's ruling that he sees things this way.
After all, for office was set up to protect the interests of consumers.
The market seems to be moving ahead of the ombudsman, though. Since
November, the National &amp; Provincial building society has been telling its
customers what it thinks to be the best account for each of them. It has a
free advice line on 0800-446 600.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: National Savings puts rivals in the
shade - Five-year investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP COGGAN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW HAVE your investments performed over the past five years? Did you opt
for safety or plunge headlong into exotic equities in the hope of gain? The
table gives a quick guide to the returns that were available, and a
yardstick against which you can measure the performance of your own
portfolio. It shows how unfancied investments, such as boring old National
Savings, have done better than most of the alternatives over the period. Had
you sought advice in January 1987, the chances are that few experts would
have recommended National Savings. For a start, equities were in the last
year of a bull market and the exciting returns achieved during the early
1980s were luring many a private investor at the peak. Just as important was
the fact that National Savings does not pay commission, so there was every
incentive for advisers to recommend other, more lucrative (for them, at
least) products. It is also true that, in the field of investment, even
experts with years of experience can get it disastrously wrong. Few
predicted the crash of October 1987 or the revival of inflation in 1988 and
1989. Fixed-interest investments were a better option than most equities
over the past five years. Both a guaranteed income bond and fixed-rate
National Savings beat most of the equity investments, and also the return
from Pounds 10,000 invested with a major building society (Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester's Gold account was used for the example). Those personal pension
funds investing in fixed-interest securities also did well. Of course, you
could have beaten fixed-interest returns by picking one of the
best-performing unit or investment trusts. But, unless you were extremely
lucky (or shrewd), the chances are that your return would have been nearer
to the average trust performance - which lagged behind not only National
Savings but also the building societies.
Only 40 individual unit trusts out of 793 with a five-year record pipped
index-linked National Savings over a five-year period. Your chances of
picking one of those outperforming trusts were almost 19 to one.
Investment trusts do rather better than unit trusts in the table, which
explains part of their popularity with investors. But a good deal of this
return has been due to the narrowing of discounts in the sector - in other
words, share prices have risen faster than the underlying assets in the
fund.
This narrowing of discounts cannot be repeated on the same scale over the
next five years and, indeed, there is always the chance that discounts could
widen. Nevertheless, it is depressing for those who invested in a unit trust
to discover that they did not beat inflation. (Not that those who picked a
managed single-premium investment bond did much better).
The history of the past five years shows how dangerous it is for investors
to follow the dictates of fashion. In 1986, a record Pounds 5.2bn was
invested in unit trusts, and total funds under management reached Pounds
32bn. Far too many investors probably bailed out right after the 'crash' of
October 1987 - the classic case of buying at the top and selling at the
bottom.
Much publicity in the unit trust industry is given to those managers with
the best-performing funds of the year - and those who sell trusts often
focus on short-term performance.
How would you have fared by backing the top-performing trust of 1986? Legal
&amp; General Far Eastern was the star, turning Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 2,122
over the year. But had you invested at the start of 1987, your Pounds 1,000
would have dwindled to Pounds 939.
The five-year audit shows just how pointless it is to look at one-year
figures when choosing a unit trust. You should normally be prepared to hold
on to these trusts for at least three to five years and, as we have seen,
you might need to do so for longer before it becomes worthwhile.
Of course, this table, as the advertisements say, is no guide to the future.
Equities have outperformed fixed-interest and cash deposits over most
five-year periods. The fact that private investors are so wary of equities
at the moment could mean that this is just the time to be buying shares. But
the nervous will find that National Savings should allow them to sleep
profitably at night.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURPRISE mortgage interest rate cuts by Abbey National, Halifax and
Nationwide were followed by the other main societies this week. Only
NatWest, among the clearing banks and centralised lenders, has yet followed
them. But there is a fierce battle for first-time buyers and, borrowers
should shop around.
Newbury Building Society, for example, is offering a discounted mortgage for
first-time buyers at 8.74 per cent. New borrowers who are not first-time
buyers will also get a one percentage point discount for the first year on
loans above Pounds 60,000. But remember to check how long the discounts last
for. There could be little point in having a heavily-discounted rate for the
first year only.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester lowered its standard mortgage interest rate by 0.2
percentage points more than the other societies, giving it a new variable
mortgage rate of 10.75 per cent for most customers and 9.75 per cent for new
borrowers after a one-year discount of one percentage point.
The cuts are good news for borrowers, but societies are preparing to pare
back their rates to savers.
'Frankly, savers have been having much too good a deal from building
societies recently if you consider that their investments have a high real
return and are virtually risk-free,' one society said privately this week.
Meanwhile, if you are a Midland Bank mortgage customer, you might recently
have had a letter from the bank asking what your attitude would be to the
possible 'securitisation' of your loan.
Mortgage securitisation is common in the United States but less so in the
UK. A lender collects a group of good mortgages, puts them together into a
bond, and sells it on the commercial money markets to a third party.
The advantage to the lender is that he gets this particular amount of
lending off his books, thereby strengthening his capital ratios and enabling
him to go out and look for new business.
All mortgage-lenders say that securitisation should not disturb the
customer. The mortgage continues to be administered by the original lender,
and payment and customer correspondence should continue as before. The
interest rate is set by the original lender, not the owner of the
securitised bond.
So, most of the time there is no snag. But if you fall into arrears on your
monthly payments and your mortgage is securitised, this could create
problems and your lender might have less leeway to be understanding.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ceiling on pensionable salary for the fiscal year beginning April 1992
will be raised to Pounds 75,000 from Pounds 71,400, according to
calculations by Scottish Provident. Calculations on earnings-related
pensions are not allowed to take into account pay above this ceiling.
Employee contributions towards pensions may not be calculated on earnings
above that amount. The ceiling is adjusted annually in line with rises in
the previous year's retail price index.
Scottish Provident also announced that it had maintained bonuses on its
endowment policies. Pay-outs on policies started by a 29-year old man paying
Pounds 30 per month dropped 4.4 per cent for ten-year policies, to Pounds
7,129, but rose 1.4 per cent to Pounds 57,369 for 25-year endowments.

contributor to the Weekend FT, it explains the uses of off-shore investment
in which funds which accumulate, rather than distribute, their income.
The company has also launched two new high yield roll-up bond funds, the
European and the US dollar, and a discount of 1 per cent is available on
them before Febrary 28.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Touche Remnant special offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Touche Remnant is making a special offer on purchases of shares in the
Bankers investment trust from February 1 until April 17. During this period
shares bought through the direct dealing service of TR's savings scheme will
be free from the normal 1 per cent transaction charge.
Bankers, despite its name, is a general international trust - at the end of
last year, 50.7 per cent of the fund was invested in the UK, 24.4 per cent
in North America, and 16.1 per cent in Europe. According to the Association
of Investment Trust Companies, it grew 92.7 per cent over the 5 years to the
end of 1991, and 771.1 per cent over 10 years.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Hong Kong progresses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong stock market has made phenomenal progress recently. But much
of that is because it started from such a low position. As the graph shows,
the market was depressed following the Black Monday crash of 1987, and
received further damage after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.
Now political and economic factors are conspiring to force the market back
up. Real interest rates are negative, and real GDP growth in the colony is
expected to top 5 per cent this year. Predictions for corporate earnings
growth might mean that the market is still undervalued. The market was up
more than 3 per cent for the week, in spite of a fall on Friday after nine
positive sessions in a row.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: Tiny Rowland sends his regrets . . . - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S announcement of its 1991 results, released after the market closed
on Thursday, is a striking document. The stock market was certainly struck
by it - as soon as the shares opened on Friday they started falling, and
closed the day at 120p, a 30p drop on the week.
The stock market's concerns centred on the announcement's contents: a cut in
the final dividend, a withheld first interim dividend, and a 24 per cent
drop in pre-tax profits. However, the style of the press release is almost
as remarkable as its contents.
The opening page consists of a string of bullet points, in the best American
manner. The first of these is the unadorned assertion: 'The balance sheet is
strong.' There is a useful rule of thumb for interpreting a company results
announcement: if it begins with the balance sheet, there's bad news in the
profit and loss statement. And so it proved in this case, for the third
bullet point was the profits confession: 'Profits are reduced in a difficult
year from Pounds 273m to Pounds 207m.'
But let's just go back to the first bullet point: 'The balance sheet is
strong.' A further bullet point elucidates this: 'Gearing 70 per cent, net
borrowings virtually unchanged since March 31 1991, with an improvement
firmly in view.'
There are several interesting features about this sentence. The first is
that gearing is actually 73 per cent - not a big difference, it's true, but
one that's worth getting correct. The second is that 73 per cent gearing is
not, on the face of it, a hallmark of a particularly strong balance sheet.
A third aspect is that behind the statement 'net borrowings virtually
unchanged since March 31 1991' lies an interesting point. Current bank loans
and overdrafts have risen by Pounds 109m in the period, to Pounds 490m. This
has been almost entirely offset by a drop in creditors, current tax and
dividends, to leave net debt at Pounds 2,091m, compared with Pounds 2,105 a
year before.
So net debt is indeed unchanged; but short-term bank borrowing has risen by
29 per cent. It is perhaps just as well that an improvement is 'firmly in
view'.
There are two other striking facts about the announcement. One is the
influence, beyond the grave, of Robert Maxwell. After what has been revealed
of his pension fund manoeuvres, Lonrho went to the trouble of devoting a
bullet point to the fact that its UK pension funds are managed by
independent professional fund managers, and that only Pounds 0.8m of the
Pounds 300m total is invested in Lonrho shares or Lonrho-related companies.
The second is the concluding bullet point: 'The board and management regret
having to present a disappointing year's results and have every confidence
in the ability of the company to move forward again.' On Thursday this
comment reduced hardened Lonrho watchers to awed silence. As one put it: 'In
all the years I have followed Lonrho, I have never seen the company regret
anything.'
* Lonrho was one of the two main influences on the week. The other was
political, as what could well be a ten-week countdown to an election began
on Wednesday, when the government chose March 10 as Budget day. That left
April 9 as the current favourite for the election, and ensured that UK
equities will be bounced up and down in line with the latest opinion polls.
For the early part of the week, the afterglow of the Conservative assault on
Labour tax policies still lingered. As late as mid-afternoon on Thursday,
the FT-SE index was trading a point or so up on the previous week's close of
2536.7.
From then on, things looked bleaker: Wall Street fell, and Friday's trading
was overshadowed by the Lonrho news. Other shares with potentially
vulnerable dividends suffered worst, and FT-SE closed at 2,510.4, down 26.3
on the week.
The economic background was unexciting: a lacklustre CBI survey of retailing
prospects, and weak figures on demand for loans from the Bank of England.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, already one of the more pessimistic City teams of
economists, produced a revised forecast: no growth this year, with non-oil
gdp shrinking at a rate of - 1/2 per cent. They had previously forecast this
figure at + 3/4 per cent.
The UBS team drew political consequences from this economic gloom: a hung
parliament, with no clear Labour or Conservative majority. Stocks to buy,
under this assumption, would be overseas earners (less vulnerable to
domestic developments) such as BTR or RTZ; and manufacturers which would
benefit from Labour policy, such as GKN or British Steel.
Stocks the UBS team reckons would be adversely affected by a Labour
government include banks, builders, stores and property (all hurt by
potentially higher interest rates); companies that employ lots of low-paid
workers (hurt by a minimum wage); and some of the privatised utilities.
Politics aside, the market as a whole is likely to take comfort from the
chart, above, which shows the relationship between the yield on the
FT-Actuaries All-Share index and the yield on long-term government bonds.
The lower the bond yield is in relation to the yield on equities, the better
value shares appear.
Typically, a ratio of around two is regarded as fair value; and though the
ratio has bounced off the bottom in recent weeks as the market has recovered
from its pre-Christmas slide, it is still in safe territory. Of course, the
calculation depends on the belief that dividends are going to stay at
current levels. Which brings us back to Tiny Rowland: the market is just
going to have to hope that in its dividend cut, as in so many other spects
of the way it does business, Lonrho is a law unto itself.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Markets: Chasing values round the economic cycle - Serious
money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKETS are as prone to changes in fashion as clothing companies. In
the last few years, as high interest rates and then recession have hit the
economy, the fashionable stocks have been the so-called 'growth' companies.
These are businesses in sectors which have long-term growth prospects that
are relatively untouched by recession. A prime example has been the
healthcare and pharmaceuticals stocks. People still get ill during
recessions and the cost of caring for the greying Western populations
continues to rise.
Glaxo and Wellcome were two of the best performing stocks of last year and
trade on price-earnings ratios of over 28 and 37 respectively. The height of
the growth stock fashion was in the early 1970s, when the 'nifty fifty'
stocks in the US were bid up to stratospheric ratings.
Such companies would never be acquired by adherents of a rival investment
philosophy - the 'value investors'. These look for stocks with low
price-earnings ratios and high yields, on the grounds that they are
undervalued by the market.
In general, these stocks tend to be in the so-called cyclical industries,
whose profits are very vulnerable to recession.
The problem for value investors over the last few years has been that the
success of the strategy depends on risks being overestimated by the market.
In fact, all too often the risks have been underestimated.
In part, this is a reaction to the euphoric early 1980s, when UK companies
did so well for so long. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, interest rates
have been higher, for longer, than experts anticipated and analysts have
been repeatedly forced to cut their forecasts for economic growth and
corporate profits. Many cyclical stocks have been forced to cut or even
eliminate their dividends.
Fund management groups which have followed the value-based stock-picking
philosophy, such as M&amp;G and Fidelity, have seen a dent in their long term
performance records over the last three years or so.
Now with gloom all around, it may be that the conditions for value investing
have returned once more. Certainly, Paul Woolley of US fund management group
GMO Woolley argued as much in these pages last November. Should UK private
investors be jumping on the bandwagon?
In the US, there have been signs this year of a shift away from growth
stocks and into cyclical stocks such as Caterpillar and Bethlehem Steel. But
as Bill Smith of BZW points out, the buoyant mood of the US market is based
on the sharp decline in interest rates, with the discount rate now down to
3.5 per cent. The hopes are for a strong rebound from recession.
In the UK, by contrast, the recovery is expected to be much more patchy and
sluggish - interest rates are still high in real terms and are unlikely to
fall quickly while the pound remains within the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
A number of sectors and companies may not yet have seen the worst. 'We are
still in a period when the risk of nasty surprises from the corporate sector
is high' says Bill Smith. This week's profit and dividend declines at Lonrho
prove his point.
As a consequence, though there was some sign that the UK was following the
US shift into cyclicals in early January, the trend stopped this week.
According to Jerry Evans of County NatWest, the shift might have started a
bit too early in the UK and investors will probably wait until they sense
the tenor of the next results season, in February and March, before taking
it further.
Certainly M&amp;G, which is in the process of launching a Recovery investment
trust via an expensive advertising campaign, will be counting on a return in
fashion to value investing in the near future.
But BZW's Smith has some doubts as to whether the value theory will hold as
good this time round. Cyclical stocks owed part of their outperformance in
previous rallies, he argues, to the continuing tendency for the pound to
devalue. A falling pound increases margins and order flow for exporters.
That trick cannot be repeated within the ERM.
BZW is looking for recovery to come from those companies with direct
exposure to the UK consumer and the US industrial sectors.
Certainly, the prospects for cyclical stocks are even more difficult to
predict than normal at the moment, since while the US is expected to
recover, the European economies are only starting their own slowdowns.
But the long term advantages of value and smaller company investing (see
below) are so well documented that it is hard to believe these effects have
disappeared for ever, even if they emerge in a slightly different form.
Fashion will shift again.
Given the risk of continued individual company shocks, however, the private
investor should ensure that any shifts in his or her portfolio are achieved
by investing in a unit or investment trust.
And it is even more vital that investors who want to back the value effect
buy for the long term. Sometimes it can take three or five years for the
undervaluation to disappear; patience in these circumstances is not just a
virtue, it is a necessity.

FT  25 JAN 92 / The Long View: Gilts seek a home market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER MAY have happened in the economy at large last year, investors had
a pretty good time. Consider your company's pension fund, for example. You
may still have lingering doubts about whether your bosses, having studied
the late Robert Maxwell's methods, are siphoning off the assets. But at
least you do not need to have any worries about recent investment
performance.
It looks as though the typical UK pension fund enjoyed an investment return
 -income plus capital gain - of 18 per cent or so last year, making up for
the blip in 1990 when returns were slightly negative. The equity and bond
markets around the world almost all performed well, and the UK property
market was the only real dog.
Because the liabilities of the pension funds will have grown only in line
with pay levels, at just over 7 per cent, there has been a margin of
surplus. Your boss will be able to enjoy his contribution holiday for a
while longer, even if he insists on continuing to deduct your own pension
instalments from your pay packet regardless.
You do not easily change a winning investment formula. For many years,
British pension funds have been chasing the high returns in the equity
market with great success.
The average fund's return over the past ten years has been 16 per cent
annually. But the strategy has now become even more extreme.
The latest figures from the WM Company, one of the two specialists which
measure pension fund performance, suggest that the proportion of portfolios
are invested in equities worldwide is 79 per cent. The rival service Caps,
which focuses more on slightly smaller, perhaps more aggressively-run funds,
calculates that the proportion is as high as 84 per cent.
Plainly there has been absolutely no response to the full commitment 15
months ago by the UK to the European Monetary System.
One logical result of that should have been a resurgence of fixed income
investment in Britain. The persistent high inflation that destroyed the
credibility of fixed interest bonds, notably government gilt-edged, was set
to become a thing of the past.
Over the past 20 years inflation in the UK has been 9.8 per cent a year, but
only 4 per cent in Germany, where investing in bonds is hugely popular.
But British investors are all too conscious of the large-scale robbery which
has been a feature of the gilts market over the years. The problem has been
pointed out once again this week in the latest annual version of the
Barclays de Zoete Wedd long-term equity-gilt study.
Since the war the average real return on UK equities each year has been just
over 6 per cent, but has been about minus 1 per cent on gilts. In nominal
terms, equities have outperformed on average by 7.5 per cent each year. No
contest, at least until we hitched sterling to the DM.
In fact, the EMS has not changed old habits one little bit. The continuing
trend towards equities is confirmed by official figures for institutional
investment. Last year the Central Statistical Office stopped publishing
figures for pension funds because they were suspect. Now it has begun
producing a new, improved version.
Since these have magically expanded the cash flowing into pension funds and
life assurance companies from Pounds 25bn to Pounds 35bn a year those stock
market strategists who feared a liquidity crisis have been greatly cheered
up.
In fact, far from being strained by the Pounds 10bn of UK rights issues last
year, fund managers had cash to spare to pour into a renewed spending spree
in overseas stock markets. The average UK pension fund now has nearly 25 per
cent of its portfolio in foreign shares.
The other notable feature has been the continued retreat from gilts. Another
Pounds 3bn of gilts were sold by pension funds in nine months to September,
and they now have at least as much in foreign bonds as in sterling bonds.
In fact the Caps funds now only seem to have 3 per cent in gilts, compared
to the 25 per cent they held at the start of the 1980s.
What is the point, say the fund managers, of bothering with fixed interest
securities? They do not match the investment objectives of pension funds,
which have liabilities linked to pay. Besides, equities will always perform
better.
Take 1991, when British inflation tumbled by more than half to 4.5 per cent,
which should have been very favourable for gilts, while in the stock market
earnings per share tumbled by over 10 per cent, which should have depressed
equities. In fact, the UK equity market returned 21 per cent while gilts
returned just over 16 per cent.
But there are two reasons to think twice about this approach. One is that
although equities do well in conditions of low inflation and strong economic
growth, they would not shine in a prolonged period of depression. Equities
are now discounting a strong profits recovery. If it does not happen they
will fall back, but gilts could continue to prosper. Secondly, the
government has a lot of gilts to sell.
Unexpectedly it has slotted in an extra auction next week. So far, it seems,
the gilts have been bought mostly by foreigners. But in a year or two a Tory
government could be trying to sell at least Pounds 20bn net of gilts
annually, a Labour regime Pounds 30bn or more.
Domestic institutions will have to play their part. But because their
attitude is poisoned by the long years of gilt-edged debauchery they may
want a better interest rate than has been acceptable to the foreigners.
Some of the big British institutions are shifting their strategies. Norwich
Union, for instance, has raised its exposure to bonds somewhat. Yet bond
returns are rarely exciting, and will only appear desirable if expectations
for equity gains have been scaled right back. Most institutional fund
managers have not yet been prepared to take that view.
But the fact that in recent months they have been chasing supposedly greener
grass overseas rather than chewing the apparently less digestible cud at
home suggests that they are running out of reserves of optimism, although
not of cash.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The imminent pricing review by the telecoms regulator makes it a difficult
time to value BT. But its shares have underperformed the market by a fifth
since October, mainly because its high profits and return on capital make it
unusually vulnerable to interference. The question is whether the market has
overlooked a simple way in which the group might try to strengthen its
defences.
According to Robert Fleming, BT's high profitability is partly due to the
abandonment of the group's traditional depreciation policy when it was
privatised in 1984. At the same time, the balance sheet was altered by heavy
asset write-downs and one-off charges to reserves. These changes had the
double effect of increasing BT's reported profits and raising its return on
capital. During the pricing review, it would be quite reasonable for BT to
propose an acceleration of its depreciation rates. After all, other European
telecoms companies, particularly Deutsche Telekom, have already implemented
a similar policy, basing their argument on shorter technological lifespans.
The dampening effect on BT's profits would relieve the political and
regulatory pressure, while the group's enormous cash flow would be
unaffected. If Oftel could be persuaded to sanction such an old-style piece
of creative accounting, it should be worth something on the price.

FT  25 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
High among the budget hopes of many a corporate treasurer must be a lower
burden of unrelieved advance corporation tax (ACT). According to the London
Business School, this is growing at the alarming rate of over Pounds 400m a
year. The severity of the UK recession means many companies are generating
an ever larger proportion of their profits overseas. Since they have not
enough mainstream UK tax liabilities to offset the levy on dividends, the
effective tax rate on their profits has increased even as recession
deepened.
A decision by the chancellor to attack this anomaly would unravel the
distortions it has created in corporate investment and borrowing. But it
should be welcome to investors too. Not only could dividend payments be
increased without fiscal penalty; the lower effective tax rate would also
increase net income and thus companies' market value.
Unfortunately this looks like too arcane a measure for a budget designed to
grab the ordinary voter's attention. It also sits ill with official concern
about excessive dividends in recession, while Mr Lamont will doubtless have
noted that the present regime encourages investment at home rather than
overseas. Other changes would have more targeted stimulatory effect. The
Institute for Fiscal Studies, for example, is homing in on the uniform
business rate, from which enterprise zones like Canary Wharf will shortly
lose exemption. If the chancellor does pass up the ACT opportunity, however,
last year's fall in UK profits will raise the taxed cost of dividends for
many companies in 1992, thus putting yet more pressure on payouts.

FT  25 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not surprisingly, the market was confused by yesterday's news that the UK
authorities want to take their own look at the Tarmac-Steetley joint
venture. Either the secretary of state cannot resist an opportunity to score
a few points off Brussels, or he is taking a pot shot at the whole UK
building materials industry. Both, after all, are familiar targets.
Assuming the latter, the implications go well beyond the likely referral of
Redland's bid for Steetley over competition in UK bricks and tiles. With the
whole sector flat on its back - and still showing no sign of recovery - the
joint venture proposal and the Redland bid look like deliberate attempts to
begin rationalisation with the least possible disruption to corporate
balance sheets. If these are now to be frustrated by a government already
suspicious about cartels in ready mixed concrete and the like, the major
players will presumably have to get rid of the excess capacity on their own.
That would almost certainly be a slower process, presumably involving bigger
write-downs in the absence of acquisition accounting.
Of course, it may not come to that. If both the bid and the joint venture
end up being investigated, much may depend on whether the OFT looks at
national or regional market shares. In the Steetley-Tarmac case, moreover,
Brussels could yet refuse to cede its authority back to the UK. Until the
politics become clearer, the Steetley shares are probably best left to the
speculators.

<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,510.4 (-14.9)
The London market's confidence in recovery is apparently not quite so robust
after all. Last week's star performers were high-yielding recovery stocks.
This week the process was reversed, as a result of nothing more significant
than a dividend cut from Lonrho, a medium-sized and notoriously eccentric
conglomerate. Yesterday the FT-SE fell by just 0.6 per cent. The 10 highest
yielders in the index, Lonrho excepted, fell by an average 2.4 per cent.
And yet nothing much in the general background has changed. Sterling is out
of immediate danger at some 9 pfennigs above its D-Mark floor. Wall Street
and Tokyo have been plunging around aimlessly, but both ended only modestly
down on the week. The outcome of the German wage round and the Bundesbank's
reaction to it remain anybody's guess. The UK consumer remains in hiding,
despite the fact that real income in aggregate - that is, allowing for
unemployment - is probably up slightly on a year ago. The prospect of a
March 10 budget is neither here or there. The best way for the government to
stimulate the consumer would be to get the election out of the way.
All the while, London's preoccupation with Wall Street looks ever more of an
anachronism. As the chart shows, the correlation between the two markets
breaks down in the face of broad economic change, as in the 1980s. The ERM
represents the biggest change yet. To appreciate how big, it is only
necessary to ask what the effect would be on the London market if base rates
went to 3.5 per cent and sterling were sharply devalued. These are the
conditions being enjoyed by US equities: and even so, it appears, Wall
Street finds it hard to make further headway.

FT  25 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt sees more
profit-taking in construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS some response in Europe to Wall Street's intermittent attempts at
a recovery yesterday morning, but in general the tone was muted, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT registered a brief uptick on London talk of a steel pay settlement
but the metalworkers' union, IG Metall, soon gave the lie to this story. The
FAX and DAX indices fell 3.30 to 677.53 and 4.80 to 1,664.77, each down a
fraction on the week. Volume xxxx from DM6.2bn to DMxxxbn.
The talk was still of gentle consolidation, but there were areas in which
the change in sentiment was more sharply defined. Construction stocks, which
had performed 'astonishingly well' since Christmas, according to Mr Urs
Waldvogel of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, fell for the third day in succession.
Bilfinger &amp; Berger dropped DM19 to DM931 for a three-day loss of DM39,
Hochtief by DM13 to DM1,150 for DM41 and Philipp Holzmann by DM22 to DM1,148
for DM36. At the same time, the building materials company, Heidelberger
Zement, leapt by DM37.50 to DM940.
Mr Waldvogel said that the constructions had combined very good output
figures with the latest fashion for cyclical stocks, and now offered
opportunities for profit-taking. Heidelberger Zement had been left behind,
had cheaper earnings, US recovery potential and no need to finance east
German acquisitions.
Other share price recovery stories lost some of their recent gains, Asko
falling DM15.50 to DM640.50 and Degussa by DM7 to DM329.50. Meanwhile, some
former laggards continued to improve, with AEG rising DM3.20 to DM216.50 and
Linotype by DM8.80 to DM347.80.
PARIS overcame an early bout of selling linked to the liquidation of the
January account yesterday to finish just below the day's highs. The CAC 40
index rose 11.23 to 1,849.92, but was down 0.5 per cent on the week.
Turnover eased to about FFr2.2bn from FFr2.4bn.
The building materials sector saw some volatility. Lafarge dropped FFr8.80
or 2.6 per cent to FFr329.90 in 113,640 shares following much worse than
expected 1991 results from its US subsidiary. Lafarge Corp suffered a
particularly bad fourth quarter loss and said that it saw no signs of any
pick-up in the North American markets.
Ciments Francais made the day's biggest gain, of 8.5 per cent, or FFr22 to
FFr281 and Poliet jumped FFr28.90 or 6.7 per cent to FFr460 but both rises
came in thin volume.
Elsewhere, LVMH added FFr50 to FFr4,340 on the back of its good 1991
turnover figures, while Saint-Gobain eased 10 centimes to FFr494 on its 1991
profits.
MILAN closed little changed, with turnover estimated at below Thursday's
L134bn. The Comit index rose 0.83 to 549.10, steady on the week.
The insurance sector continued to attract attention as shares in La
Fondiaria subsidiaries were readmitted after Thursday's suspension. News of
La Fondiaria's restructuring of its subsidiaries did not have much impact.
La Fondiaria fell L200 to L38,500, while Ausonia eased L56 to L834, Latina
fell L230 to L7,800 lire and La Previdente firmed L50 to L18,570. In the
same sector Generali, rose L150 to L31,200.
ZURICH, moderately active, ended slightly higher after Wall Street's
opening. The all-share SPI index closed 1.5 higher at 1,114.0, up 0.9 per
cent on the week.
BRUSSELS closed mixed to lower in moderate trading as the market
consolidated Thursday's gains. The Bel20 index fell 5.42 to 1,178.21, up 1.9
per cent on the week, in turnover worth BFr1.4bn.
The market leader, Petrofina, eased BFr25 to BFr10,850 on heavy volume of
26,880 shares. But the retailer GIB was one of the few blue chip shares to
buck the trend, closing up BFr22 or 1.7 per cent at BFr1,350 in heavy volume
of 161,200 shares.
STOCKHOLM had its ups and downs although the Affarsvarlden General index
closed only 0.6 lower at 984.7, up 0.3 per cent on the week. The ups
included a SKr15 recovery to SKr560 in Astra A on Aids treatment hopes for
the group's Foscavir drug.
Among insurers, however, Skandia fell SKr3 to SKr157 after Thursday's
meeting of the heads of four major Nordic insurers, at which talks on the
creation of a pan-Nordic insurance group seem to have faltered.
OSLO closed marginally lower, the all-share index dipping 0.35 to 443.43,
down 4.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was moderate at NKr301.2m.
Norsk Hydro, which shed NKr12.5 on Thursday on news of a special charge in
the fourth quarter, recovered NKr1 to NKr145.5.
COPENHAGEN ended mixed, though Danisco recovered another DKr10 to DKr835 on
heavy turnover of 119,000 shares. The index edged up 0.25 to 360.96 but was
little changed on the week.
ISTANBUL leapt more than 3 per cent on speculation that the Social Democrat
Party's congress this weekend will not lead to political unrest. The
75-share index ended at 5,022.60, up 148.84 on the day and little changed on
the week.

FT  25 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese shares resume
their downtrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO-DAY recovery in Japanese share prices was wiped out yesterday as
arbitrage-related selling, prompted by an overnight fall on Wall Street and
the lower yen and bond prices, dominated activity, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 508.57, or 2.4 per cent lower at 21,072.15, down
1.2 per cent on the week. It opened at the day's high of 21,527.81 but soon
turned down, falling to the day's low of 21,008.92 during the morning
session.
Volume dropped to 180m shares from 250m. Declines outnumbered advances by
805 to 176 with 153 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks
fell 25.92 to 1,584.86 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.51 to
1,218.53.
Light buying by foreign investors on the main market, and active foreign
buying over-the-counter provided a glimmer of light, with the Nikkei OTC
index rose by 1 per cent, advancing for the third consecutive day.
'Foreigners, especially European investors, are targeting companies with
high growth potential,' said Mr Kotaro Aoki at Ichiyoshi Securities.
International blue chips lost ground with Hitachi down Y28 to Y911 and NEC
losing Y30 to Y1,160. NTT fell Y5,000 to a new all time low of Y695,000.
Large-capital stocks lost ground on institutional selling. Nippon Steel, the
most active issue of the day, fell Y1 to Y351 and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries lost Y9 to Y645.
Speculative stocks were among the few winners, Clarion rising Y28 to Y975
and Nippon Carbon by Y70 to Y2,050 on buying by dealers looking for quick
profits.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 353.95 to 22,625.39 in volume of 33.4m
shares. Trading was dominated by cross trading and window dressing ahead of
the March book closing.
Nintendo, the game maker, firmed Y100 to Y10,500. The issue initially fell
on reports that the company was planning to buy a stake in a US major league
baseball team based in Seattle, which some investors feared would spark
criticism in the US. However, reports of favourable reaction from local
citizens, prompted some buying.
Roundup
TOKYO'S fall and domestic concerns influenced trading in the Pacific Rim
yesterday.
HONG KONG dropped in heavy trading as investors dumped the shares they had
picked up the previous day on a report that the ousted Chinese Communist
Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyan had been cleared of charges linked to the
June 1989 pro-democracy movement. The story was denied by the Chinese
authorities after the close on Thursday.
The Hang Seng Index slid 25.76 to 4,600.08, its first decline in a
record-breaking advance over the previous nine sessions but up 3.3 per cent
on the week. Turnover eased to HKDollars 3.02bn from HKDollars 3.52bn.
In a weak banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 25 cents to HKDollars 36.75
while in conglomerates, Jardine Matheson slid 75 cents to HKDollars 43.
AUSTRALIA slumped as the local currency and the bond market both plunged,
though late action by the Reserve Bank of Australia to offer to buy bonds
provided some support. The All Ordinaries index ended down 19.6 at 1,615.8,
for a loss of 3.4 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to ADollars 313m from
ADollars 259m.
Banking shares all dropped. Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell 4 cents to
ADollars 7.41, Westpac Banking lost 7 cents to ADollars 4.15 and Australia &amp;
New Zealand Banking Group fell 12 cents to ADollars 4.37.
SEOUL ended lower as investors turned cautious after the rapid rises of the
past three days. The composite index fell 9.43 to 658.04, for a 6.7 per cent
rise on the week. Turnover remained active at Won541.1bn after Won631.1bn.
TAIWAN moved strongly against the trend, the weighted index closing 121.59,
or 2.4 per cent higher at 5243.60, up 3.9 per cent on the week. The market
was encouraged by the recent trend in Hong Kong but, given yesterday's
performance, thought likely to pull back in today's trading.
BANGKOK saw turnover rise to a record Bt12.59bn from Bt10.89bn, while the
SET index closed a modest 1.37 higher at 781.63, 1.4 per cent up on the
week.

FT  25 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Canada's forestry sector shows signs of
recovery - Rising lumber prices, due to supply uncertainties, have boosted
share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cliche that the darkest hour comes before the dawn aptly describes
investors' prevailing view of Canada's depressed forestry industry.
Almost every major Canadian forest products company is expected to report
hefty losses for the fourth quarter of last year. Yet their share prices are
steadily climbing. The Toronto stock exchange's paper and forest products
index has advanced almost 14 per cent since last November to 3,660 this
week.
The price jumps in some cases have been little short of spectacular, perhaps
because of the illiquidity of the sector, which only has a 2.3 per cent
weighting in the TSE 300 index. International Forest Products of Vancouver
surged from CDollars 7.63 to CDollars 10.25 in two months. MacMillan
Bloedel, the big west coast producer, has climbed from a 1991 low of
CDollars 15.50 to over CDollars 20.
Pundits are confident that the worst is now over for a sector which has
taken one of the most severe beatings of any North American industry over
the past two years, with the exception of real estate. 'It's time to take a
long-term view and jump in,' says one Toronto forest products analyst.
Mr Richard Kellertas, analyst with McLean McCarthy in Montreal, forecasts
that the forest products sector as a whole could rise another 15-20 per cent
this year.
The signs of recovery are most apparent in the lumber and pulp markets.
Propelled by the steep fall in US interest rates, March and May lumber
futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were at record levels this week.
US housing starts grew by 2.6 per cent in December, fuelling hopes that the
construction industry, the biggest buyer of timber, is starting to emerge
from its slump.
Supply uncertainties have also helped drive up lumber prices. The US Forest
Service virtually stopped sales of timber in late 1991 from government-owned
forests in Oregon and Washington in response to pressure from environmental
groups to protect the northern spotted owl and other wildlife. About 8 per
cent of total US timber production is expected to be withdrawn between the
second half of 1992 and the end of 1993.
On the pulp side, North American producers have gained from the recent rise
in European currencies. They are due to raise the price of northern softwood
pulp by USDollars 20 a tonne at the beginning of February to Dollars 540 a
tonne, the second such increase in two months.
Canadian producers, who account for more than a quarter of the world's
market pulp output, shipped 21 per cent more material last November than a
year earlier, thanks largely to their improved competitiveness in Europe.
Their inventories have fallen steadily since last August.
Companies with a relatively high exposure to lumber and pulp are at the top
of analysts 'buy' lists. International Forest has no paper business at all.
Other favourites include West Fraser Timber, Canfor Corp and two smaller
west coast companies, Primex Forest Products and Slocan Forest. Primex's
share price has climbed from CDollars 5.75 to CDollars 7.63 in the past two
months.
A dark cloud still hangs over newsprint, and the share prices of most
newsprint producers have yet to show much sign of movement. Despite a
relatively strong balance sheet, Abitibi-Price was trading at CDollars 15.13
this week, exactly where it was last November, and still below its book
value.
Cut-throat competition is still forcing both US and Canadian newsprint
producers to offer discounts of 20-35 per cent on their list prices. The
Canadians are at a particular disadvantage, with old machines and high
labour costs.
Canadian newsprint mills are operating at about 80 per cent of capacity,
compared with 97 per cent for the US industry.
Despite these handicaps, at least some Canadian newsprint producers may
enjoy a marked improvement in profitability later this year.
A combination of restructuring, cost-cutting, a weakening Canadian dollar,
and low interest rates should show up on bottom lines by the second half.
There is even some anecdotal evidence of a shaky recovery in newspaper and
magazine advertising, a key element in the newsprint outlook.
Several of the big newsprint producers are in the midst of painful but
necessary adjustments. Canadian Pacific Forest Products has announced the
closure of eight high-cost machines in Quebec and New Brunswick.
More than 40 per cent of its capacity will then consist of machines which
are less than two years old. CP Forest also announced earlier this month
that it is easing its debt burden with a CDollars 218m equity issue.
Fletcher Challenge, Abitibi-Price and MacMillan Bloedel are also all in the
throes of restructuring.
With US forestry stocks at a hefty premium to book value and at high
price-earnings multiples, optimists are crossing their fingers in the hope
that the Canadian shares will stage at least a partial catch-up when the
recovery eventually gets into full swing.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Base metals point way to
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METAL MARKET watchers are becoming increasingly, though still cautiously,
optimistic that they may be seeing the early signs of economic recovery.
'Metal prices can broadly be used as barometers of the overall health of the
resource sector,' says Mr Nick Moore, analysts at Ord Minnett Research, in
his latest weekly metal market report. 'What we find time and again is that
two metals in particular, aluminium and nickel, outperform the other metals
in terms of price and consumption growth in the early stages of an economic
recovery. This reflects their use in consumer durables (relatively low cost
white goods for example).'
At the London Metal Exchange this week both these metals continued the price
recoveries that started before Christmas. Cash aluminium closed yesterday at
Dollars 1,249.50 a tonne, up Dollars 61.50 on the week and Dollars 123 since
the turn of year, while cash nickel was at Dollars 7,865 a tonne, up Dollars
155 and Dollars 690 respectively.
'The real acid test of any recovery is of course how well a market absorbs
profit taking,' says Mr Moore. 'This week both our star metals have been
tested by selling and have not only shrugged it off but have continued to
fresh heights.'
Aluminium's performance has been all the more remarkable because it has been
accompanied by a continuing rise in LME warehouse stocks, which started the
year already at an unprecedented level. However, a slowing in the pace of
arrivals at the exchange's registered warehouses - this week saw a stocks
rise of 9,475 tonnes to 1,045,850 tonnes - was cited by some traders as a
factor in the market's strength. There was also talk of Russian shipment
delays because of increased export tax bureaucracy.
Nickel's recent price rise has also taken place in defiance of a continued
build-up in LME stocks - this week's 1,704-tonne increase took the total to
16,524 tonnes, the highest level since September 1984, and extended the rise
on the year so far to 4,352 tonnes.
But there appears to have been a profound change in sentiment in the nickel
market, which fell by more than Dollars 2,500 a tonne during the second half
of 1991. Waves of investment fund buying, encouraged by bullish chart
patterns, had been overwhelming sporadic bursts of profit taking, at least
until yesterday, when the three months delivery price's move above Dollars
8,000 a tonne was met by sterner resistance.
A degree of caution has been encouraged, moreover, by fears of a German
steel workers' strike - the results of the ballot are expected next Friday -
which would reduce demand from nickel's key end-use sector.
Most other LME metal markets saw modest gains pared or eliminated yesterday.
The biggest movement was in zinc, the cash price of which finished Dollars
21.50 up on the week at Dollars 1,182.50 a tonne, after falling by Dollars
11.50 yesterday. Dealers explained that there were fears that recent
chart-based buying might lead to the development of an overbought market and
also noted the bearish influence of a further 2,150-tonne stocks rise
announced yesterday.
Lead was the only base metal to remain depressed throughout the week, the
cash price ending Pounds 5.50 down at Pounds 282 a tonne. But most of that
fall reflected sterling's strength against the US dollar.
At the London bullion market the gold price was pushed through resistance at
Dollars 358 a troy ounce on Monday by European buying. But the buying
quickly dried up and by yesterday's close the price was Dollars 354.65 a
tonne, down Dollars 1.70 on the week. Dealers said a Dollars 1.40 fall
yesterday was prompted by South American central bank selling.
The silver market had another lively week, the spot price dipping to 419
cents an ounce at one point on Monday before recovering on US investment
fund buying. Then on Thursday US selling undermined the market again and in
London yesterday the spot price closed at 417 cents an ounce, down 13 cents
on balance.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange cocoa prices were depressed by
sterling's strength and the May position ended Pounds 13 down on the week at
Pounds 759 a tonne. However, a market report by Gill &amp; Duffus, the London
trade house owned by ED &amp; F. Man, forecast that several years of world
production deficits - following seven years of surplus - would result in an
upward trend in cocoa prices through to the mid 1990s.

FT  25 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lose ground as account ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES that Lonrho's dividend-cutting exercise could initiate a
domino-effect among some of the UK's most important companies over coming
months prompted another widespread decline in the equity market as the
two-week trading account ended.
The FT-SE 100-share index, under pressure for much of the week, succumbed to
periodic bouts of selling pressure yesterday, which affected a generally
unwilling market, and closed 14.9 points lower at 2,510.4. At its worst
yesterday, within an hour of the start of trading, the index was
substantially below the 2,500-mark, touching 2,493.2 or down 32.1. The
index's best showing was recorded in mid-afternoon when it showed a decline
of 9.6 at 2,515.7.
At the outset of trading, all eyes in the market were glued to the Lonrho
page on the Seaq trading screens as the international trading group's
shares, battered during late unofficial trading on Thursday night, fell to
107p minutes after trading commenced, compared with the previous session's
official closing level of 164p. Turnover in Lonrho topped 32m shares and
easily outstripped that of any other stock in the market.
Thereafter, the market slowly regained some of its lost composure. Senior
marketmakers, expecting a wave of selling after the Lonrho dividend cut,
were surprised at the relatively light weight of actual selling pressure at
the outset but reported another late flurry of selling as the market closed.
This followed a statement from the US authorities about potential bank
failures which was said to have upset Wall Street as London closed. There
were also suggestions around the market, that the weekend Press will include
at least one opinion poll favouring Labour.
During the week, the Footsie has fallen just over 26 points. Specialists
attribute much of the decline in London to the weakness of international
markets. Wall Street has fallen in excess of 20 points over the same period
while Tokyo has lost substantial ground.
Market turnover, yesterday, reached 614.6m shares, well ahead of Thursday's
573.4m and Wednesday's 515.6m and only a fraction below Tuesday's
programme-trade-inflated 619.4m.
News that the Trade and Industry Secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, had asked the
European Commission for permission to refer the Steetley/Tarmac joint
venture in building materials to the Monopolies and Mergers prompted a slide
in both share prices and fears that Redland's full bid may also be referred.
Among other big movers in the Footsie, British Aerospace took another
pasting in response to a broker downgrade.
Retail, or strictly customer business in equity markets this week picked up
after a very slow start responding to heavy programme trading.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Appointments: Order to uniforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacqueline de Baer has decided that her eponymous and rapidly growing design
house for corporate clothing, hitherto more or less a one-woman show,
demands the skills of a managing director.
She has consequently hired Angus Rankine, just 33, who spent the last five
years marketing Canary Wharf for Canadian developers Olympia &amp; York. While
de Baer will continue with the design and sales, the nitty gritty of
day-to-day business will be minded by Rankine.
Clients buying uniforms designed by Jacqueline de Baer, who recently won the
TSB/Options 'Women mean business' award, range from Forte and Shell to the
British pavilion at Expo '92 in Seville.
Starting straight from school on the Barclays Bank graduate trainee
programme at 18, Rankine did not tarry with the UK clearer, finding he had
no wish to become 'a gold watch man'. Instead Rankine decided to go for what
he calls a 'sensible' job, namely an account director at J Walter Thompson,
the advertising agency, before leaving for Olympia &amp; York. In order actually
to run a business Rankine admits he will now be calling upon some of the
theory he was fed on the Barclays training programme.

Helen Rees, 31, who resigned as director of the troubled Design Museum in
London at the end of 1991, is heading north, to Halifax, where she is to be
communications director of a new children's museum called Eureka].
'It's something of a misnomer to call it a museum,' she says. 'It's designed
to be an interactive learning place, where children between 5 and 12 and
their families will enjoy themselves.' Rees is looking forward to the move,
which she says 'in a sense feels quite Utopian'.

Holland &amp; Holland, the Mayfair gun-makers bought by Chanel in 1989, has
appointed a Frenchman to the position of chief executive and chairman.
Alain Drach, 43, is not from Chanel, but otherwise Holland &amp; Holland seems
to know astonishingly little about its new boss. He has a marketing
background and has run a famous French shoot - which just happens to belong
to the Wertheimer family that owns Chanel.
New deputy chairman is the managing director Roger Mitchell - who contended
at the time of the French acquisition, which caused something of a stir
among the gunmaker's gentrified patrons, that 'we will remain an English
firm under English management'.
Stock Exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, who has chaired Holland &amp;
Holland for the past four and a half years, moves to the sidelines as
non-executive chairman of the holding company.
While Holland &amp; Holland patted itself on the back over the Chanel deal,
which cost the perfume-makers Pounds 10.9m, the company - where a pair of
Royal 12-bore tooled by its mastercraftsmen start in excess of Pounds 56,000
 -has subsequently been hard hit by the recession. It may also have been
affected by the recent successful entry of Asprey into the hand-made gun
market - even if one country gent describes the latter's weapons as vulgar
enough to frighten away any pheasant.
'The company remains quintessentially English and few, if any, Holland &amp;
Holland customers are even aware that it is no longer an independent
company,' is the parting shot of the London spokeswoman.

FT  25 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in stock market futures was volatile yesterday as fears of Wall
Street weakness failed to materialise and traders straightened their books
on the last day of the account, writes Peter John.
The futures contract for March delivery opened at 2530, in response to
overnight falls in New York equities. It was immediately marked down to
around 2522 and reached its estimated fair value of 22 points over cash.
Then March picked up slowly throughout the day although each rally was sold
down again on pessimism over Wall Street's opening. The gloom was misplaced
and dealers trying to leave themselves short were caught in a bear squeeze
which sent the contract up to a premium of almost 40 points against the
underlying market. This compares with the new fair value estimate of 16
points from Monday. At the official close March was 2,551. It moved up
further in after hours dealing.
On LTOM, turnover of just over 26,000 contracts was boosted by good two way
business in Lonrho. Lonrho saw 4,895 contracts traded, equivalent to 4.9m
shares, and volume was boosted by the introduction of a number of new option
series. Roll-Royce was also active.

FT  25 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: DTI move knocks Steetley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to refer the
proposed Steetley and Tarmac joint venture to the EC, and ultimately the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, sent shares in the two builders tumbling.
The venture would create a company with around 13 per cent of the brick
market and is seen by many observers as a necessary move in an overcrowded
sector. Steetley lost 37 to 369p in heavy volume of 5m, while Tarmac slipped
5 to 118p with 4.4m traded. Many analysts said the DTI move would spell the
end of Redland's bid for Steetley, which if successful would create a group
with a 26 per cent share of the brick market. However, Redland would
probably make a fresh bid should the MMC rule in favour of the
joint-venture. Redland fell 5 to 465p.
Mr Terry Murray at James Capel said: 'This is bad news for Tarmac and
Steetley. They both wanted to get their brick business sorted out. Without
this joint-venture, some parts may have to be closed down.'
Tesco switch
Supermarket group Tesco was up on a securities house recommendation and a
bullish presentation. The shares firmed 7 1/2 to 240 1/2 p.
Panmure Gordon changed its recommendation to a buy from a sell after a visit
to the company on Thursday, and switched its stance on the sector to
overweight from neutral. Analyst Mr Michael Bourke cited falling capital
expenditure projections as the main reason for the change.
Observers said the shares were also helped by a positive presentation to
institutions by J Sainsbury after the market closed on Thursday. Analysts
said the presentation covered the whole sector, and as Tesco is the cheaper
of the quality stocks it was the first to benefit. Sainsbury held firm at
356p.
Lonrho falls
International trading group Lonrho opened steeply lower yesterday after
marketmakers slashed their prices on consideration of the company's results,
announced after the market closed on Thursday.
When trading began the shares were quoted at 108p, down 55 on the previous
day's close. They saw furious turnover at that level with investors bailing
in response to the much lower-than-expected annual profits, a dividend cut
and others seizing a buying opportunity. By the end of the day they had
recovered to close 43 off at 120p with 32m traded, the highest turnover
since September 1989. The shares quoted in South Africa also fell sharply
and Lonrho was the most actively dealt stock in the traded options market.
The recent uptick in British Airways was sharply reversed, after Kleinwort
Benson told clients to 'top-slice' the stock which, they said, had run too
far too quickly.
Airways ended the session 7 lower at 244p on keen turnover of 3.5m. There
were also hints of a possible downgrade from one of the influential US
investment houses.
Guardian Royal Exchange dipped 3 to 123p, after Smith New Court recommended
selling the shares in its recent analysis of the insurance composites
sector. Fears of a dividend cut and the weak state of the company's general
and life operations continue to hit the share price in a generally depressed
sector, ahead of the final figures in March.
Banking shares showed mixed changes in the run up to next month's results
from the big four clearing banks. Barclays fell 1 to 381p and Midland lost 4
to 221p, but Lloyds gained 4 to 398p while National Westminster rose 2 to
286p.
Panmure Gordon's analysis of the banking sector tends to agree with the
recent review from Shearson Lehman Brothers, suggesting that NatWest is the
most attractive buy among the major UK banks. This reflects fading fears
that NatWest will cut its dividend, despite the fact that it may be
uncovered on the latest profits forecast.
Brewer Bass fell 7 to 1081p in response to a downgrade from Smith New Court.
The house cut the estimate for this year by Pounds 37m to Pounds 560m. The
move followed news at the Bass annual meeting on Thursday that there had
been a deterioration in its trading mix and that reorganisation costs would
be higher than expected.
Northern Foods rose 14 to 551p on slim turnover after securities house
County NatWest recommended a switch out of Ranks Hovis McDougall. Ranks
recovered 3 to 218p after falling 14 on Thursday in response to a company
profit warning, saying current trading, particularly in the bread industry
and in the US, continues to be very difficult. County cut its forecast on
Ranks for the year to August 1992 by Pounds 31m to Pounds 113.
A securities house forecast cut hit Tate &amp; Lyle and prompted the shares to
tumble 12 to 418p. Mr Carl Short of Nomura cut his estimate for this year by
Pounds 9m to 245m and for next year by Pounds 13m to Pounds 275m. The
figures are at the lower end of analysts' forecasts. He has also adopted a
more bearish stance and is now advising clients to take profits.
A cut in the dividend forecast for BAe sent the shares tumbling underlining
their volatile reputation.
They also suffered after reflection on Thursday's speculation over the
possibility of a bidder emerging before the general election.
Broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew slashed its dividend forecast by half to 12p,
analyst Mr Paul Compton worrying about the level of debt and the absence of
a finance director among other things. The shares fell 15 to 283p.
Lack of news on the possibility of Vickers sale of its Rolls-Royce
subsidiary took 3 off Vickers at 178p. Rolls fell 3 to 136p.
Ramifications of Vickers losing the Type 23 frigate order left the
ship-yards owner 23 off at 408p.
Lonrho's statement on weak platinum prices hit Johnson Matthey, down 10 at
335p.
A forecast downgrade by Charterhouse left BAA 15 off at 541p in moderate
turnover of 1.6m. The size of the fall perplexed some analysts as the
Charterhouse move - slicing Pounds 20m off its current-year forecast to
Pounds 200m - simply brought it into line with other brokers.
Another heavy day's trading in Queens Moat saw 5.8m shares traded as a
succession of recent buy notes improved sentiment over the stock. The shares
faded to close a half-penny stronger at 78p.
Holiday group Airtours continued strong on the news of its buoyant holiday
bookings, adding 12 to 915p. Owners Abroad, however, was hit by
profit-taking and fell 1 1/2 to 105 1/2 p.
Two cash calls left the market cold. Hi-Tec lost 3 to 179p after it Pounds
10.3m rights issue, while Wembley slipped 3 1/2 to 33 1/2 p after its Pounds
37.3m call.
City Site's results were in line with market expectations but the dividend
cut was not and the shares lost 13 to 65p.
Macarthy gained 12 to 293p on further consideration of results announced on
Thursday and hopes that the MMC will clear proposed bids by Lloyds Chemists
and UniChem.
Photocopier supplies company Eurocopy lost recent gains and fell 17 1/2 to
82 1/2 , after the full-year figures.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar hit by intervention fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR strengthened yesterday on the foreign exchange markets until
fears of central bank intervention ahead of this weekend's Group of Seven
meeting caused late selling, writes Simon London.
It retained a firm tone through Far Eastern and European trading, although
fears of central bank intervention capped any potential rise.
The dollar closed at Y123.85 and DM1.6065 on Thursday in New York, having
rallied from European closing levels.
Overnight in Tokyo, the firm tone continued, with the US currency breaking
through resistance at Y124.45, which had marked the high point in New York.
Analysts said the dollar had been helped against the yen by another bout of
weakness on the Tokyo stock market, which dented confidence in the Japanese
currency. The Nikkei stock market index closed down 500 points on the day.
By the close in Tokyo, the US currency stood at Y124.57. Against the D-Mark
it was slightly weaker, closing at DM1.6105, just below the position in New
York.
From early highs, the US currency drifted off slightly in European trading
but maintained a basically firm tone. The dollar peaked at DM1.6140 and
Y124.65 early in the session, but drifted sideways for most of the day in
the absence of economic data or policy statements to drive trading.
However, in late afternoon in London, rumours that the US authorities were
preparing to intervene to cap the dollar against the D-Mark caused a rapid
sell-off.
The dollar fell to DM1.5750, from around DM1.61 before the rumours were
circulated, before finding support.
As with other recent bouts of dollar volatility, the decline was accelerated
as stop-loss trading orders were triggered.
Against the yen the decline was less dramatic. The US currency fell to
Y123.10 from around Y124.
By the close in London there had been no intervention and the US currency
had recovered some of the lost ground. At the finish the dollar stood at
DM1.5875, from DM1.5950 on Thursday; Y123.30 from Y123.8; and Pounds 1.8055
from Pounds 1.7960.
Within the European monetary system, the D-Mark gained ground during the
morning, reversing the recent trend. However, the slight rally was not
carried through and the German currency fell back in the afternoon.
Analysts said concerns over industrial action in several sectors of the
German economy , - particularly steel and banking - continued to undermine
confidence in the D-Mark.
Sterling was slightly softer as the D-Mark gained but remained comfortably
within its permitted range. The UK currency closed unchanged at DM2.8650.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates close level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money rates were steady yesterday as sterling remained firm within the
European monetary system and the drain of tax payments from the market
decreased, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m funds early in the
day. The main component contributing to the shortage was Pounds 735m in
maturing treasury bills and repurchase arrangements from earlier days.
Exchequer transactions, mostly comprising tax payments, drained Pounds 225m
from the market, a lower level than seen earlier in the week.
The Bank was able to inject a chunky Pounds 724m in early operations,
puchasing outright Pounds 139m band 1 bills and opening a new date for
repurchase funds. It bought Pounds 585m paper for resale to the market on
February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent.
This was sufficient to remove any pressure for higher overnight rates, which
fell back from 11 per cent on Thursday to 10 - 9 1/2 per cent by mid
morning.
In the afternoon session, just Pounds 10m band 1 bills were purchase before
late assistance of Pounds 185 mopped up the remaining shortage of funds.
The overnight money rate closed at 11 - 10 3/4 per cent; one-month interbank
funds closed unchanged at 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent; three-month interbank
funds at 10 -  9/16 per cent.
In Frankfurt money market rates edged higher as operators anticipated a
squeeze in liquidity conditions next week as pension fund payments drain
funds from the market.
Anticipating this, the Bundesbank yesterday injected 'section 17' funds into
the market, transfering deposits held for the public sector into the
commercial market.
Call money was mostly traded at 9.45/55 per cent, from the 9.40/50 per cent
level which has prevailed all week.
The Bank of Japan kept liquidity conditions tight in Tokyo, despite another
heavy fall by Japanese equity prices. The Nikkei stock market index fell by
500 points, matching the scale of declines which led to a fractional easing
on money market conditions by the authorities earlier in the week.
Faced with an estimated Y290bn liquidity shortage, later revised down to
Y130bn, the Bank of Japan injected only Y100bn funds. As institutions
scrambled for funding, call money interest rates were squeezed up  1/8 of a
point to 5 per cent.

FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley doubles income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Stanley, one of New York's leading investment banks, yesterday
underscored Wall Street's current profits boom when it reported more than
doubled fourth-quarter net income.
The securities house said net income totalled Dollars 132.3m, or primary
earnings per share of Dollars 1.61, on revenues of Dollars 716.6m, compared
with net income of Dollars 58.3m, or 71 cents a share, in the same period of
last year on revenues of Dollars 488.2m.
Wall Street firms have benefited over the past year from surging stock and
bond markets, falling interest rates, strong demand for securities from
investors and extremely heavy corporate issuance of new equity and
fixed-income instruments.
Morgan's fourth-quarter leap stemmed from two main areas. One was securities
transactions on its own account, where its trading revenues rose from
Dollars 176.7m to Dollars 246.3m.
The group also realised Dollars 14.3m in revenues, compared with nil a year
ago, from 'merchant banking' - direct investment in highly leveraged
companies. The second big area was investment banking, where revenues rose
from Dollars 146.3m to Dollars 252.3m, helped by strong equity and debt
underwriting volume.
Morgan Stanley invented the most fashionable new security on Wall Street
last year - preferred equity redemption cumulative stock or percs.
For the full year, Morgan Stanley reported net income of Dollars 475.1m, or
earnings per share of Dollars 5.93, against Dollars 270.4m, or Dollars 3.37
in 1990.
Revenues rose to Dollars 2.86bn from Dollars 2.16bn.
The company said its strong global market position helped 1991 sales and
trading activities, resulting in record fixed income, equity, foreign
exchange and commodities revenues.
On the investment banking side, equity and underwriting volumes had more
than offset continued weakness in the takeover and real estate advisory
markets.

FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Packer sells 51% stake in
Valassis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CANBERRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KERRY PACKER, the Australian media entrepreneur, has stepped up his
worldwide asset sell-off with the flotation of 51 per cent of Valassis
Communications, his successful US-based advertising company.
The flotation, seeking to raise between USDollars 442m and USDollars 508m,
has intensified speculation that Mr Packer is raising cash ahead of a big
overseas investment.
In November last year, Mr Packer unexpectedly withdrew from Tourang, the
international consortium that won the bid for Fairfax, Australia's
second-largest newspaper publisher. Tourang, led by Mr Conrad Black, the
Canadian publisher, offered ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.05bn) for the
Fairfax assets.
The Valassis flotation follows closely the public offering of 51 per cent of
Australian Consolidated Press, Mr Packer's magazine publishing business,
which is expected to yield about ADollars 800m to his privately-owned
Consolidated Press Holdings.
A filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission said 22.1m Valassis
shares would be sold at between USDollars 20 and USDollars 23 a share. The
flotation is underwritten by Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney Harris Upham.
Mr Packer bought Valassis in December 1986, reportedly for ADollars 600m.
Over the last 18 months, Mr Packer has raised ADollars 1.6bn from sales of
assets including shares in the Australian National Industries, the Nine
Network and six other large investments.

FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Mundial to be fully privatised
in late March
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MUNDIAL Confianca, one of Portugal's top three insurance companies with an
estimated turnover of Es32bn (Dollars 237m) in 1991, will be fully
privatised in the second half of March, the government announced this week.
Several other privatisations, including the sale of an initial stake in
Petrogal, the oil group and the country's largest company, and the
completion of the sale of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa,
Portugal's third largest bank that was 40 per cent privatised last year, are
also expected soon. Conditions for the sale of 51 per cent in Petrogal are
due to be announced next week.
This year, the government plans to accelerate its privatisation programme
with the sale or partial sale of 18 companies which it hopes will raise
about Es350bn. Since the programme began in 1989, the government has raised
Es370bn from 14 big privatisations.
The sale of Mundial will be split into three tranches with a starting price
of Es3,500 for a single indivisible block of shares representing 40 per cent
of the company's share capital. The other 60 per cent will be divided among
employees, small investors and overseas investors who will be reserved 25
per cent of the shares, and general investors for the remaining 35 per cent
of the shares.
Employees will be offered shares at a fixed price of Es2,925 per share, and
foreign and small investors at Es3,100 per share. The starting price for
general investors will be Es3,250 per share. Foreign investors will be
limited to a maximum 25 per cent of the privatised shares, though they can
join up with Portuguese groups in bidding for the single block of shares
or/and buy shares from the tranche aimed at general investors.
Several groups have already indicated interest in Mundial including Banco
Totta &amp; Acores, a Portuguese bank in which Spain's Banesto has a large
stake, Allianz, the German insurance group, and Mr Antonio Champalimaud, a
Portuguese entrepreneur and former owner of the company before its
nationalisation in 1975.
Sociedade de Construcoes Soares da Costa, Portugal's biggest civil
construction company, yesterday said 1991 pre-tax profits had topped Es2.5bn
compared with Es2.05bn in 1990, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Turnover for 1991 was over Es55bn against Es50.6bn the previous year.

exchange

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAURER Group Holding, the Swiss textile machinery and engineering group
controlled by Dr Tito Tettamanti, has acquired Gruppo Industriale Ghidella
(GIG), an Italian motor components maker, through an exchange of shares.
The deal means Mr Vittorio Ghidella, chairman and owner of 93 per cent of
GIG's equity, will receive a roughly 25 per cent voting stake in Saurer and
become its chairman. Mr Tettamanti, who has a 35 per cent voting position,
will be chairman of the twin company, Saurer Group Investments.
The exchange of shares is to be made on the basis of the audited net asset
value of the two groups at the end of 1991. Saurer estimated that the
217,000 shares to be issued for GIG shareholders would be valued at about
SFr670 apiece, making the deal worth roughly SFr145m (Dollars 102.80m).
GIG specialises in transmissions for agricultural and industrial vehicles.
It had sales last year of L223bn.
Saurer has been active on the acquisition trail in the past year, buying
Schlafhorst, a big German manufacturer of textile machinery in June and
Xaloy, a US maker of components for injection moulding machines, in
December.
Mr Tettamanti said Mr Ghidella would take overall responsibility for the
group. The two agreed that Mr Ghidella might buy further shares of Saurer to
bring his holding up to the level of Mr Tettamanti's.

PFIZER, one of the largest US drug companies, has agreed to commit up to
Dollars 505m to cover claims by recipients of the company's artificial heart
valves who become ill or die.
The allocation, which consists of up to Dollars 205m in a settlement of a
lawsuit plus a Dollars 300m pre-tax reserve taken by the company, represents
one of the largest product liability settlements in the history of the US
pharmaceuticals industry.
The record was set in 1988 when AH Robins agreed to set up a Dollars 2.4bn
fund to compensate women who claimed injuries from the Dalkon Shield
contraceptive device.
The Dollars 300m fourth-quarter charge - which amounts to Dollars 195m after
tax and is separate from the settlement of a lawsuit covering 55,000 heart
valve recipients - wiped out nearly all the company's net earnings in the
quarter, reducing them to less than Dollars 1m from Dollars 154.8m in the
last quarter of 1990. Quarterly sales were 4 per cent higher at Dollars
1.85bn.
For the whole of 1991 the charge resulted in Pfizer's net income declining
by 10 per cent, to Dollars 722.1m. Sales for the year were 8 per cent higher
at Dollars 6.95bn.
Pfizer said yesterday that 400 recipients of the artificial heart valve,
which was taken off the world market in 1986, have either died or suffered
from its fracture. But the company will not admit that the valve is
defective.
Last September, the New York-based drug company sought to refute a report of
a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) task force finding that a Pfizer
subsidiary had schemed to thwart FDA regulatory efforts and to prolong the
marketing of the flawed heart valve.
The task force charged that the valve, made by Pfizer's former Shiley
subsidiary, was defective at the time of FDA approval in 1979.
The settlement, which still requires court approval, is in response to a
class action lawsuit filed last April. The agreement sets up a fund of
between Dollars 80m and Dollars 130m to provide heart valve patients with
medical payments plus a further Dollars 75m of funds that will be
administered by the court in order to finance heart valve research. Claims
will be awarded to patients on the basis of a sliding scale that ranges
between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 2m per claimant.
The Dollars 300m taken in the fourth-quarter charge is for future claims by
patients who suffer from fractures of the valve.
Mr Stanley Chesley, the lawyer who acted on behalf of the heart valve
patients, said the settlement was significant because it does not contain a
ceiling on total claims by patients.
Pfizer said this means that valve recipients have the right to bring further
legal action against the company if they are not satisfied with the payments
already specified.
Pfizer said it expected to offset the Dollars 155m to Dollars 205m of
payments agreed in the settlement with its own insurance and from gains
recorded on the sale last month of most of Shiley's remaining product lines
to SNIA BPD, a subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group.
On Wall Street yesterday, Pfizer's share price rose by  5/8 to Dollars 75
7/8 .

FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reputation costs Eurocopy Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROCOPY, the photocopier distribution and services group, which has faced a
barrage of criticism of its selling practices, is taking a Pounds 7.7m
provision against costs related to defending its position and resolving
customer complaints.
The provision, taken as an extraordinary item, compares with pre-tax profits
for the year to September 30 of Pounds 7.03m (Pounds 11.32m).
The company has suffered from substantial bad publicity regarding its
selling practices and a warning by the Office of Fair Trading that it could
revoke its consumer credit licences. Earlier this week the OFT decided not
to revoke any of its licences.
Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said that the recession and the adverse publicity
had led to 'what has been without doubt the most difficult year in the
company's history'.
The fall in photocopier sales was mainly responsible for reduced turnover of
Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 48.2m).
There was an overall loss for the year of Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 7.38m
profits) which, together with dividend payments, necessitated the transfer
from reserves of Pounds 5.05m. Last time there was a payment to reserves of
Pounds 5.46m
The shares, which surged by 25 per cent to 100p on the announcement of the
OFT's decision, yesterday slipped 13p to 87p.
Earnings per share were down to 9.49p (15.33p) and a proposed unchanged
final dividend of 2.9p makes a same-again total of 4p.
Efforts will be directed to rebuilding the group, Mr Gay said. 'It's not an
overnight job. It's going to take us six months. But we've something to
build on now.'
It is pursuing a warranty claim against Sketchley from which it acquired in
1989 two of its subsidiaries criticised for their selling practices. The
damages it could claim have been quantified at Pounds 9.2m.
COMMENT
There is a lot of work to be done at Eurocopy. On the positive side, the
OFT's decision was, if anything, an endorsement of the current management.
However, efforts to shake off the group's tarnished corporate image and then
to generate momentum for growth are only just beginning at a time when
market conditions are not exactly favourable. Yesterday's drop in the share
price indicates that the response to any adverse news coming from the group
can still be jittery. Eurocopy's management, well aware of the enormity of
the task, has given a rather downbeat assessment of prospects over the next
year. With forecast pre-tax profits being revised sharply to about Pounds
4.5m, for earnings of 6.2p and a prospective multiple of 14, the shares do
not look particularly attractive yet, given the extent and probable lengthy
duration of the upward climb the group faces.

FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Wembley calls for Pounds 37m and gives
profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEMBLEY, the leisure group which owns the London stadium, yesterday
announced a 1-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 37.3m, which will be used
to reduce borrowings.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said the cash call would cut gearing to 66 per
cent. Gearing would have been nearly 150 per cent at the end of 1991, when
he said the group took a conservative view of its assets in preparation for
the rights issue.
He now aimed to dispose of non-core businesses to reduce gearing to 55 per
cent.
The fully underwritten issue of up to 136.9m new shares was priced at 30p
each. Wembley's shares closed down 3 1/2 p at 33 1/2 p.
Wembley forecast it would make a pre-tax loss of up to Pounds 8.5m in the
year to December 31 1991, compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.2m in
the previous year.
The loss was mainly due to exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 3.2m in
merging the group's US ticketing businesses and a writedown of Pounds 3.3m
on its investment in Leisure Resources Group.
There will be a loss per share of not more than 10p, compared with earnings
per share of 9.3p last time.
The directors forecast a final dividend of 0.9p (1.5p), giving a total for
the year of 1.8p against 2.4p.
The group said it had been badly affected by the Gulf war, which cut the
number of pop concerts at Wembley to three last year, compared with a normal
level of between eight and 12.
Delayed construction work at Wembley's exhibition hall also disrupted
business.
Wembley is to increase its stake in National Leisure Catering, a joint
venture with ARA, the private US food services group, from 50 per cent to 75
per cent.
The Pounds 3.25m consideration to ARA will be paid in the form of 6.8 per
cent of Wembley's enlarged share capital, which the US group has said it
regards as a strategic investment.
The UK leisure group is also issuing 18.6m new convertible preference shares
in exchange for all its outstanding convertible loan stock.
Sir Brian said he was confident that the Gulf-related difficulties of last
year would not recur, and Wembley would benefit from the reorganisation of
its US ticket business, the refurbishment of the group's bingo clubs and the
contribution from new exhibition halls.
The rights issue was underwritten by Schroders, with Smith New Court as
brokers.

FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kevin Maxwell to reveal source of legal
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN Maxwell has agreed to reveal, in confidence, the source of funds he
is using for his legal and living expenses.
Mr John Brisby, counsel for the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, told the High Court yesterday that Mr Maxwell had agreed to
disclose to them the names and addresses of 'persons and/or other entities'
who have funded him and whether the funding has been on the basis of 'gift,
loan or otherwise'.
The liquidators had sought a disclosure order against Mr Maxwell in
connection with their attempts to recover about Pounds 450m missing from
Maxwell pension funds.
An application by Mirror Group Newspapers for Mrs Elizabeth Maxwell, Mr
Robert Maxwell's widow, and Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell to be appointed to
represent the Maxwell estate was adjourned for 28 days.
Mr Martin Moore, for MGN, which is suing Mr Kevin, Mr Ian Maxwell and the
estate for Pounds 170m, said Mrs Maxwell had renounced her executorship and
did not wish to be appointed. Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell felt a conflict
might arise if they were appointed. They intended to renounce their
executorships.
During the adjournment there will be talks between MGN and Mr Peter
Phillips, the receiver of the estate, to try to agree representatives.
The Appeals Court will give its ruling on Wednesday in Mr Kevin Maxwell's
'right to silence' case. Provisional liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, a key Maxwell company, won a high court ruling in December
requiring him to give details of transfers out of Mirror Group Newspaper
pension funds.

FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Options dispute complicates sale of Israeli
newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, admin-istrator to Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies,
said yesterday that it was close to selling the companies' 84 per cent
holding in Ma'ariv Modi'in, the Israeli media group.
The sale of the business, which owns Ma'ariv, Israel's second biggest
newspaper, is likely to raise between Dollars 20m and Dollars 25m (Pounds
11m to Pounds 13.8m).
However, the disposal has been complicated by a dispute between Andersen and
the Tel Aviv law firm which represented Mr Maxwell in Israel. The dispute
was triggered by the discovery of a document giving details of a pledge
allegedly made by Mr Maxwell in the month before he died to grant options
covering 15 per cent of Ma'ariv's shares to three individuals, including Mr
Ya'acov Ne'eman, a partner in Herzog Fox Ne'eman, Mr Maxwell's Israeli legal
advisers.
According to the document, Mr Maxwell promised to grant the options -
together with an option of first refusal on other share sales - to Mr Aharon
Dovrat, Mr Maxwell's representative on the company board, Mr Dov Judkovsky,
the editor of Ma'ariv, and Mr Ya'acov Ne'eman.
Mr Dovrat and Mr Judkovsky, an existing 5 per cent shareholder, are partners
in one of four bids to purchase Ma'ariv. The options, if taken up, would
have given them an advantage over the three other bidders, led by Mr Conrad
Black's Hollinger Group, Mr Ya'acov Nimrodi, chairman of the Israel Land
Development Company, and a group of US Jewish investors.
Arthur Andersen had been concerned about the enforceability of the document
but said yesterday: 'The persons who could claim options under the document
have now withdrawn the claim.' So the auction of Ma'ariv can proceed.
'There was no question of these options being taken up because they were at
a much more expensive price than that now being mentioned for the company,'
said Mr Judkovsky.
The relationship between Mr Katz's team and Herzog Fox Ne'eman has been
under stress. The law firm, which is understood to be seeking payment of a
large sum in outstanding fees left unpaid by Mr Maxwell, is angry at what it
feels is the accusatory attitude of the administrator towards it.
An investigation by the administrator of the firm's files at its offices
over the past two weeks has led to bitter verbal and written exchanges
between the two sides.

FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec Sports launches Pounds 10.3m rights
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HI-TEC Sports, the designer and distributor of sports footwear, is launching
a one-for-five rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet and fund further
expansion.
The rights issue of 7.14m new ordinary shares is priced at 150p per share
and is aimed at raising Pounds 10.3m net of expenses.
The amount will go initially to reducing its debt burden of Pounds 20m at
the end of January, and gearing of 82 per cent.
Hi-Tec's shares yesterday closed down 3p at 179p.
This is the first time the group has come to the market to raise money since
its flotation in 1988.
The initial impact of the right issue would be to reduce borrowings to about
Pounds 10m and gearing to just under 30 per cent.
Eventually, the group plans, on the basis of its strengthened balance sheet,
to expand further in North America and Europe, two of its stronger markets
last year.
Mr Frank van Wezel, the group's chairman who controls just under 70 per cent
of the shares, and other family members who control another 5 per cent, are
not taking up any of their rights.
As a result of the issue, Mr van Wezel's stake will fall to 56 per cent
while the remaining family's will be reduced to about 4 per cent.
Hi-Tec also forecast a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year
to February 2 to Pounds 9m from a previous Pounds 8.2m.
Earnings per share are forecast to rise to 15.78p (14.75p) and the board
expects to recommend a final dividend of 3.85p (3.5p) on the enlarged share
capital in the absence of unforeseen circumstances. This brings the total to
5.5p (5p).

PRE-TAX losses at City Site Estates grew from Pounds 980,000 to Pounds 3.37m
over the year to September 30.
Mr William Syson, chairman, ascribed the losses in general to 'one of the
most difficult years the property market has faced in the last three
decades', and in particular to the Pounds 1.95m loss on the sale of the shop
and office development in London's Sloane Street and to the exceptional
Pounds 1.77m provision against the value of the Milton Keynes office
development.
The board has recommended reducing the final dividend to 0.5p (0.96p) for a
total of 1.46p (1.92p).
Rental income rose to Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 8.56m), but other costs,
principally from property disposals, totalled Pounds 406,000 (income Pounds
1.07m). Net interest took Pounds 9.12m (Pounds 9.13m) and, below the line,
losses per share emerged at 22.68p (7.93p). Net assets per share declined to
122p (227p) at the basic level and 174p (237p) fully diluted.

However, it declined to give details of how the recession on both sides of

Yet it is possible to work out where the worst results are likely to surface
when Lonrho publishes its 1991 annual report on February 26, containing the
divisional and geographical profit breakdowns:
Motor and equipment operations, predominantly based in the UK, were the
worst hit by the recession, said Mr Philip Tarsh, a director of Lonrho. VAG,
the import and distribution arm of Volkswagen and Audi Motor cars in the UK,
suffered from the 20 per cent fall in VAG car sales. Sales at Jack Barclay,
the Rolls-Royce and Bentley distributor, were down by 26 per cent;
Hotel operations within the leisure division had a difficult year, a fact
highlighted by the statement of Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive. He said:
'Across the world the Gulf war cut back both business and holiday travel and
our hotels suffered a severe drop in occupancy during the year.'
There has been speculation that Lonrho has been planning to sell some or all
of its hotels. Mr Mike Smith, analyst with Robert Fleming Securities, says:
'A sale of all the hotels would be viewed as an act of desperation. It would
be far better if the group sold off smaller businesses across the world.'
In manufacturing, textiles and local newspapers traded more strongly than
the engineering operations. Lonrho is understood to be planning the sale of
both the Glasgow Herald and the Evening Times, which belong to the group's
subsidiary Outram. The sale could fetch up to Pounds 200m, the group says;
Financial services, one of the few divisions to report a fall in pre-tax
profits in 1990, had another bad year. It includes the 49 per cent-owned
finance associate, VAG Finance, which arranges finance for vehicle sales in
the UK, a Lloyd's insurance broker and some property and investment
businesses, which were all affected by the recession;
Agriculture suffered from the fall in sugar, where last year the average
price on the open market in London fell from Dollars 335 a tonne to Dollars
239; Mining produced the best result. Although these operations are all in
Africa, which does not get top rating in the quality of earnings department,
Lonrho has stakes in two top-class mining businesses.
Western Platinum (73 per cent owned) is believed to be the world's
lowest-cost platinum producer. This position was strengthened by the 1990
merger with Impala's Karee platinum mine, which adjoins the Westplats
operations on the South African Bushveld near Rustenburg.
Westplats produced 625,000 troy ounces of platinum group metals last year
and is being expanded towards an annual 800,000 ounces. It has a life
expectancy of 100 years.
Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, in which Lonrho has a 45 per cent
shareholding and has the Ghana government as its partner, is also being
expanded - towards 1m ounces a year level by 1995-96. Last year gold output
increased by 42 per cent to 569,452 ounces.
Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg Securities,
estimates its operating costs are only Dollars 120 (Pounds 66.20) an ounce.
He estimates that these two mining operations have been contributing a
steady increase in attributable gross revenue: from Pounds 89m in the second
half of the 1989-90 financial year, to Pounds 99m in the first half of the
1990-91 year and to Pounds 115m in the second half.
Mr Worthington says this does not sit easily with Lonrho's statement that
the fall in precious metals prices accounted for nearly half the reduction
in its second-half profits.
Mr Rob Davies, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, says Lonrho's statement
is 'downright misleading' in this respect.
He points out that if the half-years to end-September are compared - while
gold's price eased back from Dollars 385 to Dollars 367 an ounce and the
platinum price was certainly in a slump and down from Dollars 491 an ounce
to Dollars 392 - rhodium, which accounts for perhaps half of Westplats'
production, rose strongly. It was up from Dollars 2,700 to Dollars 4,500 an
ounce.

FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Humphreys quits at Saatchi Advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Humphreys has resigned as chief executive of Saatchi and Saatchi
Advertising Worldwide (SSAW), the group's flagship international advertising
network, less than six months after he was promoted to the job as part of a
corporate reorganisation.
Mr Humphreys' departure is understood to have followed differences with Mr
Ed Wax, chairman of SSAW, and impatience on the part of Mr Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of the Saatchi group, with the speed of
cost-cutting at the financially-troubled network.
A spokesman said Mr Humphreys' departure was part of a group-wide attack on
costs intended to restore profitability following Saatchi's capital
restructuring last year.
Mr Wax has been named chief executive as well as chairman of SSAW.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Squeeze on costs that is threatening more providers
of training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Unfortunately, Lisa Wood's article ('Training shunted to the slow
track', January 21) on the dilemma faced by voluntary sector employment
training (ET) and youth training (YT) providers in England and Wales also
reflects the situation in Scotland. Although the voluntary sector here has
maintained around a third of total ET places, the perennial pressure to
reduce costs threatens to squeeze out more and more providers.
Our concern is that ET will contract to a narrower fast-track scheme for the
most able. It remains the task of voluntary bodies to prevent the Department
of Employment defaulting on its commitments to trainees with special needs.
Inevitably, this will entail more flexible arrangements for those whose
training costs more and takes longer.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Why employers should have first call on any surplus
in an occupational pension fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M H WHITLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Richard Clark's letter (January 17) leads me to comment that in the
usual 'final salary' pension scheme it is the accrued pension benefits that
are to be seen as deferred pay; not the fund which accumulates from the
investment of contributions.
Since the employees' contributions represent the first tranche of funding
and the employer's obligation is to make up to the funding level necessary
to meet those accrued benefits, the employer surely has the first call on
any surplus, albeit that employers also frequently improve benefits under
such circumstances.
I would also suggest that there is a place for both personal pensions and
company schemes, the main difference usually being that benefits from the
former are not related to salary (and hence living standards) at the time of
retirement. However, my main concern is that the arguments over pensions are
progressively becoming more biased by socio-political beliefs.
It needs to be emphasised that it is the security of pension funds that is
of paramount importance. Other issues are surely of secondary concern.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN DE COURCY LING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate about the future of Lloyd's need not be complicated. It is
not an institution comparable to the MCC. It is a commercial institution. It
exists to make money for its members. In recent years it has failed
lamentably. It has been more concerned with self-regulation than marketing.
As an external member for 25 years and a former member of the council, I
support Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director of the Octavian Group, in his
spearheading of a movement to get the present council to adopt the recent
proposal for a market committee.
The council at present contains a former Inland Revenue official, a retired
ambassador and a galaxy of lawyers and accountants. They are not
money-makers. Unless Lloyd's devotes its particular expertise to making
profits for its members, those members will desert it, just as shareholders
unload their holdings in an ailing company.
It would be tragic if the mandarins of the council continue to fiddle with
legislative documents while Lime Street burns. The proposed market committee
is a vital component of any strategy for growth at Lloyds.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr V A L POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his profile of David Rowland as chairman of the Lloyd's Task Force
Report (January 18), Richard Lapper stated that the weakness of the report
is that it does not tackle the problem of the crippling losses of those
Names affected by the disastrous business conditions of the late 1980s.
Let it be said from the outset that the Association of Lloyd's Members has
every sympathy with such Names and has given them practical assistance in
forming action groups.
The reality of the situation is that the only way to relieve Names of these
losses is for other Names to assume them, either indirectly by way of the
central fund or because Lloyd's directs that they should be reapportioned by
some process of mutualisation (this assumes we are not dealing with fraud as
in the case of PCW). This can only be done by obtaining the prior consent of
members without risking litigation on their behalf. In the current climate,
with most Names facing losses for the 1989 year of account, how forthcoming
would that consent be? A recent Mori poll revealed that 62 per cent of those
polled were likely to reject mutualisation to help fellow Names.
When dealing with the strengthening of the capital base, the Task Force
Report spells out the reasons why that could not be implemented
retrospectively to help Names in distress. It would represent a fundamental
change to the basis on which Names agreed to participate at Lloyd's and
would be open to legal challenge. Furthermore, if the scheme was to be
introduced retrospectively, those Names would also have to be given the
chance to resign and this might weaken the capital base more conclusively.

Sir, I run a modest but diversified agricultural estate, and for 1991 have

Could this burden of compliance be a record for a small business, whose

FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Missing the mark by trying for too many targets on
the civilised life of Quebec City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD B POTTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Daniel Green's travel article on Quebec City, 'On the very edge of
civilisation' (January 18), misses the mark by trying for too many targets.
If, as Green asserts, Quebec City is at the very edge of civilisation, he
fails to assess for us the civilised aspect - the gastronomie, theatre,
music and nightlife of this urban centre which has survived and flourished
for more than 350 years in the midst of anglophone North America. As for the
nearby hinterland, Green seems to view it by reference to the US. He speaks
of 'New England-style' houses, but certainly the older houses have a design
indigenous to Quebec.
He speaks of the south shore of the St Lawrence River as 'the American
shore', part of a 'civilised, settled, comfortable continent' (sic) and
implies that this is because 'the US is a few miles away'. The northern US
border as a centre of civilisation? It would come as a great surprise to
most observers that northern Maine is civilised, at least by comparison with
either Quebec City or with other parts of the north-eastern US.
And as for the furthest hinterland, Green missed his train by eight hours
for which he surmises his good fortune - au contraire, we may think it is
ours]
In an article replete with non sequiturs, perhaps the most curious is
Green's surprise that his hostess at Auberge Mange Grenouille has a
personality 'both French and American', surely a penetrating glimpse into
the obvious.

Sir, Once again the absurdities of the relationship of banks and building

What lawyer would advise his client to enter into a contract with another
party which enjoyed vastly greater economic power and retained the right
unilaterally to alter that contract, inevitably, in the latter's favour?
Surely the time has come for binding contracts and the advertising of

much of the suspicion with which most customers hold their banks. Some
measure of equality would be achieved.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Coal dust flies as door shuts: The recent dismissal of
Malcolm Edwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several days ago, Mr Malcolm Edwards, British Coal's top marketing man,
arrived in Hobart House, the company's headquarters behind Buckingham
Palace, to find his office door locked. He was then told not to come to work
any more, or to make any contact with the state coal company's customers.
It was a sad end to 36 years in the coal industry for the man who was once a
longshot tip for the chairmanship of British Coal. After a series of bitter
rows with Mr Neil Clarke, the current chairman, and a lengthy legal wrangle,
Mr Edwards had been sacked.
The matter, however, did not stop there. This week Mr Edwards's departure
was at the centre of a political storm concerning the whole future of
Britain's coal industry. An influential cross-party group of MPs, led by Dr
Michael Clark, the Conservative chairman of the energy committee, signed a
motion expressing horror at his ousting and calling for his reinstatement.
As British Coal proceeded on Tuesday to announce the loss of 1,105 jobs at
four pits in West Yorkshire, the conspiracy theorists had a field day. The
government, they said, had wanted Mr Edwards, an outspoken critic of its
plans for the company, out of the way to smooth the path for privatisation,
expected soon after the general election. The statement by Mr John Wakeham,
energy secretary, that Mr Edwards's dismissal was a matter for Mr Clarke,
whom he fully supported, did little to quell the speculation.
It is not surprising that Mr Edwards's departure arouses strong feelings. As
marketing chief for the old Coal Board since 1973, he had been an articulate
advocate of coal, in the energy market and in the political marketplace.
Had he stayed, Mr Edwards would have been in charge of negotiations with the
newly privatised electricity industry on the price and volume of the coal
supplies it will take when the generators' current contracts with British
Coal expire in March 1993 - and it is on the outcome of these talks that the
future shape of the industry depends.
Although no official explanation has been given for the falling out, it may
well have come to a head in disagreements about how to handle the
negotiations with the generators, National Power and PowerGen. Mr Edwards
has always taken a robust approach - lashing out at rival fuels, and lately
(to the apparent dismay of Mr Clarke and Mr Wakeham) lambasting the
electricity generators for their decision to invest in new gas-fired
stations in preference to coal. 'I fight because I believe markets are
made,' he says. 'You have to persuade the buyer not to get into a jam that
doesn't suit you.'
The government has insisted that it will not intervene in the electricity
contract negotiations, although many doubt this given the highly political
nature of decisions about the future of the coal industry and the regulation
of energy prices; only this month Mr Wakeham was dragged into a row between
British Gas and its regulator. Nor, the government claims, will it seek to
influence the generators' decision on what kind of power plant they build,
for example to ensure that coal or nuclear retains a share. Mr Edwards has
frequently pointed out that in spite of this free market philosophy, the
government subsidises the nuclear industry through a levy on electricity
consumers  - and that leaving the untested new market to decide which fuel
should be used in power stations could put the coal industry out of business
long term. 'If these decisions prove to be wrong, some will be quite
irreversible and others only reversible at great cost to electricity
consumers,' he says.
His views find an echo in Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary: 'We
think there's no point in formulating a coal industry based on sympathy for
mines. But we believe the coal industry is in the interest of the country,
we believe in husbanding the resources of the country.'
Against that background, it is easy to see how Mr Edwards's outspoken
approach could have embarrassed the government in the run-up to the
election. He would also have objected loudly to current moves by Mr Clarke -
with approval from Mr Wakeham - to negotiate a one-year contract with the
electricity generators; he has always argued that British Coal needs
long-term contracts for planning.
Mr Edwards was not against privatisation per se. 'I think he sincerely
wanted the company to be privatised,' says an old electricity industry
colleague. 'But he still believed the government could force the generators
to buy all their coal from British Coal - he couldn't accept the idea of the
company shrinking.' Not so, Mr Edwards says. As a marketing man he realised
that market share meant strength. And he has always been a vigorous advocate
of cost cutting and commercial rigour.
The latest round of cost-cutting was signalled on Tuesday. And with
privatisation looming, it seems to be going to the heart of British Coal's
empire. As the company is forced to shrink and possibly to join the private
sector, there are certain to be fierce political and industrial arguments.
Mr Clarke, inexperienced in the cut-throat world of nationalised industry
politics, appears to have decided that quiet diplomacy is better than the
Edwards megaphone.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Leading Article: The price of a Tory vote
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWEVER MUCH the government may dream of buying the election, there is no
case for a cut in the standard rate of income tax. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer, may be tempted to knock 1p off, reducing the
rate to 24p, when he presents his Budget on March 10, but he should remain
true to his characteristic sense of prudence.
Many will advise him to throw caution to the winds in order to save the
government's skin. It is thought by some Conservatives that a cut in
personal taxation would put Labour on the spot, since Mr Neil Kinnock is
pledged to reverse any reduction. If the Budget was quickly followed by an
election, voters would prefer to keep the money.
In practice a 1p cut would certainly be poor fiscal management and probably
bad politics. Consider, first, the Budget strategy. A penny off the basic
rate of tax here, an increase in the tax thresholds by more than the rate of
inflation there, and pretty soon one is talking serious fiscal profligacy.
Against that, Mr Lamont is publicly committed to the proposition that the
Budget should be balanced in the medium term over the cycle as a whole. The
chances that the Budget will be so balanced are already minimal. If the
government made inroads into the overall tax take in March it would become
non-existent.
In the Autumn Statement the Treasury suggested that the public sector
borrowing requirement would be 3 per cent of gross domestic product in
1992-93. Given the dismal statistics on the economy published since last
November - some of them released only this week - this is certainly an
underestimate.
Since general government expenditure was also set to grow at 3 per cent a
year in real terms between 1990-91 and 1994-95, the chancellor's forecast of
a medium term budget balance depends on the achievement of a sustained
period of above-trend growth. At the current sterling parity and real rates
of interest, that is about as likely as a Welsh victory in the five nations
rugby championship this year.
ERM constraints
Having junked one rationale for its fiscal policy, an imaginative government
could easily find another one. It could mutter about the constraint imposed
by the ERM and appeal to the widely-held view that an active fiscal policy
is a natural corollary of a fixed exchange rate. It could not do so without
embarrassment.
If he were persuaded to ride out the political assault, Mr Lamont would also
have to consider the economic context for such a looser fiscal policy. A
country with a substantial current account deficit in the midst of a deep
recession is not the ideal candidate for further incentives to consumption.
If fine-tune the government must, then lower taxes on business and
particularly on investment seem the better alternative. This would certainly
be a better choice than lowering income tax.
'Economic competence'
As to the politics of the matter, it is not at all clear that a cut would be
to the government's advantage. One of the Conservatives' most precious
electoral assets is the public perception that they are to be trusted with
the management of the economy. The Tories' 'economic competence' rating
scores consistently higher than Labour's. It has continued to do so even
through a period when there has been reason to question that competence. A
little light electoral bribery on March 10 might be met by a heavy barrage
of criticism. That could destroy the Conservatives' image as the better
economic managers.
There is also the evidence of the opinion polls. These indicate that there
is an overwhelming majority, spread across all parties and income groups,
that favours public expenditure over a cut in the standard rate. Politicians
tend to disregard such results on the grounds that what people say in
answers to questionnaires is different from what they do when they calculate
the effect on their own incomes. This is true, but the size of the
majorities against tax reductions suggests that there could be a residual
loss for the government if it went that route.
This is not to say that the government has to go naked into the electoral
arena. There is still time for it to refine a series of radical policies to
offer the voters. There is plenty in Labour's programme that can be
attacked, not least the unclarified starting level of higher rate taxation
and the vague assurances that the removal of the ceiling on national
insurance contributions may be phased in. Labour is vulnerable to the charge
that its many promises cannot be kept without either a higher rate of
economic growth than seems achievable under its proposals, or further
taxation. One or other side of its equation - the rebuilding of the
public-sector infrastructure or the means of financing it - must be unsound.
There is no need for a Tory tax bribe to reinforce that argument.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Industrial theatre: The threat of labour unrest in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The curtain goes up tomorrow in Germany on the last act of a brand-new
production of the Threepenny Opera. The international audience is more than
usually restive. So far, the piece has been entertaining because it has an
unusual cast and the words and music have been completely rewritten. All
except for the ending. And work starts on that tomorrow.
In the story so far, the grand chorus of 360,000 steelworkers has taken on
the combined might of the employers, government and economic establishment
in a battle over pay. In the three months since the action started, the
difference between the IG Metall union's claim and the steel industry's
offer has been whittled down to around 10 pfennigs  - 3p - an hour.
And there the music stopped. Union members start voting in a strike ballot
tomorrow. The outcome will be known at the end of the week. There will then
be a grand denouement, its length and content decided largely by which way
the 3p drops.
The steelworkers, normally walk-on players in the domestic pay round, have
assumed a status, as one of their union leaders put it recently, 'beyond
their economic importance'. Indeed, because they were first to the
negotiating table and first to the ballot box, the influence of their votes
could ultimately reach far beyond their own pocket books and the confines of
dusty Duisburg, heart of the Thyssen steel empire.
The whole of Germany, all its European neighbours, and other industrial
partners could be affected. At worst, recovery from recession in Britain,
France and the US could be slowed further. At best, German interest rates
might come down, others could follow, and flagging economies would be given
a boost.
Can one little union branch carry so much clout? Yes, because it has a
supporting cast of millions behind it. The scenario is straightforward. It
has been decided in Bonn and Frankfurt, home of the Bundesbank, that if in
current conditions the German economy is allowed to take another step up the
pay-price spiral - last year's 6.7 per cent average wage settlement against
annual inflation of 3.5 per cent was the first - the Bundesbank will leave
interest rates at their current high level, or even put them up.
Either way, hopes of recovery in Britain and elsewhere will be damaged. At
present, there is a consensus that if German pay deals are held below 6 per
cent this year, then Frankfurt's hardline guardians of monetary discipline
will respond at the end of the pay round by reducing key interest rates from
the peaks to which they were shunted just before Christmas. If not, early
cuts are unlikely, and a further increase cannot be ruled out.
Enter the steel workers. The 10 pfennig difference between the negotiators
translates to a final offer of around 5.5 per cent from employers, up
against a final demand from the unions for 6.5 per cent. It is the first,
and certainly not the last, stand-off in the current round, which continues
into the spring. The main body of IG Metall, numbering almost 4m engineers,
and 3m OTV public service union members are standing to one side with
demands for 9.5 per cent rises at the ready. Across the country, with the
exception of coal miners pleading for a rise to cover 'inflation at least',
unions have prepared claims averaging 10 per cent.
IG Metall's steel section, which was thrown into the fray with an initial
10.5 per cent claim, has so far refused to play the part of the sacrificial
lamb. Hard-line members say the employers are mistaken to believe they will
be easy meat, their morale weakened by the advancing wave of job cuts
brought on by the slump in steel markets. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of
Thyssen, meanwhile, has stated quite openly that he would rather face a
strike than pay more than 6 per cent.
The employers have cast the IG Metall steel section in the role of the
Trojan horse. They fear that if the steel workers are allowed to breach the
6 per cent barrier, the hordes will follow. The main IG Metall sections, one
of which has already posted a claim for 9.5 per cent in talks due to begin
in March, are unlikely to settle for less than their more lowly colleagues
in the steel mills of North Rhine Westphalia.
Government, industry and academics have warned repeatedly during the past
six months that over-generous pay settlements will cost businesses dearly in
lost competitiveness. The natural, inevitable result, they say, is that
union members will lose their jobs. But the Bundesbank will not lose its
nerve. It has coolly rebuffed all the many critics of its last turn of the
interest rates screw. The value of the D-Mark, it insists, and the stability
of the German economy are crucial to the well-being of the European Monetary
System and thus of the European Community. Even a recession, in the
Bundesbank's view, would be preferable to giving up its target of 2 per cent
inflation.
Inflation, long acknowledged in all walks of life in Germany as the devil
most to be feared, may be a worry for the Bundesbank, but curiously it is
not the main factor motivating the unions' large pay demands. It has been
more of an off-stage voice, its message ignored in the clamour. At 3.5 per
cent last year, and expected to rise to an average 4.5 per cent this, it has
been relatively high by German standards. But there are more powerful forces
at work.
It has been displaced in shopfloor demonology this year by a more striking
presence: a 7.5 per cent 'solidarity' levy on income tax. Imposed for 12
months last July 1 to help fund the costs of German unity, and rolled up
together with a package of increased duties on cigarettes, heating oil and
petrol, it had an immediate and dramatic effect. Growth in private
consumption of 4.5 per cent in the first half of the year dived to 1.2 per
cent in the third quarter, and ended the year at just 2.4 per cent.
It is still a leading topic in pub talk, and the opposition SPD party keeps
the arguments alive with constant claims that the levy should be retained.
Despite fresh assurances yesterday from Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister,
that it will be withdrawn on schedule at the end of June, the country's
workforce feels, and says forcefully, that it has been cheated. The tax levy
cancelled out last year's pay increases, and cheated working people out of
their share of the 'boom' profits earned by west German industry in 1991 as
it worked at capacity to match pent-up demand from the east of the country.
While popular resentment has hardened union attitudes, misjudgments made in
last year's post-unification euphoria have at the same time weakened the
employers' position. Government undermined industry negotiators by starting
the round of settlements with a 6 per cent rise for what the bulk of trade
union leaders say are 'unproductive' public servants. Companies wanting to
avoid missing out on the unification windfall, avoided disruption only by
paying out for an even more generous series of deals. This has led this year
to an uncomfortable scramble among unions striving to restore differentials
and the traditional pecking order.
The government also blundered last year when it announced plans to increase
value added tax to 15 per cent from 14 from the start of 1993. This measure,
which is currently blocked in the opposition-controlled Bundesrat, served
only further to fuel this year's pay demands. However, the differences over
pay and taxation policy between industry and government have been put to one
side for the moment.
The motor industry, for example, is busy laying contingency plans for
short-time working and lay-offs at its factories should the ballot lead to a
strike. Government itself is drafting its strategy for dealing with the
aggressive OTV public service union.
Financial market observers, meanwhile, are occupying themselves in trying to
cheer everyone up. They claim, almost to a man, that everything will turn
out fine in the end with 5.5 per cent all round. In the freezing Duisburg
fog yesterday morning, while 4,000 workers gathered to cheer their leaders,
their optimism seemed a little theatrical. One veteran of the last strike
outing in 1978, said, puffing out his cheeks: 'It's strike weather.'

FT  25 JAN 92 / Men in the News: Reluctant regulator and his guarded
successor - Sir David Walker and Andrew Large
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Running the Securities and Investments Board is not at the top of most
people's lists of the City's most desirable job. And that includes the
people who have done the job in the brief history of the UK's chief
investment watchdog.
The current chairman, Sir David Walker, made his position quite clear at the
outset, four years ago. 'I wasn't the first choice for this job, and I
wasn't a volunteer,' he told the Financial Times then. A former Treasury
high-flyer, his career had taken him to the Bank of England under Lord
Richardson in the mid-1970s, where he had risen to become an executive
director.
Then duty called. A tide of City complaints about the implementation of the
Financial Services Act - which gave birth to the SIB and the system of
regulation it heads - was threatening to engulf the new body. Something had
to be done, and Sir David was seen as the man to do it.
This week, on announcing his departure, his position had hardly budged. 'I
didn't want to retire a regulator,' he said.
The man who will take over from him on June 1, Mr Andrew Large, was more
guarded in his comments. Running the SIB would be 'an enormous challenge',
he said. Yet for Mr Large, a 49-year-old career investment banker, it is a
far cry from the time in the mid-1980s when he was in the forefront of City
opposition to much of what the SIB stood for. Through tough campaigning, he
is credited with having helped to shape a regulatory system which has proved
largely acceptable to international financial firms in London. The result:
he became the first chairman of the Securities Association, one of the four
self-regulating organisations (SROs) answerable to the SIB.
It also seems clear that Mr Large's was not the first name to spring to the
mind of the two men charged with finding a successor to Sir David - Mr Peter
Lilley, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor
of the Bank of England. They had known since September that Sir David wanted
to leave the SIB when his four-year term of office expires at the end of
May. Yet in November, Mr Large was parachuted in to take over the
chairmanship of the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) after an
investment scandal. He will now surrender that post.
It is not hard to see why filling the chairman's seat at the SIB is a tough
job. It is politically highly charged, not least because the regulatory
regime is often held responsible when private investors lose money as a
result of investment fraud or incompetence.
Appeasing critics in the City, whose instinctive antipathy to the Act had
been exacerbated by what they saw as an obtrusive approach taken by Sir
Kenneth Berrill, the SIB's first chairman, was equally exacting. Sir David's
first task - and one which is only just coming to completion - was to
attempt a simplification of the new investment rulebooks. The rewrite has
been widely welcomed, although ultimately doing little to shrink the
extensive and detailed regulations.
There are also the politics of the retail investment industry. Sir David, a
forthright, articulate man, has been irritated at the SIB by his inability
to act in as direct a way in dealing with industry disputes as he might have
wished. His natural manner, according to people who have worked with him, is
that of the Bank of England mandarin: bringing warring factions together,
cajoling them into reaching agreement, if necessary acting as middleman to
resolve disputes. It was a job at which he is said to have excelled while in
charge of the Bank's industrial division in the mid-1980s.
The SIB has never offered him the same freedom or power. Two years ago, he
caused a furore among SROs by hinting that greater powers should rest at the
centre. The ensuing row with the SROs led him to back away from
confrontation, and has resulted in a less direct approach since. Sir David
has made it clear that he is happy to leave these practitioner-led bodies to
get on with the job, provided they show they are up to the task.
Sir David's inability to deal with the investment industry in the same way
that the Bank of England deals with the UK's leading banks has also been a
source of frustration. 'He likes to fix things, and fix them himself,' says
one person who has worked with him.
Dealing with the UK's powerful life companies is the main job that remains
undone. The review of retail regulation that Sir David is close to
completing will not provide final answers to a web of interrelated problems:
how should the commissions paid on life assurance policies be disclosed? How
can a level playing field be created to accommodate both independent
financial firms and the direct salesman of life companies? Will life
companies join together to rescue Fimbra, the financially troubled SRO
responsible for independent financial advisers?
For Professor Jim Gower, the man whose review of investment protection,
begun in 1981, led to the FSA, the inability to resolve these issues remains
the biggest disappointment in the existing regulatory arrangements. They are
not intractable, he said this week - 'or rather, not completely
intractable'.
For Mr Large, the challenge will be particularly acute. His experience lies
entirely at the international wholesale end of the investment industry
rather than the domestic retail one. An investment banker who worked for
Orion Bank during the 1970s, he was one of five executives to defect to set
up a London investment banking arm for Swiss Bank Corporation in 1980. He
helped to build the operation into one of the most innovative and active in
the Eurobond and Euroequity markets - the free-wheeling international
financial markets which had been attracted to London in part by the absence
of regulation.
Mr Large is known for having a sharp mind and a no-nonsense, practical way
of dealing with problems - though long-term vision is not top of the list of
qualities mentioned by others. He was clear about what he could bring to the
SIB: a sense of what regulation means to the people who have to live with
it.
He will be better prepared for the other job that has been consuming much of
Sir David's time of late: shaping the regulation for London's wholesale
financial markets. This summer he will chair in London the annual meeting of
the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, the international
regulators' club. Senior members of the investment banking community regard
Mr Large as one of their own. Whether Mr Large can square the various sides
of the job, the domestic and the international, retail and wholesale, will
be the yardstick by which he will be judged.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Study faults unions on black staff

<TEXT>
THE FIRST investigation into the position of black workers in trade unions
has disclosed that unions lag behind best practice in the private sector and
local authorities Catherine Milton writes.
Ten unions, representing about 60 per cent of TUC membership, took part in
the study commissioned by the TUC and published yesterday.
Researchers say the unions' employment practices are unsatisfactory.
Monitoring of employees by ethnic background is limited and there is little
training for recruiters.
The GMB, TGWU and MSF general unions; Nupe and Nalgo public-service unions;
Usdaw, the shop workers union; NCU, the communications union; IRSF and
NUCPS, the Civil Service unions; and the FBU, the fire fighters' union, took
part.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Japan's premier apologises for wartime misdeeds

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday broke a long
taboo and became his country's first political leader to apologise in the
Diet for Japan's wartime past.
He apologised too for recent political scandals and pledged to 'clean up
politics as a top priority'.
The scandals threaten to overshadow the Diet session and to impede the
progress of legislation, including financial liberalisation measures and the
Budget bill - which would allow Japanese servicemen to serve overseas on
United Nations peace-keeping missions.
Mr Miyazawa's speech followed a visit to South Korea, where he repeatedly
apologised for misdeeds during colonial rule and the Second World War.
His unprecedented expressions of remorse come in the wake of public debate
about the war generated by the 50th anniversary last month of the attack on
Pearl Harbor.
Nevertheless, Mr Miyazawa's words fell far short of the explicit account of
Japanese atrocities which some Chinese, Koreans and other Asians, who
suffered at the hands of the Japanese military, have demanded.
The prime minister's minute-long reference to the war contrasts with the
widely-admired hour-long speech to the Bundestag by Mr Richard von
Weizsacker, the West German president, in 1985.
Mr Miyazawa referred indirectly to the trade concessions made to Mr Bush
during the US president's recent visit to Japan.
He said Japan had benefited greatly from American support after the Second
World War. Now that the US faced 'some problems of its own', it behoved
Japan 'to make every effort to co-operate'.
Speaking about the economy, Mr Miyazawa said the government's budget for the
year from April, together with recent interest rate cuts and other measures,
would contribute to inflation-free sustained growth. Emiko Terazono adds:
The Japanese government, pushing for changes in Japan's financial system,
will submit a series of bills to the Diet next month.
They include measures to prevent the recurrence of political and stock
market scandals, and the reform of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange
Law - Japan's version of the US Glass Steagall Law which separates the
banking and securities industries.
The bills would set up a securities and banking supervisory commission;
establish capital adequacy standards for brokers; and increase fines for
breaking the Securities and Exchange Law.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Ethiopian leader pledges market economy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Meles Zenawi, transitional president of Ethiopia, said yesterday his
government would sign an agreement with the World Bank next week which would
release Dollars 650m of emergency assistance to rebuild the impoverished
country emerging from 30 years of civil war.
Mr Meles also disclosed, in an interview in Addis Ababa, that the liberal
economic policy published recently by his transitional coalition government
would become a part of his party's election manifesto. This is the the first
statement by the 37-year-old president which specifically abandons the
socialist economic polices of the once Marxist Ethiopia People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and commits it to a basically liberal
economic agenda.
The president also said Ethiopia's first free democratic regional elections
would be held no later than March.
Nearly eight months after his ragtag rebel army stormed the capital and
seized power, Mr Meles said his government had already prepared sweeping
revisions of the investment and labour codes, transport policy and was
studying how to liberalise trade, restructure the financial system and
dismantle state-owned industries.
'We are newcomers to this. How can people expect us to go ahead and correct
everything in a few months?'
The president said a government delegation would sign its first agreement
with the World Bank in Washington next week for an Emergency Recovery and
Reconstruction Programme which, with other donors, will be worth Dollars
650m until national elections in January 1994. The government, he said, was
already prepared for the next round of talks in February on what would
become Ethiopia's first structural adjustment programme. On the thorny issue
of devaluation Mr Meles said: 'It is no longer an issue of principle but one
of timing.'
In a surprising statement which suggests how far the ideological rethinking
of the EPRDF has gone the president said: 'We are fully committed to the
transitional economic programme not only for the transitional period but
also after it - which means if the EPRDF wins the national elections its
economic programme will be the same.'
The government's economic programme, so far a statement of intent, pledges
to roll back state control and give greater opportunities to private local
and foreign investors to own and participate in the economy. The only policy
not open to debate, he said, was public ownership of land.
The president admitted that the political thrust of decentralising power to
ethnically defined regions was fraught with 'dangers and irrational
fall-outs'. But he said he believed an equilibrium would be found and that
Ethiopia could 'be united only under one condition - if the people desire.
Any other attempt is a recipe for civil war.'
Mr Meles said the most surprising thing he had experienced since taking
power was the obstruction of the old bureaucracy.
'It was very easy to trust people in the bush, even with your life. Here it
is very difficult to trust anybody.'
Dressed in a double breasted pinstripe suit and smoking heavily, Mr Meles
appeared as a thoughtful, softly spoken man still struggling to come to
terms with dealing with the complex dynamics of a modern economy and the
problems of applying a set of principles developed in the bush into a
pragmatic mode of governing.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Marcos launches flamboyant campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Imelda Marcos yesterday launched her presidential election campaign in
shamelessly flamboyant style, saying she would grant amnesty to rebel
soldiers who had tried to overthrow President Corazon Aquino in coup
attempts.
The former first lady made the promise after imprisoned troops interrupted
her first sizeable campaign rally by shouting their support from the roof of
a military stockade.
Demonstrating the political awareness of her late husband, President
Ferdinand Marcos, Mrs Marcos jumped from her limousine to wave to the 30
soldiers clamouring from the prison roof.
'I would like to give an amnesty to the soldiers, insurrectionists,
radicals, communists and secessionists,' said the 63-year-old campaigner,
rounding-up the usual suspects who are blamed for the country's lack of
unity.
Mrs Marcos displayed composure as she was jostled by enthusiastic crowds and
hammed-up emotion as she promised that the country could once again be
great.
She was greeted with enthusiasm when she told the crowd outside army
headquarters that she doubted their lives had improved since she and her
husband fled into exile six years before.
Foreign observers have tended to write off Mrs Marcos's chances of winning
the May 11 elections, viewing her as a phenomenon of the past, who is still
accused of looting her country.
But the attraction of an enduring and colourful personality, especially when
pitted against lacklustre government candidates who have overseen a dismal
economic performance, may still make Mrs Marcos a contender.
The ruling party is most concerned that Mrs Marcos might combine forces with
another political escape artist from the Marcos era: the notorious business
man Eduardo Cojuangco.
They are likely to know who they are competing against after a rally today
to be led by Mrs Aquino. After considerable procrastination, Mrs Aquino is
due to anoint her chosen candidate.
While Mr Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, has already
won the approval of the majority of ruling LDP delegates at a party
convention, Mrs Aquino has been reluctant to endorse him. Instead, she
appears to favour General Fidel Ramos, her former defence secretary, even
though such a choice might split her party.
Mr Mitra and Gen Ramos stand on similar policy platforms, favouring further
economic liberalisation. What Mr Mitra lacks in popularity, compared to Gen
Ramos, he more than makes up for in political machinery.
However, despite promising for a year that she will endorse a candidate
today, there is still a chance that Mrs Aquino will not.
Mr Cojuangco, widely remembered as controller of the important coconut
industry, adopts a vocabulary that also suggests he is in favour of an open
and free market. However, the business community is aware that he built his
considerable wealth as a monopoly capitalist.

TWO gang members said police in the Zulu homeland recruited, trained and
armed them to carry out attacks on African National Congress supporters, it
was reported yesterday, AP writes from Johannesburg.
The report in the anti-government Weekly Mail said the men, identified only
as Lucas and Themba, were trained at a base used by the Zulu nationalist
Inkatha Freedom Party, the main rival of the African National Congress.
The ANC has long alleged that security forces, in an effort to destabilise
the black opposition movement, helped Inkatha in clashes between supporters
of the two groups.
Fighting between the ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black movements, has
claimed thousands of lives in recent years.
In previous reports, the Weekly Mail disclosed secret government payments to
Inkatha that led to the demotion of two cabinet members and a promise from
President FW de Klerk to halt covert funding of political parties.
Subsequent reports on the scandal have included allegations that government
funding of Inkatha has continued and that Inkatha supporters received
military training.
A government-appointed judicial commission said last week it would
investigate the allegations.

<TEXT>
BASEBALL being as American as apple pie, it came as little surprise
yesterday when US authorities gave a Japanese bid to buy a controlling
interest in the Seattle Mariners baseball team a polite but firm brush-off.
Mr Fay Vincent, the all-powerful commissioner of baseball, said Americans
should be flattered by the interest shown by a group of investors led by
Nintendo, the world's largest video game company. But in its present form,
the bid was unlikely to gain approval, he said.
The Japanese offer of Dollars 100m for 60 per cent of Seattle Mariners, one
of the less glamorous teams in baseball, has come at a delicate moment in
US-Japan relations. President Bush's disastrous trip to Tokyo this month has
magnified American fears about Japan's industrial and financial muscle.
Mr Vincent said the issue of foreign ownership had already been settled,
with baseball team owners expressing a strong preference in favour of local
ownership. 'We're presented with a very difficult and complicated set of
problems,' he said.
Any sale would have to be approved by a majority of major league team owners
who were due to hold a telephone conference late yesterday. The Japanese
consortium bid was supported by some of the best known business and
political names in Seattle, and the current team has threatened to move out
of town unless a deal is struck.
Even though Japan-US tensions are running high, the Yamauchi family,
founders of Nintendo, hope to avoid attack in the US by emphasising their
offer comes in response to an appeal for help from Seattle politicians. Mr
Booth Gardner, the local state governor, and other leaders appealed to
Nintendo in order to stop Mr Jeff Smulyan, a West Coast businessman and the
Mariners' owner, selling the team to another city.
Japanese buyers have been criticised in the past in the US for acquiring
landmarks of American culture including Columbia Pictures and control of the
Rockefeller Centre in Manhattan.
Nevertheless, the appeal from Seattle sets the Mariners deal apart from
other Japanese investments. Mr Smulyan, a radio station owner and baseball
fan who bought the Mariners in 1989, is being forced to sell the team to
clear debts.
Other cities are trying to buy the Mariners' franchise but the team's lease
on their stadium required them to first try a local buyer. When none
emerged, people in Seattle began to grow restless. With a deadline of March
27 for an offer fast approaching, Mr Gardner, the governor of Washington
state, wrote to Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, the president of Nintendo, which has
its US headquarters in Seattle and is one of the larger local employers.
The Yamauchis put together a consortium in which they took a 60 per cent
stake and the rest was divided among Seattle businessmen. The consortium has
offered to pay Dollars 100m to Mr Smulyan and invest a further Dollars 25m
in the club.
Mr Yamauchi said yesterday that he was responding to an appeal. He had no
interest in baseball, only in helping the citizens of Seattle, he said. He
added he was acting in a personal capacity not on behalf of Nintendo which
would have nothing to do with the club. 'I have no intention of doing
something which would hurt national feelings.'

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yegor Gaidar, the embattled Russian deputy prime minister in charge of
economic reform, yesterday laid before parliament a 'tough and conservative'
budget in a desperate attempt to cut the country's huge deficit to a
Rbs11.5bn (about Pounds 55m at the present Central Bank rate) in the first
quarter of this year, and stabilise the rouble.
Last year, the Russian budget deficit was reported to stand at Rbs108.4bn.
The legislators reluctantly passed the budget, which would slash spending on
defence and construction, though the head of their budget committee, Mr
Alexander Pochinok, warned that hyperinflation was less of a danger than the
social explosion which it would be likely to trigger.
The warning was reinforced by Mr Fyodor Prokopov, chairman of the
parliamentary employment committee, who said unemployment would rise from a
present official level of 60,000 to 6m over the next 18 months.
At the same time, an analysis prepared for President Boris Yeltsin by a
research group, RF-Politics, says that former and present officials are
opposing reforms and are set to overturn them; that underground Communist
party committees are exercising control over regional governments and many
newspapers; and that a wave of strikes organised by the former Communist
trade unions could paralyse the country from next month.
Mr Gaidar said: 'Every measure to cut the budget deficit would be
justified.' He expected the new 28 per cent value added tax to raise
Rbs140bn, and the profit tax of 32 per cent to raise Rbs67bn.
But the government is under intense pressure from Russian and foreign
businesses to cut tax rates. Many are expected to under-report profits and
sales, and those which earn hard currency are demanding payment to foreign
bank accounts to avoid tax, despite the illegality of such a move.

according to the organisation's secretary-general Mr Jean Claude Paye,
Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City
Mr Paye did not specify when Mexico would be admitted, but reports suggest
the country's membership should be approved next year. New Zealand was the
last country to join the OECD, in 1973.

FT  25 JAN 92 / More than 2m E German restitution claims filed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE than 2m claims for the restitution of property expropriated by the
former Communist regime in east Germany have been filed, and it could take
10 years for the majority to be settled.
That is the daunting conclusion of the Federal Property Office set up in
Berlin to deal with the flood of claims, mostly from former residents of
East Germany who have settled in the west.
Disputes over property ownership have been the biggest single factor
delaying new investment in the east, in spite of efforts to limit the right
of former owners to demand the physical restitution of their property.
The latest figures were issued by Mr Horst-Dieter Kittke, deputy president
of the office, who based the estimate of 2m on a total of 1.1m legal
notifications received since German unification in 1990.
He said only 67,000 cases had been settled so far , and many of those were
still being challenged by counter-claims.
The claims concern all forms of property, ranging from enterprises to
buildings, land, and purely monetary claims.
The scale of the problem was a big reason behind the proposal made two weeks
ago by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, for a drastic
acceleration in the processing of property claims. He proposed former owners
should have a maximum of two weeks for a hearing. He also wants to amend the
property law so that once an investor has been given the green light, a
former owner can only demand financial compensation.
One delaying factor preventing resolution of claims is that the Treuhand
agency, responsible for the privatisation process in the whole former East
Germany, has filed objections to most demands for physical restitution of
property. The reason is that the agency faces crippling claims for
compensation for any damage to the property if it is returned to its former
owner.
However most property claims are aimed at getting financial compensation,
rather than outright restitution, according to officials involved in the
processing. In those cases, the former owners are waiting for the passing of
a new compensation law to see how they would be better off: from financial
compensation or restitution.
Nearly 400,000 east Germans lost their jobs last December in former state
companies controlled by the Treuhand agency, the largest number in any month
since the collapse of the communist regime in autumn 1989, Leslie Colitt
writes from Berlin.
But the jobless rate - 11.8 per cent last November - is expected to rise
much less sharply because many of those released from short-time work were
cushioned from unemployment by state-subsidised job creation and retraining
programmes.
Mr Alexander Koch, a member of the Treuhand Executive Board, said the worst
loss of jobs in east Germany was over. He expected no big wave of dismissals
this year, though unemployment would remain high until the third quarter.
The privatisation agency, which when founded in early 1990 had 4m employees
in its companies, now has only 1.65m. Nearly 1m jobs were guaranteed by
private investors who bought more than 5,000 companies.

MACEDONIA yesterday rejected Serbia's initiative to revamp Yugoslavia and
vowed to forge ahead with its drive for independence.
Mr Nikola Kljusev, the prime minister of Macedonia, one of the Yugoslav
republics, yesterday said: 'We do not wish to begin political talks with
other republics about creating a new Yugoslavia.'
But he added that Macedonia has already held talks on economic co-operation
with Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Croatia and Slovenia have already won European Community recognition as
independent states. Macedonia and Bosnia, the central republic, have asked
for similar recognition but so far have been recognised only by Bulgaria.
The parliament of Bosnia yesterday was expected to debate a referendum on
independence.
Meanwhile Mr Marak Goulding, United Nations undersecretary, is expected to
arrive in Belgrade tomorrow to meet UN liaison officers. The 50-member
advance team last week was deployed in crisis zones to set up communication
links between federal and Croat forces in order to shore up the UN-brokered
ceasefire.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Future of couture comes under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE hotels of Paris - those with five stars, at least - are filling up.
Socialites and celebrities are again flooding into the city for its haute
couture collections.
The 21 French fashion houses showing their collections over the next five
days desperately need a successful season. For years they have accepted that
they would lose money on couture - where one evening dress sells for
anything up to Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 16,600) - but continue to bankroll it
because of the publicity it attracts for the scents and sunglasses that
really make money.
Even so, the fashion houses are now under intense financial pressure after
two years of recession, so much so that the French government has
commissioned a formal review of the future for haute couture.
High fashion at this level has long been seen as an anachronism: the rules
on who can or cannot call themselves a couturier were laid down in 1947 and
owe more to the austerity of post-war Paris than to the exigencies of a
modern European economy.
The rules cover everything from how many people a fashion house must employ
to how many garments it must show. Add to the bill the hiring of supermodels
 -at anything up to Dollars 20,000 each a show - to make sure the paparazzi
arrive and take lots of pictures, and the overheads soar.
Haute couture is so costly (many hours alone are spent in personal fittings)
that only very few can afford to buy it. After enjoying a brief revival in
the bullish 1980s when women with surnames like Trump and Gutfreund flaunted
their husbands' profits in Paris, the market declined. And last winter's
collections were a disaster: models, and clients, were too frightened to fly
from New York to Paris because of the Gulf war.
Yves St Laurent saw its couture sales fall sharply, after having already
slipped to FFr39m (Pounds 4m) in 1990 from FFr44m in 1989. The whole market
in 1991 declined by 15 per cent to FFr282m, according to the Chambre
Syndicale de Couture Parisienne, which presides over the shows.
Yet the Paris houses still plough in money because of the publicity. It can
be no coincidence that the mainstream investors who moved into fashion in
the 1980s (LVMH with Christian Dior and Christian Lacroix and Orcofi with
Lanvin) have not only increased the investment in couture but have
encouraged their designers to become more and more flamboyant.
Some critics claim that the collections are now just a publicity stunt and
the clothes are designed not to be sold but to generate press coverage.
'Self parody' crops up again and again in the reviews.
Stunts notwithstanding, the fashion houses are stuck with couture. Balmain's
announcement last year that was withdrawing from the scene caused such an
uproar among its Japanese licensees that it was forced to backtrack.
Somehow, the French government has to find a way of hauling high fashion
into the 1990s without tarnishing its traditions.
The report that will land on the desk of industry minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn in March is expected to recommend modest changes to the 1947
rules so that the ritual of the collections stays more or less the same.
But the business of haute couture will be at least a little less expensive.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Japan plans Soviet food loans: Republics would get Dollars
500m to buy goods from east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is considering a plan to offer Dollars 500m (Pounds 276m) of
no-interest loans to former Soviet republics to buy food and other goods
from eastern Europe, according to western officials in Washington.
The idea of promoting 'triangular trade' between the emerging democracies in
eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States using third-party
finance was discussed during the two-day international aid conference in
Washington this week.
The aim is not to recreate wholesale the old trading patterns between a
communist Soviet Union and its Soviet bloc satellites, but rather to single
out specific goods such as grain and feedstuff which could be sold to help
hard-pressed republics and bolster economies of eastern Europe.
Despite some apparent Russian disquiet at getting aid from eastern Europe
rather than directly from the west, the European Commission yesterday
reiterated its intention of pursuing triangular operations. The Commission
said it hoped to use up to Ecu750m (Pounds 535m) in EC food credit in this
way.
The Commission stressed yesterday the need for speedy action to give
substance to the aid plans agreed by the Washington conference.
It emphasised the importance of next week's Minsk meeting with CIS republics
in tailoring the Washington plans to what the republics perceived as their
most urgent needs. In contrast to this week's opening conference, the CIS
republics will be invited to the follow-up conference to be hosted in Lisbon
in May by the EC's Portuguese presidency, Commission officials said.
A senior US official said yesterday the Washington conference had proven
successful in 'breaking the inertia' which threatened to take hold of
western aid efforts at the end of 1991.
Officials in Moscow yesterday welcomed the western aid effort but voiced
doubts about whether the right goods were being sent in the right way to
tackle the crisis.
Mr Alexander Zhitnikov, deputy head of Russia's Commission for Co-ordinating
Humanitarian Aid, questioned plans for a Dollars 61m US airlift of food and
medicines.
'Of course we need aid urgently and of course we are very thankful,' he
said. 'But the main thing is to begin the process straight away and to use
other means of transportation as much as possible.'
The Japanese offer of Dollars 500m in concessionary loans stems from a
Dollars 2.6bn credit package put forward last October after the failed
putsch in Moscow. One technical problem is that untied Japanese loans to one
country must be made available to the rest of the world. 'We have not made a
final decision on how to use this money, but we are trying to find ways
round this provision,' a Japanese official said.
During the conference, several countries pledged fresh financial support for
the former Soviet Union. Oman announced it would commit Dollars 200m for
energy exploration. Thailand offered Dollars 450m in loans for republics to
buy rice and other commodities, with Korea putting up Dollars 800m to do the
same.
Argentina said it was willing to absorb 100,000 Russian immigrants. Saudi
Arab and other Gulf states agreed to unfreeze more than Dollars 1bn in aid
held up after the August coup.
President George Bush also said he would seek congressional approval for
Dollars 645m in new humanitarian aid to the republics.
The US administration is drawing up plans to recruit up to 2,000 Soviet
nuclear scientists to thwart efforts by Libya and Iran to hire their
expertise.
The funds would be drawn from Dollars 400m which Congress approved last year
for dismantling the Soviet nuclear arsenal, a senior US official said. The
plan could be announced in Mr Bush's State of the Union address next week.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Israel tries to placate US over loan guarantees

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel, anxiuosly awaiting word on its request for dollars 10bn (pounds
5.5bn) in US loan guarantees, has told Washington it is committed to
US-backed Middle East peace efforts, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, sent a letter to Mr James Baker, the
US secretary of state two days ago pledging to forge ahead with peace talks
despite the possibility of an early general election, a Shamir aide said
yesterday.
The letter did not mention the loan guarantees which Israel fears Mr Baker
will link for the first time to a curb on Jewish settlement of occupied Arab
land. Israel needs the guarantees to help raise an estimated dollars 20bn in
foreign loans over the next five years to settle an influx of Jews from the
former Soviet Union.
The figure is contained in a report which Mr Zalman Shoval, the Israeli
ambassador, was due to give Mr Baker yesterday. Their meeting, however, has
been put off until today when the US is expected to respond formally to the
Israeli request.
'We believe that we have progressed at a respectable pace,' Mr Shamir wrote
of the three rounds of Arab-Israeli talks since October.
Mr Shamir, who torpedoed Mr Baker's first attempt to convene peace talks two
years ago, has since tried to cast himself as peace-maker, partly to placate
Washington which used the loan guarantees to prod him to the negotiating
table.
Washington is expected to give less than the full amount and insist that the
money is not used directly or indirectly to increase the 100,000 Jews
already living in guarded settlements amid 1.75m Palestinians in the
territories Israel captured in 1967.

long-term rates rise

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER a hesitant opening, US share prices turned decisively lower yesterday
in the wake of higher long-term interest rates and some poor fourth-quarter
earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.07 at 3,226.74.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's also ended lower, down 3.18 at
414.96. In contrast, away from the Big Board, the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks, which has endured heavy selling recently, continued
to attract buyers and finished 2.18 higher at 622.86. NYSE turnover was 230m
shares.
Among individual stocks the release of quarterly earnings continued to
dominate sentiment. Delta Airlines fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 on
news of its operating loss of Dollars 237m in the last three months of 1991,
while USAir gave up early gains and ended Dollars  1/2 easier at Dollars 15
7/8 in the wake of modest but unexpected profit for the fourth quarter.
Elsewhere in the sector, AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 72 5/8 and UAL eased Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 148 1/2 .
Airline stocks were also affected by the news that Salomon Brothers had
issued a sell recommendation on the entire sector on Monday.
AT&amp;T fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 5/8 after the telecommunications group
announced fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 635m, down from the previous
year but reduced by a Dollars 218m charge to cover the write-down of the
company's investment in an Italian group.
Morrison-Knudsen climbed Dollars 1 3/8 early on but fell away in late
trading to end up just Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 53 1/8 . A local authority in
Los Angeles voted to cancel a Dollars 121m subway car contract with Sumitomo
group of Japan in order to give US firms a better chance. Morrison is tipped
as one of the favourites to win the contract.
Centel soared Dollars 9 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 on the news that it had hired
some investment banks to pursue the possible sale of the company.
Unisys put in one of the best performances of the day amid heavy trading.
The stock jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 7 in volume of 9.6m shares after
the computer manufacturer announced a big improvement in 1991 fourth-quarter
earnings, which recovered from a loss at the same stage of 1990 to post a 31
cents a share profit.
Investors were also buoyed by reports from the company that US orders were
up sharply in the quarter. Monsanto fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 1/8
after the chemicals group announced it would give its 12,000 employees a
Dollars 1,000 contribution each toward the cost of buying or leasing a new
US-made car.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed lower in heavy trading, as gold stocks turned
sharply downward. According to preliminary figures, the composite index fell
14.26 points, or 0.39 per cent, to close at 3,624.53. Declining issues
outnumbered advances 334 to 301.
American Barrick fell 1 3/8 to 32 3/8 to lead gold's decline after spot gold
in New York fell USDollars 3 to USDollars 354.75 an ounce.
Shell Canada jumped 1 1/4 to 40 1/4 . The company reported fourth-quarter
earnings from continuing operations of CDollars 85m or 76 cents a share,
down from CDollars 146m or CDollars 1.31 a year earlier.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar steady ahead of G7
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar remained the focus of a tense day on the foreign exchange
markets, maintaining a tight range against both the yen and the D-Mark ahead
of this weekend's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the
Group of Seven countries, writes Simon London.
Although rumours of possible central bank intervention on Wednesday failed
to materialise, dealers were unwilling to test the US and Japanese
authorities determination to cap the value of the dollar. However, there
were few natural sellers of the US currency, leading to an uneasy stalemate.
The dollar was confined to a very tight range overnight in the Far East. The
US unit closed at Y123.23 and DM1.5900 in Tokyo, from Y123.35 and DM1.8595
in New York.
The Y123 resistence was tested several times but the yen was unable to break
through. Many analysts are still expecting an appreciation of the Japanese
currency to Y120 before the end of this month. There is speculation that the
G7 meeting will back a stronger yen as a means of capping the large Japanese
trade surplus.
In European trading the restricted pattern continued with US currency rising
against the D-Mark but remaining within its established range, reaching
DM1.5942 early in London before softening. The US currency closed in London
at DM1.5950 from DM1.5875 on Wednesday; Y123.85 from Y123.20; and Pounds
1.7960 from Pounds 1.8070.
However, shortly after the London market had closed the dollar rallied
sharply, breaking through DM1.60. Stop-loss trading orders were triggered
and the US currency briefly touched DM1.6155 and Y124.45 before falling
back.
Dealers were unwilling to ascribe significance to the short-lived rally.
There were reports that an order to buy dollars against the Swiss franc
started the move in thin US trading.
With the dollar subdued, attention also focussed on the yen/D-Mark cross
exchange rate. The German currency closed at Y77.68 in Tokyo, having tested
resistence at Y77.00 but proved resilient. During European trading the
D-Mark rose to Y77.80 until the late rally of the dollar in New York pushed
it back down to Y77.35.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling gained most against
the D-Mark during the morning session, rising to a high of DM2.8750.
Analysts said that the rise was backed by expectations of tax cuts to
stimulate the UK economy when 1991 budget measures are announced on March
10.
However, trading in sterling remains driven by political factors, including
the weekly round of opinion polls published in Sunday newspapers. Dealers
commented that they were wary of holding long sterling positions over the
weekend. By the close the UK currency had fallen back to DM2.8650, from
DM2.8675 on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
European money market rates were steady yesterday, with central banks across
the Continent maintaining current interest rates ahead of this weekend's
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven
countries, writes Simon London.
The Bank of Spain held its intervention rate unchanged at 12.65 per cent at
its regular money market operations, injecting Pta 1,540bn.
Some analysts had speculated that the rate might be shaved to ease the
pressures on sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism. However,
sterling was trading comfortably above its maximum permitted divergence
against the peseta this week, and the Spanish authorities maintained a tight
policy stance.
In Germany the Bundesbank council left credit policy unchanged at its
regular bi-weekly meeting. Call money rates were also unchanged at 9.40/50
per cent. Analysts commented that lower than expected reserve requirements
for January, at DM77.6bn, contributed to the stable tone of the market.
The Bank of France also maintained its intervention rate, at 9.6 per cent.
The Bank injected FFr45bn at this rate, a net increase of FFr16.2bn over
expiring funds.
In London the Bank of England forecast another substantial liquidity
shortage - Pounds 1.2bn later revised to Pounds 1.15bn. Overnight unsecured
money rates rose to 14-13 1/2 per cent by midday, from 11-10 3/4 per cent on
Wednesday.
In early assistance, the Bank bought Pounds 379m paper for resale to the
market on February 10 at 10 7/16 per cent, the same repurchase terms as on
Wednesday. In late morning a further Pounds 99m was injected, through the
outright purchase of band 1 band and treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent and a
further Pounds 75m repurchase paper.
Early afternoon assistance was more substantial, with the authorities able
to inject Pounds 685m band 1 and band 2 bills, again at 10 3/8 per cent.
This was enough to ease liquidity conditions and overnight rates subsided to
11-10 per cent by mid-afternoon.
Overnight money closed at 11 1/2 -11 per cent; one-month interbank funds
closed at 10 13/16 - per cent; three-month interbank funds at 10- 9/16 per
cent.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange closed little changed at 89.76.

dominance

<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA'S cut in oil output this week as a prop for crude prices is as
much a signal of its intention to remain dominant within the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries as it is a concession to its Opec fellows.
It also reflects Saudi Arabia's emergence from the costly Gulf war in a
straitened economic condition - and politically tougher.
Although trimming 100,000 barrels a day from output of 8.5m b/d entered the
communautaire spirit of voluntary cuts by six other Opec members, Saudi
Arabia announced its reduction only after others volunteered theirs.
The kingdom recognises cuts are necessary with crude prices faltering, and
that more must be agreed at the next Opec summit on February 12. But it is
determined not to bear the brunt of such cuts. Saudi Arabia's days of being
Opec's swing producer are over, officials insist.
Once Venezuela, Libya, Nigeria, Iran, Qatar and Algeria announced their
reductions - later followed by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - Saudi
Arabia felt that this showed a willingness among Opec's historically
fractious members to share the burden of any further reductions.
The Saudi budget will not bear a return to the wide swings in oil output in
earlier years. Faced with war-related costs of Dollars 60bn, a prospective
budget deficit this year of Dollars 8bn, plans under way to upgrade its oil
industry both upstream and down at a cost of Dollars 34bn over the next 10
years and continuing heavy defence spending, the kingdom has no choice but
to maximise revenues.
Economically, it has been forced into putting its own interest first - in a
more emphatic way than at any time since the first oil price explosion in
1973. Politically, Saudi Arabia's emergence unscathed from the Gulf war has
spawned a more assertive foreign policy and a determination not to cede
ground to regional rivals, such as Iran.
The Saudi delegation in Geneva will therefore insist that all further Opec
cuts should be made on a pro-rata basis and related directly to production
capacity. This will safeguard the kingdom's augmented share of Opec output
since the Gulf war - which rose to 36 per cent from 24 per cent after the
kingdom filled 60 per cent of the hole left by lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti
production.
Saudi officials insist they will brook no alternative to this, or some
formula very like it, in Geneva.
However, Kuwait will also demand exemption from any Opec cuts and Iraq, once
it feels the terms are right, is equally determined to re-enter the market.
Iran, ever one of Opec's price hawks and one of Saudi Arabia's fiercest
critics, would prefer higher prices on lower output and has its own
ambitious development and foreign policy plans, most recently including the
newly independent Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union.
Saudi Arabia's ability to get its own way in Geneva will therefore be an
early test of what government officials profess to be new-found muscle. But
when Kuwait and Iraq both re-enter the market and add a powerful depressant
to oil prices, the kingdom will face some much tougher arm-wrestling if it
is to sustain its high oil output.
Whatever the war medals Saudi Arabia has pinned to its chest, they are
unlikely to impress Kuwait, Iraq or Iran, all of which have suffered far
greater war damage to their oil industries and economies than the kingdom
within the last decade.
Saudi Arabia may, in Geneva and at subsequent Opec summits, be forced to be
politically belligerent because it believes it has no economic choice. But
then, neither do its rivals.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease with shift of attention to
auction
</HEADLINE>

US BOND prices fell sharply across the board yesterday as investors ignored
more bad employment news and instead reacted badly to a disappointing
afternoon auction of new government securities.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  31/32 at 103
9/32 , yielding 7.705 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also markedly weaker, down  7/32 at 99 5/8 , to carry a yield of
5.058 per cent.
The morning's news of a 46,000 rise in jobless claims for the second week of
January would normally have buoyed the market. The figure, however, was in
line with analysts' forecasts, and not enough to affect a market that was
trading cautiously ahead of the sale of Dollars 9.25bn in five-year notes.
Prices took a sharp turn downward after the auction, which was completed at
an average yield of 6.28 per cent. The yield was higher than expected by
dealers, and combined with the lower than usual bid-to-cover ration and the
poor non-competitive demand, was an indication of only moderate interest in
the new issue from investors.
JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs on yesterday's bullish money
supply data, but the market ended the day almost unchanged as profit-taking
wiped out the gains.
The money supply grew by a preliminary 2 per cent in December, down from the
previous record low of 2.1 per cent in October. The news raised hopes of an
easing in the Bank of Japan's monetary policy.
The yield on the benchmark No 129, which opened at 5.20 per cent, reached
5.145 per cent after the money supply announcement. However, prices fell
back on profit-taking and weakened further in the London session with the No
129 yielding 5.22 per cent.
Short-term interest rates, which fell sharply on Wednesday, inched up again
in Tokyo yesterday as the Bank of Japan squeezed the supply of funds in the
money market. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit moved up to
5.0 per cent from 4.95 per cent.
THE DUTCH government's financing agency announced it will close sales of its
8.25 per cent 10-year issue today, but will leave its 8.25 per cent 15-year
tap open next week.
The 10-year issue has raised a total of Fl 8.3bn this week, while the
15-year issue has raised Fl 3.9bn during the same period. Traders said the
money raised by the two tap issues accounted for 30 to 35 per cent of the
government's 1992 funding requirement.
Although Dutch government bond prices closed higher, investors only bought a
little of the tap issues, preferring to buy directly in the market.
Elsewhere in Europe, German government bond prices were almost unchanged on
the previous day's close. The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a range
of between 88.21 and 88.52 before ending the day at 88.41. Traders noted
that the futures contract was well supported at the low end of its range and
did not fall below 88.20 which is an important technical resistance level.
UK government bonds ended the day firmer in light trading ahead of the G7
meetings this weekend and next week's gilt auction. Traders said sterling
strength helped to lift gilt prices, with the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt
due 2003/07 rising from 115 to 115 13/16 by late afternoon.

SCOTT PAPER, the world's largest manufacturer of toilet tissue, announced
plans to cut its workforce by around 10 per cent, or 3,800. It will also
take a Dollars 183m after-tax special charge in the fourth quarter, about
half of it due to the job cuts, which will push it into losses for the
period.
Scott, which faces ferocious competition in the US, attributed the cuts to
'the difficult economic environment and highly competitive market
conditions.' It estimated that fourth-quarter earnings, due to be announced
on January 30, would total around 35 cents a share excluding the special
charge, which would work through at about Dollars 2.49.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US long-distance telephone
carrier, yesterday reported a 21 per cent fall in its fourth-quarter net
profits to Dollars 635m (Pounds 350m), or 48 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 809m, or 64 cents, a year ago.
However, that drop included a one-time action, knocking 14 cents a share off
earnings, to reduce the book value of AT&amp;T's investment in the Italian
holding group Compagnie Industriali Riunite. Without that, earnings per
share would have been 62 cents. Revenues were little changed at Dollars
11.94bn, against Dollars 11.88bn.
All the figures include NCR, the large US computer manufacturer which AT&amp;T
acquired last September to give critical mass to its own ailing computer
operations.
While the recession was blamed for lower product sales, long distance and
financial services operations improved. AT&amp;T's sales of products and systems
dropped 7 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn.
There was a particularly large drop - 19.4 per cent to Dollars 1.08bn - on
the computer side, which the company said reflected general industry
weakness.
However, NCR reported record orders for the quarter, showing customers were
enthusiastic about new models it had introduced during the year.
Revenues for AT&amp;T's phone service business rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.3bn,
on calling volume up nearly 6.5 per cent.
For the full year, AT&amp;T's net income was Dollars 522m, or 40 cents a share,
after taking Dollars 4.2bn of restructuring and other charges.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Uneasy times in the retail
sector - A variety of pressures affecting US stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING, to coin a phrase, is rotten in the US retail sector. The question
is, how quickly can the situation be repaired?
Casual observers, noting a wave of post-Christmas announcements from the
industry, have every reason to be confused. On the one hand, the former
Campeau-owned chains - 11 in all, including high-profile names such as
Bloomingdale's and Jordan Marsh - are poised to emerge from bankruptcy.
Revco, a mid-west drugstore group with over 1,000 outlets, seems headed in a
similar direction.
But Macy's, the New York-based department store group, has been forced to
delay post-Christmas payments to suppliers so that bankers' requirements can
be met. Zale Corporation, the nation's largest jewellery retailer, last
night filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors, while Seaman's, a
prominent east coast furniture chain taken private in a leveraged buy-out
three years ago, has succumbed, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
on January 3.
Woolworth - one of the country's biggest general merchandise retailers with
over 9,000 outlets - has unveiled a big operational overhaul, including the
shedding of certain specialty chains.
Although a few rare retail stars, such as The Gap, a fast-growing fashion
chain, posted double-digit same-store sales gains in December, even
Wal-Mart, the stock market's discount darling, managed only 5 per cent. So
what does it all add up to?
For a start, the sector's problems need to be seen in perspective. No one
doubts that demographics were very favourable to the retail industry in the
1970s and early 1980s. The 'baby boom' generation became wage-earners and
more women joined the labour force. Personal debt levels also rose until the
mid-80s - a reflection of the large youthful working population and general
affluence. According to analysts at Salomon Brothers, this prompted shopping
space to increase by over 200 per cent between 1972 and 1984.
Population growth, however, was just 12 per cent. Now, as the 'baby boomers'
begin to age and turn their attention to savings, some fundamental fizz must
drain from the 'over-stored' retail marketplace.
But other pressures weigh in, too. The most obvious is the recession, and
the deterioration in consumer spending trends. Recent statistics have shown
consumer spending for retail goods edged up by only 0.7 per cent in 1991 -
the smallest increase since sales declined by 0.1 per cent 30 years ago.
Since the figures do not allow for inflation, the 'true' picture suggests an
underlying fall.
At a more anecdotal level, most retailers point to the correlation between
consumer caution and job fears - a worry which the announcement of 14,000
lay-offs at United Technologies only serves to perpetuate.
Second, trends within US retailing have benefited certain segments of the
industry at the expense of others. During the 1980s, for example, the notion
of 'niche retailing' or 'specialty stores' took hold in formidable fashion,
undermining the traditional department store concept. Discount retailing
also acquired a new twist with the development of 'warehouse clubs' -
out-of-town barns selling at rock-bottom to membership customers.
Finally, there is the overhang of the 80s bid-frenzy and high levels of
leverage which have developed within the sector. In common with airlines,
retail chains were superficially well-suited to the 'leverage' scenario. In
non-recessionary times, they combined tangible assets, in the form of
property holdings and inventories, with strong cash-flows. Capital
expenditure, meanwhile, could usually be pruned short-term to help meet
interest expenses.
In practice, the last problem has arguably been the simplest to solve. As
soon as consumer expenditure fell away, companies with the most ambitious
capital structures came unstuck.
A string of bankruptcies - including Revco, Federated and Allied Department
Stores (the Campeau-owned subsidiaries), Ames Department Stores,
California's Carter Hawley Hale and Hills Department Stores - resulted.
Since then, creditors have steadily bitten the bullet, and in most cases
some form of financial restructuring - usually involving a debt-for-equity
swap and some asset sales to provide a cash payout - is under negotiation.
In the best situations, such as Federated/Allied, corporate purgatory is
virtually over and an overhauled balance sheet in view.
This process is not at an end. Many analysts reckon that some companies
still need to resolve capital structure problems. But, that caveat aside, it
is probably fair to assume the largest wave of retail bankruptcies has
passed.
The other factors prompting the sector's decline may be more difficult to
resolve. There are predictions galore about the path of the US economy - but
the consensus suggests only a slow upturn at best.
'We're still waiting to see signs of life in the US consumer,' comments
Barbara Wedelstaedt, retail analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei, the
high-yield specialists. 'I think we'd be looking for a very slow recovery in
the sector next year.'
For some retail groups, even this modest recovery may be hampered by
consumers' increased attention to 'value' - a predictable recessionary trend
 -and the new retailing techniques designed to satisfy this. 'I reckon
profitability will still be tight,' commented one pundit. 'There's a switch
to value, and consumers will look for lower initial prices and then
discounting'.
All of which points to the continued need to update systems and minimise
costs. Perhaps one of the best things going for the retail sector, is the
combination of record stock market levels and ultra-cheap debt, which makes
investment funds more accessible.
Retailers have not been slow to seize the opportunity. At the end of 1991,
Salomon Brothers noted investment-grade retailers had raised over Dollars
3bn in the debt markets during the previous eight months - with four leading
names, Dayton Hudson, JC Penney, May Department Stores and Wal-Mart
accounting for 80 per cent of this money. Three others have tapped the
equity markets - including K mart, via a Dollars 1.12bn issue of Percs, the
latest financial product to hit Wall Street.
It is a small break - in an otherwise discomforting picture.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETRO-CANADA, the partly privatised Canadian oil company, plans to stem
losses in its downstream business by selling or closing one-third of its
service stations and withdrawing almost a third of its refining capacity.
The restructuring will be provided for in a CDollars 369m (USDollars 318.1m)
after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Mr Wilbert Hopper, chairman of the Calgary-based company, said yesterday:
'We are not counting on a major recovery in demand for refined petroleum
products and we expect continued intense competition for market share.'
Petro-Canada's main competitors are Imperial Oil, a subsidiary of Exxon, and
Shell Canada, controlled by Royal Dutch Shell.
The domestic industry's sales of refined petroleum products slipped by 7 per
cent last year, following a 2.7 per cent fall in 1990.
Over the next 6-18 months, Petro-Canada will cut 80,000 barrels a day in
refining capacity, mainly at plants in British Columbia and Ontario. It is
also seeking a joint-venture partner or buyer for a refinery in Montreal.
The company also plans to close or sell one-third of its 3,200 retail and
340 wholesale outlets. It has already sold a number of exploration
properties and reduced capital spending in line with a 50 per cent shortfall
in expected cash flows last year.
The refining and marketing business lost CDollars 106m in the first nine
months of last year. The company said the division will post a small
operating loss, before the special charge, in the fourth quarter.
Petro-Canada was created as Canada's national energy company during the
mid-1970s energy crisis to give Ottawa a window on the oil industry. It grew
mainly by buying assets from foreign-controlled oil companies, including BP
and Belgium's Petrofina.

MR LI Ka-shing, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, has continued his buying spree
in Hong Kong with the acquisition of a large interest in Lippo, a local
financial services company controlled by Indonesia's wealthy Riady family.
The acquisition, although relatively modest by Mr Li's standards, is seen as
significant for future business developments between himself and the Riady
family which has extensive interests in Indonesia and Hong Kong and aims to
be a force in south-east Asian business.
Mr Li's Cheung Kong Holdings has paid HKDollars 100m (USDollars 13m) for a
convertible note, exchangeable for 18.9 per cent of Lippo's share capital on
or before December 31 1993.
In Hong Kong, the Riady family owns a controlling interest in the Hongkong
Chinese Bank, and some high profile properties. Lippo has also been in
negotiations with the receiver appointed to deal with the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International's business in Hong Kong.
The Lippo acquisition is Mr Li's ninth in 13 months and the seventh where he
has taken an interest in a company via a convertible note. Collectively
these deals have been worth more than HKDollars 2bn. In October, Mr Li took
11 per cent of Guoco, a listed financial services group which owns the
colony's fourth largest bank.

markets

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO large US consumer product groups, Sara Lee and Quaker Oats, have
reported sharply-improved profits for the final three months of 1991.
Profits rose by 13.6 per cent at Sara Lee, the large Chicago-based consumer
products company, during the second quarter of its 1991-92 financial year,
to Dollars 189.4m after tax. Earnings per share increased by a roughly
similar amount, up 13.2 per cent to 77 cents, while net sales for the
quarter were Dollars 36bn, 6.8 per cent higher.
First-half net profits show a more dramatic advance, up by two-thirds to
Dollars 452.8m, but this partly reflects a net pre-tax unusual gain of
Dollars 221.7m - comprising profit from the sale of the pharmaceuticals
business offset by some restructuring costs. The gain was taken in the
July-September quarter.
At Quaker Oats, the food and pet foods group also based in Chicago,
second-quarter after-tax profits totalled Dollars 44.7m, against only
Dollars 2.1m.
Comparisons are muddied because of a Dollars 30m provision for discontinued
operations last year, but pre-tax profit from continuing businesses still
rose from Dollars 57.5m to Dollars 78.3m.
The company was helped by strong volume growth, at home and abroad, and
lower commodity costs. First-half profits stand at Dollars 87.1m after tax.
At close of trade shares in Sara Lee fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 53 1/2 ,
and those of Quaker Oats, were down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 69.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CENTEL, a Chicago-based telephone service company, yesterday underscored the
wave of consolidation sweeping through the US telecommunications industry
when it announced it would be examining the possible sale of the group as
part of a review of strategic options. Wall Street analysts reckon the
business could be worth around Dollars 5bn.
Centel, which has been through a restructuring programme to shed non-core
businesses over the past two years, serves about 1.6m telephone lines in
seven states and has a large cellular telephone business, operating in 44
urban areas and more than 50 rural ones.
Mr John Frazee, the chairman, said it had retained investment banks Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley to explore strategic options. But he added that
Centel had not had any discussions or inquiries from outside parties about
the sale of either all or parts of the business.
He explained that Centel wanted to remain in charge of its fate while the
industry was consolidating, rather than possibly ending up as a bid target.
Centel stock soared by 25 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange to close
up 9 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/8 . Wall Street analysts said the group was most
likely to be sold off in pieces and that any of the seven 'Baby Bell'
regional telephone companies might be interested in parts, together with
GTE, the largest local operator in the US.
The analysts reckoned its break-up value could be between Dollars 55 and
Dollars 60 a share, based on eight to 10 times the cash flow of its
telephone operations and Dollars 200 for each potential subscriber (or
'pop') to its cellular network. Recent cellular deals have been struck
around Dollars 200 per pop.
Centel already has experience of hostile investors. In 1988 it fought off an
attempt to gain boardroom seats launched by Mr Asher Edelman, a New York
investor, and Mr George Lindemann, chairman of cellular group Metro Mobile.
Metro Mobile was sold last year to Bell Atlantic, one of the Baby Bells, for
Dollars 2.5bn. Other recent telecommunications takeovers include last year's
Dollars 6bn purchase of Centel by GTE.
Centel's growth in telephone business has been running ahead of the industry
average and its cellular business has also been growing strongly. The
group's fourth quarter results showed income from continuing operations of
Dollars 25.7m, or 30 cents a share, up from Dollars 10m, or 11 cents a year
ago, helped by a 14 cent gain on the sale of a cellular interest.

<TEXT>
UNISYS reported its first profitable quarter in three years, buoying
confidence that the struggling US computer manufacturer is on the road to
recovery.
Although sales revenues dipped, the company said US orders booked during the
quarter showed the strongest gain in five years.
For the fourth quarter, the computer manufacturer reported net income of
Dollars 80.5m, or 31 cents a share, well above Wall Street expectations and
a strong recovery from 1990 fourth-quarter losses of Dollars 88.5m, or 74
cents.
Revenues declined sharply, however, to Dollars 2.46bn for the quarter,
compared with Dollars 2.93bn in the same period a year ago. Unisys said the
drop reflected 'continuing market weakness, lower shipments at the end of
product cycles and the sale of its Timeplex subsidiary in June 1991'.
Unisys said strong demand in Pacific Rim markets and improvement in the US
were offset by continued weakness in Europe during the fourth quarter.
Over the past two years, Unisys has restructured its operations to cut costs
and reduce its heavy debt load. Debt declined around Dollars 150m in the
fourth quarter, Unisys said. At the end of the third quarter, the company's
debt load was just under Dollars 3bn.
'Our programme to reshape the company is on schedule in terms of both
lowering our cost structure in line with market conditions and focusing our
strategic product, technology, service and market initiatives,' said Mr
James Unruh, chairman and chief executive.
For 1991, Unisys recorded a net loss of Dollars 1.4bn, including a special
charge of Dollars 1.2bn in the second quarter, on revenues of Dollars 8.7bn.
This compares with a 1990 loss of Dollars 436.7m, including a special charge
of Dollars 181m, on revenue of Dollars 10.1bn.
Mr Unruh said: 'We do not expect early improvement in general economic
conditions or a lessening of competitive pressures in our information
systems business. However, we did start the year with a stronger base of
business. . . and we remain committed to profitability for the year.'
Unisys stock rose to Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 7 at close of trade, from a
Wednesday close of Dollars 5 3/4 , on news of its higher-than-expected
earnings.

DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, yesterday reported a 32.5
per cent decline in 1991 net profits, to Dollars 72.2m, a result in line
with market expectations.
The net income figure was struck after a previously-announced Dollars 32m
write-off of development costs, goodwill and equipment associated with The
Trading Service, a foreign exchange direct dealing service of Dow Jones'
Telerate subsidiary.
Consolidated operating income for 1991 was 5 per cent higher at Dollars
240.7m. Group revenues of Dollars 1.7bn were 0.3 per cent up on 1990.
Group net profit in the fourth quarter was almost wiped out by the Dollars
32m Trading Service charge, having declined to Dollars 3.5m from Dollars
23.4m in the last quarter of 1990.
But operating income in the last quarter of 1991 grew by 44.4 per cent to
Dollars 78.7m on quarterly revenues that were 3 per cent higher at Dollars
456.1m.
The final quarter of 1991 saw an improving trend in all three main
divisions, with operating income 22.6 per cent higher in information
services, to Dollars 37.6m.
The business publications segment, which includes The Journal and Barron's,
rebounded by 96.2 per cent, to Dollars 33.6m of operating income, although
this was compared with a depressed 1990 fourth-quarter level.
Operating profits in the quarter at the Ottaway community newspapers
division was 12.7 per cent up at Dollars 9.4m.
The Wall Street Journal's advertising linage fell by 10.3 per cent in 1991,
but by only 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. The Journal's full-year
advertising revenues fell 5.8 per cent, but rose by 3.3 per cent in the last
quarter.
Wall Street marked Dow Jones shares down Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 28 7/8.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANK OF BOSTON, which last week ended merger talks with Shawmut National
Bank, yesterday unveiled a fourth-quarter net profit of Dollars 93.5m, a
figure that underscores the bank's claim that it is on the mend after heavy
losses in the first half of last year.
The fourth-quarter profit contrasts with a Dollars 186.7m loss in the last
quarter of 1990, and is an improvement on the Dollars 18m net profit in the
third quarter of 1991.
For the whole of 1991, Bank of Boston was still in the red, suffering a
Dollars 26.6m loss, which compares with a Dollars 394.5m deficit in 1990.
The bank's bad debt provisions in the fourth quarter of 1991 were Dollars
78m, much lower than the Dollars 170m recorded in the same period of 1990.
For the whole of 1991 the bank's bad debt provisions totalled Dollars 328m,
down from Dollars 620m in 1990.
Non-performing loans were also down to Dollars 1.5bn at year-end, a 17 per
cent drop year-on-year.
The bank has undergone a significant restructuring over the past year.
Yesterday the Bank of Boston share price closed at Dollars 14 3/8 , up by
1/2 .

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Platinum prices hit Rustenburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER platinum prices contributed to a 19 per cent fall in Rustenburg
Platinum's pre-tax profits to R498.8m (Dollars 179.4m) for the six months to
December.
Sales at the world's largest platinum producer, which is part of the
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, fell 15 per cent to R1.5bn
as values of platinum and rhodium, a by-product of mining platinum, slid by
12 per cent and 17 per cent respectively over the reporting period. Despite
a reduction in costs, profits on metal sales fell 15.2 per cent to R558.5m.
After taking account of renewals and replacements charges, and tax, lease
and tax normalisation, distributable profits fell 17.7 per cent to R219.7m.
This was better than market expectations of a 20 to 25 per cent fall in
earnings.
It is a measure of the difficulties the platinum industry is experiencing
that Rustenburg, which has a strong balance sheet, saw fit to cut its
interim dividend to 87.5 cents a share from 125 cents. Earnings dropped to
175.3 cents from 213.1 cents, so dividend cover was lifted from 1.7 to 2.
Lebowa Platinum, a smaller platinum producer also in the JCI group, made an
after-tax loss of R9.4m against a R1.2m profit previously.

<TEXT>
TANDEM Computers reported a net loss for its first fiscal quarter after
restructuring charges. The manufacturer of fault-tolerant computers said
that economic and competitive pressures had permanently changed the computer
industry, writes Louise Kehoe.
The company reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 94.6m, or 88
cents a share including a restructuring charge of Dollars 80.5m, or 74 cents
a share. In the corresponding quarter of fiscal 1991, Tandem earned Dollars
7m, or 7 cents a share.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 454.5m, 2 per cent above the Dollars
443.8m in the same period a year ago.
Tandem reduced spending and cut its workforce in the first quarter. However,
'revenues were lower than we anticipated and our actions were not enough to
offset historically weak first quarter revenue patterns', said Mr James
Treybig, Tandem president and chief executive. 'Now we are moving to
restructure the company to increase both productivity and profitability.'
Earlier this month, the company announced restructuring plans to be
implemented over the next nine months, including consolidation of offices
and facilities, write-offs of assets and job cuts.
The company said that the restructuring would reduce expenses by Dollars 40
to Dollars 50m in the current fiscal year, and Dollars 90 to Dollars 100m in
fiscal 1993.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Delta registers Dollars 236.8m
operating loss for quarter
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DELTA Air Lines, one of the three large US carriers and the purchaser of Pan
Am's east coast shuttle operations and transatlantic routes last autumn,
yesterday unveiled a Dollars 236.8m operating loss in the three months to
end-December.
At the after-tax level, the picture improved slightly, with the net loss for
the quarter - the second of Delta's financial year - being Dollars 187.6m,
or Dollars 3.89 a share.
This was a small improvement on the Dollars 207.8m deficit seen in the same
period a year earlier, although the latter half of 1990 was abnormally
affected by escalating fuel prices and other Gulf war-related factors.
The operating results reflect Delta's ownership of the shuttle operations
for the full three months, and the transatlantic routes, together with the
Frankfurt hub, during November and December.
The carrier did not spell out the impact of these acquisitions on the
overall loss, but Mr Tom Roeck, Delta's finance director, admitted
'aggressive growth in operations, along with additional expansion during the
year, was a primary cause of increases in operating expenses for the
quarter.'
During the three months, Delta's operating revenues advanced from Dollars
2.13bn to Dollars 2.62bn. But operating expenses climbed from Dollars 2.44bn
to Dollars 2.86bn, despite a sharp fall in aircraft fuel costs, down from
Dollars 534.3m to Dollars 394.8m.
Delta's passenger/mile yield improved from 13.83 cents to 14.17 cent, but
the average load factor stood at 57.2 (55.9) per cent, against a break-even
load factor of 62.7 per cent.
Pan Am's failed attempt to reorganise - in which Delta was to have been a
major player - also weighed on non-operating expenses, affecting pre and
after-tax figures.
The overall non-operating charge was Dollars 56.6m, incorporating a Dollars
50m write-off relating to Delta's participation in the Pan Am reorganisation
effort.
Analysts had expected a large loss for the quarter, but the figure was at
the bottom end of expectations, and the shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
73 1/8 at close of trade.
Mr Roeck said the carrier was 'encouraged by recent declines in fuel prices
and a move towards a more rational industry pricing structure'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BCE, the telecommunications group that controls Northern Telecom, reported
higher fourth-quarter earnings despite the recession and reduction in
long-distance rates.
Net income was CDollars 346m (USDollars 298m), or Dollars 1.11 a common
share, up 7 per cent from CDollars 322m, or CDollars 1.05, a year earlier,
on revenues of CDollars 5.2bn, against CDollars 4.8bn.
The contribution from Bell Canada, the telecommunications subsidiary, was
stable at 74 cents per BCE share.
For the full year, BCE lifted earnings to a record CDollars 1.23bn, or
CDollars 4.01 a share, up 16 per cent from CDollars 1.06bn, or CDollars
3.50, in 1990. Revenues advanced to CDollars 19.9bn, up 8 per cent from
1990's CDollars 18.3bn.
BCE credited the strong results to a continuing high level of investment in
technology and to expense controls. It said its results in the latest
quarter were helped by lower borrowing costs.
For the full year, Bell Canada contributed CDollars 2.97 per BCE share,
little changed from 1990, Northern Telecom 97 cents, against 89 cents,
Montreal Trust 7 cents compared with 14 cents, and TransCanada PipeLines 13
cents, against 22 cents.
BCE Mobile Communications suffered a loss of 6 cents, against 5 cents.

Amdahl into deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMDAHL, the IBM-compatible mainframe computer company, has, as expected,
incurred a fourth-quarter net loss. The company had projected a loss, citing
increasing softness in the European market which accounts for about one
third of the company's sales, writes Louise Kehoe.
The loss totalled Dollars 12.7m, or 11 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars
389.9m. It included a tax credit of 6 cents a share for the previous year's
losses in certain foreign subsidiaries. In the 1990 fourth quarter, the
company had net income of Dollars 61.3m, or 55 cents a share, on revenues of
Dollars 644.4m .
The company said fourth-quarter earnings were also adversely affected by
pricing pressures and high start-up costs associated with the introduction
of new products. A manufacturing problem, now corrected, also made it
necessary to suspend sales of some disk drives for some time.
Net income for all 1991 was down sharply to Dollars 10.6m, or 10 cents a
share, from Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66, in 1990. Revenues totalled
Dollars 1.7bn, down from Dollars 2.2bn.

below expectations
</HEADLINE>

   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DATA GENERAL'S stock lost 23 per cent of its value yesterday when the
manufacturer of mid-range computers reported much lower than expected
earnings for its first fiscal quarter.
The company blamed competitive pressures on pricing for the decline.
For the first quarter, it reported net income of Dollars 4m, or 12 cents per
share, down from Dollars 12.4m or 41 cents in the same period last year.
Wall Street analysts had been projecting earnings of around 47 cents per
share for the first quarter. The stock tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 12 at
yesterday's close, from a Wednesday close of Dollars 16. Revenues for the
quarter were Dollars 294.8m, down from Dollars 311.7m for the same period a
year ago.
The company said first quarter revenues from the Japanese market were
Dollars 16m lower than during last year's first quarter, following the sale
in 1991 of its Japanese subsidiary.
The sales and earnings decline represents a setback in Data General's
financial recovery. The company returned to profitability in fiscal 1991
after four years of heavy losses, during which operations were severely cut
and the company developed a new 'open systems' product line.
It said sales of its 'open systems' product line continued to grow during
the first quarter, but that prices declined.
'We have been able to maintain profitability despite continuing weakness in
the worldwide economy and very competitive pricing pressures,' said Mr
Ronald Skates, president and chief executive.
'Our expectation is that industry-wide pricing pressures, which had a
significant impact on the past quarter's results, will not abate for some
time,' he added. 'We remain very cautious about the remainder of 1992.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: 'Strategic move' by T&amp;N with east German
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the UK motor components and engineering group, is buying a bearing
manufacturer in the former east Germany.
The acquisition, through the Treuhand privatisation agency, is small in
financial terms - Pounds 2m - but was described by Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N's
chairman, as 'an important strategic move at little capital cost. The extra
sales potential is considerable'.
T&amp;N will acquire the site, production equipment and inventory of
Gleitlagerwerk Osterwieck, based 50 miles from Hanover.
The venture is being renamed Glacier Vandervell (Osterwieck) to identify it
with T&amp;N's long established Vandervell and Glacier bearings and bushes
subsidiaries.
Initially the venture is employing 186 people. Its main customer is
Volkswagen, already assembling cars from kits at the former Trabant plant at
Mosel, near Zwickau, and which is setting up a new factory there to produce
Golfs.
Gleitlagerwerk, which has been a Glacier licensee, also makes a range of
after-market parts for east European automotive and industrial bearing
applications.
The acquisition forms one of what is expected to be a string of such
acquisitions in the region, as T&amp;N seeks to establish a firm foothold in
growing east European markets.
In June, T&amp;N became the first British company to acquire a controlling stake
in a Czech company offered for privatisation by the Czech government when it
invested in Osinek, the sole Czech producer of automotive brake and friction
products.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: DC Cook falls 69% but restores dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DC COOK Holdings, the USM-quoted motor dealer and property developer,
yesterday announced the resumption of its interim dividend in spite of a 69
per cent decline to Pounds 107,000 in pre-tax profits.
Mr Derek Cook, the chairman whose family controls 40 per cent of the
company, said he expected the full-year dividend to be increased in light of
the group's confidence over trading in the second half. 'A profit for the
year is almost certain,' he said.
The interim distribution was restored at 0.2p.
The Pounds 233,000 costs of establishing operations in Spain were
responsible for virtually all of the profit fall in the six months to
October 31. Turnover slipped from Pounds 63.7m to Pounds 56.9m.
The motor division, which recorded losses last year, had been turned round
to show an Pounds 810,000 profit in the first half. 'The total motor
division is profitable,' Mr Cook said.
During the first half, DC Cook integrated the operation's three arms -
retail, service and finance - resulting in substantial cost savings.
Mr Cook said new and used car sales had held steady, in spite of the
generally depressed state of the UK new car market.
The property operation, which develops petrol stations for oil companies,
recorded a loss of Pounds 470,000 in the first half. However, Mr Cook said
the division would return a profit for the full year, since several
contracts had been agreed in the last month.
The deregulation of the Spanish petrol sector provided significant
opportunities for the group, Mr Cook said. 'The major oil companies are
desperate for sites,' he added. In June, the company bought Norfolk Espana,
a Spanish roadside developer, for a nominal sum and took on its Pounds 2m
debt.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.13m, largely due to the
Pounds 4.2m rights issue in October which cut gearing to about 70 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share tumbled from 1.19p to 0.33p.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho shareholders' funds fall to Pounds
1.33bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, suffered last year from its exposed
asset position in Africa. In the year to September 30 1991 shareholders'
funds, excluding minority interests, fell by Pounds 53m to Pounds 1.33bn.
Mr Philip Tarsh, a director, said yesterday that one of the main reasons for
the fall was the continued appreciation of sterling against the South
African rand and Kenyan shilling.
Pre-tax profits for the year fell to Pounds 207m (Pounds 273m) on turnover
of Pounds 4.8bn (Pounds 5.4bn). The fall took the market by surprise but Mr
Tarsh said he could not understand why the results should come as a
surprise.
He added: 'We were badly hit by the recession. The fall in precious metal
prices accounts for nearly half of the reduction in Lonrho's profits in the
second six months. Why analysts could not see that is beyond me.'
Aware that the market had developed an appetite for tycoon-bashing, Mr Tarsh
said that only Pounds 800,000 of its Pounds 300m UK pension funds was
invested in Lonrho shares or Lonrho related companies.
Exchange movements through balance sheet reserves in the period increased by
Pounds 40m to Pounds 209m. Lonrho has now suffered a cumulative adverse
movement through reserves over the last six years of Pounds 695m.
In the past Lonrho has been able to mitigate their effects by revaluing part
of the asset base. Over the same period revaluations have added a total of
Pounds 882m, the 1990 increase being Pounds 93m.
However, Mr Tarsh said the group did not believe it would be prudent to
revalue freehold and leasehold properties in the middle of a recession, thus
there was no addition to the revaluation reserve in 1991.
Net debt increased from Pounds 936m to Pounds 1.1bn over the year but it was
less than some commentators feared and gearing stands at 73 per cent.
Some analysts have voiced concern that it could be misleading to net off
cash against debt when cash is held in soft currencies and debt in hard
ones. However, Mr Tarsh pointed out that 87 per cent of the group's cash
balances of more than Pounds 280m was held in bank accounts in Europe and
the US.
Mr Tarsh said that debt would continue to fall. The sale of Lonrho's 50 per
cent stake in Kuhne &amp; Nagel, the German freight forwarder was part of a
wide-ranging review of assets which started eight months ago.
Capital expenditure, which has been rising over the past few years, fell
from 1990's Pounds 250m. Due to the high rates of taxation of South African
profits and the reliefs available for capital spending Lonrho has continued
to spend significant sums there.
The price of rhodium has fallen from a recent high of Dollars 7,000 (Pounds
3,910) an ounce to a low of about Dollars 2,000. Lonrho owns a 75 per cent
stake in Western Platinum, the South African mining company which produces
45,000 ounces of rhodium a year.
James Capel, the stockbrokers, said a slump on such a scale could have
reduced Lonrho's gross revenue by up to Pounds 100m.
Mr Tarsh added that the group's motors division, which includes Dutton
Forshaw and VAG, the Volkswagen/Audi distributor in the UK, suffered a
particularly bad fall in pre-tax profits.
Earnings per share declined from 23.6p to 14.2p and the total dividend is
lower at 13p (15.7p adjusted) with a proposed final payment of 5p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Bank Scotland, the Scottish offshoot of TSB Group, raised pre-tax
profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 76.9m in the year to October 31 1991.
Profits in Scotland thus grew faster than those of TSB's retail banking and
insurance division, of which TSB Bank Scotland is part. The division's
pre-tax profits, announced last week, rose 17 per cent to Pounds 413m.
TSB Bank Scotland's cost income ratio fell from 59.3 per cent to 52.6 per
cent as a result of staff cuts and the removal of duplication. Those of the
division fell from 68 per cent to 59 per cent.
The charge for bad and doubtful debts was Pounds 14.7m, against Pounds 5.9m.
TSB Bank Scotland handles commercial lending, although large corporate
customers are dealt with by TSB's Hill Samuel subsidiary which lost Pounds
419m last year.
Mr Charles Love, chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland, said it fared better
than the division as a whole because of the better economic climate in
Scotland, although that had worsened in the second half of the year. He said
costs rose by only 4.6 per cent.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTEUS International, the start-up company specialising in computer-aided
molecular modelling and rational drug design, reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.27m for the six months to September 30.
Mr Kevin Gilmore, chairman, said development had continued on target. The
balance sheet remained strong with Pounds 1.5m net cash on deposit at the
end of 1991, following an share issue in November which raised Pounds 1.23m.
Proteus, founded in May 1990, incurred a loss of Pounds 520,000 for the five
months to September 30 1990 and a Pounds 982,000 deficit for the six months
to March 31 1991.
Turnover was Pounds 2,000, following the decision not to market Prometheus,
its proprietary software system. Mr Gilmore said the company had had
difficulty providing support to licensees and had not wanted to sell off its
most valuable asset for short-term cash flow considerations.
He said there had been a substantial increase in workload during recent
weeks representing progress beyond expectations. The company should start
generating income this calendar year and reach profitability in 1993, he
added.
The most promising area was immunocastration, which involves castration of
domestic and farm animals through injections. An HIV serum designed by
Proteus is under evaluation by Repligen Corporation in the US.
News of the agreement with Repligen lay behind a jump in the group's share

FT  24 JAN 92 / Zale seeks court protection

<TEXT>
ZALE CORPORATION, the world's largest jewellery retailer with around 2,000
outlets in the US, last night decided to seek protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
In doing so, the company was acceding to an involuntary bankruptcy petition
filed by some of its bondholders in the Texas courts on January 1.
The bondholders' action followed an interest payment default by Zale on
certain junk bonds. Zale had a set 'window' in which to respond to the
petition, and this expired yesterday.
Zale had suggested that it would prefer to negotiate a financial
restructuring outside the bankruptcy courts, although some analysts believed
that it proposed to use the brief 'pre-packaged bankruptcy' mechanism to
implement this.
Last night, it reiterated its belief that the Chapter 11 filing was
'regrettable'.
However, as part of yesterday's package, Zale will also get up to Dollars
510m (Pounds 281.7m) of debtor-in-possession working capital and accounts
receivable financing from Chemical Bank.
The funding is for a proposed two-year term, and subject to bankruptcy court
approval. DIP financing is often used in bankruptcy situations, with lenders
ranking at the forefront of the repayment queue.
A few days before the bondholders' bankruptcy petition was filed, Zale
outlined a reorganisation scheme which involved the closure of 400 stores
and a 'downsizing and cost reduction' plan at its headquarters. That, said
the company, was going ahead as planned, with 300 stores already closed.
The heavily-indebted retailer is based in Dallas, although it is owned
jointly by Peoples Jewellers in Toronto and Zurich-based Swarovski
International Holding - a vehicle for the wealthy Austrian Swarovski family.
Part of the loss-making group's problems stem from hefty debts taken on when
the company was acquired by Peoples and Swarovski in 1986, and then again
when Zale bought out the rival Gordon jewellery chain in the late-1980s.
The group has also blamed the recession, and its impact on the jewellery
market in particular, for its current troubles.
Debts of Zale, and other subsidiaries involved in the filing, are put at
around Dollars 1.45bn. Around Dollars 200m is owned to trade creditors,
Dollars 300m to banks, and Dollars 950m to bondholders.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRIEND'S PROVIDENT, the leading UK life assurer, is taking 20 per cent of a
new Milanese stockbroking group in a marked expansion of its Italian
interests.
It marks the first time a UK insurer has been involved in the establishment
of a Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new type of broking
and fund management hybrid. So far, UK investment in Sims has been limited
to Midland Bank. It owns the majority of Euromobiliare, the Milanese
merchant bank which last year set up a Sim.
Friend's Provident has formed close links with SAI, the Italian insurance
group which is taking just under 20 per cent of the new broker. A further 20
per cent will go to Cosmo Commissionaria, the financial intermediary of the
Ligresti group. Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the controversial property developer,
is the controlling shareholder in SAI.
The new broker will be operated by the owners and management of Studio Gamba
Azzoni, a Milan broking house. Studio Gamba Azzoni, like a number of
brokers, has taken advantage of the Sims law, which will eventually remove
stockbrokers' monopoly on share transactions on the bourse, to bring in
outside capital.
Just over 40 per cent of the shares in the new broker, to be called Gamba
Azzoni Sim, will be held by Studio Gamba Azzoni's management. Mr Gian Paolo
Gamba and Mr Paolo Azzoni have been appointed managing directors, while
Friend's Provident will have two directors on the board.
The company will develop fund management activities alongside its broking
role.
Steps to reform Italy's capital markets received a setback yesterday when
the lower house of parliament postponed a debate on a new law regarding
takeover bids.
The long-awaited legislation, which would guarantee that minority
shareholders received fair treatment when controlling stakes changed hands,
is one of the few remaining planks in Italy's financial deregulation.
In spite of widespread political support for the measure, opponents in
parliament argued that more discussion was required in view of its
ramifications for the economy. It is now likely that debate will be put off
until after general elections likely to be held in early April.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Blockbuster set to win Cityvision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the US-based video rental chain, yesterday
narrowly defeated a move by a group of dissident shareholders which would
have blocked its agreed bid to acquire Cityvision, the UK video chain.
Blockbuster said that by 3pm yesterday, 50.21 per cent of shares in
Cityvision had been tendered to it, and that it had declared its offer
unconditional in respect of acceptances. The offer has been extended until
February 12.
Merrill Lynch, advisers to Blockbuster, said Blockbuster was prepared to
complete the acquisition even if a large minority of shares remained in the
hands of other shareholders. Minority shareholders are not required to
tender their shares unless the bidder receives at least 90 per cent
acceptances.
Meanwhile, Blockbuster said it was delighted with the outcome. The company
hadn't expected to get more than 45 per cent acceptances, Merrill Lynch
said.
Blockbuster had made a cash and shares bid for Cityvision last November in a
deal valued at Pounds 75m. As part of that deal, Philips, the Dutch
electronics company, agreed to pay Pounds 37.3m for a 50 per cent stake in a
new company to be known as Blockbuster UK, consisting of Cityvision and
other stores.
Following the offer, a group of dissident shareholders, Fidelity Investment,
Alliance Capital and Postel, who controlled more than 17 per cent of the
company, called for an extraordinary general meeting to replace Cityvision's
management with a team of former Cityvision executives. The team was headed
by Mr David Quayle, founder of the B&amp;Q DIY chain and chairman of Cityvision
during its greatest period of expansion.
The shareholders said the price on offer for Cityvision shares, while nearly
double the price at the time of the bid, did not reflect the value of the
company's franchise. Poor management and poor marketing, they charged, had
allowed the company's sales and share price to fall sharply.
They said yesterday that they were considering their position and had not
decided whether to tender their shares. Merrill Lynch said arbitrageurs -
who by Wednesday controlled more than 40 per cent of shares - had apparently
played a significant role in Blockbuster's success.
If Blockbuster fails to acquire 100 per cent of Cityvision, Philips has an
option to use its Pounds 37.2m investment to purchase up to 6m shares of
Blockbuster Entertainment, rather than buy into a UK subsidiary which is not
wholly owned by the company.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Behind the scenes at Perrier's drama: The Agnelli's fight
with Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past few days Europe's industrialists have watched in astonishment
as Nestle, the secretive Swiss food group aided and abetted by BSN of
France, one of its closest competitors, has fired the first salvos in what
could be a bitter battle against the Agnelli family of Italy for control of
Perrier, the famous French mineral water.
Why have these pillars of European industry come to blows over Perrier, for
which Nestle this week mounted a FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) hostile takeover
bid with Indosuez, the prominent Paris bank?
And how have some of Europe's best known banks - not only Indosuez, but also
Lazard Freres and Credit Agricole in Paris and Mediobanca in Milan - become
embroiled in the battle?
It began in November when Ifint, an Agnelli vehicle, announced a partial bid
for Exor, the wine-to-property group that controls 35 per cent of Perrier.
After protests from Exor's minority shareholders - notably from Indosuez and
Credit Agricole angry at being excluded from the bid - the Agnellis agreed
to mount a full FFr5.6bn offer. The temperature rose when earlier this month
Saint Louis, another company associated with the Agnellis, bought 13.8 per
cent of Perrier's shares. This triggered an investigation by the French
stock market authorities which are also considering whether Ifint should be
forced to make a full bid for Perrier.
In the meantime the Exor bid has been put on ice. The bourse and Exor's
minority investors were not the only aggrieved parties. BSN, which has since
1987 been a close ally of the Agnellis (who indirectly own 5.8 per cent of
its stock), is said to have been furious that the Italians could consider a
major move into mineral water - where it is a big player with the Evian and
Badoit brands - without its knowledge. This presented a potential problem
for Lazard Freres.
It owns 6 per cent of BSN and Mr Michel David-Weill, its senior partner, is
vice-president of the company. Lazard also has a decades-old relationship
with the Agnellis and with Mediobanca, their main Italian adviser.
Mr David-Weill has for years worked closely with Mr Enrico Cuccia,
Mediobanca's veteran honorary chairman.
Italian and French analysts suspect that Lazard was also concerned about the
Agnellis' growing links with Worms et Cie, the family's partner in Saint
Louis.
The situation was further inflamed when Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has been
spearheading the family's French interests, told the Italian press that the
Agnellis wanted to raise their stake in BSN. Mr Antoine Riboud, president of
BSN, retaliated with an interview in a French newspaper in which he
threatened to exercise his right of veto over any attempt by the Agnellis to
buy more shares.
So it was that Nestle, long anxious to expand its interests in the lucrative
mineral water market, found no shortage of allies when putting together its
bid for Perrier. Indosuez, the Agnelli's opponent over the original Exor
bid, was roped in as Nestle's joint investor, thereby giving the bid the
stamp of the French financial establishment.
Credit Agricole, which owns 8.5 per cent of Perrier, swiftly declared its
support.
As an Exor shareholder, Credit Agricole, like Indosuez, doubtless realised
that a Perrier bid might help it to squeeze more money out of Ifint because
of the implicit rise in the value of Exor's holding in Perrier.
The Agnellis bid for Exor at a time when the Perrier share price was around
FFr1,200 against the FFr1,475 offered by Nestle.
Last but not least BSN, an old ally of the Agnellis and a direct competitor
of Nestle in many markets, agreed to a 'sweetheart deal' with the Swiss
group whereby it would buy Volvic, one of the Perrier waters, if the bid
succeeds. Most analysts consider this a masterstroke for Nestle.
'If BSN, the number two player in mineral water, buys Volvic, its market
share would be nearly as high as Nestle's after the bid,' said Mr John
Graham, European food analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
'This means Nestle ought to avoid monopoly problems.'
Nestle also obtained court orders to freeze temporarily the voting rights of
both the Agnelli allies, Exor and Saint Louis, in Perrier. On the same day
Mr Jacques Vincent, chairman of Exor and Perrier, vowed to fight against the
Nestle bid.
What will happen next?
The Agnellis said on Wednesday they will not counter-bid for Perrier. Nor
will they raise their offer for Exor, although there is still a possibility
of the French stock market authorities forcing them to do so.
In the meantime Exor still controls Perrier. Presumably Nestle is confident
that the bourse will veto St Louis's share purchase, otherwise it would not
have risked making a bid if Exor and St Louis combined controlled 48.8 per
cent of Perrier's shares.
Alternatively, Nestle could mount a counter-bid for Exor. In the meantime
the protagonists must also be assessing the longer-term implications of the
fracas. The relationship between Lazard and Mediobanca does seem to have
been strained. 'Lazard faces a conflict of loyalties,' said one Italian
analyst.
'Their old links with Mediobanca, based on years of old-fashioned banking
diplomacy, may now be buckling under the weight of modern commercial
considerations like their investment in BSN.'
Meanwhile the Agnellis are counting the cost to their reputation. Until Exor
they had shown great skill in making opportunistic deals in France, partly
by using their social contacts with prominent figures such as the
Mentzelopoulos family with whom they negotiated the Exor deal.
But the Agnellis do seem to have miscalculated BSN's reaction both to the
Exor deal and to the prospect of their increasing their holding in BSN
itself.
They also may have underestimated the French banks' hostility to their
trying to buy control of Perrier on the cheap.
Mr Umberto Agnelli is particularly exposed. He headed the family's drive
into France after a short, unsuccessful stint as managing director of Fiat
in the late 1970s.
Last year he was named as heir apparent to the chairmanship of Fiat by Mr
Giovanni Agnelli, his older brother and the present patriarch.
This week's events may have been outside Mr Umberto Agnelli's control, but
they have dealt a blow to his family's aura of infallibility, at least in
Italy.
Some sections of the Italian press still loyally suspect that, behind the
scenes, the Agnellis are beavering away on a machiavellian masterplan.
The family does, of course, stand to make a huge capital gain should the
Nestle bid go through.
Saint Louis alone may pocket a profit of FFr600m on its Perrier stake.
More important to the Agnellis is the impact on their relationship with BSN,
their chosen partner for expansion into the French food industry.
The partnership has been beneficial to both sides especially in Italy where
the Agnellis have helped to open doors and identify opportunities for BSN.
One of their most successful ventures has been Galbani, the cheese group
which they own jointly but which is managed by BSN.
In spite of the public sniping both BSN and the Agnellis must be anxious to
avoid damaging their long-term relationship.
'Somehow they have got to find an amicable solution,' said Mr Louis Morvan,
food analyst for James Capel in Paris.
'After all, it is in everyone's interest for all this to end in a
gentlemen's agreement.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / Tied agents 'are overselling life policies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE ASSURANCE and pen-sions policies sold through tied and direct sales
agents are much more likely to be terminated early than those sold through
independent financial advisers, according to a study undertaken for the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief investment regulator.
The study will provide ammunition for the SIB, which is considering
regulations which would require companies to tell customers more about
policies before a sale was completed.
The research commissioned by the SIB shows that up to 45 per cent of life
assurance and pensions policies sold through tied and direct agents are
terminated within two years. In contrast, policies sold through independent
advisers have cancellation rates ranging from 22 per cent to 32 per cent.
Sir David Walker, SIB chairman, has said high termination rates in early
years suggest consumers are being sold products which are unsuitable for
them. The SIB is considering new regulations which would require life
companies to disclose the size of refunds if policies were cancelled before
maturity.
Cancellation in the early years of a contract can cost the customer up to
100 per cent of all premiums paid because they are typically diverted at the
start of a policy to pay sales agents' commission and other administrative
fees.
The study found that between 23 per cent and 37 per cent of policies were
cancelled within two years, regardless of how the policy was sold. It said
early termination typically indicated 'overselling' or unsuitability. It may
also reflect high unemployment, recession, falling house prices or other
factors outside the control of sales agents or policyholders.
The study, which examined terminations in 1990, was completed in December
and surveyed the results of 61 UK life companies. It found that in all main
categories of product, independent advisers had a lower termination rate on
policies they sold than the industry average.
Unit-linked life assurance policies, for example, had an average 37.1 per
cent termination rate within two years. However, 39.2 per cent of policies
sold by direct sales agents and 40.1 per cent of those sold by tied agents
were terminated compared with 30.3 per cent of those sold by independents.
Non-linked life policies had an average termination rate of 23 per cent, but
24.7 per cent and 24.8 per cent of those sold respectively by direct and
tied sales agents were cancelled, compared with 22.1 per cent of those sold
by independent advisers.
The UK life assurance industry has moved to sign up banks and building
societies to act as exclusive sales outlets.

FT  24 JAN 92 / France set to tax dumping in attack on waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday launched an ambitious campaign against household and
industrial waste.
The scheme, drafted by Mr Brice Lalonde, environment minister, signals the
Socialist administration's sensitivity to the Green party's growing
popularity ahead of important regional elections in March.
The proposals, if implemented, would cost the public and private sectors an
estimated FFr15bn (Pounds 1.53bn) over 10 years. The government says they
would give France one of the world's most advanced systems for controlling
waste.
They are similar to last autumn's German plan centred on an annual levy for
collection of household refuse. The French proposals, which drew a hostile
response from international packaging companies yesterday, would impose a
FFr20 per tonne tax on the dumping of household and non-toxic industrial
refuse.
The tax is expected to raise FFr350m to FFr500m per year, enabling the
government's environment and energy agency to open 160 waste treatment
plants over the next decade. France's 6,700 public tips would be closed.
Producers of packaged goods would have to pay a levy of three centimes a
package. The project, adopted by the cabinet for presentation to parliament,
would oblige producers or importers of consumer goods to take back
packaging, or pay for a contractor to do so, from the start of next year.
The Industrial Council for Packaging and the Environment (Incpen), which
represents more than 60 international packaging groups, expressed strong
misgivings.
It said it was disappointed that many of the ideas for a more flexible
approach sketched out in a report on packaging waste by Mr Antoine Riboud,
chairman of the BSN food group, appeared to have been abandoned.
'If the French go the German route it would be disastrous,' Incpen said
yesterday. It has already lodged an official complaint with the European
Commission arguing that the German recycling system threatened the free flow
of trade across borders.
Other industry groups, such as the European Recovery and Recycling
Association, which represents consumer products companies and retailers,
have argued that recycling schemes should be commercially driven rather than
imposed.
The tax is designed to encourage industry and individuals to reduce the 70m
tonnes of waste they produce each year.
Yesterday's proposals include far-reaching plans for dealing with toxic
waste. These would require French companies to reach an agreement with the
environment agency under which they would treat their own toxic waste or
have it dealt with by specialists.

FT  24 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: EC insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two quite different events yesterday suggest that concentration in European
insurance is speeding up. The first was a meeting in Stockholm between four
leading Scandinavian insurers, which could lead to a new alliance grouped
round Sweden's Skandia. The other was a proposal by Italy's La Fondiaria to
reorganise three of its quoted subsidiaries into bigger units.
The latter can be seen as a purely domestic affair, inspired by the need to
tidy up La Fondiaria's sprawling corporate structure. But the move, which
involves putting three previously separate motor insurance activities under
one roof, has also been prompted by expectations that motor tariffs will be
freed from government restrictions at the end of this year. Speculation to
this effect has led to a 12 per cent jump in Italian insurance company
shares since Christmas.
While this may seem a national matter, it is worth remembering that the
Italians are only acting on motor tariffs because of an EC instruction.
Brussels legislation often seems divorced from commercial reality, but in
the insurance field it has already had a powerful political and
psychological impact. The same will no doubt be true of the key Third
Non-Life Directive, which provides for home country control and which almost
unnoticed was given the political go-ahead by the 12 last month. The single
market apart, the main factor driving mergers is the urgent need to address
the poor profitability of companies' core activities.

FT  24 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in its 35-year history, the Hoare Govett small companies
index has underperformed the main market in three consecutive years.
Moreover, this recession appears to have shaken the constituents like no
other. Since 1955, the bottom 10 per cent of the sector by size has made a
compound annual return of 35 per cent. Last year, because so many of the
group's constituents became valueless, it made no return at all. Many
specialist fund managers outperformed the broad index simply because they
held stocks in the middle range where it was easier to buy and sell.
History suggests that small companies should begin to outperform at this
stage of the economic cycle, with survivors bouncing back. The picture is
clouded this time by the uncertainty over dealing arrangements. According to
Hoare, the marketability of small companies declined last year as fewer
market makers fought over smaller deals. Although the Stock Exchange is
working on proposals for trading small company shares, the omens are not
good.
There has always been something of a 'small firm effect', whereby investors
require a reward for the risks posed by illiquidity. That may now increase
accordingly. But for the professional investor, the answer always lay in
diversifying the portfolio and waiting until the liquidity problem solved
itself through growth in the individual stocks. Given patience, small
companies should logically be a better bargain than ever.

FT  24 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something unnerving about a market which rises as fast as Hong Kong
has this year. A gain of nearly 8 per cent by yesterday suggests it is time
for a correction, especially since the inspiration for the final spurt was
classic froth - a false report that the Chinese government was dropping
criminal charges against former leader Zhao Ziyang.
Yet on a slightly longer perspective the heights reached by the Hang Seng
are not so giddy. Relative to Wall Street, it has only just made up its loss
following the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. It has still underperformed
the S&amp;P Composite by over 15 per cent since the October 1987 crash. Since
the market multiple of around 12 is not particularly expensive and the
territory is bound to benefit from the recent trade accord between the US
and China, there are solid grounds for presuming further upward movement.
Progress is unlikely to be linear, however, and the pace is being forced at
present because Hong Kong's link with the US dollar is holding money market
rates well below the 11 per cent inflation rate. This advantage should
unwind once US rates start rising again. The local prime rate has lagged the
money market as interest rates have fallen. Official worries about inflation
mean it is unlikely to do so as they come back up. By then a rising currency
could make local products less competitive just as export markets in Germany
and Japan are turning down. The resulting squeeze would leave equities
facing much less settled times.

<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,525.3 (+3.3)
Lonrho's full year figures are so startlingly bad as to raise the question
of whether some kind of denouement is finally at hand. In his recent choice
of chairman, Mr Rowland demonstrated that he could not provide a successor.
It now appears that he cannot provide adequate profits and dividends either.
The cut in the final payment may have been half expected, but not the 40 per
cent slump in second half profits and the passing of this year's first
interim. At last night's unofficial close of 120p, Lonrho has a market value
of under Pounds 800m and is heading out of the FT-SE. If the institutions
want change, they had better get on with it.
As always with Lonrho, the snag lies in assessing what Mr Rowland would
leave behind him. Its assets - the mines, the hotels, the newspapers and so
forth - seem solid enough. But so does the net debt of Pounds 1.1bn.
Granted, the figure is unchanged since the interim statement, while net
interest is apparently twice covered. But this makes the action on dividends
the more puzzling, particularly since there has been no obvious pressure
from the banks. A held annual total would have been only 90 per cent
covered, but Lonrho paid an 83 per cent covered dividend in 1982.
Without knowing what Lonrho is so worried about, valuation of the shares is
impossible. The market's working assumption is of 10p in total dividends
this year against 16p last, making for an 11 per cent yield at 120p. But
until the annual report is published, there is no telling what fresh horrors
are to come. Lonrho shareholders cannot say they were not warned. The
trouble is that they were not warned by Lonrho.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Deal near on BR break-up: Ministers support proposals to
keep InterCity network intact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE regional rail compa-nies would run prestige national services on a
largely intact InterCity network under a plan emerging as a front-runner in
the cabinet committee considering British Rail's privatisation.
Ministers are nearing a compromise agreement on BR privatisation which could
pave the way for publication soon of a white paper setting out the
government's plans.
The Department of Transport hopes the deal will reconcile Mr John Major's
preference for reviving pre-war regional rail companies with the
determination of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, who wants to
keep the privatised InterCity network as a viable entity.
Cabinet ministers have embarked on an intensive series of meetings on BR's
future in an attempt to resolve the row which has already delayed the white
paper at least once.
No final decisions have been taken on how the sell-off will be implemented,
but Mr Rifkind has said that a white paper would be published ahead of the
general election. There were suggestions at Westminster last night that it
might be released within two weeks, although a date later in February
appeared more likely.
The government originally hoped for publication late last year. With BR
privatisation set to be a central part of the Conservative party's election
manifesto, Mr Major is anxious to avoid unnecessary delays.
Ministers have agreed that BR's monopoly has to be broken and that private
operators must be given open access to tracks. They are also agreed that an
independent regulatory organisation would be required to resolve disputes
if, say, InterCity refused to permit access to its rail network.
Under the compromise now being worked on, companies for each region would
operate under a franchise system and would receive public subsidy. They
might be allowed to lay new tracks or use InterCity lines for running
services from provincial areas to London.
The freight network, which like InterCity is usually profitable, would
remain as one company and buy the use of track from InterCity and the
regional companies. Network SouthEast might remain in the public sector or
parts could be transfered to the regional operators.
Mr Major wants to revive the pre-war networks of regional companies - the
so-called 'golden age' scenario - but would have to accept InterCity
remaining in one piece if the compromise proposals were agreed.
Mr Rifkind wants to see an expanding rail network but fears that any
break-up of InterCity would lead to the abolition of many unprofitable
services.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Recruiters target ex-Soviet missile scientists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   DNEPROPETROVSK, UKRAINE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN headhunters are recruiting specialists from Dnepropetrovsk, the
missile-building capital of the former Soviet Union, to work in the Middle
East and elsewhere. Local businessmen say rocket scientists are among those
seeking to work abroad.
The recruitment drive at the centre where all Soviet intercontinental
ballistic missiles, including the SS18 and SS24, are built and designed
raises the spectre of Soviet arms technology proliferating to countries such
as Iraq, Iran and Libya.
Yesterday Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to the UN, denied
reports in an Arabic magazine that Iran had already purchased three nuclear
weapons, possibly from Kazakhstan, for between Dollars 130m (Pounds 71m) and
Dollars 150m.
The magazine, Al-Watan Al-Arabi, also claimed that Iran had hired more than
50 Soviet nuclear experts at salaries of Dollars 5,000 a month.
Proliferation of Soviet arms is a danger to which western leaders are
acutely sensitive. Yesterday on German radio Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
Germany's foreign minister, warned that unemployed Soviet military
specialists are 'wandering technological mercenaries . . . easy prey for
recruiters for irresponsible potentates' who have the dangerous ambition of
building weapons of mass destruction'.
Mr Genscher proposed western states create funds to help prevent such a
brain drain. At the same time, officials accompanying Mr Roland Dumas, the
French foreign minister, on a visit to the former Soviet Union, said Russian
authorities might be willing to take legal action to prevent military
specialists from peddling their skills abroad.
But in Dnepropetrovsk fledgling entrepreneurs think military knowhow could
be one of their depressed region's most promising exports.
'If the Libyan government asked me to find rocket scientists I would be
happy help,' says Mr Viacheslav Kostiukovych, assistant director of Sistema
Reserve, an American-Ukrainian joint venture in the city which is primarily
involved in publishing.
Mr Kostiukovych has no doubt that if the price was right, Dnepropetrovsk's
military specialists would be willing and able to work abroad - he believes
some are already employed in the Middle East.
Sistema Reserve has an entree into the business: this spring it was asked by
the International Employment Agency, based in Liechtenstein, to recruit
specialists to work abroad, with special reference to the Middle East.
IEA emphasised that 'there is no limit to the amount of candidates that you
can recruit' and offered annual starting salaries of Dollars 30,000, (Pounds
16,600), a complete benefit package, pre-paid air fares and assistance in
obtaining visas.
Dnepropetrovsk is the home of Iuzhny Mashinostroitelny Zavod (Iuzhmash), the
largest integrated missile production facility in the world.
According to Mr Leonid Kuchma, the director of Iuzhmash, some 3,000 of the
50,000 people employed by the complex are specialists with knowledge of
sensitive rocket technology.
As the enterprise has shifted from 85 per cent military production five
years ago to a current 30 per cent, those specialists are now making
umbrellas, sausage-making machines and rose petal dryers instead of
missiles.
Mr Kuchma brushes aside fears of a brain drain to the Middle East butMr Iuri
Alexeyev, chief engineer is not so sure.

FT  24 JAN 92 / How Kinnock gets it wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tories are on the verge of political bankruptcy, but they have an ace up
their sleeves. 'Vote for us,' they are saying, 'because we are not the
Labour party'. This proposition lacks nobility. It does not speak of
national regeneration, or enhanced prosperity, or a more competitive stance
in an ever-tougher world. Yet it worked in 1979, 1983 and 1987, when an
overwhelming majority of the electorate rejected Labour.
In those years, the kernel of the matter - that the Labour party could not
be trusted - was contained within a respectable shell of policy. Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives did have something definite to say. She
may have won three times simply because most voters are anti-socialist, but
once in office she could defend her policies against the small print of her
election statements. She could tell herself that she was a conviction
politician and that the nation favoured those convictions.
This time it may be different. I am open to correction when the Tory
manifesto appears, but on the basis of what is known today the shell of
policy is likely to be so thin as to be transparent. A Citizen's Charter and
a bit of rail privatisation will be welcome, but even taken with other bits
and bobs, such as reform of inheritance tax, the package that is expected is
unlikely to be described as conviction-driven or intellectually coherent.
This does not mean that the government's strategy will fail. In modern
democracies challengers tend to lose elections if they promise extra
spending without extra taxation, or, worse, threaten to raise taxes. As
Adlai Stevenson and Michael Dukakis in the US and Hugh Gaitskell in Britain
discovered in contests now long forgotten, arousing suspicions about tax can
seriously damage your electoral health. This year nobody doubts that Labour
is the party of higher personal taxation. The fuzzy area is how far down the
income-scale it will reach. The Conservatives can exploit this. They have
only to frighten a small number of people in relatively few marginal seats
in the south-east to deprive Mr Neil Kinnock of victory and thus terminate
his career. That is why Wednesday night's crude election broadcast, with its
absurd allegations about Labour's tax proposals, may pay undeserved
dividends.
These observations on Conservative strategy should not be regarded as an
endorsement for Labour. Nuts to that. Mr Kinnock did produce a structured
argument during an FT interview with him on Wednesday, but it begins to
unravel under close examination. The advice he has been getting from his
staff is, in essence, that the old-style socialism thrice rejected in the
past decade was a peculiarly British response to the Conservatives' adoption
of the US model of the market economy. On this view, the Labour party was
right to turn to European social democracy. So far, so good.
There is some coherence to the accompanying exposition. As whispered in the
Labour leader's ear, Labour's policy reviews can be allied to debate about
the differences between the 'Anglo-American' theory that competitive markets
are an efficient method of allocating a given quantity of resources and the
supposed 'European' view that markets are dynamic forces that stimulate
accumulation but that can be destructive as well as constructive.
On the latter supposition, Mr Kinnock is advised, a regulatory framework and
state intervention become necessary adjuncts of economic strategy. But this
interventionism does not mean direct involvement. (The Labour leader spoke
of 'enabling'.) His advisers also place an emphasis on stability. The thrust
of investment, they say, should be in education and training, research,
design, and infrastructure. In most areas of economic policy there should be
a move away from discretionary instruments and towards institutional rules.
This would apply, for example, to competition policy.
A simpler way of putting what is a more complex case than I could properly
expound in such a small space is 'the German economy has succeeded while
Britain and America have run into trouble, so let's copy the Germans'. This
seems to be the unspoken proposition behind many of Mr Kinnock's
pronouncements. Put thus, his argument contains serious flaws.
First, the closer we get to an election the more the Labour party hedges. It
is straightforward about what it has dropped - nationalisation,
anti-Europeanism, unilateralism - but increasingly defensive about precisely
what it would do if elected. Thus Mr Kinnock spoke at length about Labour's
supply-side economics (see advice, above) but avoided spending commitments
that would make more than a small portion of it a reality. He spoke
eloquently about his framework for taxation, but dodged being pinned down on
detail.
Second, Labour is trying to pick up what suits it from Germany, leaving the
rest alone. Mr Kinnock was at his most wary on constitutional reform, and
evasive on proportional representation for the House of Commons. But
Germany's constitutional arrangements are a part of its method of managing
its affairs. Federation and a propensity to coalition are essential
ingredients of the entire polity.
Third, it is not the social democrats who have been the principal architects
of German success, but the Christian democrats. They do differ from
Thatcherite Tories in wholeheartedly accepting a 'social dimension' and a
rule-based framework of laws, but they are not models for Labour.
This is where the Tories could come in, if they had the wit to do so. They
could offer a positive set of policies to the British electorate, based on a
coherent 'one-nation' philosophy. The trouble is that they are not yet
ready.
Mr Christopher Patten, the chairman of the Conservative party, has
recognised that a conversion of Britain's Tories to the basic tenets of
Christian democracy would benefit the party. For all I know this view might
one day become acceptable to Mr John Major. The trouble is that the prime
minister has not been in office for long enough to convert his party to a
what would be a dramatically different way of thinking. To achieve that he
needs to convince himself that such a change is right. Then he needs to win
his own mandate.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Letter: Clamour of support needed for Gatt leader's draft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr B PERSAUD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf ('The Gatt makes its last stand', January 20) is so right
to call attention to the scope which now exists for concluding the Uruguay
Round successfully on the basis of the very helpful draft final act put
together by the Gatt director general, Arthur Dunkel.
The article is very timely and in a very good cause in pointing out the
significant gains made in the negotiations in many areas - agriculture,
textiles, services, disputes settlement, emergency protection etc - and the
great need to prevent any unravelling by industrialised countries seeking to
advance national positions even further.
His exaggerated claim that 'never have the fundamental principles of the
Gatt been more enthusiastically embraced' is excusable under the
circumstances.
He should, however, have emphasised even more the significant consequences
of failure and the need for greater international support of Mr Dunkel's
draft. Also, there is the real danger of a collapse of the whole package by
a hardening of the US position in such areas as agriculture, textiles and
intellectual property rights and vis-a-vis Japan, if the negotiations are
not completed before trade policy becomes an issue in the US presidential
election.
The greatest threat to the international trading system arises from the
unreasonable and petty attitude of the US and other leading countries to
Japanese economic and export success and the reluctance of the Japanese to
use the fortunate position of their persistent current account surpluses to
provide liberal leadership in the Uruguay Round.
All who believe in market systems should be clamouring for support of Mr
Dunkel's draft.
But if and when it is accepted Mr Wolf should note that much would remain
outstanding, especially in relation to the need for quick progress in
dismantling high levels of protection against exports from developing
countries, many of which are now in the forefront of import liberalisation.

Of what does a Londoner have 1 1/2 times more than a New Yorker, 2 1/2 times
more than a Parisian, and 11 1/2 times more than a citizen of Tokyo?
The answer is available park space. And Tokyo's per capita average of a mere
2.6 square metres to London's 30 is combining with another Japanese
statistic to cause the Tokyo authorities to contemplate re-writing a well
known proverb to read: What you lose on the swings, you gain in the
bathchairs.
With Japan's birthrate at a record low and forecast to keep falling into the
next century, the share of the population made up of over-65s is expected to
rise from its present 10 per cent to 25 by the year 2019. So planners are
considering pruning Tokyo's parks of the seesaws and such for weenies, and
replacing them with diversions for wrinklies.
One of them, says the construction ministry, is a croquet-like game called
gateball. Other possibilities include greenhouses for elderly gardeners and
cafes serving green tea.

Eyeballs bulged north of the Border yesterday. Could they really be looking
at the Scottish edition of The Sun fronted by a blue-and-white St Andrew's
cross, and then seven pages urging independence for Scotland, to which even
the page-three girl succumbed?
The paper used to string along with its London edition in backing the
Conservatives and rejecting Labour's scheme for a devolved Scottish
parliament, let alone independence. But now it says Scotland should become a
separate member of the European Community, raising its own taxes and keeping
its oil revenues. 'Then we could stop blaming everything on the Sassenachs
at Westminster.'
Oddly enough, there is a stream of Scottish Tory thinking that, failing the
status quo, would prefer independence to the fudge of devolution. But the
reason for the switch is probably the battle for popular readership in
Scotland where the Mirror Group's Daily Record has a circulation of about
700,000 against the
Scottish Sun's 280,000.
Its editor Bob Bird explains that he reached the decision after 'listening
to our readers'. But although he says he has complete editorial
independence, it's hard to believe that Rupert Murdoch did not have the
decisive voice.

The chairmanship of the Securities and Investments Board is proving a bit
like the job of secretary of state for trade and industry. It is hard for
the incumbent to prove that he has done a good job; it is therefore
difficult to recruit the very best talent and then keep it.
Sir David Walker, who has decided not to seek a second term, was the
establishment figure supposed to correct the errors of Sir Kenneth Berrill's
first term. He has simplified the structure and sharpened the focus. But he
has not been an unqualified success and several of his reforms have got
bogged down.
That said, much the most interesting aspect is what Sir David is going to do
next. He has just turned 52, he is not ill, nor is he a rich man. He won't
be able to survive on the Pounds 500 a year the Bank of England pays
non-executive directors. Pen Kent has filled his old job at the Bank and
there are no obvious vacancies for a man of his seniority.
He might be a long-odds candidate for the governorship but the choice is not
going to be made until after the election. A highly-paid private sector job
perhaps? Lloyds Bank, for example, needs a successor to Sir Jeremy Morse as
chairman. Or perhaps he might want to play a bigger role at that other
Lloyd's?

No surprise that ubiquitous Tony O'Reilly - top bean at Heinz, balked bidder

Trust.
However, also on the list of Bankers' luminous European experts is 'a

That is Greek-born Chryss O'Reilly, the Goulandris shipping heiress, who
also happened to emerge last year as the second Mrs O'Reilly.
'What kind of question is that?', the bank's mouthpiece snapped when asked
why it sought her wisdom on European strategy. The multi-

of tying the knot with the gifted Irishman.
Yet according to one of her acquaintances, a fellow Greek, the expert

The house of Warburg is not accustomed to being sacked. As the UK's most
successful investment bank, it can afford to be fastidious about the clients
it deigns to serve.
What an affront, therefore, when one of Warburg's less successful customers
dares to intimate that it might obtain better financial advice elsewhere.
Nevertheless, the defector, Gerry Robinson, new chief executive of
television and leisure group Granada, is clearly not in awe of Warburg's
reputation, even though partly indebted to the bank for his job. For
Warburg's part, having been dumped as Granada's financial adviser in favour
of Lazard Brothers, it has haughtily resigned from its separate role as
Granda's joint broker.
So why does the group want a new adviser? The official explanation is that
Robinson worked closely with Lazard when he headed Compass, a fast-growing
service company. But Granada was never happy about the high-handed way the
City demanded the sacrifice of the group's chief executive in return for
agreeing to a vital rights issue.
At the time, some Granada employees felt that Warburg had crossed the fuzzy
boundary between giving advice and interfering in the company's affairs. But
the money came rolling in, and as one Warburg wag said: 'It's the first time
anyone has been sacked for saving a company'.
Perhaps this sort of arrogance helps explain the decision.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: Surrealist comes out of the closet - The work of
Alberto Savinio currently at the Accademia Italiana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not the easiest thing to be the artist son or younger brother of an
established reputation, especially if that reputation is critically
uncertain or in decline. Invisibility, in such a case, is not quite the
physical impossibility we might suppose. It took two major surveys of 20th
century Italian art, at the Royal Academy in London early in 1989 and at the
Palazzo Grassi in Venice a few months later, both of them sponsored by Fiat,
and the Tate's On Classic Ground in 1990, sponsored by Reed International,
to bring the surrealist painter, Alberto Savinio, back into the light in
propria persona. And now the Accademia Italiana happily completes the
process by bringing to London a select but ample retrospective of his life's
work (24 Rutland Gate, until February 23: sponsored by the Banco di Santo
Spirito and, for the catalogue, by Alenia).
Savinio, who died in 1952 at the age of 60, was the younger brother of
Giorgio de Chirico, the first and foremost of the Italian metaphysical
painters of the years around the First World War. He took his pseudonym in
1914 to distinguish himself from his brother's celebrity, in Italy at least,
for he was active himself within the avant-garde circles of Futurism and the
Metaphysical Movement, though as writer and composer rather than as painter.
It was not until 1927 that he turned to painting, but by then, though he
would win enough domestic reputation over the next 25 years to merit a
memorial show at the Venice Biennale of 1954, the world had moved on.
We should not be too surprised at his comparative obscurity. It is true of
all national schools that they contain artists of true quality and stature
that the rest of the world knows little about - we think of our own Spencer,
Bomberg, Matthew Smith, Freud until lately, even Sickert.
If Savinio's case is unusual, the fault is somewhat of his brother's making,
or rather of his critics' reading of his work. For metaphysical painting,
forerunner of surrealism yet quite distinct, and admittedly of authentic
art-historical significance, was held by the 1920s to have had its day. And
with it, down the critical chute, went de Chirico, of whom the long-received
opinion was not that his later work was of marginal interest, but of no
interest or worth at all.
The retrieval from neglect of Italian painting between the wars in general,
and the rightful reappraisal within it of de Chirico in his later career,
have been among the more interesting moves in our revisionist times. The
perhaps unexpected effect has been not merely to re-examine the movements
and tendencies of which artists as various as Sironi, Carra, Martini,
Morandi, Pirandello, de Pisis, Casorati, Severini and, of course, Savinio
were a part, but to put greater and particular emphasis on the work of the
individuals themselves.
Savinio is as notable a beneficiary as any, paradoxically so in having so
long persevered under a pseudonym he manifestly never needed. He is truer,
which is to say more unequivocal a surrealist, than his brother, if
surrealism, of which the very essence is contradiction and ambiguity, could
ever be unequivocal. Unequivocally ambiguous might do it. His imagery is
rich in transformations, monstrosities and double-functions, in a tradition
that goes back to Bosch and Archimboldo: faces as concoctions of still-life;
figures with the heads of ostrich, owl or turkey-cock; emblematic heaps of
brightly coloured blocks, balls, poles. And over all there hangs the sense
of ancient spirits, gods and demons, the more threatening and disconcerting
for lurking in such a comical and lugubrious manner. Neptune rises monstrous
at the far end of the silent, deserted quay. The river god peers boggle-eyed
above the farthest mountains.
Surrealism is essentially a literary genre, drawing its imaginative
authority from the power of its imagery, and the interpretative indulgence
it affords. The execution must shift for itself, and Savinio, with his
habitual desiccated tempera surfaces, carries it off more by his
whole-heartedness than technical sophistication, more enjoyably robust than
subtle in its seductions. Yet surrealism in its Italian variety always
retains a quality of the metaphysical, a quality of mood and atmosphere, a
heightened, febrile atmosphere at that, fraught with the sense of nightmare,
of an impending, unknowable doom. The form is too solid, the space too
clear, the light too strong for comfort.
Like his brother, Savinio will always keep the fearful patient's temperature
a degree or two too high.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: Hamlet - Oxford Playhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Theatr Clwyd's colourful, energetic and uneven Hamlet is the company's first
British touring production of this scale and scope (Glasgow, Blackpool,
Oxford, Chichester, Brighton), and one of its five shows now on tour. It is
worth seeing for Geraint Wyn Davies' Hamlet, but the rest of Toby
Robertson's production drains one's patience.
The plain set, bronze panels bearing latin inscriptions and funeral/marriage
flowers, opens onto a glass that holds the mirror up to nature; for the most
part, the action is uncluttered. However, the costumes are a visual
distraction. They turn the Danish court into an apres-ski all lycra, leather
and velvet in ocres and reds. The contrast with Hamlet's black 'suits of
woe' is the evening's best visual thrill. White masks are painted on the
faces of courtiers, signifying complicity (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
arrive barefaced, and end up white); when Hamlet feigns madness, he opts for
white stripes.
The acting is patchy. The tense opening scene so much praised by Coleridge
is dissipated by over-emphasis: intensity is not conveyed only by panic. The
Ghost (Robert Arnold) has strayed in from a Las Vegas revue trailing plumes,
shimmer and smoke; only when he speaks does the seriousness emerge. The same
actor plays Polonius as by turns silly and wise, flapping like a winged
plover. Horatio (Howard Antony) is dependable but ponderous, well short of
even having a philosophy, let alone one with dreams.
The King (David Keller) is a horror of jollity, both spiteful and vicious.
Martin Mckellan, successfully cast as Gertrude, maintains a chilly distance
from Hamlet, and adds a new strangeness to the play; but Ophelia (Sonia
Forbes Adam) seems slight. Perhaps an all-male casting policy would have
been more rigorous. The Cheek By Jowl Company's As You Like It recently
showed how good an all-male Shakespeare could be, if a director takes that
option.
The production's shortcomings are redeemed by Geraint Wyn Davies' Hamlet. He
plays him as a sane, intelligent, depressive overwhelmed by events and
facing difficulties as if for the first time: 'Oh what a rogue and peasant
slave am I' treads an exact line between the depressive's self-distraction
and the need to get things done. 'To be, or not to be' (spoken as Davies
bounds on stage) comes as a revelation, the discovery of a way out; and 'Get
thee to a nunnery' finds a cool, level hate for Ophelia. Elsewhere, Davies
is exact, losing the power of action in the energy of resolve.
This Hamlet, at just over three hours, has been cut for action; but the
point of Shakespeare's play (his longest) is in its digressions. Robertson's
cuts, particularly in Horatio's lines, make the play less lyrical, eschewing
the compensations of reflection: out go Horatio's haunting lines abut the
dawn together with his final catalogue of accidental murders and casual
slaughters; the tragedy earns these insights, and a traditional performance
like this one is incomplete without them. The ending lacks an ending.
(Chichester Festival Theatre, January 27-February 1; Brighton Theatre Royal,
February 3-8).

In the Mayfair offices of the firm he founded 58 years ago, Mr Erdman flicks

had some fun with him . . . Sir Isaac Wolfson, my most difficult client . .
. ' His collection of portraits and reminiscences amounts to a who's who of
the property industry.
His anecdotes, which he collected and published in 1982*, give a
affectionate, but revealing account of the entrepreneurs, agents and
builders who dominated the property industry for much of the century.
Mr Erdman's scrap-book contains a letter to the uncle of Mr John Ritblat,
the future boss of British Land, explaining why he had refused the young
Ritblat a job on leaving school.
'I thought he would be far too ambitious to settle down patiently to the
disciplines and rigours of a professional career,' he wrote.
Mr Erdman was persuaded to change his mind after learning that the young
John had a suitably professional background (his father was a Hampstead
dentist). However, in a sense, his misgivings were well-founded. John
Ritblat soon left to set up his own agency, Conrad Ritblat.
Mr Erdman also recounts the gruelling initiation into the Hammerson Group of
Mr Sydney Mason (now the grand old man of property, after many years at the
head of the company).
On the first day of his new job in 1949, the nervous youth was sent by his
boss Mr Lew Hammerson to negotiate the acquisition of a site in Park Lane
with Mr Freddie Oberlander, the heavyweight world amateur wrestling
champion.
Another figurehead of the property industry, Lord Samuel of Land Securities,
suffered a nerve-wracking incident at the start of his career.
One day, drumming up business in the west end, Mr Harold Samuel was smoking
a cigarette to steady his nerves. When he went into the shop to talk to his
owner, he stubbed out the cigarette, pocketed it and then found to his
'utter embarrassment and confusion', that he had set his coat pocket alight.
Mr Erdman's best stories concern Sir Isaac, the fiery, abrasive Scot who
built up Great Universal Stores (GUS) in more than 100 takeovers. Mr Erdman,
who advised him throughout on property valuations, pays tribute to Sir
Isaac's infectious enthusiasm. 'I often found myself almost rushing out of
his office in eagerness to do the next deal,' he says.
He also shows the darker side of the tycoon, who was 'tough on the payment
of fees' in his early days and who domineered over his executives, even
insisting that they breakfasted with him at 7.30am. Once when his Mr Erdman
and another agent were discussing a sale with Sir Isaac a waiter appeared
with coffee and biscuits. 'Who told you to bring biscuits?' snarled Sir
Isaac. These people are not customers, they are only agents. Take the
biscuits away.'
When, in 1955, Mr Erdman, did his first valuation of GUS's properties, Sir
Isaac went through each valuation, yelling when he saw what he thought was a
conservative valuation: 'You (Erdman), are not a valuer, you are a butcher.'
But to his surprise, IW (as Mr Erdman refers to him) slapped him on the
shoulder when he finished and said: 'Ah, well, I think you have done a good
job.'
Mr Erdman, now a spry 85-year-old, did not bow out of the property industry
when he retired. He is president of a housing association, a non-executive
director of Chesterfield Properties and Warnford Investments and he
continues to take an interest in his former surveying practice, which is now
an international firm.
There is a trace of regret in his voice when he talks about the surveying
profession. He contrasts today's 'young university trained surveyors with
their computers' with the old-style agents who built their experience from
pounding the streets, assessing the value of each and every property and
from many years of 'trust, confidence and personal contact with individual
clients'.
'In those days, there was a special flair and intuition. That has almost
disappeared,' he mourns.
The change has been 'a bitter pill' for the old-style surveyors who think
that modern commercial standards, competition and outside capital investment
will lower professional ethics, he says.
'I look at this business from a different angle from today. The boss of our
business was principle not principal.'
For all that, Mr Erdman concludes that surveying practices like his own are
on the right path. And he does not suggest that all agents behaved
impeccably in the old days. Back in the early 1930s, one of his colleagues
whose job was to canvass shopkeepers for business, got away with being on
three separate payrolls simultaneously.
Mr Erdman's long memory is particularly valuable in assessing the severity
of this property downturn. The paucity of records in the industry makes it
difficult to judge the severity of the current recession against those in
the first half of the century. Mr Erdman reckons the present slump is the
worst he has experienced.
In the 1930s, the emerging retail multiples needed more shops, which
partially offset the ravages of the depression. Even so, his description of
Regent Street in 1937 bears an eerie similarity to the present crash. 'Many
well built crown properties on the west side were empty and to let. Some
occupiers during the slump even complained they could not pay the rates.'
There was a hiatus in the London property market during the second world
war, although there was no shortage of demand for buildings from the army
and government. After the war, Mr Erdman returned and re-opened the practice
in Mayfair, and tried to find offices for businesses which wanted to
reestablish themselves.
Since domestic servants were no longer easily obtainable, many occupants of
large Mayfair houses decided to move away. Mr Erdman matched demand with
supply by obtaining temporary licenses from the Greater London Council to
use the houses as offices (some of which have recently reverted to
residential use).
The 1974 property crash was 'no comparison at all' with the current
downturn, according to Mr Erdman. As one of the seven specialists who sat on
the Treasury's property advisory panel in 1974, he thought that the problems
were manageable.
'As rents were reasonable and there was not a huge oversupply of new
buildings, all that was necessary was to ensure that people did not rush
into forced sales'.
By contrast, Mr Erdman is damning about the current state of the market.
'In the 1980s everything went mad. Rents and capital values rocketed.
Without wearing glasses, anyone could see that the market was overheated.
Younger and younger people were coming into the business and they got the
idea that things keep going up and don't go down.'
'I have been through three recessions,' he concludes. This one is the worst
because too much money was lent without caution.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / Management: Why the American Challenge ran out of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever happened to Le Defi Americain? Twenty-five years ago, when some of
us were only just starting to cut our teeth on the business world, this
elegant French thesis about the coming supremacy of US multinationals over
the Europeans was on everyone's lips.
Within a few years, the doctrine - literally, 'The American Challenge'  -
grew decidedly shaky, as European companies showed themselves remarkably
resilient against their US rivals. By the mid-1970s, with a rampant Japan on
the rise, it was dead.
Unlike 1960s fashions in most other aspects of society today, it shows no
sign of coming back into vogue. Disney is expanding in France, GE in Britain
and eastern Europe, while Philip Morris is rumoured to be back on the
European takeover warpath. But with the debacle of President Bush's trade
mission to Japan coming hard on the heels of the latest travails of IBM and
General Motors, it is evident to everyone that American big business is in
deep competitive trouble - not just against Japan, but also vis-a-vis
Europe.
The trouble may be even deeper than most people realise. For the last five
years, many American executives, economists and government policy-makers
have consoled themselves with the results of a widely quoted 1987 study of
international trade patterns. In essence, this showed that though the US
share of world exports had declined between the late 1950s and the
mid-1980s, exports from the overseas operations of US multinationals were
enabling them to hold their overall share of world trade.
Now, in a study guaranteed to make President Bush and many of his
compatriots positively bilious, a US professor has concluded that the
aggregate world share of very large American corporations has fallen far
more sharply than is generally thought, especially since the mid-1980s.
The study covers revenues from all sources, including domestic sales from
local production, which were not examined by the 1987 report. It has just
been published under the provocative title of Global Corporate Competition:
is the large American firm an endangered species?*
By analysing Fortune magazine's regular tables of top US and non-US
companies, Lawrence Franko of the University of Massachusetts has compiled a
set of global corporate 'Top 12' league tables for 15 separate industries
from 1960 through to 1990. His tables show two things: how many companies
headquartered in various countries appear in each industry's top 12; and,
for that industry, each country's collective 'world market share' - defined
as its percentage of the aggregate dollar sales revenues of the Top 12.
To the obvious objection that exchange rate fluctuations may have distorted
some of his results - notably for 1990 - Franko points out that the dollar
was also weak at other times over the study period, including in 1980 and
1988.
Takeovers and diversification beyond the strict bounds of a particular
industry may also have distorted the rankings from time to time, as may the
divestment programmes which have frequently followed such splurges. But
Franko makes some adjustment for this.
However, the overall downward US trend has been so sharp in most industries
as to make most objections little more than marginal. US companies have held
their 'world market share' of the professor's league tables since 1980 only
in aerospace, food and beverages, and (almost) paper and paper products. In
most cases, the main gainers have been Japan and Korea. But one European
country or another has surged forward in motors (Germany), banking (France),
food (Switzerland), iron and steel (Germany), paper (Sweden),
pharmaceuticals (UK), and tyres (France).
Does all this matter or is it just the expression of an increasingly
international world economy, where the US share will fall inevitably as
other nations build industrial prowess? Robert Reich, the influential US
economist, argues that corporate nationality is of fast declining
importance, since traditionally 'headquarters activities' such as research
and development are becoming dispersed geographically within 'transnational'
corporations.
Franko contests this. The most highly skilled - and highly paid - jobs are
still 'nearly universally located at headquarters' he claims. So is
decision-making over such sensitive issues as multinational tax allocation.
Franko may overstate slightly his case on the 'headquarters effect': in
reality, research and development activities, together with other corporate
decision-making jobs, are becoming quite widely dispersed in several of the
companies which appear in his various Top 12s. But these are still the
pathfinders: his general argument remains powerful. He is also right in
rebutting hopes that smaller US companies - the likes of Apple and
Microsoft, for example - may 'ride to the rescue of the nation'. During the
last 30 years, the Japanese, Koreans and the Europeans have been performing
this transformation more effectively than American counterparts, Franko
concludes.
Apart from the obvious observation that by no means all European countries -
notably Britain - have been performing nearly as well as he implies, one can
only concur with his judgment - and with his statement that the nationality
of a company's ownership can still matter considerably. Not invariably,
perhaps, but often enough to make it a cause for concern.
So what price a late 1990s French tome called 'Le Defaut Americain'? The
D-word has alternative meanings: 'shortcoming' and 'complete absence'. Take
your pick.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Management: Adopting the Lotus position - Gay rights / Why
US companies are copying a revolutionary initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has the age of the 'spousal equivalent' dawned ? Perhaps in Massachusetts,
where Lotus Development Corporation - the large US software company - has
taken the bold step of extending healthcare and other benefits to partners
of its gay employees.
Even in the huge and diverse US market, this is radical thinking.
Initiatives recognising employment rights for homosexual workers have
usually been confined to a handful of public sector employers, such as
Manhattan's Montefiore Hospital, or small 'ideologically-sound' companies
like Ben &amp; Jerry's, the Vermont-based ice cream manufacturer, and the
Village Voice, a left-leaning New York publisher.
Lotus, on the other hand, has more than 3,000 US employees and worldwide
name recognition. As such, it is by far the largest, and most high-profile,
corporation to extend employee benefits to 'non-traditional family units'.
No one pretends that this mould-breaking package was achieved easily - the
initiative came from a handful of determined employees and was hammered out
over many months  - but repercussions from the move have been immediate and
widespread.
On the one hand, says Lotus, some 75 companies have been in contact,
requesting details or asking about the plan's implementation. These, it
adds, have ranged from large multinationals to small domestic businesses. On
the other, the US media has picked up on the subject, and gay rights in the
workplace have become a hot topic of debate.
As with the furore over sexual harassment last year, it is questionable
whether this heightened awareness, in itself, will bring practical change.
But most activists are convinced that discussion alone is useful in
dismantling barriers. 'Even if a corporation decides against a change in
their benefits plan,' comments Ruth Harlow at the American Civil Liberties
Union, 'the simple fact of airing the issue helps'.
Under current US law - and in contrast to popular perception abroad - gay
employees have relatively little protection when it comes to working
conditions. Although a 'gay rights' bill is pending in Congress, few
activists expect this to find its way on to the statute book in the
short-term. In the meantime, federal protection is virtually non-existent.
At the state level, matters are only slightly more advanced. Four states -
Wisconsin, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Connecticut - plus the District of
Columbia, have enacted measures banning discrimination on grounds of sexual
orientation. A smattering of cities and municipalities - including New York
 -have similar laws. Some companies, meanwhile, have taken the initiative
into their own hands, and spelt out individual anti-discrimination policies.
This position may eventually improve, but progress has been noticeably
patchy in recent times. Legislation supportive of gay rights has just been
passed in New Jersey, for example, and was signed only days ago by Governor
Jim Florio.
But homosexual employees in California, the most heavily-populated state,
suffered an important setback when Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a similar
measure last autumn.
Given a widespread reluctance to state sexual preference, it is difficult to
assess the number of employees who may be directly interested in the matter.
However, the conventional assumption is that some 10 per cent of the US
labour force is either gay or lesbian. If correct, this translates to 13m
people, the equivalent of almost half Britain's working population.
So, in an area which has arguably been neglected for far too long, what has
the Lotus deal achieved ? The package itself is relatively straightforward.
All US Lotus employment policies will simply add the term 'spousal
equivalent', whenever the word 'spouse' is used. This applies across the
board - in relocation matters, questions of bereavement leave, expatriate
assignments, as well as for healthcare and medical benefits.
To qualify as a spousal equivalent, the person must be the sole partner of
the employee. He or she must also be the same sex as the employee; live in
the same residence 'with the intent to reside together permanently' and 'be
jointly responsible for the common welfare and financial obligations of both
individuals'. Plainly, this does not extend the notion of 'spousal
equivalents' to unmarried partners in heterosexual relationships. Lotus
justifies this stance by pointing out that state law does not permit gay and
lesbian couples the option of marrying.
Superficially, the Lotus initiative seems to come at an inauspicious time.
After all, are all US employers not acutely aware of mounting healthcare
costs and will the Aids risk not drive up expenses in this particular case?
That, says Lotus firmly, is a misconception. It is true that the software
company is largely 'self-insured', which means that it meets most healthcare
costs out of its own pocket instead of paying hefty insurance premiums to a
commercial carrier. As a result, the task of implementing the new scheme was
made a good deal easier.
Nevertheless, the company itself is clearly at risk, and did its homework
accordingly. Where precedents have been set, Lotus claims, experience has
not been particularly adverse. 'Data indicates that coverage of same-sex
employees and their partners has not significantly increased per capita
healthcare costs,' it told employees in an internal memo.
In fact, perhaps the bleakest element in the Lotus story is that only a
dozen employees have taken advantage of the scheme to date. This, in turn,
seems to mirror the experience of some progressive public sector employers
operating similar benefit packages. All of which points to a rather gloomy
conclusion: improved benefits, one suspects, can go so far, but making
everyone comfortable about taking them up is another matter altogether.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Struggle against ignorance and a lack
of interest - Promoting non-academic studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT is an NVQ? Or a BTEC? Most people in Britain have not the faintest
idea.
Such ignorance sums up the country's training weakness, which Mr John Major
made a robust attempt to combat yesterday.
Asked recently by Gallup pollsters: 'Have you heard of national vocational
qualifications?' 61 per cent replied 'no'. Of those, more than half said:
'No, and I'm not interested.' Among semi-skilled and unskilled workers -
those for whom vocational qualifications are primarily designed - the
proportion saying 'no' rose to three quarters, with 50 per cent of the
unskilled uninterested.
True, almost half of those questioned believed that better training would
improve their performance at work - a marked improvement on previous
surveys. Marrying belief to remedy, though, has defied British policymakers
for a generation.
Measured by initiatives, the government scores highly.
In 1986 it established the National Council for Vocational Qualifications
(NCVQ) to streamline the plethora of existing qualifications and to accredit
NVQs (as they were named) for all levels of the workforce.
The council expects to complete the task by next year, working closely with
the three main providers of vocational courses, the Business and Technician
Education Council, City and Guilds and the Royal Society of Arts.
Last May came the government's white paper on education and training,
presaging most of the items announced by Mr Major yesterday.
In particular, it heralded 'general national vocational qualifications'  -
intended as full-time, vocationally oriented alternatives to A-levels to be
taken in schools and colleges - and 'advanced' diplomas  - to be awarded to
those with three A-levels or the vocational equivalent and intended to
constitute the minimum higher-education entry standard.
According to Mr Major, vocational qualifications deserve parity of esteem
with their GCSE and A-level counterparts - and, once they have gained it,
will generate a training revolution in Britain.
His optimism is shared by Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post Office,
who also chairs the council. Sir Bryan wants to see 1m people with NVQs by
1995 (a tenfold increase on the present level), and boasts that by the end
of this year the council will have the framework in place.
'Thereafter, it will be a sweeping-up exercise and painting the Forth
Bridge,' he says.
The 1m target is ambitious. It cannot be achieved solely through training
young people, under government-funded schemes such as Youth Training, but
will rely on schools and training in the workplace. Only a handful of
schools has been persuaded to offer NVQs, and only a small cadre of
companies accounts for most of today's 100,000 people with NVQs.
Boots the Chemist, Safeway, Rover Group, B&amp;Q and WH Smith are prominent
among them. Boots is one of the most enthusiastic, after extensive piloting.
Boardroom scepticism remains widespread, however. One personnel director of
a large group declared himself not particularly concerned to promote NVQs
because he saw them as akin to other government-led initiatives - destined
to die when the next bright idea was launched. He also thought a Labour
government might abolish them - which Labour has always denied.
Other companies are wary. Asda, one of the largest food retailers in the UK,
is reviewing its participation in the scheme and may abandon it in favour of
an internal accreditation system, blaming the cost and inflexibility.
NVQs also have a long march ahead if they are to 'academic' courses. The
council's emphasis on testing competence in the workplace, rather than
setting examinations to be assessed externally, has limitations.
The Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC) first diploma in
business and finance, which claims parity of esteem with GCSE, comprises
such competence tests as these: file 20 consecutive documents correctly;
retrieve 20 items from a filing system correctly; correctly answer 10
incoming and outgoing telephone calls; take three oral messages accurately -
hardly a highway to university.
According to Mr Sig Prais, of the National Institute for Economic and Social
Research, much recent reform is 'purely cosmetic'.
He says: 'We are still a long way from the Continental idea of skill
training - which involves taking an examination course at college,
externally assessed, combined with practical experience at work.'
The council's mission is 'to provide the world's most effective national
framework of vocational qualifications'. A more modest goal of adapting to
British conditions the best on offer in Germany, France and the Netherlands
might be more appropriate.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions attack 'loopholes' in rules for
use of VDUs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH and safety rules covering an estimated 7m workers using visual
display units (VDUs) were issued yesterday and were immediately attacked by
trade unions and environmental health officers.
Unions said the rules provided too many loopholes for employers and failed
to meet the requirements of a European Community directive.
The Institution of Environmental Health Officers said the regulations might
lead safety inspectors to spend too much time visiting offices and
neglecting more dangerous premises.
The new rules, published in a consultation document by the Health and Safety
Executive, cover the design of desks and chairs as well as the provision of
work breaks and eye tests for VDU workers.
The TUC said the proposed regulations would not meet EC standards. Mr Alan
Tuffin, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union and chairman of
the TUC's health and safety committee, said the TUC would lobby unions
throughout the EC on the issue. Mr Tuffin is also a commissioner on the
Health and Safety Commission.
Unions say thousands of VDU workers will be excluded because the definition
of a regular user is too narrow. They also say the proposals would not
entitle all VDU workers to a full eye test.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Major defends vocational
qualifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER yesterday announced a new set of vocational
qualifications which will be available as an alternative to A-levels from
September.
Mr Major, speaking at a conference organised by the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications, said good vocational education was not inferior
to a good academic education.
He said that old-fashioned prejudices and snobberies could have no place in
the world of education and should have no place in society.
Mr Major said general national vocational qualifications (GNVQs) would be
available for schools and further education colleges to teach from this
autumn. The qualifications are based on the new system of vocational
qualifications but will be less job-specific than the national vocational
qualifications (NVQs).
He also said that from 1994, 'advanced diplomas' will be awarded to students
with three A-level passes or 'equivalent' vocational qualifications. GNVQs
and diplomas were outlined in the education and training for the
21st-century white paper.
The prime minister also endorsed the target for 1m people to have achieved
NVQs by 1995, a target set by the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications. At present, about 100,000 people hold such qualifications.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the national council and chairman and chief
executive of the Post Office, called on Britain's top companies to become
the first 1,000 to take up the challenge. Last year the Confederation of
British Industry, with the support of the government, the Trades Union
Congress and several other bodies set voluntary targets for the proportion
of people gaining NVQs.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour education spokesman, said Mr Major's speech was
'pathetic' and offered nothing new. 'This confirms the government has run
out of ideas about how to improve sorely needed skills in education and
training,' he said.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Qualifications record of ET is
attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of all trainees on youth training and Employment Training
programmes leave without a qualification, according to previously
unpublished figures revealed yesterday by the Labour party.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said that the Department of
Employment figures showed that only a third of those on Employment Training
(ET) obtained a qualification, while 67 per cent of Youth Training (YT)
trainees did not even gain a credit towards a national vocational
qualification.
The Labour attack came the day after a meeting of more than half the 82
Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) agreed to protest to the government
over the 'substantial reduction' in funding for training programmes, and was
timed to coincide with the prime minister's speech on training yesterday
afternoon.
Mr Blair added that only a quarter of ET trainees ended up in full-time
employment, while more than 60 per cent of ET and 35 per cent of YT trainees
were unable to get a job within three months of completing their course.
'The figures show conclusively that the government has been failing our
young people,' he said.
Mr Henry McLeish, an opposition employment spokesman, said: 'These figures
show the yawning gap between the rhetoric of the Conservatives and the
realities facing young people in Conservative Britain.'
New measures to improve relations between providers of Youth Training and
Tecs have persuaded the British Printing Industries Federation to reverse a
decision to stop being a managing agent for Youth Training.
The measures, drawn up by the Department of Employment, are due to be
announced next week. They will simplify the task cited by several large
companies of negotiating individually with the 82 Tecs and the 22 Local
Enterprise Companies, the Scottish equivalent to Tecs.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Plea goes to EC over help for
region - Ravenscraig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has applied to the European Commission for leave to declare
an enterprise zone in north Lanarkshire to offset the impact of closure of
the Ravenscraig steelworks, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Lang also told MPs he had written to Sir Bob Scholey, chairman of British
Steel about its proposals for Ravenscraig. His letter asks British Steel to
help deal with decontamination of the Ravenscraig site, partly by funding an
assessment to gauge which parts of it needed special treatment.
Mr Lang also asks British Steel to release evidence explaining why it had
opted for closure and to state how much extra funding will be provided to
British Steel (Industry) - a body set up to nurture new industries - to take
account of the additional job losses.
During a debate on Ravenscraig initiated by the Opposition, Mr Lang
challenged Labour to say how it would react to the situation. 'The party
opposite owes it to the House to tell us what they would do,' he said.
Earlier, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, had attacked government
inaction over Ravenscraig, which he said was typical of its 'hands-off,
do-nothing approach'.
While branding the government's package as 'incoherent and without shape',
he admitted there could be no promises of 'an overnight transformation.' He
did not consider nationalisation the answer.
Mr Dewar advocated keeping open 'as long as possible' the option of finding
a buyer while recognising the chances were slim. British Steel had probably
agreed to consider offers only because it doubted that there would be any.
An opposition motion condemning British Steel's repeated failure to invest
in its Scottish plants was defeated by 242 votes to 212.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock scorns PM's support for
business - Prime Minister's Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused Mr John Major, the prime
minister, in the Commons yesterday of ignoring 'the voice of business'.
Mr Kinnock claimed that the prime minister had been reduced to 'paralysis'
in face of the recession created by his policies.
His comment came during rowdy exchanges stimulated by election fever. Mr
Bernard Weatherill, the speaker, called on MPs to 'moderate their language'.
In a rebuke to Conservative and Labour MPs who have been subjecting the
rival party leaders to disorderly catcalls and barracking, he said: 'I hope
in this period of electioneering excitement we can keep off the
personalities and concentrate upon policies.'
Mr Weatherill warned Tory backbenchers not to repeat earlier breaches of the
rules of the House by questioning the prime minister - frequently at the
prompting of government whips - about Labour party policy for which he had
no responsibility.
The Labour leader cited the findings of a survey by the Association of
British Chambers of Commerce indicating worsening employment expectations,
higher job losses and declining business confidence.
He charged the prime minister with complacency and indolence in failing to
take action to remedy the situation.
Mr Major urged Mr Kinnock to take account of the view of the president of
the chambers of commerce that industry and commerce was on 'an improving
trend of slowly and steadily climbing out of recession'.
The prime minister highlighted a European Community report identifying the
UK as the only EC country where signs of sustained economic recovery were
discernible.
To government cheers, Mr Major claimed that investment by Japanese and
German companies indicated their confidence in the British economy.
He said: 'It is a shame that some of the doom and gloom-mongers in this
country do not share the same confidence.'
The prime minister also highlighted a survey of the 100 top companies
showing that 63 per cent believed that the recession would get worse under a
Labour government, while not one thought it would get better.
There was 'no enthusiasm whatsoever' among business men for a Labour
government, he said.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Iveco Ford optimistic over recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IVECO FORD TRUCK, the UK's second-biggest truck maker, has joined market
leader Leyland DAF in forecasting a recovery in the depressed UK truck
market later this year.
Mr Alan Fox, managing director of the company, which is majority-owned by
Fiat of Italy's Iveco commercial vehicles division, suggested that sales
would rise by about 15 per cent to 37,000 units from last year's 32,184.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show the
present sales plunge to have been the sharpest since the Second World War.
The Iveco Ford forecast is slightly more pessimistic than that of Leyland
DAF, whose marketing and sales director, Mr David Gill, has suggested a
level of 38,000 to 42,000, depending largely on the outcome and timing of
the general election.
Backing for the recovery view was provided by SMMT statistics for December,
which showed a drop of only 12.37 per cent in sales of all commercial
vehicles, to 11,288, compared with the previous year's level.
Black Horse Financial Services, a Lloyds Abbey Life subsidiary that markets
financial services to Lloyds Bank customers, yesterday ordered 2,000 Rover
218SLD Turbo cars for its regional staff.
The order, worth Pounds 26.5m, is a boost for the diesel sector, one of the
few fast-growing sectors of the UK market for new cars.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Model price for Matchbox toys: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 2-ft long scale model of a London double-decker bus sold for Pounds 1,100,
twice its estimate, at Sotheby's yesterday. A group of Matchbox toys,
estimated at up to Pounds 400, made Pounds 2,090. They were part of the
collection of tinplate and die-cast toys sent for sale by the receivers of
Mint &amp; Boxed, which went bankrupt last May with debts of more than Pounds
15m.
The company, started in 1983, spent lavishly in acquiring private
collections, but had less success in persuading buyers to pay record prices
for toys.
The top price from the two-day auction was Pounds 47,300, paid by a private
American buyer for a toy fairground carousel, with tiny figures riding on
pigs or shell-shaped chairs. It was made by Marklin of Germany in 1910 and
is very rare. The price was above forecast.
The same sum was paid by a German collector for a set of six horse-drawn
tinplate fire toys made in 1902 by Marklin. Other high prices were Pounds
11,000, against a top estimate of Pounds 1,500, paid for a Marklin Gauge I
electric Commodore Vanderbilt locomotive, carrying the legend New York
Central, and Pounds 9,900 for Leipzig station, made by Marklin in tinplate
around 1930.
In contrast, a marquetry-and-wood version of Euston station, constructed in
1938 and installed in the First Class booking hall there, sold below
forecast at Pounds 3,300.
The auction total of Pounds 580,740, with virtually everything sold, was
within Sotheby's target and underlined the continuing good demand for
collectables. The strongest sector was cars.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Mortgage rescue scheme launched by Nationwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE, the second-largest UK building society, launched the first stage
yesterday of a Pounds 150m mortgage rescue scheme to save 3,000 home owners
from losing their homes.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said: 'We believe it
should be possible to find a solution for every borrower who is in the
'can't pay' category.'
It is the first of a series of rescue measures from lenders who promised the
government they would put up Pounds 1bn to halve the 80,000 mortgage
repossessions that otherwise appeared inevitable this year.
The first stage of Nationwide's scheme is an Pounds 8m agreement with three
housing associations: London &amp; Quadrant, Notting Hill Housing Trust and
Newlon Housing. The associations will buy 100 homes in the London area,
enabling their owners to stay as tenants.
Rents will be substantially lower than mortgage interest payments, at
between 3.5 per cent and 8 per cent a year of the value of the house. Mr
Melville-Ross said rents in London would be closer to the lower figure,
although they would be 15 per cent higher than normal housing association
rents.
Separate valuations will be carried out by the housing associations and
Nationwide, and borrowers will have their arrears wiped out only if they
stay with the scheme for three years. Each rescue operation will run for an
initial five-year period, which can be extended to 20 years.
About 12 other building societies are negotiating with nearly two dozen
housing associations and they are expected to announce similar schemes in
the next few months.
Nationwide is also negotiating a scheme with local authorities in which
borrowers and their families stay in their homes while the local authority
pays Nationwide a sum equivalent to the cost of bed-and-breakfast
accommodation.
Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, welcomed the
initiatives, saying he expected them to be the first of many.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to maintain tax offensive -
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives signalled their determination to keep Labour on the
defensive over taxation yesterday, alleging that the 'phasing' of increases
in national insurance and income tax would decisively undercut its spending
pledges.
The attack coincided with an effort by Mr Michael Howard, the employment
secretary, to rekindle concern about Labour's plans for a minimum wage by
saying it would cost more than 2m jobs.
Following Mr Kinnock's interview yesterday in the Financial Times, Mr David
Mellor, the chief secretary of the Treasury, said Labour's immediate
commitments now totalled Pounds 4.75bn.
That comprised the Pounds 3.75bn it would cost to raise child benefit and
pensions and the Pounds 1bn economic recovery programme promised by the
opposition.
Mr Mellor said official figures given in response to parliamentary questions
showed that by abolishing the income ceiling on National Insurance
contributions and raising the top rate of income tax to 50 per cent, Labour
would raise an extra Pounds 3.85bn in the first year.
That left a shortfall of nearly Pounds 1bn, even if Labour dropped any
suggestion that the tax and national insurance contribution increases would
be phased. Mr Kinnock insisted in his interview that he would keep open the
option of phasing until after the election.
Mr Mellor has been given the role of ensuring tax remains a central issue in
the campaign. He said that Labour's attempt to present a prudent and
balanced tax and spending policy had 'fallen apart after just a few days
scrutiny'.
Mr Howard said Labour's plans for a national minimum wage, for a training
levy and for implementing the European Community's social action programme
would lead to the loss of a total of 2.25m jobs.
For the first time, the Tories provided a rough guide as to how the national
figures they claimed for job losses would be dispersed throughout the
regions and in some constituencies: worst hit would be the south-east and
greater London, which would lose 427,500 and 337,500 jobs respectively.
While Labour has emphasised commitment to a minimum wage at half median male
earnings, Tory figures were based on a promise that at some point the
minimum wage would rise to two-thirds male earnings, and assumed
differentials would be maintained in full.
Mr Howard also emphasised that Labour had other plans, such as cuts in
defence spending, that would threaten jobs.
He said: 'Dozens of constituencies would be desperately hard hit, including
those in Bristol, Derby and Nottingham.' Barrow would be devastated by
Labour's irresponsible approach to the defence of our country.'
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said the figures would not stand
serious scrutiny.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Onslaught by Meacher over poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A BLUNT address during an Opposition debate on poverty Mr Michael
Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, tried to portray the
government as one that neglected the poor, David Owen writes.
For the first time since 1945, he said, more than 10m people were living at
or below the income support level.
It would be surprising if child benefit survived the end of a fourth Tory
term in government, he continued.
For the government, Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, pledged
that the value of child benefit, retirement pensions and disability benefits
would be protected against inflation.
He forced an admission from Mr Meacher that a few individuals earning less
than Pounds 21,000 a year might pay more in national insurance contributions
under Labour. That might arise in cases where there were marked fluctuations
in weekly income levels, Labour admitted.
However, Mr Newton found it difficult to cite the social security select
committee to support his claim that people at all levels of income
distribution had become better off under the Tories.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, emphasised that the
smallest gains under the Conservatives had gone to the poorest individuals.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government to move against
defaulters - Poll Tax non-payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is trying to bring a quick end to its embarrassment over poll
tax non-payment. The embarrassment has been caused by confusion in
magistrates' courts about whether computer records are admissible evidence.
Mr John Major's close interest in the issue is reinforcing pressure on Mr
Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, to produce proposals over the next day or
so to ensure computer evidence can be admitted.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, announced yesterday that
councils would be given more time to take enforcement action against poll
tax defaulters. 'There will be no amnesty for non-payers,' he said.
The two years at present available to councils will be raised to six years
under regulations to be made shortly.
Mr Heseltine's extension of the deadline for taking action blocks the
loophole that would otherwise have meant people who had not paid from 1990
could have escaped action.
The threat of poll tax enforcement descending into chaos has pushed the
issue high up the political agenda, to the government's discomfort, although
ministers make what they can of the involvement of opposition politicians in
non-payment campaigns.
The latest pressure comes from the decision on Wednesday by the Clerkenwell
stipendiary magistrate in London that Camden council could not rely on
computer records as evidence of non-payment in default actions against 12
Camden residents. That followed a similar decision by magistrates at Bury St
Edmunds in Suffolk three weeks ago, which prompted some other magistrates to
halt all their poll tax cases until the matter had been cleared up.
At Westminster, Labour has signalled willingness to co-operate in enabling
the regulations to be enforced urgently, although Mr Bryan Gould, shadow
environment secretary, said yesterday that 'Labour councils have been
warning for months of the dangers that computer-generated evidence might not
be valid, and the government should have moved months ago'.
There have been suggestions that if default cases heard so far are declared
invalid because of the loophole, the government might face claims for
wrongful imprisonment.
More than 1.8m summonses have been issued for non-payment in London since
the tax was introduced, according to the Association of London Authorities.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Budget boost is urged to avert car factory closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR TRADERS were warned yesterday that 'there are now real concerns' over
possible car plant closures this year, with the possibility of new
Japanese-owned factories leading to overcapacity and threatening the
existence of UK manufacturers.
Sir Hal Miller, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' chief
executive and outgoing Tory MP for Bromsgrove, said that cuts in the tax
burden on the industry were essential if it was to recover from its present
decline. He was speaking as the society launched a campaign to raise
awareness of the motor industry among MPs and election candidates.
Measures it is suggesting in a pre-Budget submission to Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, include abolition of the 10 per cent special car tax, higher
price thresholds for the taxation of company cars and concessions on value
added tax and national insurance contributions on the private use of company
cars.
Car and commercial vehicles sales have fallen by 30 per cent and 50 per cent
respectively in the past two years. Sir Hal warned that, without a Budget
stimulus, there was a risk of 'merely moving jobs from Dagenham to Derby'.
Car production at Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby is due to start late
this year, as is production at Honda's plant near Swindon, Wiltshire. In the
past few days Nissan has announced plans to increase production from its
Sunderland plant by 50,000 to 270,000 cars next year.
The society is concerned about the severely depressed state of the UK
market, and about weakening demand in main European export markets that have
hitherto helped to keep UK car production relatively buoyant. That may lead
to an overcapacity crisis later this year and put established plants such as
Ford's Fiesta facility at Dagenham under pressure.
Unofficial calculations by the society suggest that the abolition of special
car tax might increase sales in a full year by 10 per cent.
Since the the organisation has already forecast a 10 per cent rise in sales
this year, to 1.75m units from 1.59m, abolition might therefore further
increase the size of the market to about 1.88m units. However, the society
is reviewing its forecast and may reduce it.
Nevertheless, Sir Hal struck a note of optimism when he claimed he had 'very
good reasons' for believing that Mr Lamont this year would act on at least
some of the industry's submissions.
At its meeting with the chancellor immediately after last year's Budget, the
society had warned that higher VAT, company car taxation and retention of
special car tax would significantly worsen the recession for the industry,
with 70,000 jobs likely to be lost in the two-year period up to the middle
of this year. Sir Hal said: 'It's turned out exactly the way we said it
would.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour promises a fair wind for
Ulster talks - Kevin McNamara and unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS BY the Conservatives to resume round-table talks on Northern
Ireland's political future would be given 'a fair wind' under an incoming
Labour government - but the process would not be allowed to stagnate, Mr
Kevin McNamara, the party's spokesman on the province, has said.
Seeking to allay Unionist MPs' fears at the prospect of a Labour government,
Mr McNamara says he will continue trying to start negotiations under the
formula envisaged by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary.
When Mr Brooke offered his resignation this week for singing on an Irish
television show just hours after an IRA bomb attack, Mr McNamara was the
first to offer his support. 'It never was, nor should it be regarded as, a
resignation matter,' he told the Commons.
Yet Labour's official policy - backed enthusiastically by Mr McNamara, 57, a
white-haired, academic-looking Roman Catholic - is for Irish unification by
consent.
He insists that nobody would be coerced into an extended Irish state -
practically ruling out unification while the Unionist majority remains in
Northern Ireland.
But the aspiration is enough for Unionist leaders to insist that they cannot
give an undertaking to continue formal negotiations if Labour wins the
election. It is the stumbling-block Mr Brooke has run up against.
Mr McNamara is adamant, too, that Unionists should not be allowed to set the
agenda. 'We will seek to give a fair wind but the thing cannot be allowed to
stagnate,' he says. Governments have a responsibility to govern.
It is not automatic that Mr McNamara, spokesman since 1987, would step into
Mr Brooke's shoes were Labour to win. His support for unification marks a
significant break with policy when Labour was last in power. Mr Roy (now
Lord) Mason, the last Labour Northern Ireland secretary, was highly regarded
by some Unionists - more so than some of his Tory successors - for his tough
security policy.
If a Labour government had a small majority, Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader,
might want to avoid alienating the Unionists. Mr McNamara also is not an
elected member of the shadow cabinet. Others might have to be rewarded
before him.
Mr McNamara believes strongly in finding cross-community agreement on how
Northern Ireland should be governed, saying it would be a 'strange form of
neo-colonialism' if Labour insisted on a particular solution. Like Mr
Brooke, he would want talks to look at relations within the province,
between north and south Ireland, and between London and Dublin.
If talks failed, he would want to build cross-border co-operation under the
1985 Anglo-Irish agreement - to which Unionists angrily object because, they
say, it gives the Irish republic a say in the affairs of the north.
Mr McNamara says his commitment to eventual unification is real but
acknowledges the seemingly insurmountable obstacles to his goal. 'Our
aspiration is for a union of peoples,' he says. 'You could unite in a
territorial sense tomorrow . . . of course there would be problems, but it
could be done. But that would not unite the peoples of Ireland.'
Northern Ireland's political leaders looked likely last night to agree to
meet on Monday and try to overcome remaining obstacles to formal
negotiations on the province's political future - in spite of continued
wavering by Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Michelin man finds recession food tasty

<TEXT>
HOTELS and restaurants in the UK have responded to the recession by raising
standards while maintaining or even cutting prices, according to the editor
of the 1992 Michelin guide, which was published yesterday.
Mr Derek Brown said that the guide, in spite of the recession, had added
nine restaurants to its list of Michelin-starred establishments.
The new additions, all of which received one star, include Tatsuso, a
Japanese restaurant in the City of London, Lettonie of Bristol and 21 Queen
Street in Newcastle upon Tyne.
Le Gavroche in Mayfair and the Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire, kept their
three-star ranking. La Tante Claire in Chelsea; Harvey's in Wands-worth,
south London; Chez Nico in Westminster; Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons near
Oxford; and L'Ortolan, near Reading kept their two stars. There were 36
one-star establishments.
Mr Brown said more restaurants had introduced fixed-price menus, many
offering a wider choice than previously.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFIDENTIAL report for the Department of Energy suggests that 30 pits
could produce coal at competitive prices. The the study, by John T. Boyd, a
US mining consultancy, has been passed to British Coal. Details of the study
appear in the latest issue of Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter.
Boyd's conclusions mirror those of a study by the British Association of
Colliery Management, which has predicted that 30 mines could produce 49m
tonnes a year at competitive prices.
British Coal would still have to shut nearly half its pits, and the present
rate of closures and redundancies is likely to continue, according to Mr
Gerard McCloskey, consulting editor of Coal UK.
The newsletter says Hatfield, Bentley and Markham Main in the Yorkshire area
will be the next three closures among 55 working pits employing about 55,000
miners. Boyd differs from NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, which has
reported to the government that fewer than 10 pits are viable.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Leukaemia link with low radiation proved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STUDY of the UK nuclear workforce has proved for the first time that
long-term exposure to low doses of radiation carries an increased risk of
leukaemia.
Scientists at the National Radiological Protection Board have analysed the
records of 95,000 past and present workers in civil and military nuclear
plants, of whom 6,600 have died.
Among the 50 deaths from leukaemia there was a clear statistical link with
the workers' radiation doses. The board also found a correlation between all
cancer deaths (1,800) and radiation exposure, although that did not reach
the scientific threshold for 'statistical significance'. A recent study in
the US failed to detect any risk from exposure.
The board's report, published today, suggests that the risk of developing
cancer through radiation exposure is twice as great as the International
Commission on Radiological Protection assumes in its latest recommended dose
limits. Those are based on studies of people who have received large
radiation doses in a very short time - mainly Japanese survivors of the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs.
Anti-nuclear groups seized on the board's report as ammunition for their
attack on the industry. Greenpeace called for the immediate closure of all
nuclear plants. Mr Simon Boxer, Greenpeace nuclear campaigner, said: 'This
is yet further proof that the nuclear dream has turned into a nightmare.'
Dr Patrick Green of Friends of the Earth said the board's analysis justified
an immediate tightening in occupational radiation dose limits.
Nuclear Electric called the study 'good news' because it confirmed the
'healthy worker effect'. Death rates among the nuclear workforce are 20 per
cent below those in the general population - and mortality from most cancers
is also lower - because the nuclear industry tends to recruit healthy
people.
Mr Martyn Day, a London solicitor acting for several nuclear workers who are
suing for compensation after contracting leukaemia, said the board's study
would provide strong evidence to support their cases. 'Every time a major
new report comes out, it shows that the risks of radiation are worse than
previously thought,' he said.

THE Independent Television Commission yesterday rejected the suggestion that

in a shoddy way.
TSW, the company that lost its broadcasting licence for south-west England
in last October's auction of franchises, opposes the award of the franchise
to Westcountry TV.
Mr Patrick Elias, QC for the commission, said at the Court of Appeal: 'This
public body has taken its decision-making obligations extremely seriously.
It was far from a shoddy exercise.'
The hearing continues today.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Cut in Scotch output urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT in Scotch whisky production is essential this year if the industry is
to avoid a damaging surplus of stock, according to a report published today
by Charterhouse Tilney, the securities house.
Mr Alan Gray, whisky analyst, says total production of grain and malt whisky
fell by 5.2 per cent last year, well short of the 10 per cent he thought
necessary. 'More substantial cuts are needed in 1992,' he says.

Lord Justice Watkins rejected their judicial review application, saying

Mr David Oliver QC, for Mohammed, Salah and Ali Fayed, had argued that the

FT  24 JAN 92 / Pollution monitoring increase is ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX more government stations to monitor air pollution are to open this year
at a cost of Pounds 3m, Della Bradshaw writes.
The move, which will bring the number of stations to 16, follows wide
concern about the quality of air in towns. The new stations will be in
London, Cardiff, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Belfast.
Friends Of The Earth, the environmental campaigning group, said the increase
was inadequate. Ms Fiona Weir, the organisation's air pollution campaigner,
said Germany had about 200 stations monitoring nitrogen dioxide, the vehicle
exhaust gas known to aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma.
The six latest UK stations will monitor airborne fine dust and hydrocarbons,
such as benzene, as well as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon
monoxide and ozone.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Sun Alliance to axe 800 jobs in cost cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest insurer, yesterday announced plans to cut 800
jobs as part of a rationalisation programme designed to reduce costs and
restore profitability.
Most of the job losses will result from voluntary redundancies and early
retirements over the year, although there are to be some compulsory job
losses.
Thirty-nine smaller branch outlets that are no longer considered
cost-effective will close, with the company concentrating sales and customer
service in 50 main branches.
As with other UK composites, Sun Alliance has made heavy losses during the
past two years as a result of tight rate competition, the recession and
weather-related claims. Pre-tax losses for 1991 might amount to more than
Pounds 450m.
Mr Charles Coyne, analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing, believes the move may
be followed by other composite (life and general) insurers. 'There is an
awful lot of fat to cut.'
Sun Alliance's expense ratio - the yardstick that measures operating costs
as a percentage of net premium income - amounted to 35.8 per cent in 1990,
according to Department of Trade and Industry figures, nearly 2 percentage
points above the average for the UK's top 10 composite companies.
Last year, staffing was reduced from 14,200 to 13,800, with most losses
concentrated at Sun Alliance (UK), which handles the group's personal lines
of non-life insurance, such as household and private motor.
That was largely the result of a decision to concentrate processing of a
substantial part of the group's personal lines business at a new,
inexpensive centre in Oldham, Lancashire.
Komatsu, the Japanese earth-moving equipment manufacturer, yesterday
announced a further 50 job losses at its plant in Birtley, Tyne and Wear,
Chris Tighe writes.
The company blamed the cuts on the construction industry's worst decline for
more than 40 years. It hopes many jobs will be shed by natural wastage and
voluntary severance, but compulsory redundancies are probable. The cuts will
reduce the workforce at its sole excavator production outlet for Europe to
350.
Mr Clive Morton, personnel director, said staff and suppliers had been
assured that the future of the business was not at risk.
Komatsu last year injected Pounds 10m in capital investment at Birtley,
including design and test facilities for products tailored to the European
market.

FT  24 JAN 92 / MMC finds takeover activity sharply down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP decline in takeover activity in the UK over the past 18 months was
reflected in figures published yesterday for the number of mergers
investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1991.
After the busiest year in its 44-year history in 1990, when it investigated
27 mergers, the MMC completed only seven reports on mergers last year.
Sir Sydney Lipworth, MMC chairman, said yesterday that in spite of the lower
total, the intensity of the commission's work had been maintained.
Presenting its annual review for last year, he said that was largely due to
the six big monopoly inquiries carried out, including the largest
investigation ever carried out by the MMC, into the supply of new cars.
Overall, 21 reports were published during the year, compared with 35 in
1990.
Sir Sydney said a feature of 1991 had been the growing trend for more than
one national competition authority to become involved in transactions
affecting multinational companies.
The leveraged buy-out and restructuring of the company controlling the
Wilkinson Sword razor business by a consortium that included Gillette, its
biggest competitor worldwide, had led to investigations in the US, Canada,
Germany, the UK and several other jurisdictions, as well as by the European
Commission.
In the UK, the MMC's reports into the merger itself and the supply of razors
and razor blades are now both the subject of judicial review proceedings
brought by Gillette and are expected to be heard by the High Court in March.
A sharp increase in the number of challenges to MMC decisions by judicial
review proceedings was another feature of last year, Sir Sydney said.
In the past five years there had been 10 judicial review challenges to MMC
decisions. In five cases, the decisions had been upheld; two were under
appeal, including the commission's own appeal in the Sheffield Bus mergers
case; and three were still pending - the two razor cases and a challenge to
the commission's monopoly report on the supply of structural warranty
services in relation to new homes.
Sir Sydney said the increase in challenges was partly a reflection of the
general trend towards challenging official decisions by judicial review. It
would be a pity, he said, if judicial review came to be used as an accepted
means of appeal against the substance of the commission's findings.
On the role of the privatised utilities regulators, he said it was too early
to judge whether the government had got the structure right. In the early
days, there were advantages in having specialist regulators dealing with an
industry. Whether enough competition would develop to make this type of
regulation unnecessary remained to be seen, he said.

FT  24 JAN 92 / EC offers to spend more to aid mining areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is prepared to spend more to help British
coal-mining areas facing pit closures to create alternative jobs. In return,
the commission says the UK government must settle the row with Brussels over
how it accounts for such money.
The offer is likely to bring pressure on the government in the wake of the
job losses in the Yorkshire area announced this week, and claims that it is
not using the means available to safeguard people's livelihoods in those and
other threatened coal areas.
Mr Bruce Millan, the EC commissioner for regional policy, said yesterday
that Brussels had already allocated more than Pounds 30m to coalfields in
the Yorkshire area under the Rechar programme to help declining coal
regions. He 'was prepared to examine the possibility of increasing this
allocation', but was 'still awaiting assurances from the UK government that
when community funds are approved for particular areas they actually reach
the areas concerned'.
The commission has refused to disburse Pounds 109m under the Rechar
programme, and has warned that about Pounds 880m in regional aid for Great
Britain in 1992-93 is also 'in jeopardy', until Britain guarantees that the
EC money is 'additional' to government and local government funding of
projects.
British Coal said yesterday it did not rule out reopening talks with
Caledonian Mining, the unsuccessful bidder in the competition for leasing
Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh. That follows a report that Monktonhall
Mineworkers, a company formed by redundant staff, had yet to complete its
business plan and secure finance.

FT  24 JAN 92 / BA to shed 300 staff at Gatwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is to cut 300 jobs at Gatwick airport as part of an
efficiency drive. Ground staff and cabin and flight crew will be affected.
The cuts, to be achieved voluntarily, represent the first stage in a
three-year plan to return BA's Gatwick operation to 'an acceptable level of
profitability'. BA does not rule out further job losses before the end of
that period.
Other productivity initiatives include increased provision for Boeing 737
maintenance and taking back work that had been contracted out. It is
intended that those objectives should be met without increasing engineering
staffing.
BA employs 5,700 people at Gatwick, including 1,300 engineering staff.
The company yesterday also announced further flights from the airport to
attract business passengers. 'Gatwick is seen as a holiday airport by many
people,' said BA. 'We are trying to build an effective hub at Gatwick to
appeal to business travellers.'
The number of flights scheduled for the summer will increase, largely
through doubling services to Copenhagen, Naples and Milan to two flights a
day.
The company said the plan for growth confirmed its commitment to Gatwick.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Plea to ministers for tin clean-up funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority, the environmental watchdog for water, is to
ask the government to pay for clearance of pollution caused by the flooding
of the disused Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall.
The cost of clearing the pollution caused by heavy metals in local rivers
and the Fal estuary at Falmouth might amount to more than Pounds 1m. So far
the authority has spent Pounds 100,000.
The authority expressed its intention to Mr Tony Baldry, the junior
environment minister, who visited the mine yesterday to see the clean-up
operations.
Mr Baldry said that any request for further funds from the NRA would be
considered 'carefully and constructively'.
There were claims that the pollution from millions of gallons of
rust-coloured water is beginning to affect shellfish in the estuary, and
fears that other marine life might be affected.
Mr Baldry denied allegations that the government was to blame for the
halting of pumping operations in the mine by refusing further loan advances
to Carnon Consolidated, the owner.
'The decision to stop pumping which foreshadowed this large discharge was
taken by the company without consulting the NRA,' he said. 'A discharge on
such a large scale was unforeseen and could not have been planned for.'
Mr Elliot Morley, the Labour party's fisheries spokesman, visited the area
yesterday and said local fishermen were very worried. High levels of cadmium
and other metals had been found in the estuary.
On the first day of the flooding 10m to 15m gallons of water came from the
mine but that had now been reduced to under 2m daily.
Bulldozers began preliminary work on the M3 extension at Twyford Down near
Winchester yesterday in spite of a plea from Mr Ripa di Meana, EC
environment commissioner, that it should not start until the dispute over
the scheme's impact on the environment was cleared up.
It is one of seven big construction projects that the EC commissioner said
should be halted because proper environmental impact assessments required by
community law had not been carried out. He has warned that the matter might
end in the European Court.
Friends of the Earth said that the sending in of bulldozers was a 'wilful
disregard of the due process of law' on the part of the government. However,
yesterday's operations were not on the site of special scientific interest
that is at the heart of the controversy.

FT  24 JAN 92 / US middle-class voter wooed: The not-so-discreet pitch for
the bourgeoisie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY days yet in the 1992 presidential election campaign, but one common
theme has emerged: the American Middle Class is being treated like royalty.
Scarcely a day passes without President George Bush, or one of the five
Democratic party candidates seeking to stand against him in the November
poll, profferring new-fangled tax breaks or federal entitlements to the
millions of Americans who consider themselves middle-class.
Electoral mathematics make this inevitable. At least 70 per cent of the
population fit the middle-class label, ranging from the mechanic earning
Dollars 19,000 a year to the lawyer making Dollars 90,000 (Pounds 50,000).
The difference this year is how explicit the pitch has been.
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner, laments the
'forgotten middle class' - a conscious echo of President Richard Nixon's
televised appeal to the 'Silent Majority' over the heads of the Vietnam war
protestors who ringed the White House in 1969. Mr Clinton's economic agenda
includes a 10 per cent cut in middle-class taxes, a new Dollars 800 tax
credit per child, and a pledge (ill-defined) to make health care available
for every American.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero, supports similar tax
relief for the middle class, supported by a comprehensive reform of the
health care system which would extend coverage to more than 37m Americans
who are uninsured.
Mr Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, a former senator, opposes an
across-the-board tax cut for the middle class. 'Twinkie economics,' he calls
that. But he is still targeting middle-income voters, mixing 'Buy American'
appeals with old-fashioned, government-backed industrial policy to restore
prosperity and guarantee jobs.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa alone has sought out low-income workers, the
unemployed and disadvantaged. He has cast himself as an old-fashioned
Democratic in the Franklin Roosevelt style, who supports huge public works
programmes (plus a heavy dose of protectionism and Japan-bashing).
His message has fallen flat. With four weeks until the key New Hampshire
primary election, he is counting on a late TV campaign to turn the race
around.
The Democrats have not discovered the discreet charm of the American
bourgeoisie by accident. Having lost five out of the last six presidential
elections, strategists and candidates seem to have grasped at last the cost
of the party's liberal bias.
This has meant candidates being buried by Republican charges that they are
soft on crime and communism, and prone to helping blacks and other
minorities at the expense of law-abiding whites.
Put differently, Mr Clinton, who comes from a conservative southern state,
understands he must counter Republican efforts to cast him in the same mould
as earlier, unsuccessful Democratic candidates for the presidency - Senator
George McGovern (1972), Mr Walter Mondale (1984) and Governor Michael
Dukakis (1988) - that of a big spender interested in funnelling tax-payers'
money to the poor at the expense of the middle class.
Two factors should help the Democratic cause in 1992. The absence of Rev
Jesse Jackson - civil rights activist, defender of the down-trodden and
showman extraordinaire - should broaden the party's appeal.
Mr Jackson correctly observes that he won more than 7m votes in the
Democratic primary elections in 1988; but the more pertinent (albeit
unanswerable) question is how many middle-class voters his ubiquitous
presence cost the Democrats in the 1984 and 1988 general elections.
Democrats may also take heart from the weak US economy. In the last weeks of
the 1988 campaign, Mr Dukakis started to catch up with Mr Bush, then
vice-president, by declaring himself on the side of 'working families'.
Government, he said, should make good the deficiencies of the Reagan-Bush
era by raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing health and child care, helping
to finance affordable housing and college education.
In 1988, when the US economy was still growing, the message (and the
candidate) was not alluring enough; in a stagnant economy, where polls show
Americans insecure about jobs, crime, and the direction of the country, the
message could prove attrative if offered by an attractive candidate.
Democrats cannot afford, however, to place all bets on the economy.
If Mr Bush's advisers are correct, signs of a recovery should be evident by
the summer; this would immediately weaken the standard argument that the
Democrats can make middle-class Americans more secure with 'safety net'
programmes.
On closer inspection, some of the Democratic candidates' current proposals
are less mouth-watering than they at first appear. Mr Clinton's middle-class
tax cut would be financed by a new top tax rate of 38.5 per cent (up from 31
per cent now) on incomes of Dollars 90,000 for single people and Dollars
120,000 for heads of households. This leaves the governor open to charges
that he is robbing middle-class Peter to pay middle-class Paul.
Likewise, Democratic proposals for comprehensive health care for all
Americans carry a huge-price tag, perhaps as high as Dollars 60bn.
This was enough for Mr Patrick Buchanan, the Republican challenger to Mr
Bush in New Hampshire, to admit candidly to pensioners last week that he was
not ready to support any health-care plan, although the need for reform was
pressing.
During the 1992 campaign, candidates' public spending plans will be
scrutinised more closely by the press and public alike.
So, there is a fair chance that voters will understand that tax breaks and
other giveaways promised by the politicians now will be financed later - by
the middle class.

A NEW YORK judge yesterday rejected a request from Lloyd's of London to halt

The London-based insurance institution, with other BCCI creditors, had tried

BCCI sufficient funds to pay creditors' claims.
Lloyd's had filed its own lawsuit, under US racketeering statutes, alleging

Judge John Keenan ruled yesterday that the plea accord was 'a precisely

FT  24 JAN 92 / Castro crackdown leaves him a castaway at home: The
increasing international isolation of Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA'S attempts to seek new economic partners, following the demise of the
Soviet Union, are being placed in jeopardy by a new purge of opposition
leaders in Cuba and the execution on Monday of a Cuban exile.
The crackdown has shaken President Fidel Castro's fragile relations with the
Latin American and Spanish leaders who count among his last remaining
friends abroad, and on whom he is depending for vital foreign investment.
Since the execution of Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, the leader of a group of
three Cuban-Americans apparently set on sabotage in Cuba, Mr Castro has come
under diplomatic attack across the world.
The German government expressed 'profound consternation'. The European
Community said the execution was a 'great obstacle' to better relations.
France, Spain and the Vatican, among others, expressed dismay.
The reaction underlines the president's growing dilemma. As Professor Jorge
Dominguez of Harvard University says: 'Mr Castro's chances for co-operation
with Latin America grow if he does not crack down internally; but his
reading of the changes in eastern Europe suggests that he ought to crack
down'.
Heightened repression is also bound to scare away some of the foreign
investment that Mr Castro is hoping will pull Cuba out of its economic
troubles. On Wednesday, Germany cancelled a bilateral air transport accord.
The extent to which the government is willing to go to deal with dissent was
indicated by Mr Raul Castro, defence minister and the president's brother,
who said the administration would respond violently to any opposition. He
warned opponents that the government would not hesitate to reconvene
emergency revolutionary tribunals, scrapped 20 years ago, to determine
sentences for violence against the government and the country.
The capture of the three Cuban-Americans three weeks ago has provided the
Havana government with some justification for its claims that it is under
threat and must defend itself, and rationalises a crackdown on opposition
elements which appears to have been intensified this week.
As the first execution for 'counter-revolutionary activity' in 20 years, it
also seemed meant to warn groups which have been making public criticisms of
the Castro administration.
It has also allowed a temporary diversion, clearly to the government's
relief, from the deepening economic problems which have overtaken the
country after the end of communism in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe,
and stem also from the unbending 30-year US embargo on trade with Cuba.
Reports this week of further detentions of opposition figures follow the
arrest of some 60 activists since September last year, almost half of whom
remain in jail.
This comes after a modest political liberalisation in the mid-to-late 1980s
and reflects in part an attempt to link the supporters of democracy with
alleged US-sponsored attempts to overthrow the regime. More significant: it
shows Mr Castro's fear that the discontent (so far mainly silent) caused by
the rapid deterioration in the economy will translate into organised
opposition.
The tough actions have damaged the hopes of some Latin leaders that
prospects of Latin American economic integration and foreign investment
would encourage Mr Castro to curb political repression.
The so-called Group of Three - Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela - invited Mr
Castro to Mexico in late October to preach that message. While not offering
aid, the three 'agreed to fight for the rapid and total integration of Cuba
into the Latin American family', and to promote foreign investment in Cuba.
The barely concealed objective was to prod Mr Castro into more reforms, in
return for economic help and membership of the emerging Latin American
economic bloc.
This conciliatory approach contrasts not only with the unbending US
position, but also with that of some Latin nations which prefer that help to
Cuba be conditional on clear promises for reform.
Cuba has rejected such interference in its affairs and has hit back at its
Latin American critics. This makes it increasingly difficult for Latin
countries to include Cuba in their regional plans.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Chile peso revalued to trim reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S central bank yesterday revalued the peso by 5 per cent against the
dollar, in an effort to stem a build-up of foreign exchange reserves which
was hampering both monetary management and the fight against double-digit
annual inflation.
The central bank had been resisting a revaluation to keep exports
competitive, but a flood of dollars - from direct foreign investment and a
record Dollars 8.9bn in exports last year - forced the bank to buy hundreds
of millions of dollars to keep the exchange rate low.
The frequent interventions became too costly for the central bank and
international reserves shot up to Dollars 6.64bn, enough to cover 11 months
of imports. They also endangered the bank's monetary targets.
The authorities are resisting calls to free the exchange rate and will
continue with their 'crawling peg' adjustment of the currency. But they will
allow the peso/dollar rate to move 10 per cent either side of a central rate
that, as before, will be adjusted daily in line with inflation.
The allowed fluctuation used to be 5 per cent.
The revaluation of the peso will make imports cheaper and help the central
bank to lower inflation to a target of 15 per cent by the end of 1992, from
18.7 per cent last year.
Also, Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister, announced measures intended to
ease the dollar pressure on the economy and increase investment:
Foreign investors will now be able to repatriate capital after one year
instead of three.
Chile's private pension funds, the country's largest institutional investors
with almost Dollars 10bn in assets, will be allowed to invest 1.5 per cent
of their portfolios abroad.
The Chilean economy grew by 5.5 per cent in 1991 - its eighth consecutive
year of growth. All forecasts agree the economy will repeat this strong
performance in 1992.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S money supply growth in December fell to a record low of 2 per cent
compared to a year earlier, the Bank of Japan said yesterday.
The low rate reflects sluggish demand for loans from companies which are
cutting expenditure and investment in response to the cooling of the economy
and commercial banks' reluctance to lend to hard-pressed sectors such as
property groups.
On a month-on-month basis, money supply fell 5.4 per cent, the first decline
since February last year. The figures are likely to increase pressure on the
Bank of Japan for a further cuts in interest rates.
'Looking at the figures, the Bank of Japan itself is probably feeling the
need for lower interest rates as well,' said Mr Yuji Shimanaka, economist at
Sanwa Research Institute, the research arm of Sanwa Bank.
Yesterday's preliminary figures cap off a year in which money supply growth
declined steadily because of the squeeze on borrowing applied by the Bank of
Japan for two years to mid-1991. A cut in lending by commercial banks in
line with capital asset ratio guidelines of the Bank of International
Settlements also contributed to the fall in liquidity.
The central bank implemented its tight monetary policy in 1989, to eliminate
the speculation 'bubble' in the real estate and stock markets caused by the
loose credit policy in the late 1980s.
While the Bank of Japan finally responded to calls from the government and
corporations to ease credit by cutting the official discount rate three
times in late 1991, money growth has failed to pick up. Money supply for
1991 grew by a record low 3.6 per cent from the previous year, down sharply
from an 11.7 per cent rise in 1990.
A Bank of Japan official attributed the fall in monetary growth to a decline
in corporate demand for funds and the shift in banks' lending stance 'from
quantity to quality'.
However, some analysts see a need for substantial growth in money supply for
economic growth acceptable for the government. Effects of the half-point cut
in the official discount rate at the end of last year, to 4.5 per cent, are
likely to take longer to appear than expected, as potential borrowers await
a further decline in lending rates and funds from commercial bank deposits
shift out to postal savings.
'The Bank of Japan will need to lower rates aggressively to achieve targeted
economic growth,' said Mr Robert Feldman of Salomon Brothers, the US broker.
He said a seasonally adjusted annual rate of over 15 per cent was necessary
to support real GNP growth of over 3 per cent for the year.

FT  24 JAN 92 / US tries to save Mideast peace talks in Moscow

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US is working to save an important Middle East peace conference in
Moscow next week from the threat of a boycott by Israel's main Arab
adversaries, agencies report.
The two-day conference, scheduled to take place next Tuesday, is due to
discuss Middle East regional issues such as arms control and economic
development. It is seen as a crucial support pillar to the main bilateral
peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours - Syria, Lebanon, Jordan
and Palestinians from the occupied territories.
But Syria and Lebanon have already said they will boycott the meeting and
the Palestinians have yet to respond to the invitation because they resent
being lumped together with Jordan in a joint delegation.
In a separate development, the US secretary of state, Mr James Baker, had
been scheduled to inform Israel yesterday of Washington's decision on its
request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in housing loan guarantees. But a US
spokesman said the meeting between Mr Baker and the Israeli ambassador, Mr
Zalman Shoval, would be held today and indicated the US might not be ready
to give Israel its decision at the meeting.
The US decision on loan guarantees could have crucial implications for the
peace process. Arab foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in the Moroccan
city of Marrakesh today to co-ordinate positions on the issue and a decision
on Palestinian participation was expected to follow soon after.
Meanwhile, Israel yesterday revoked an expulsion order against one of 12
Palestinians facing ejection from the occupied territories following a spate
of attacks on Jewish settlers. It was only the second time that the Israeli
authorities have reversed an expulsion order. The last time was in 1979.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Battle for hearts and minds in Central Asia: Fundamentalist
and mainstream Moslems, writes Tony Walker, are fighting for influence in
new nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOWHERE is the creation of a clutch of new central Asian states from the old
Soviet Union being watched more obsessively than in the capitals of moderate
Arabs fearful that the balance of influence in the Islamic world may be
altered to their disadvantage.
While the moderates held sway at a recent meeting in Dhakar of the Islamic
Conference Organisation, they cannot be at all confident that Islamic
institutions will remain firmly in their grip in light of a restless Iranian
challenge and the addition of new and possibly militant members.
Beyond worries about control of Islamic institutions, the moderate Arabs,
plus Turkey, are also concerned that the newly formed Islamic states of
central Asia will provide moral and political support for fundamentalists
throughout the Middle East at a time when political Islam appears again to
be on an upswing.
Intriguingly, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have joined in an attempt to counter
developments in the former Soviet republics possibly detrimental to their
own interests and to Sunni (mainstream) Islam. Saudi money and Egypt's
abundant ulema, or religious guides, are being mobilised to spread the word
in central Asia in competition with the militant Shi'ism of Iran.
Religious notables from the former Soviet republics have also been invited
to Cairo for what is known as 'Preacher's Day' early next month, and Islamic
teachers will participate in courses on contemporary Islam run by the
al-Azhar religious authorities in the Egyptian capital.
Mr Mohammed Mahjoub, Egypt's religious affairs minister, was quoted last
week as saying pointedly that 'we are approaching a very critical stage. In
this stage, Egypt, representing religious moderation, must lead in showing
the magnanimity of Islam.'
Mr Mahjoub's remarks coincided with worrying (for Arab moderates)
developments in Algeria, where the military felt obliged to cancel
democratic elections that would have resulted in an overwhelming victory for
the Islamicists.
The constitutional coup in Algeria and reaction to it across the Middle East
exposed tensions and differences between moderate and militant regimes in
the wake of the Gulf crisis, adding further to the region's unsettled mood.
Algeria's new military rulers reacted bitterly to criticism voiced by Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who declared that Algerian Moslems
would defeat 'Satanic plots'.
Algiers recalled its ambassador to Tehran and asked Iran's representative to
leave. Algeria also announced that it would stop representing Iran in the US
because of the 'virulent Iranian press campaign seeking to hit (Algeria's)
vital interests'.
The argument between Algiers and Tehran might be dismissed as one of the
region's periodic spats, but Iran efforts to play a more conspicuous role
regionally invests it with greater significance.
Mr Fahmi Howeidi, Egypt's leading Iran specialist, believes, however, that
worries among moderate Arabs about Iran's intentions are exaggerated. He
says its present activism should be viewed against a background of coming
elections for Iran's parliament.
Mr Howeidi says that manoeuvring for control of the Majlis, which was
elected in 1988 and therefore the militant sway of the late Ayatollah
Khomeini, has obliged Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the pragmatic
president, as the upholder of the Ayatollah's crusading vision, to act in
order to outflank the extremists and secure victory for his own people in
the election.
The Egyptian specialist said it would make no sense for Iran, which has
invested much recently in wooing moderate Gulf regimes and improving its
profile in the west, to appear to be fomenting trouble in the Arab world.
But, while concern about Iranian intentions might be exaggerated in Arab
capitals, it seems inevitable that competition in central Asia will cause
tensions with both the moderate Arabs and with Turkey, which is also
understandably staking its claim for influence.
Iran's own concern about developments in the six new states to its north and
especially in neighbouring Azerbaijan (the only one of the six where Shia
predominates) stem partly from worries about possible separatist tendencies
of its own minorities.
While Turkey was the very first country to recognise Azerbaijan, Iran
delayed. This caution also extended to Tehran's recognition of the other
newly independent states.
Evidence of Iranian sensitivity about developments on its borders came
recently with criticism in the English-language Tehran Times, close to
President Rafsanjani, accusing Turkey of seeking to inflame nationalist
sentiment in central Asia. Diplomatic wariness has not, however, stopped
Iran from seeking actively to woo these states.
In December, Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, visited all
six: the five Moslem-dominated republics of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kirgizia, and half-Moslem Kazakhstan.
Arab moderates not only want to try to ensure that the newly formed central
Asian states become part of a pragmatic and western-leaning Islamic axis,
but, perhaps more importantly, they wish to counter transfers of advanced
military technology, and possibly even nuclear know-how, to Middle East
radicals. (Kazakhstan is home to part of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal).
Writing in the Kuwaiti daily Sawt al Kuwait, Mr Hassan Abu-Taleb, of Cairo's
al Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, voiced some of the
alarm felt when he observed:
'In the chaos accompanying the disintegration of the communist superpower,
the chances are high that what lies ahead is a period of uncontrollable
nuclear proliferation that could transfer the arms to a number of other
states and - even more dangerously - to 'unknown groups' that could use them
to blackmail the entire world.'
Other Egyptian commentators have taken up a similar theme. The weekly
publication Rose el-Yousef, commented that: 'Whereas the Arabs once needed
to deal only with the central Soviet authority, they must now establish
urgent and energetic contacts with all the independent states .. If we don't
move now, those (Iran and Turkey) will beat us to close relations with the
new countries.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Transatlantic dispute moves into top gear
 -European gear-making exporters are fighting back in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more than a year of shadow-boxing, the gloves are off in a
transatlantic row that has turned the arcane world of gear-making into an
issue fit for Washington's finest lawyers and lobbyists.
The debate over the effect of imports on the Dollars 15bn (Pounds 8.2bn) US
gear market moved out of neutral last year after the Gulf conflict focused
attention on the US industrial infrastructure and its ability to mobilise
for war.
Now, Eurotrans, the organisation representing nine associations of European
gear makers, has delivered a blistering response to the November decision by
the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) to seek a US Commerce
Department investigation into the impact of imports on national security.
Its 57-page document, filed with the Commerce Department a few days ago,
pulls few punches in its descriptions of AGMA's petition under the
little-used Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. These range from
'misleading' and 'incorrect' to 'severely flawed' and even 'nonsense.'
The central issue in a Section 232 petition is whether imports are affecting
a US industry with significant national security implications. The question,
in military jargon, is whether domestic producers can meet targets for
'surge and mobilisation' - doubling defence production in six months, and
quadrupling production in 24 months?
AGMA believes there is a case to answer. Mr Joe Franklin, executive
director, says: 'In 232 petitions you find some cases are economic - the
Washington jargon is that they are 'wrapped around the flag'. But my
analysis in the gear industry is that we truly have a national security
issue. There are trends in the use of alternative suppliers that reduce the
US industry's ability to respond.'
Eurotrans counters that the US has existing and potentially available
resources sufficient to meet defence requirements. Gear imports, it says, do
not contribute significantly to critical defence products.
The initial response to the petition from Europe was almost dismissive. But,
says Eurotrans president Michael Opperman, it was realised that 'a lot of
what the Americans were saying is wrong.'
Concern was heightened by the possible cumulative effect on US legislators
of the AGMA petition, the 1991 Commerce Department national security
assessment of the industry, and the 1990 International Trade Commission
investigation documenting the decline in the US industry.
'These three important documents would be floating around Washington for
years to come,' says Mr Opperman. 'The answer would always be that imports
were at fault.'
The European and US submissions to the Commerce Department paint very
different pictures.
AGMA speaks in more temperate language of an industry that, in parts, has
never recovered fully from the recession of the early 1980s, suffers from
predatory pricing by foreign producers, and lacks their competitive
advantages in everything from access to capital to government support for
research and development.
Eurotrans, in its potent mix of strident language and solid statistics, says
that the US aerospace gear sector leads the world but criticises many
industrial gear makers for complacency. It also produces evidence of
relatively low spending on research and training, and outdated manufacturing
technology. It bitterly denies dumping products in the US and says US
producers have the advantage over the Europeans on both the cost of, and
access to, capital.
The two sides cannot even agree on the level of imports - as so many gears
are 'embedded' in other products. While AGMA says imports account for 30 per
cent of the US commercial (non-defence) market, Eurotrans says the figure is
only 18.2 per cent.
The European side also berates AGMA for ignoring the effect of currency
fluctuations on the rise in imports between 1984 and 1988, and pours scorn
on the US contention that the automotive gear sector could not be converted
to defence work for technological reasons.
The two documents are the opening salvoes in a lobbying campaign which
should see a presidential decision on what action to take, if any, in about
nine months.
A wide range of options is available, including voluntary restraint
agreements (VRAs) limiting imports.
However, these are being phased out in other areas, and the AGMA's petition
could face an uphill battle for controls on imports.

FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US steel makers to file on anti-dumping
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 50 US steel makers are soon expected to file anti-dumping and
countervailing duty cases against their foreign competitors.
Mr Frank Luerssen, chairman of Inland Steel in Chicago, said that the steel
makers would be filing a 'whole spectrum' of trade cases when Washington's
Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRA) lapse with 28 countries. These are
scheduled to expire in March.
The tactic, said Mr Luerssen, was to pressure for a multilateral steel
arrangement because 'what we're seeing under the VRAs is widespread
dumping'. He complained that US steel prices have been consequently
weakened.
VRA's are informal arrangements through which exporters voluntarily restrain
certain exports, usually through quotas, to avoid economic dislocation in an
importing country.
He declined to specify what countries or products would be the targets of
such cases. VRAs currently apply to some 75 per cent of US steel imports. Mr
Luerssen said that the cases now being prepared would be those 'with a high
probability of success'.
The companies used the filing of trade cases to win the VRAs in 1984.
Critics of US steel quotas say that it is not imports that are hurting large
integrated US steel mills. Imports accounted for some 18.2 per cent of the
US market 20 years ago and just under 18 per cent last year. They argue that
efficient US mini-mills have been doing far more harm. Mini-mills' market
share has risen to 28 per cent in 1991 from 5 per cent two decades ago.

MR Frank Shrontz, chairman of US aircraft manufacturer Boeing, yesterday
launched his most comprehensive attack yet on alleged government subsidies
to Europe's Airbus Industrie, and warned that American rival McDonnell
Douglas must not become an 'Asian Airbus', subsidised by Taiwan.
'Airbus and the European Community should understand our position,' he said
in a speech in New York. 'Twenty-one years of subsidy is far too much.
Enough is enough.'
He repeated a threat of retaliatory action under US law as a 'last resort'
if the issue could not be resolved through the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt).
The broadside follows five years of slow movement in two cases brought by
the US under the Gatt, seeking to prevent EC members from subsidising Airbus
 -which has become the world's second largest civil aircraft manufacturer.
The US claims the subsidies total about Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.4m) for every
aircraft Airbus has sold.
Mr Shrontz also voiced concern over a plan for state-backed Taiwan Aerospace
to take a 40 per cent equity stake in McDonnell Douglas's civil aircraft
business.

LANDLOCKED Bolivia's 113 year-old dream of an exit to the Pacific is set to
become reality today when Bolivian and Peruvian presidents Jaime Paz Zamora
and Alberto Fujimori meet in the southern Peruvian port of Ilo to sign a
bilateral agreement.
Peru's President Alberto Fujimori has made an offer of free transit for
Bolivian products through a 'corridor' leading to Ilo from the Bolivian
frontier town of Desaguadero.
Under Mr Fujimori's proposal:
Bolivia would be permitted to import and export via Ilo with no customs
formalities - perhaps even using their own railway stock on the Peruvian
tracks;
Ilo would become a free zone with full industrial and commercial facilities;
and,
Bolivians could even purchase their own seaside residences in a new tourist
resort on Peruvian soil.
The Peruvian proposal has been enthusiastically greeted in Bolivia, which
has been landlocked since it lost territory to Chile in the 1879 War of the
Pacific.
In return for the concessions, Peru would gain access to the Atlantic, via
the network of roads and railways which link Desaguadero to the Bolivian
capital, La Paz, and thence to Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina.
Ilo, which is less than 300 miles from La Paz, hopes to lure lucrative
Bolivian trade away from the northern Chilean ports of Arica.
President Fujimori's plan gives priority to Ilo as the principal port for
Peruvian and Bolivian (and ultimately Brazilian) exports to the Pacific Rim
countries.
It is a deep-water port with good basic infrastructure but will require
further substantial investment and development.
Before leaving for Ilo, the Bolivian president called the meeting one of
'transcendental importance'.
'This is a signal to the rest of the continent,' he said, 'that there's a
new way of managing affairs.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / Western nations rally to rescue their former foe: Why the
conference on aid to the former Soviet Union has been a useful first step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Washington conference on co-ordinating emergency humanitarian aid to the
former Soviet Union proved more useful than its many critics first
suspected.
At the end of the two-day meeting yesterday, most leading participants said
the conference marked an important first step in mobilising international
public support for aid to the one-time superpower.
'A process has been started,' said Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German
foreign minister who has long argued for large-scale western aid to pre- and
post-communist Russia as a catalyst for reform.
The big question, of course, is how far this global effort will go; at what
point will the west, notably the US, be called upon to put up money to
support the risky and immensely costly macro-economic reform in the former
Soviet republics.
The Bush administration pre-empted this debate last month by calling for a
conference on humanitarian aid alone. Some 47 countries and five
international financial organisations, including the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, accepted the invitation.
The US demarche upset European sensibilities, but President Bush defused
criticism during generous opening remarks at the opening of the meeting in
which he tried to reassure allies that the US intends to pay its way in
future Soviet aid.
Mr Bush lavished praise on the European Community and Germany for their own
aid effort; he announced he was seeking Dollars 645m in fresh technical and
humanitarian aid from Congress; and he agreed to a follow-up conference in
Lisbon, sponsored by the European Community and to be attended by the
republics.
This week's focus among the working groups was short-term disaster relief:
how best to ship and distribute food and medicine to cities where the worst
shortages are located; and how to avoid the corruption and bureaucratic
snarl-ups which have plagued the relief effort.
The aid pledged so far will not be enough to feed the Soviet people, but the
conference participants felt enough food was in the pipeline to avoid
starvation this winter. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, observed
that the relief effort remains crucial 'at the margin' - unblocking
bottlenecks and seeking out the most vulnerable areas.
The US announcement that it is starting military airlifts on February 10
should be taken in the same spirit of solidarity. In volume terms, the
proposed 54 C-5 Galaxy transport flights are not impressive; the broader aim
is to show the Soviet and American people that the Cold War is over and the
west is prepared to help its old adversary.
This education of ordinary Americans is easily underestimated. Having been
brought up on a diet of anti-communism for more than 40 years, Americans
need to be persuaded of the wisdom of sending direct financial aid to the
former Soviet Union, particularly during a recession which has highlighted
the country's own domestic problems.
The military airlifts may be a headline-grabbing gimmick, but they also help
prepare the political case for financial aid which - in Mr Hurd's words -
lies just over the horizon. Indeed, British officials stressed this week
that humanitarian aid is merely a short-term remedy, not a long-term
solution.
In order to avoid a 'dependent culture' growing up in the Soviet republics,
the reformers must be pushed into another leap toward a free market - with
the clear prospect of international support, a British official said.
This coincides with the German view. During a long news conference at the
Watergate hotel, Mr Genscher mixed his lengthy description of the German
relief effort over the years with one newsworthy remark: that the issue of
financial aid to the former Soviet Union was certain to be discussed at the
Group of Seven industrialised nations meeting in Munich in July of this
year.
The G7 conference will be chaired by Germany; and unlike the previous
conferences held in Houston and London, this meeting will be discussing
large-scale aid not for a reformist communist Soviet leadership led by Mr
Gorbachev but 11 republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
European diplomats said this week they were leaning hard on the IMF to speed
up membership for Russia and other republics. This would allow them to
borrow to support a stabilisation fund for currencies and, perhaps, a
payments union to ease trading problems between the republics. The World
Bank stands ready to commit money, too, beyond the current technical aid.
This is the point where the tough decisions on financial aid will have to be
taken in Washington. For all the heady rhetoric about the 'global coalition'
for freedom heard at the State Department this week, the moment of reckoning
is approaching fast.
FORMER Soviet republics like Ukraine, which have yet to sign the
western-inspired memorandum of understanding on repaying the debts of the
former Soviet Union, could be refused membership of the International
Monetary Fund, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Germany will press at the G7 meeting to block membership for those not
prepared to honour Soviet debts, not with the aim of excluding them, but
rather in the hope of forcing them into line.
Ukraine is by far the most important of the four which have so far refused
to accept responsibility. The others are Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were forcibly incorporated into the
Soviet Union in 1940, have rejected responsibility for a share of the Soviet
debt apart from that related to projects in the Baltic states.

THE European Parliament is considering a code of conduct for the estimated
3,000 professional lobbyists who have established themselves in Brussels to
influence Community laws and decisions.
This move parallels a similar step by the European Commission, whose 1992
work programme, to be unveiled next month, also talks of the need for a
proper code of conduct between the Commission and pressure groups.
For all their mock horror at the growth in Euro-lobbying, most EC
legislators and officials are privately delighted that so many people now
consider them worth influencing. But as the stakes mount, so does industry
pressure, with, for instance, the tobacco lobby now pulling out all the
stops to head off a near-total ban on tobacco advertising.
Two days of public hearings this week gave professional lobbyists the
unusual chance to lobby in favour of themselves rather than their clients.
Most of them baulked at having to register as lobbyists, as they are
required to do in the US and Germany.

YESTERDAY'S French government proposals inject a potent factor into EC
policy-making on the environment.
The packaging industry and several national governments have been concerned
to prevent the European Commission from modelling its forthcoming directive
on recycling of packaging too closely on Germany's radical legislation
outlined last autumn.
The hostile reaction yesterday to the French proposals from Incpen, the
council representing more than 60 international packaging groups, indicates
the gulf between industry and governments which now appears to be opening
up.
Officials in Brussels see environmental legislation as possibly the most
difficult example of framing common rules to bridge the Community's
north-south gap.
Measures in this field must encompass both the concerns of the rich, 'green'
northern countries, such as Germany and Denmark, and those of poorer
southern countries seeking to catch up with northern living standards which
see much EC environmental law as an expensive obstacle.
Unless this circle is squared, achieving a common policy will be difficult.
Proliferating national laws on the environment could, Commission officials
fear, erect new barriers to competition and trade within the single market.
The German packaging law has already raised complaints that products from
elsewhere in the EC will face discrimination inside Germany, and that the
sheer volume of recycled packaging will overflow German borders to stifle
efforts by its neighbours to get recycling schemes under way.
Yet the latest versions of Brussels' long-delayed plans - still to be
approved by the Commission, much less passed into law by the 12 - are less
exacting than Germany's rigid standards. Officials say plans now aim to
ensure that, within 10 years, 90 per cent of all packaging is reused,
recycled or burnt for energy, and at least 60 per cent would have to be
reused or recycled.
Earlier drafts set targets of 60 per cent overall 'recovery' of the waste
and 40 per cent recycling, but over five years.
It also now seems unlikely that Brussels will press for an EC levy on
packaging to help fund recycling.
The drive for tough waste and recycling standards is one sign of the
environmental pressure emanating from Germany, which is well ahead of the
rest of Europe in this field. The west of the country alone produces an
annual 80m tonnes of industrial waste, and up to 40m tonnes of household
rubbish.
Britain, by contrast, is taking a totally different approach to Germany on
waste disposal, based on deregulation rather than new legal measures.
The Environmental Protection Act lays down that local authorities can no
longer run a waste disposal site and regulate it as well. The functions are
separated and the authorities have to set up companies that operate at arms
length to dispose of waste. In fact, many will be putting out the work to
the private sector.
A much more vigorous approach has been adopted by Bonn.
In the past year, Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, has introduced
a series of initiatives to force German industry to recover and re-use or
re-process increasing proportions of waste.
By 1995, German industry will have to collect 80 per cent of all plastic
waste produced, and recycle 80 per cent of that. Similar targets have been
set for board and paper packages, and higher standards still for glass,
tin-plate and aluminium.
Last summer, Mr Topfer produced further plans for manufacturers to take back
used cars and household electronic appliances.
In the autumn, he proposed a new rubbish surcharge of up to an annual DM10
(Pounds 3.40) per head, with special charges of up to DM200 per tonne for
industrial waste.
In December, he introduced minimum quotas for re-usable bottles for drinks,
and for re-usable packaging to put them in.
At the heart of the recycling effort is the so-called 'green spot' system,
called Duales System Deutschland (DSD), set up by 440 companies to establish
the infrastructure needed to recover and re-use packaging waste.
Companies pay the DSD to have a green spot attached to their products,
showing that they can be returned and re-used. The money charged is supposed
to pay for the cost of running the scheme.
Ironically, the greatest outcry has come not from German industry, but from
foreign companies, fearing they will be disadvantaged on the German market
without green spot packaging.
Latest reports suggest that the scheme is not working as well as intended,
because of a lack of recycling facilities to receive the packaging.
More than 3,000 companies have signed up to put the spots on some 6bn
packages since the scheme came into effect last autumn. By the end of 1992,
the number is supposed to have increased tenfold.

THE government of Estonia resigned yesterday - the second post-Soviet
government to fall after Georgia's was forced out of office earlier this
month.
Mr Edgar Savisaar, the former communist whose two-year tenure as prime
minister saw Estonia move towards free prices and a market economy, paid the
political price when his request for a 'State of Economic Emergency'
designed to push through reforms was first narrowly passed by deputies, then
effectively torpedoed by parliament's refusal this week to set up a
commission to implement the State of Emergency.
The Estonian news agency ETA reported that Mr Savisaar had proposed that Mr
Arnold Ruutel, chairman of the parliament, should head a new government -
though it was not clear if he would, like Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, combine that with the position of head of state.
Estonia, like the other two Baltic states dependent on Russia for energy,
has in the past month had to cut heating to offices and homes and ration
fuel supplies since Russia began charging world prices for its energy -
although it is paid for in goods through a barter system. A new agreement
with Russia to supply extra fuel was signed last week.
Plans for monetary reform based on the introduction of the Estonian crown,
originally planned for the middle of this year, have been postponed until
next April, according to Mr Siim Kallas, president of the Estonian central
bank. Mr Kallas told trade union leaders this week that unemployment would
rise as Estonian enterprises failed to sell their goods on the world market.
President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania yesterday called on western
governments and institutions to provide a stabilisation fund to back the
introduction of a new national currency and support market reforms, writes
Anthony Robinson in London.
Lithuania, he said, was looking for around Dollars 1bn (Pounds 555m),
equivalent to the sum provided to Poland two years ago to back its
stabilisation policies. But Poland has more than 10 times more people.
Mr Landsbergis made clear that Lithuania does not consider itself a
successor state to the former Soviet Union and should not be treated as such
by western creditors seeking repayment of Soviet foreign debt. It would,
however, repay credits of around Dollars 100m which had been used directly
in Lithuanian projects, he added.

AT LEAST 5,000 people are still missing in Croatia where Serb insurgents and
the federal army have executed and tortured Croat civilians during the
seven-month war, the human rights organisation Helsinki Watch said
yesterday.
The New York-based group, in a letter to President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia and army chief of staff General Blagoje Adzic, appeals for the
unconditional release of all civilians taken hostage in the hostilities
which it says have left at least 10,000 people dead.
It calls on the federal army and Serbia to 'investigate reports of torture
and summary executions', to 'refrain from the indiscriminate and
disproportionate use of force, which has caused thousands of civilian
deaths, and cease all discriminate attacks against civilians - including
journalists - and civilian targets'.
Helsinki Watch, which next week will detail similar reports of atrocities
and violations by Croat forces, accuses Serbia of providing 'military,
economic and political support' to local Serb insurgents in Croatia. Its
letter also denounces the 'continuing persecution of the Albanian population
of Kosovo', a province under the direct control of Belgrade.
It urges humane treatment of prisoners held in an estimated 36 detention
camps throughout Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Krajina, a self-proclaim
Serb republic in southern Croatia. Prisoners are currently held in
'appalling conditions', it says, and in 'many cases detainees are tortured
and beaten by their captors'. Families have not been notified of the fate of
at least 3,000 people taken captive after the fall of Vukovar, eastern
Croatia, on November 18. Many of the Croat prisoners are feared to have been
executed.
The 23-page letter contains the most extensive eyewitness accounts to date
of brutalities committed in Croatia's war zones. Reports from Hum and Vocin,
villages about 100 miles east of Zagreb, describe savage acts committed by
the White Eagles, an ultra-nationalist Serb militia, when the villages were
seized in August. The pro-Serb army should be held responsible for the
conduct of paramilitary groups which are armed by the federal military, says
Helsinki Watch.
Croatian autopsy reports said many of the Croatian victims from Hum and
Vocin had multiple gunshot wounds to the face and neck, usually from the
back. Ten bodies had been badly burned, two people had been hit with a sharp
object, propably an axe. Two people had been shot in the eyes. 'Two others
appeared to have chained to a table and then set afire while still alive. .
. . An elderly Croatian couple were chained and burned in their backyard'.
Helsinki Watch officials in Belgrade said yesterday the army had promised to
respond to the letter, which follows similar charges of atrocities by EC
monitors in Croatia.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY will argue that its rising labour costs prohibit any relaxation in
its strict economic and monetary stabilisation measures at this weekend's
meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised
countries.
Conscious of the likely pressure from the US and other G7 members for action
to revive the world economy, German officials insist that any return to the
'Stop-Go' policies of the past would be more damaging to business confidence
than a failure to take action.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, is also likely to defend the
Bundesbank's priority of monetary stability, even though Bonn officials feel
last month's half percentage point rise in interest rates was excessive. At
its fortnightly board meeting in Frankfurt yesterday, the bank took no
action to modify its move.
The attitude in top German government circles is that the slowdown in the
world economy is worrying, but it is not in danger of slipping into
worldwide recession. As for the German economy, in spite of a slowdown from
3.2 per cent growth in 1991 to a forecast 2 per cent this year, 'our
underlying growth remains robust,' a senior official said yesterday.
The principal German worry is the underlying rise in unit labour costs,
coinciding with a stormy round of wage negotiations which could lead, next
week, to strikes in both the steel industry and banking. They point to the
OECD's December forecasts, showing that, of the G7 countries, only Japan and
Germany are facing rising unit labour costs.
The government's annual economic report, to be submitted to the cabinet next
week, forecasts wage rises of around 5 per cent in the coming year in west
Germany - although trade union demands are running at up to 10.5 per cent.
Including wage rises in the east of between 30 and 35 per cent, overall wage
costs could go up 9.5 per cent, it says.
Mr Waigel will be arguing at the G7 meeting that confidence and stability
remain of paramount importance for the world economy. A crucial factor in
maintaining confidence will be success in the Uruguay round of trade
liberalisation talks in the Gatt.
Officials also point to the fundamental problems of the US economy -
although not so much at the precise budget deficit, but rather at the low
level of savings.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Pay threat to Russian economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government was yesterday struggling to retain control of its
economic reform programme after Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president, reportedly
conceded large pay rises for miners and abandoned the target for a balanced
budget in the first quarter of the year.
Mr Yeltsin, who met representatives from Russia's biggest coalfield, the
Kuzbass, on Wednesday, was reported by the Interfax news agency to have
conceded their case for higher salaries.
Such a concession to the powerful mineworkers would open the way to further
wage demands by other industrial workers.
At the same time, the chairman of the Russian central bank, Mr Georgy
Matiukhin, told the Russian parliament that monetary reform was 'senseless -
a complete waste of time and energy' at a time of unrestrained monetary
growth.
Mr Matiukhin said Russian internal debt had risen to Rbs375bn - though other
figures published yesterday showed the Russian debt to be even higher, at
Rbs572bn. The bank chairman said that he expected to print Rbs34.3bn in the
first quarter of 1992, a significant rise over the same period last year.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Life assurance faces difficult journey across EC borders
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING life assurance across EC borders will be no easy matter even in the
post-1992 single market, according to a study by the main European
consumers' organisation. The task will still be hampered by linguistic
difficulties, lack of information and inconsistent customer protection
rules.
The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc) yesterday called on
the European Commission to amend its draft legislation on liberalising the
life assurance market and bring contract law into line in the 12 member
states. However, as one Commission official commented: 'We tried harmonising
contract law at the end of the 1970s and got nowhere, because member states
weren't able to agree.'
The third life assurance directive, which is being discussed, would enable
insurance groups to operate freely throughout the EC from the end of this
year according to their home countries' rules. The same official stressed
yesterday that national authorities' ability to veto 'foreign' contracts
would be limited.
Beuc points out that fixed-term life assurance in Portugal can cost eight
times more than in the UK. Britain, Ireland and France sell the cheapest
life assurance; Greece, Belgium and Portugal the dearest.
According to the Commission, the discrepancies are partly due to differing
national tax regimes, which will not be affected by the draft legislation.
Beuc also found that insurers were reluctant to adapt to the demands of the
single market.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Yarrow wins Pounds 400m navy order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, JAMES BUXTON and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CRUCIAL order for three new Royal Navy frigates worth almost Pounds 400m
went yesterday to Yarrow Shipbuilders of Glasgow after a fierce competition
with rival yards.
The order, announced in the Commons by Mr Tom King, defence secretary,
ensures work for the Clydeside yard well into the mid-1990s and leaves all
three other UK naval yards still searching for shipbuilding orders for that
period. About half the total value will go to Yarrow, a subsidiary of
Britain's General Electric Company (GEC).
Defence officials said it had been 'a clear win on cost grounds' against
bids from VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Swan Hunter of Tyneside and
Southampton-based Vosper Thornycroft.
The government, however, is widely seen as also having had strong political
reasons for wanting to place the work in Scotland, especially after the
announcement earlier this month of plans to close the Ravenscraig steel
complex in Lanarkshire with the loss of 1,200 jobs.
Workers at Yarrow reacted with delight and relief to the news that they had
won the order for all three frigates. 'It's excellent,' said one of the
shipbuilding workers. 'It means job security for the next three years,' said
another.
Local Labour politicians and trade unionists had raised the possibility of
the yard closing down if the order had gone elsewhere. That idea was
dismissed earlier this week by Sir Robert Easton, Yarrow's chairman.
Sir Robert said yesterday, however, that redundancies would still be needed
before work began on the new ships unless further orders were secured.
Yarrow, which has been in negotiation with Malaysia over an order for two
corvettes, shed 645 jobs late last year, reducing the workforce to 2,750.
The contract follows a recent Pounds 200m order for four chemical carriers
won by Kvaerner Govan, the Norwegian-owned merchant shipyard on the other
side of the Clyde.
It is also the second big defence order for GEC this week. The group leads
an international consortium which will provide electronic warfare equipment
potentially worth Pounds 1.5bn for the European Fighter Aircraft.
Yarrow, which lost the competition for the last batch of warships to Swan
Hunter, has now won nine of the 13 orders placed for Type 23 anti-submarine
frigates.
Officials said placing orders in batches had proved much less expensive than
spreading them between different yards. Work on the new ships is due to
begin late this year and continue for about four years.
At least one further batch is planned, but that order is expected to be
about two years away. Future Royal Navy orders are not expected to be
sufficient to sustain all four yards, which were privatised in 1985-86.
Swan Hunter, which currently employs 3,800 including 1,000 on short-term
contract, said it was 'naturally disappointed' that its 'extremely
competitive bid' had failed.
VSEL, which currently has no orders for surface warships, said it still
needed a share of the frigate programme to provide work following completion
of Trident nuclear-missile submarines.
Vosper Thornycroft said it would also keep trying for a share of frigate
orders.
The Ministry of Defence also announced yesterday it was buying the
ice-breaker Polar Circle, which it currently leases, from Rieber Shipping of
Norway to replace HMS Endurance in the South Atlantic. The price was not
disclosed.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Banker to succeed departing SIB chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID WALKER, tipped as a possible candidate to become the next governor
of the Bank of England, yesterday announced a surprise decision to step down
as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
investment regulator.
He will leave at the end of May, when his current four-year term ends.
Explaining his departure, Sir David, 52, who was asked to take on the post
in 1988 after other candidates turned the position down, said: 'I don't want
to retire a regulator.' He said he was looking for a new job in the private
sector, but did not yet have another position to go to.
His job is to be taken by Mr Andrew Large, a 49-year-old banker. A former
chairman of The Securities Association, one of the City's self-regulatory
organisations, Mr Large was the first Briton to be appointed to the main
board of a Swiss bank when with Swiss Bank Corporation in the mid-1980s.
Sir David was sent into the SIB at a time of widespread City concern about
the bureaucratic and costly system of regulation that had been set up by his
predecessor, Sir Kenneth Berrill.
A former executive director at the Bank of England, where he still sits as a
non-executive director, Sir David's forceful style and impatient manner have
at times antagonised the self-regulatory organisations which come under the
SIB's control. They have also enabled him to push through extensive changes
to the regulatory system set up under the 1986 Financial Services Act.
Sir David said he had warned of his intention to leave the SIB last
September, but had offered to stay for a further short period beyond the end
of his existing term if needed. The offer was not taken up by Mr Peter
Lilley, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, current
governor of the Bank, who jointly appoint the SIB chairman.
The announcement of Sir David's departure comes as the SIB is close to
finalising its policy on the selling of retail investment products such as
life assurance and unit trusts - one of the most difficult and important
aspects of its work.
Policy decisions are expected to be taken before Sir David departs on
several important aspects, including how commissions are paid on life
assurance policies. But other aspects of retail regulation, such as the
future of Fimbra, the financially troubled watchdog for independent
financial advisers, will be left to Mr Large.

THE US will begin emergency airlifts of food and medicine to the former
Soviet republics on February 10 in a gesture of solidarity underlining the
end of the Cold War, writes Lionel Barber in Washington.
Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, announced the military relief effort,
codenamed Operation Provide Hope, yesterday at the end of a two-day
conference of 47 nations in Washington called by the US to co-ordinate aid
to the ex-Soviet states.
The US proposal, involving 54 US Air Force flights, runs counter to German
arguments that land and sea transport is more effective and less costly, but
Mr Baker said at the State Department yesterday that the use of US forces
was symbolically important. '(It) can vividly show the peoples of the former
Soviet Union that those that once prepared for war with them now have the
courage and conviction to use their militaries to say 'we will wage a new
peace',' he said.
The US has dispatched airlifts to select republics in recent months, but the
latest relief effort - reminiscent of the Berlin air-lift in the late 1940s
 -seemed more ambitious. The flights of C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft from
Frankfurt will last between one and two weeks. The aim is to target
orphanages, hospitals and other needy groups in all 12 independent states.
Advance teams from the Pentagon and other Federal agencies will oversee the
on-site distribution. The hope is to prevent the chronic corruption which
has to date plagued the western relief effort.
European diplomats suggested yesterday that the use of C-5 aircraft from
Rhein-Main air-base could herald a fresh campaign to use Nato forces to
oversee the relief effort. Mr Baker pointedly noted Nato's earlier offer of
logistical support.
Using Nato forces could run into opposition from France which this week
expressed reservations about the Washington conference which also involved
five international financial organisations including the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
France dispatched its deputy foreign minister, criticised the decision to
bar the ex-Soviet republics from attending and called for practical on-site
mechanisms to ensure distribution of the food and humanitarian aid already
available.
In Washington, EC trade commissioner Frans Andriessen said nations outside
the EC would have to do more to help out the former Soviet Union, as the
current 'burden sharing doesn't reflect the global nature' of the issue.
In spite of these reservations, the participants described the conference as
a useful exchange of views which had produced detailed plans of action to
help the republics in dismantling their centrally planned economies.
The US defused rivalry with Europeans by agreeing to a follow-up conference
in Lisbon this spring, to be sponsored by the European Commission and
attended by the republics.
Japan, which has been accused of dragging its feet over aid because of its
claim to the Kurile islands, has offered to host a third conference.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Lonrho cuts dividend as profits fall by a quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, yesterday announced the first cut
in its final dividend for a decade as pre-tax profits for the year to the
end of September 1991 fell by 24 per cent to Pounds 207m.
The final dividend has been cut by 3p to 5p per share. The group also took
the unusual step of withholding this year's first interim dividend, which
was expected to be 3p.
Lonrho was hit by the recession on both sides of the Atlantic and the
appreciation of sterling against the currencies of the African states in
which it has many of its assets. Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive, said: 'We
want to see how earnings are going before returning to our traditional
policy of maximum distribution.'
There has been speculation that Lonrho, which has borrowings of just under
Pounds 1.1bn, has been under pressure to cut its dividend from its banks,
led by Standard Chartered, Barclays and National Westminster and two Swiss
banks, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation. But bankers denied this
yesterday.
Lonrho held a meeting last week with executives of Standard Chartered, which
has substantial Far East and African operations. But the dividend was not on
the agenda.
Although the market had closed when the results were released at 4.30pm, the
shares were marked down in after-hours dealing by around 40p.
Earlier, they had risen by 9p to close at 163p when the group confirmed the
sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne and Nagel, the German freight
forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 118.8m).
In a statement released with the results Lonrho said: 'The board and
management regret having to present a disap-pointing year's results'.
Mr Mike Smith, analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, commented: 'I have
never seen the company regret anything in all the years I have followed
Lonrho. It is encouraging to see that they have decided to be more open.'
Mr Philip Tarsh, Lonrho director, said he could not understand why the
results should come as a surprise. 'We were badly hit by the recession. The
fall in precious metal prices accounts for nearly half of the reduction in
Lonrho's profits in the second six months. Why analysts could not see that
is beyond me.'
Lonrho had better news to announce from its balance sheet. Although net debt
had increased from Pounds 936m to Pounds 1.1bn, this was better than most
commentators feared. It represented 73 per cent of shareholders funds of
Pounds 1.5bn, including minority interests. Gearing will fall by another 10
per cent after the Kuhne and Nagel disposal is taken into account.

TIMES HAVE not been propserous for collective-fund investors. Even with the
recovery in world stock markets during 1991, ten out of the 15 unit trusts
sectors covered in our tables, and ten out of the 13 investment trust
sectors, have incurred a loss over the last two years.
Worst of all were those trusts investing in Japan, with the average unit
trust in the area losing 35 per cent over two years, and the average
investment trust more than 40 per cent.
Even over the longer five-year period, many trusts failed to beat the 64.6
per cent return on index-linked National Savings. Four investment trust
sectors managed to do so, but no unit trust sector achieved this feat.
The brightest sector has been UK income growth investment trusts, several of
which now stand at a premium to net assets. The elimination of the discount
has boosted the share-price performance of this sector. The individual
investment trust leader over five years is the tiny Capital Gearing trust.
Among unit trusts, the five-year champion is Newtown Income; the recent poor
performance of the Japanese stock market has meant that the previous star,
Schroder Japanese Smaller Companies, has slipped back.
The five-year performance records of collective funds ought to pick up in
November, when the 1987 stock market crash will start to drop out of the
statistics.
For the moment, it is really only over the 10-year span that the benefits of
collective fund investment can be seen. The average UK equity income trust,
for example, turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 5,033 between January 1982 and
January 1992, and the Key Income fund turned the same sum into Pounds 7,480.
The difficulty for potential investors is that past performance, while a
useful guide, sends out some contradictory signals. Capital Gearing has
turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 2,625 over five years, but over the last two
years it has turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 536. Which is the better
indicator of its future performance? Fidelity Japanese Special Situations is
seventh in its sector over five years, but 67th over two.
Nor do the performance figures settle the thorny question of whether unit or
investment trusts offer the better prospects to the small investor.
Investment trusts seem to have the performance edge, as measured by these
tables, but a good deal of this due to discounts narrowing. Such narrowing
cannot occur again. Indeed, the volume of investment trust new issues
creates a chance that the discount could widen once more. The relative
performance of unit trusts could look alot better in five years time.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (36):
Massive interest over five years - The Business Expansion Scheme / The
Budget is likely to see the end of buy-back schemes, which may seem too
generous a tax-break for the benefits they deliver, and are not a suitable
home for all your savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STAND BY for a clearance sale by Business Expansion Scheme companies in the
run-up to the budget. Schemes that seek to assure a fixed return after five
years are expected to be abolished.
In many ways, it is surprising that the government allowed them to start in
the first place; yet such a move would also be a shame. For these schemes
have finally won support for the BES from the mainstream intermediaries and
accountants who control most of the UK's investment business. Previously, it
had seemed too speculative for small investors.
At first, the BES may not seem to have much to do with mainstream personal
finance. It was set up in 1981 as the Business Start-up Scheme, to stimulate
investment in high-risk small companies - and many early BSS companies
indeed lived up to the 'high-risk' label.
Since then, it has regularly been altered. In 1988, the scheme was opened to
investment in 'assured tenancy' rental accommodation, to help the private
rental sector. The housing side of the BES now predominates  - the maximum
size for a BES tenancy company is Pounds 5m, but for trading companies the
limit is only Pounds 750,000.
The broad outlines for private investors are as follows. You can invest up
to Pounds 40,000 in companies which qualify for investments under the BES.
You then submit a BES3 form (sent to you by the company) to the Inland
Revenue. The total value of your investment is then deducted from your total
taxable income. Thus, if you are a 40 per cent taxpayer, you will receive a
rebate of 40 per cent of the amount you invested. So you ultimately part
with only Pounds 24,000 to invest Pounds 40,000.
You may lose this relief if you do not hold on to your BES shares for at
least five years; otherwise, provided you can sell the shares, you should
make a substantial profit. However, making a clean exit from the company has
proved difficult for many of the trading companies which have now finished
their five years, and this, combined with the speculative nature of the
investment, has deterred investors.
The new concept of covenanted buy-back companies attempts to ensure an exit
route, and also a specific yield. BES sponsors go to providers of low-cost
rental housing - usually colleges or housing associations - and offer to buy
them some property. In return, the association or college must covenant to
buy back the property, for a fixed price, when the five-year BES term has
elapsed.
The fixed price will typically be around 35 per cent or 40 per cent higher
than the price paid initially. now. This provides the covenanting housing
providers with reasonably cheap finance, and they have the use of the
housing stock for five years. But they are 'taking a punt' on house price
inflation. If they cannot afford the covenanted price after five years, they
are legally obliged to borrow to meet it. This would have the unfortunate
effect of using substantial tax relief from the Treasury to force worthy
organisations into debt.
However, the odds are that the covenanting bodies will do well out of the
deals. The only risk for investors comes if they go out of business
altogether.
The exit route would then be much less secure, as, in most cases, there is
no third-party guarantor. These schemes are not entitled to describle
themselves as 'guaranteed', despite some early marketing claims.
However, one scheme launched in September - IM Assured Growth - had a
guarantee from the Bank of America. It was quickly oversubscribed. This type
of scheme seems likely to spread.
If you are a 40 per cent taxpayer, and have money to put away for five
years, these schemes may deserve attention. Interest rates after tax-relief
are massive. For example, Johnson Fry's Seventh Super Growth offers the
equivalent of 16.5 per cent annually, roughly double what you might hope to
get from a five-year guaranteed income bond.
The problem with the 'buy-back' schemes is that they seem far too generous a
tax-break for the actual benefits they deliver. The latest edition of the
Investor's Chronicle Beginners' Guide to Investment described the practice
as 'arbitraging the taxman'. Certainly, the schemes are far removed from the
original principle of encouraging investors to take risks.
However, Stephen Bantoft, BES analyst of the Allenbridge Group, points out
that they offer the security of a long-term owner, and should therefore do
more to encourage lasting housing provision for the needy. Schemes aiming to
sell to a private owner in five years might provide only a brief interlude
of private rental housing, and are of less help to the country's current
housing crisis.
The other main class of BES company is the 'predator'. These do not have the
secured exit route, but aim to profit to the full from the current depressed
residential property market. Thus they buy now, let the houses to private
tenants for five years, and then sell, hoping to make a profit.
There could be problems with exit routes. Otherwise, the strength of the
investment depends on your reading of the residential property market. The
central problem is that the BES is an inappropriate vehicle for housing
subsidies. If the upper limit for investments in trading companies were
raised, things might be different.
Several operators are looking at ways to extend the 'buy-back' principle to
trading companies. For example, the BES might be used to finance individual
supermarkets or petrol stations for larger chains, who would buy them after
five years. This would be an interesting development, returning the scheme
to its original intentions, but in a form which might allow average small
investors to benefit. It also effectively circumvents the Pounds 750,000
limit.
For the time being, tread carefully, but keep an eye open for opportunities.
The view of David Harris, of accountants Chantrey Vellacott, is typical:
'I'm fairly positive with regard to the so-called guaranteed schemes. If you
are prepared to accept that there's a limited risk, it's definitely
something you should consider as part of a broader portfolio. But it would
be lunacy to take everything out of the Halifax tomorrow and put it in a BES
residential scheme.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (34): Keep
your head while salesmen lose theirs - Before the tax year ends / As the
April deadline approaches, here are 10 ways to reap a harvest in the spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END-of-tax-year 'harvest season' for financial products is almost upon
us. You need to make many important decisions, but try to keep your head
while all salesmen around you are losing theirs. Here are 10 taxing topics
to think about:
Pensions and Additional Voluntary Contributions. If you want to put the full
15 per cent of your salary into a pension this tax year, you should top up
your company pension with an AVC.
Pension contributions offer one of the most tax-effective forms of long-term
investment. Remember that when you reach retirement cannot take a lump sum
from a (post-1987) AVC but must buy an annuity. A personal equity plan
offers more flexibility.
Personal Equity Plans. The survey contained in this issue of the Quarterly
Review has all the necessary information about Pep investment. Suffice to
say that if you have Pounds 6,000 to spare, a managed unit or investment
trust Pep (one that combines trusts with additional shares) might make
sense, and if you have a large portfolio of equities, you should probably
transfer holdings up to the annual limit into a tax-free plan. Delay until
April and you have excluded yourself from Pounds 9,000 in tax-free
investment.
Business Expansion Scheme. To take advantage of this valuable tax concession
then, again, you must act before April. It is best to do deals before Budget
day, to be on the safe side. This applies in particular to the covenanted
buy-back companies, which are widely tipped for abolition.
Tax-exempt Special Saver Accounts. These require no particular action before
the end of the tax year. However, if you started a Tessa at the beginning of
last January, now is the time to top up with this year's instalment of
Pounds 1,800.
Enterprise Zones. The very wealthy might consider investing in commercial
property in enterprise zones. You receive full tax relief at your top
marginal rate on EZ investments, and there is no upper limit on the amount
you can invest.
You can also effectively obtain tax relief on loans taken out to finance an
EZ investment, if you pay for them with rental income from the property.
If you have a lot of money to shelter from tax, EZs probably offer the best
way to do it, but do not proceed without advice.
Interest on saving accounts. Following last year's abolition of composite
rate tax (CRT) on interest on bank and building society accounts,
non-taxpayers need no longer pay any tax on these accounts. If you are
already registered as a non-taxpayer you do not need to re-register. But if
you have not already registered, you should do so.
If you, or your spouse, have ceased to pay income tax this year (through
redundancy or retirement, for example) you need to claim exemption from the
beginning of the next tax year. Leaflet IR 111, 'How to Claim Repayments of
Tax on Bank and Building Society Interest' and form R 95 are available from
your local tax office.
Bed &amp; breakfasting. If your portfolio is likely to make gains above the
Pounds 5,500 capital gains tax threshold, you might benefit from a bed &amp;
breakfast deal. A B&amp;B deal involves selling a share one afternoon and buying
it back the following morning. In the process, you take a gain or loss for
this tax year. If you have already taken more than Pounds 5,500 in gain this
year, it might be worth doing a B&amp;B deal to establish a loss elsewhere in
your portfolio. This way you can still avoid paying CGT this year.
Also, you can B&amp;B stocks which are doing well in order to limit the gains on
which you will eventually pay tax, although this is more speculative, and
the dealing costs might cut into the tax saving.
It is important to use an accountant, unless your broker is one of those who
provide all the documentation you need in time to make B&amp;B deals. All gains
and losses should be calculated after indexation.
Inheritance Tax. Current legislation allows you to give away up to Pounds
3,000 to a single individual each year free of inheritance tax. You can also
carry forward unused gift allowances from last year, but you must use this
year's Pounds 3,000 first. Also, you can only carry forward one year - after
that, the exemption is lost.
If you gave nothing away last year, you can give away Pounds 6,000 this
year. However, if you only gave away Pounds 3,000 this year, you would be
treated as using up this year's allowance, and would have no extra to carry
forward for next year. You can also make gifts up to Pounds 250 to as many
different people as you like, free of IHT.
Charitable giving. Now is the time to make a Gift Aid donation. If you give
Pounds 600 or more to a charity, it will be 'grossed up'. Therefore, if you
part with Pounds 600, the charity, after 25 per cent tax has been added,
will receive Pounds 800.
If you are a top-rate taxpayer, you then receive 15 per cent (the difference
between the top and basic rates). In this example, that is Pounds 120. So
you spend a net Pounds 480 to make a donation of Pounds 800. You can also
enroll on a payroll Give As You Earn scheme for next year.
Offshore Trusts. This is a very abstruse area, on which you should seek
accounting and legal advice before taking any action. However, Edmund Wood,
of BDO Binder Hamlyn, points out that sweeping changes made by last year's
budget could require action in this tax year if you do not want to miss out.
Following the changes, when capital payments are made from an offshore trust
to a UK beneficiary, capital gains tax must be paid on them. However, from
next tax year onwards there will be a supplemental charge of 10 per cent per
annum. So, if you are considering making such a payment before long, Mr Wood
points out that it would be wise to make the payment before, rather than
after, April 5.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (33):
Premiums fall but vary widely - Travel insurance / One insured holidaymaker
in every 15 eventually makes a claim on policies offered by 100 companies
competing in a profitable market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
THINGS CAN go wrong when you take a holiday abroad, and the expense,
especially if you are unfortunate enough to need hospital treatment, may be
considerable.
One insured holidaymaker in 15 eventually makes a claim to recoup the cost
of cancellation, lost luggage or medical treatment.
Travel insurance is a classic example of what insurers call a 'commodity
product'. According to Peter Friend, of Leslie &amp; Godwin, the insurance
broker, most policies are similar in character, offering cover for a
standard range of risks:
Cancellation or curtailment of a holiday;
Loss of luggage (usually covered for between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 1,500)
and money (Pounds 250 to Pounds 800).
Medical costs: (typically, cover of up to Pounds 250,000 in Europe, and
Pounds 1m in the US where treatment can be very expensive, though some
policies offer higher limits).
Other clauses provide compensation in the event of an accident, and also
cover any legal expenses that might be incurred.
Terms are often comparable. Excesses (the amount that the policyholder must
bear of any claim) of Pounds 25 apply in most cases. However, conditions can
differ sharply, according to the type of holiday. The cover for losses
arising from the cancellation or curtailment of a holiday varies from about
Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 5,000, for example.
But although premiums have fallen in the past few years, as more insurers
have competed for what has traditionally been reasonably profitable
business, rates for exactly the same policy can vary markedly among the 100
or so companies in the market.
According to Which?, the magazine of the Consumers' Association, which
published an extensive review of the market last February, cover for a
family holiday in the US can cost as much as Pounds 158 or as little as
Pounds 94.20.
A survey conducted by Leslie &amp; Godwin also shows wide variations. Lunn Poly,
the tour operator, charges holidaymakers Pounds 20.90 for seven-days' cover
for a European holiday; while Masseys, the broker, which markets a policy
underwritten at Lloyd's of London, charges only Pounds 13.50.
Most companies rate premiums in three geographical bands: travel outside
Europe is the most expensive, Europe is cheaper, and the UK cheaper still.
Premiums vary according to the number of days' cover, and are also affected
by the amount of commission earned by the retailers - banks, travel agents
and tour operators.
Tour operators sometimes charge higher commissions; in some cases they also
provide special packages.
Wallace Arnold provides special rates for family groups, while Lunn Poly
offers discounts for pensioners.
People who take holidays where the risk of injury is higher, such as skiers,
must usually pay higher rates. Winter-sports packages also provide snow
guarantees, which compensate skiers if there is insufficient snow on the
ground, and also cover losses arising from rock damage to equipment.
Holidaymakers should be aware of exclusion clauses, paragraphs in fine print
which spell out circumstances under which cover is not valid. Off-piste
skiing is sometimes not covered.
More generally, holiday insurance policies rarely provide cover if you are
travelling against medical advice, or for anything that happens while you
are under the influence of drink or drugs. And policyholders should be aware
that cover for loss of property, such as jewellery, cameras and expensive
watches, can be limited. In some cases, it may be advisable to extend your
home-contents policy.
Travel by car can mean extra requirements that are not met by standard
travel cover - such as the cost of repairing your car, or of hiring a
replacement. So you may need to extend your motor insurance, too. Companies
can supply you with a Green Card, which is internationally recognised proof
that you are covered. Which? warns: 'You can drive without a Green Card in
EC countries, but cover is then limited to the legal minimum for that
country.'
The magazine lists more than two dozen companies that provide good coverage
relatively cheaply for holidays in the UK, Europe, the US and worldwide. Its
list of 'best buys' covers four categories of holiday: those where no
special requirements are involved, 'family holidays', trips taken by the
'retired or elderly', and those where 'higher levels of cover' than those
provided on standard forms are required.
In turn, rates for each type of holiday are cited for four destinations: the
UK, Europe, US and worldwide. Specialist brokers Crispin Spears and Lloyds
Bank, which sells a policy underwritten by Commercial Union, get most
mentions. Crispin Spears is particularly competitive in the UK, while Lloyds
provides best value for most holidays outside Europe. Brokers Frizzell and
MKC also figure prominently.
Crispin Spears' popular Annual Protection Plan is particularly suitable for
business travellers who make frequent trips to Europe or farther afield. It
covers any number of trips each year. Guy Ireland, of Crispin, says the cost
varies, from Pounds 80 a year for Europe, Pounds 100 for the US and Pounds
120 for a full international cover. The policy is particularly appropriate
for people who have second homes in France or elsewhere in Europe, he says.
Finally, holidaymakers may find they have some level of automatic cover when
tickets are bought with a credit card. Most ordinary cards simply provide
basic personal accident cover, but some gold cards provide extensive cover.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): A
happy anniversary for some - TESSAs / Savers who opened an account at launch
are now entitled to add to it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU have money languishing in a bank or building society account, now is
the time to top up your Tessa (tax-exempt special savings account). Those
who opened a Tessa last January can now put in the second instalment, up to
a limit of Pounds 1,800.
To obtain the best gains, you should try to put in the maximum amounts each
year as early as possible. Statistics suggest that investors are doing just
that: more than 2.7m Tessa accounts were opened in the year to September and
around Pounds 7bn deposited, according to Treasury figures. This represents
an average of just under Pounds 2,600 in each Tessa opened.
The average rate of interest paid last year on Tessas was about 12.9 per
cent - a healthy return, particularly as it is tax-free provided you keep
the Tessa over the full five-year period. This means that those who put in
the maximum Pounds 3,000 last year will already have earned around Pounds
387 in interest.
Investors are allowed to draw the net interest on the Tessa, but must leave
the capital untouched in order to qualify for the tax-free element.
The table, of the best performing Tessas for 1991, shows the value of Pounds
3,000 on the first anniversary of the account. Only bonuses paid at the end
of the first year have been included, because they will accrue further
interest. Bonuses paid at the end of the five-year period have therefore
been excluded.
Tessas are theoretically transferable, so you can move to another
institution if you feel you are getting a raw deal. Before doing so,
however, check that you are not going to be losing a good bonus in order to
chase a higher rate of interest. For example, Kent Reliance, Lambeth and
Norwich and Peterborough building societies will all pay a bonus of a
maximum of Pounds 300 at the end of the five-year term. This may well
outperform even the better interest rates.
Also check on transfer penalties. Barclays, which had the most draconian -
the loss of all interest on the first year if transferred - has now dropped
this in favour of a Pounds 25 transfer fee. In some cases, the transfer
penalty may outweigh the benefit of a more attractive rate of interest.
Finally, check that the operator you wish to switch to will actually accept
the Tessa, and remember that a society offering a good rate of interest now
may not do so in the future.

Nostalgia at the 19th hole - Alternative investments / Collectors are teed
up, because the auction houses now hold annual sales of golfing memorabilia.
 Last summer these brought in Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>

THIS SUMMER, there should be cheering to the rafters of the gym at Loretto
School, in Scotland - not in celebration of any athletic feat, but because
an old golf club has been sold for rather a lot of money.
Each year, the three leading auction houses - Sotheby's, Christie's and
Phillips - hold major auctions of golf memorabilia on the practice days of
the British Open Championship. This year, the Open will be at the
Musselburgh club, and Sotheby's has cornered Loretto School, which is on the
course, for its sale. Its star lot is a golf club which was made about 1700,
the oldest certified club in good condition to appear on the market. Bids of
Pounds 100,000, and maybe more, are expected.
Jon Baddeley, Sotheby's expert in the field, is confident of beating the
auction record for a golf club of Pounds 55,000, set by Christie's in 1989.
Last year, Christie's sold a club head, of the same period and found in the
same area (in a hedge on the outskirts of the North Berwick Golf Club, the
home of the game) for Pounds 44,000 to an American dealer.
Most people would have reckoned the head, fashioned by a local blacksmith,
to be a lump of old iron. Its location confirmed its rarity. Sotheby's has a
complete club, a family heirloom which for years had lain unappreciated in a
North Berwick home. Hence its confidence in a record price.
The auction houses have been holding regular annual sales of golfing
memorabilia since the mid-1980s. Last summer, they brought in about Pounds
1.8m, and are the main source of new material for collectors. There are a
couple of specialist dealers in the UK, one working out of Grays Antiques
Market, in London; while Morton Almond, of Cincinnati, is the leading
collector-dealer in the world. He publishes the essential price guides, but
this is basically a collecting field dominated by the salerooms.
With 50 million golfers world-wide, many of them wealthy individuals, it
requires only a small proportion to take an interest in the history of their
favourite game to get prices rising. Demand has been underpinned over the
past decade by the interest of Japanese golfing fanatics, and by the opening
throughout the world of major new golf clubs, many of them aimed at a rich
membership. A new club with pretensions invariably likes to establish an
alcove, perhaps near the bar, to act as a shrine to the game and to display
golfing memorabilia.
In the same way, old and established British clubs are keen to acquire
momentos, such as portraits and golf clubs, of past members who achieved
sporting glory.
Even though the Japanese were not prominent among the bidders at last year's
summer sales, the purchasing for club collections, and private buying,
ensured a steady appreciation in price, at least for the older and rarer
items. So much so that there are already forgers turning out old clubs,
balls, and golfing pictures.
As in most collecting fields, there is a vast price differential between the
old, rare, well authenticated objects in good condition and the more recent
mass-produced items.
Among golf balls, it is the feather balls, produced up to the mid-19th
century, which command the high prices. They were expensive in their day -
2s 6d each - so it is not surprising that a record Pounds 14,850 was paid at
Christie's for a ball made in the 1840s by the celebrated Allan Robertson.
In clubs, it is the tailor-made examples, produced in the same period by
such important names as Hugh Philp, which sell for up to Pounds 15,000.
Prices fall away dramatically for the mass-produced clubs made at the end of
the 19th century, which is encouraging for new collectors with modest
resources. Good Edwardian examples of golf clubs have hardly moved in price
over the past five years, and can still be acquired for Pounds 10 or so. A
good collection of 20th century clubs could be amassed for Pounds 500.
But serious collectors must be prepared to pay much more. At Sotheby's last
July, a collection of 23 clubs was sold for Pounds 627,000 (just over
Dollars 1m) to a British company. They were collected by William
Auchterlonie and his son Laurie, who were professionals at the Royal and
Ancient Club at St Andrew's, between 1860 and 1930. The Auchterlonies
acquired a club from every winner of the British Open. The appeal of the
collection is owning a club used by such great names as Willie Park Senior,
winner of the first Open in 1860, and the fabled Bobby Jones.
The fanatics will pay extraordinary prices for a piece of golfing history.
At Christie's last year a gutty golf ball marker went to Japan for Pounds
35,200. These hand-operated markers were used for a short period in the
1870s, to cut into the new gutta percha golf balls to make them fly better.
The attraction of golfing memorabilia is that it stretches far beyond old
golf clubs and balls. The highest prices are paid for paintings and prints
of the game and its heroes, which are surprisingly rare.
Sir Francis Grant is not a great painter by any reckoning, but his mid-19th
century portrait of John Whyte-Melville, captain of the Royal and Ancient,
standing with the club house in the background, went to Japan last year for
Pounds 165,000. Sotheby's sold 'North Berwick: the Third Tee', by Sir John
Lavery, for Pounds 44,000.
Memorabilia - inkwells shaped like holes, ceramics illustrated with golfing
scenes, statuettes of golfers - are all keenly sought after. Something as
dull to non-fanatics as a certificate confirming Edinburgh membership of the
Honourable Company of Golfers could attract a bid of Pounds 23,650 - because
it is dated 1779.
Scotland gave the world golf. Now the world is coming to Scotland to acquire
an instant history for clubhouses in Osaka and the Costa del Sol.
Well publicised high prices have opened up a remarkable hoard of treasures.
International demand should ensure that the rarest objects remain expensive,
but those whose golf stops short at the 19th hole, and whose pockets are not
limitless, can still acquire intriguing momentos cheaply.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): What
job-changers should know - Pensions / An employee who leaves early is
entitled to a deferred pension in a company scheme, yet administrators often
fail to explain the situation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PEOPLE WHO change jobs tend to be confused about what happens to their
benefits in the company pension scheme. Such employees, often referred to as
early leavers, still appear to be treated as 'poor relations', by comparison
with those who remain with the company.
Legislation over the past few years has improved their position, narrowing,
though not eliminating, the gap in benefits between early leavers and
stayers. But it has also created a complicated scenario.
The latest report from the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas),
published at the end of October, showed that early-leaver problems were the
largest source of complaints (about a third). Many employees, it said, were
still baffled by their entitlements, and administrators failed to explain
the situation adequately.
An employee who changes jobs is entitled to a deferred pension in the
company scheme, based on salary and length of service at the time of
leaving, revalued until retirement to allow for inflation. Alternatively, he
can take the cash equivalent, known as a transfer value, which can be
transferred to another occupational pension scheme or invested in a pension
contract with a life company.
However, in calculating the transfer value, the scheme's actuary is required
to estimate the amount of deferred pension at retirement, how much that
pension will increase in retirement, and how long the employee will live. He
must also discount these benefits (including spouse's benefits) back to the
present. So the actuary has to make various assumptions about inflation,
pension increases, mortality and investment returns.
Opas found that complaints by early leavers fell into the following
categories:
Delay in obtaining a quotation;
Misunderstanding over the conditions under which a quotation is valid;
Failure to appreciate that the value can vary with time and changing market
conditions; and
Concern over the value itself.
We asked a number of consulting actuaries and pension consultants about
their procedures regarding transfer values, and how they dealt with such
complaints.
Delay in obtaining a quotation
Most transfer-value calculations are relatively straightforward, in
actuarial terms, now that the 1990 Social Security Act requires all the
deferred pension in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) to be
revalued in line with the retail price index, up to 5 per cent a year.
Indeed, many actuaries have written the calculation procedures on computer
diskettes, and the schemes themselves run the programmes with parameters
provided by the actuary. The quotations can be produced very quickly.
Delay arises in checking data about the employee and initiating the
procedures, and will be compounded if more than one organisation is
involved.
Many schemes still have their records separate from the company's employee
records, especially if there are several autonomous operating companies
within a group but one centralised pension scheme. If there is a mass
redundancy programme involving several hundred employees, most of whom want
transfer-value quotations at the same time, delay is inevitable.
The main complaint from employees is that they submit their application for
a quotation and then hear nothing for months. They would appreciate at least
an acknowledgement of their application and an apology that it will take
several weeks to process. Scheme administrators, despite work pressures at
such times, should make this simple courteous act.
The House of Commons social security committee last month called for
employees to be provided with up-to-date transfer values on an annual basis
 -presumably included in the annual benefit statement. Some pension schemes
already provide this information.
Misunderstanding of conditions
In making a transfer, the sequence of events is usually as follows:
1, The employee obtains a quotation. He or she then . . .
2, Considers the situation and decides to take a transfer;
3, Looks at the market and talks to a life-company intermediary, either
independent or tied;
4, Decides to make the transfer; and
5, Formally asks the trustees of the scheme to arrange the transfer of
benefits to a named pension scheme or life company.
There can be a delay of several weeks between obtaining a quotation and
formally requesting a transfer, and here misunderstanding arises. With a
formal request for transfer, the transfer value is calculated at the time of
the request and its value is guaranteed in that, when the trustees
eventually pay over the transfer, the amount will be the value at either the
time of the request or at the date of transfer if this is higher.
But this guarantee does not apply to an informal request for a quotation. In
theory, such quotations only apply on the day the calculation was made. The
value should be calculated afresh when the formal request is made. Most
consultants now advise their client schemes to give a guaranteed period
during which the quotation is valid  - usually two or three months - and to
inform the employee on the quotation form of this period of validity.
Transfer values can vary
This leads to the third complaint:
Transfer values are not like deposit accounts, which never fall in money
terms. There are short-term fluctuations in transfer values as market
conditions change, particularly the rate of discount, linked to the assumed
investment return, used by the actuary, even though the deferred pension
itself steadily increases in value.
When actuaries calculate transfer values, they follow guidance laid down by
their profession: GN (Guidance Note) 11, issued by the Institute of
Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. But this guidance note is far from
specific, and allows actuaries freedom to use professional judgment in their
calculations, particularly on the rate of interest used in discounting. Many
actuaries base the discounting rate on the yield from long-term gilts,
reviewing their rate as frequently as once a month.
If yields rise, then actuaries will increase their rate of discount,
resulting in a lower transfer value, and vice versa.
So if yields have risen between the employee's obtaining a quotation and
formally requesting a transfer, he will get a lower value transferred, by
comparison with the value given on the original quotation.
All consultants advise their clients to warn employees on the quotation form
that values can vary - up and down - over shortish periods.
So employees, when obtaining a transfer-value quotation, should first check
the period of validity (one major consultancy firm said it did not give any
guaranteed period); then, if they feel that interest rates are going to
rise, they should play safe and make a formal request within the guaranteed
period.
Actual transfer value
The final cause of complaint is the transfer value itself: employees
invariably consider it too low. But of even more concern is the variation in
values calculated by different actuaries. The flexibility given to actuaries
in GN 11 can result in a wide variation in values for the same deferred
pension.
Consider a hypothetical case:
An employee, aged 35 exactly, has been a member of his company scheme for 10
years. It provides a pension of 1/60th of earnings at retirement at age 65
for each year of service, with, on his death, one-half spouse's pension. His
pensionable earnings at present are Pounds 24,000.
His deferred pension, payable from age 65, is currently 10/60ths of Pounds
24,000 - Pounds 4,000 a year. This will be revalued each year, the scheme
providing the statutory minimum on the non-GMP element.
The transfer value quoted by various consultants, assuming pensions in
payment are increased by the RPI up to 5 per cent a year, were:
 --------------------------
Consultant A Pounds 18,085
Consultant B        17,300
Consultant C        16,350
Consultant D        15,500
Consultant E        12,500
 --------------------------
The main cause of these variations is the discount rate, reflecting
assumptions about mortality and investment return. Even a difference of one
percentage point can have a considerable impact over 30 years.
There is nothing the employee can do about this variation, even if he or she
is aware that some schemes give higher values per unit of pension than
others.
It is not even certain that the scheme's actuary is obliged to reveal his
assumptions.
There is a need for the actuarial profession to tighten up on its guidance
note, to ensure that such variations are narrowed. Otherwise it may find it
difficult to oppose the threatened introduction by a Labour government of a
statutory standard basis of calculation, which would ensure that the same
deferred pension would produce the same transfer value.
Meanwhile, the employee would not succeed in any complaint made to the
pensions Ombudsman, Michael Platt, who has made it clear that he would
accept the actuary's professional assurance that the transfer value had been
calculated in accordance with GN 11.
So there is still room for improvement in transfer values, and employees
should urge their employers and the authorities to make them.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal
Equity Plans (29): Charges may eat up what you save in tax - Managed PEPs /
So these vehicles are most likely to suit those investors who regularly pay
CGT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A MANAGED Pep must sound like a tempting deal to many investors. The full
Pounds 6,000 can be placed in a plan (unlike unit trust and non-new-issue
investment trust Peps), and the tricky task of choosing the shares is left
to the managers.
The snag is that charges are likely to be higher than on other types of Pep.
This reinforces the perennial danger of Peps: that the investor may pay out
more in charges than he or she is ever likely to gain in tax savings.
Measurement of performance is also difficult. A managed Pep is not like a
unit or investment trust, with daily prices. Charging structures mean that
an investor who puts Pounds 3,000, and one who puts Pounds 6,000, into the
same Pep on the same day may get different returns. The manager may also
select different shares for two different investors, depending on their
income needs and tax positions.
One guide is the performance of unit trusts run by the same fund manager.
The Newton Income fund, for example, is the best performing of all unit
trusts over five years. Newton offers a Pep based on the trust alone; one
that mixes the trust with individual shares; and one that only invests
directly in equities.
Managed Peps fall into four rough categories: shares only; unit trusts plus
shares; investment trusts plus shares; and unit and investment trusts plus
shares. In theory, the inclusion of a unit or investment trust should give
the Pep greater diversification (and thus reduce the risk) than is possible
with individual share based Peps.
Those who opt for share-only Peps should also look for the number of shares
which the manager selects. A large number of shares will bring added
diversification, but is likely to mean substantially higher dealing costs.
Given that the investor can only back one managed Pep per financial year,
and that there are almost 500 Peps to choose from, a certain amount of pot
luck is inevitable.
An invaluable aid to the selection process is the Pep guide published by
Chase de Vere. This lists all those Peps which had been introduced by late
1991, with details of their terms and conditions.
The guide illustrates the fact that charges come in all shapes and sizes -
and that many of them are subject to Value Added Tax on top. An initial
charge, similar to that imposed on unit trusts, is usually levied. This can
take the form of a flat fee, say Pounds 25 or Pounds 50, or more normally a
percentage, usually between 1 and 6 per cent.
In addition, there will be an annual charge, usually a percentage: a rough
norm would be around 1 per cent, with 0.5 to 2 per cent the range.
On top of these charges, there can be penalties for partial withdrawal,
transfer charges when investors want to move from one Pep to another, and
even a Pounds 50 charge if the investor wants to attend annual general
meetings. Then the manager will make a charge to cover the costs incurred
every time he deals in shares - this could easily be 1 to 2 per cent a time.
So the investor needs to be pretty sure that the scope for tax savings is
considerable. This is most likely to be true for investors who regularly pay
capital gains tax, and who will thus save 25 or 40 per cent of any gains the
Pep makes.
The calculations are more complex for those who are relying on the income
tax savings alone. With equity yields of 5 per cent, the annual income on a
full Pounds 6,000 Pep would be just Pounds 300; the tax saving for a
top-rate taxpayer would be just Pounds 120, or 2 per cent of the full value
of the Pep.
On most managed Peps, the charges in the first year will be far higher than
2 per cent, and with the annual charge typically 1 per cent a year, the
average investor may take a long time to catch up.
Those seeking the income tax exemption should also make sure that the Pep
has a yield orientation; the lower the yield, the lower the tax saving. And
all Pep investors should ensure that the managers' investment philosophy is
in tune with their own: for example, it would be foolish for the cautious to
go for a high-risk vehicle such as Hill Samuel's aggressive growth Pep.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal
Equity Plans (28): A flexible path to a long-term objective - Packaged PEPs
/ In meeting such commitments as a mortgage or school fees, a Pep has
advantages over an endowment policy, if you pick the right kind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PERSONAL EQUITY plans have many attractions for those who are saving to meet
a long-term commitment, such as a mortgage or school fees.
For a start, there is the prospect of tax-free growth and income. This
becomes increasingly important as time passes - as the gross income on the
plan is reinvested - and as the capital gains edge up above the annual
Pounds 5,500 threshold.
The fact that the funds are invested in equities may make them subject to
short-term fluctuations, but it also means that, in the long term, returns
should easily outpace inflation.
It should be emphasised straight away that single-company Peps, or Peps
containing small numbers of 'risky', stocks should not be used to meet
long-term commitments. The danger of a single company's failing is too
great. The most suitable plans are based on unit and investment trusts with,
if necessary, a top-up of blue-chip shares for those who want to invest more
than Pounds 3,000 a year.
Provided one has the right kind of Pep, a key advantage is flexibility. Peps
are far better in this respect than the most commonly used medium for
repaying a mortgage - an endowment policy.
With an endowment policy, the cash-in values over the first few years are
very low, often less than the amount paid in. This is because a large chunk
of the premiums paid by the policyholder goes straight to the salesman's
pocket in the form of commission.
Even after endowment-policy payments have been made for 10 years or so, the
cash-in values may not be very exciting. It is usually better to sell the
policy at auction, rather than redeem it at the insurance company. The real
value of endowment policies only accrues to those who keep up the payments
for the full term and receive the terminal bonus on maturity.
In contrast, Peps can be stopped at any time and redeemed for their full
value. It is possible, therefore, that, after a long bull market, the value
of a Pep will have risen sufficiently to pay off the mortgage early. The
homeowner can do so without penalty.
However, anyone using a Pep to meet a commitment should be aware of the
risks. For a start, there is no absolute guarantee that the Pep will grow
sufficiently to pay off the mortgage at the end of the 25-year term, or to
pay for the school fees.
The chances that it will not do so are fairly slim, given the long-term
growth rate achieved by equities, provided that a realistic monthly
contribution is made. Indeed, a prolonged period of poor performance from
equities could actually lessen the ability of endowment policies to pay off
the mortgage or school fee commitment. Nevertheless, this risk may well be a
large psychological barrier that prevents many people from using a Pep in
this way.
There is also the chance that a sudden plunge in the stock market at the end
of the mortgage period might sharply reduce the value of the Pep at the
wrong moment. An endowment policyholder, by contrast, would be protected by
the system of annual bonuses which cannot be revoked.
But this problem could be more apparent than real. Assume that an investor
had put Pounds 1,000 into a Pep (had one then been available) in 1965.
According to Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Pounds 1,000 would have grown to Pounds
37,600 (assuming gross income reinvested, as would occur in a Pep) by the
end of 1989. The stock market fell back in 1990, the first calendar-year
drop since 1976. Even so, the Pep would still have been worth Pounds 35,000
at the end of 1990 - the difference does not seem significant enough to
affect a mortgage repayment.
A bigger potential disadvantage of a Pep savings plan is the prospect of a
Labour government. The Labour party is unenthusiastic about Peps, which
might not survive a John Smith budget - at least, not in their present form.
As is the tradition with UK tax changes, previous Pep contributions would
not be affected by abolition. But future plan payments might not be eligible
for tax relief, so that, in effect, a Pep would convert into a unit or
investment trust savings plan.
This would not be a complete disaster, because such plans offer very good
value for small investors. They would also have the same level of
flexibility as a Pep.
But the loss of the tax relief would make a dent in the long-term growth
rate that one could expect from a plan, and consequently it would probably
be necessary to increase the monthly payments in order to meet the long-term
commitment.
Investors who decide to use a Pep to finance a mortgage, or a school-fees
plan, should therefore have sufficient spare income to be able to meet an
increase in payments if Labour is elected.
The potential disadvantages of Peps - the political and market risks - are
certainly real, but one suspects that they have been over-emphasised. Most
of those selling long-term savings plans have a great incentive to plug
endowment and other life-insurance linked products, because they will
receive substantial commissions if they do so. The commissions on a Pep are
relatively low by comparison, and this will probably continue to hinder the
growth of the packaged Pep market.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal
Equity Plans (26): The tax-free route to a stake in your employer -
Single-company PEPs / Shares bought through a SAYE scheme can now be
transferred directly into a Pep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THIS YEAR's newcomer in the Pep market is the single-company Pep.
Investors are already entitled to use Peps for holding shares in only one
company if they wish. Such vehicles have a limit of Pounds 6,000.
But these plans cannot provide diversification, and so make little
investment sense. They were likely to be of most use to executives and
employees who had built up shares in their own companies through option
schemes, allowing workers a tax-free way to hold the proceeds.
Single-company Peps - otherwise, SCPs or Copeps - were introduced in the
last budget to recognise this. Since the beginning of this month, investors
have been allowed to invest an additional Pounds 3,000 in a single-company,
on top of Pounds 6,000 in a mainstream Pep. Transfers of shares bought via
an approved SAYE scheme can be made directly to a Pep, saving the expense
and bother of selling them, and then buying them back into a Pep, as is
currently necessary.
A number of companies - including such blue-chip names as BP, ICI, Glaxo and
BAT Industries - sponsor their own Peps. Other companies are planning to
launch them. Much of the running in this market has been made by Bradford &amp;
Bingley, and CC&amp;P Trustees, which is now a division of Bacon &amp; Woodrow. The
FT-SE 100 companies and their intentions are listed below
These Peps will be particularly attractive to company employees. In some
ways, they can be set apart from the main bulk of portfolio management and
financial planning. However, institutional fund managers are also cashing
in. In practice, you can buy a tax-free Pounds 3,000 stake in virtually any
quoted company, even if you do not work for them.
Many managers are offering a free choice of any quoted company, or in some
cases a choice of any FTSE stock. If the company you wish to invest in does
not have its own Pep, then this is the route to take.
Choosing a Pep manager in these circumstances is simple. Go for the
cheapest.
The only other factor is to check the company's financial strength. The
collapse of Diameter Stockbrokers last year led to lengthy hassle for its
Pep-holders, as ownership was often difficult to establish. The bigger
institutional fund managers might, therefore, make sense.
These Peps still have the significant advantage over other plans that most
do not suffer from the heavy dealing costs involved in active management. It
does not cost much to buy a block of shares and then hold on to it. If you
choose a large, secure company, with every prospect of continued high
dividends, then a Pounds 3,000 Pep should be a sound investment, provided
you hold it for the long term.
Some managers, such as Reyker Securities and John Siddall &amp; Son, will offer
discounts by combining the Pounds 3,000 single-company Pep with a Pounds
6,000 standard Pep.
It is open to question whether the big fund managers offer the best value
for money. For example, NatWest Bank charges an initial fee of Pounds 30,
with a half-yearly management charge of 0.25 per cent plus VAT. There is no
start-up fee for existing NatWest planholders. It offers a range of 60
companies for investment.
This is a good deal. But if you invest in ICI, one of the companies offered
by NatWest, through its own sponsored Pep, managed by Bradford &amp; Bingley, it
should work out cheaper. There is no initial charge, and management charges
are Pounds 5 plus VAT per half year, which works out, unless the price of
the shares drops considerably, as being rather cheaper than NatWest's
management charge. However, there is a fee of Pounds 5 plus VAT when the Pep
is closed.
If you want to invest in ICI in any case - and it is part of many portfolios
 -then ICI's sponsored Pep seems to be a very sensible way to do it.
But in general, although these plans provide some interesting opportunities
for general investors, they are of most use to those who already have a
large portfolio, and want to protect some of it from tax. Unless you are in
that bracket, unit and investment trust Peps, with possibly some blue-chip
equities on top, should take priority over a single-company Pep.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal
Equity Plans (25): Cheap if you have the time - Self-select PEPs / There
should be no management fees. Charges will be weighted on the dealing side -
to the disadvantage of those who deal often
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SELF-SELECT Peps are most likely to appeal to investors who like to play the
stock market themselves. As the name suggests, the investor chooses a
portfolio of shares, in contrast to the more common managed Peps which are
run by fund managers.
'You must know what you are doing,' said Roz Barder, of Chase de Vere
Investments, which publishes *Pepguide.
Those who do not have the time or the inclination to manage their own
portfolio would therefore be well advised to steer clear of self-select
Peps.
The advantage of self-select Peps is that they are often cheaper than those
that are managed; and, since you choose what and when to buy, you are not at
the mercy of fund managers' decisions. Nevertheless, you still have to go to
a plan manager to get a self-select Pep, because only they are authorised to
run plans.
There is a basic difference in the charging structures of self-select and
managed Peps. The latter usually carry an initial charge of anything between
1 and 6 per cent, and an annual management charge of about 1 to 1 1/2 per
cent, with VAT on top. There will often be charges each time that you deal.
By contrast, there should be no management fees to pay on a self-select Pep
 -if there are, look elsewhere. Instead, the charges will be weighted on the
dealing side. This means that those who wish to deal frequently, or in small
amounts of much less than Pounds 1,000, may well find that a self-select Pep
is more expensive than a managed Pep.
Paul Killik, of the stockbroking firm Killik, says, however, that Peps are
not the place to put speculative investments which you might want to buy and
sell quickly. Instead, he sees them as 'the place to tuck away good
long-term investments with reasonable yields.' David Nugent, of Pilling,
also regards Peps as a long-term investment. 'Go for blue-chip stocks with a
10-year view,' he advises.
Killik and Pilling are two of four plan managers recommended by Roz Barber
for their low dealing charges. The others are Reykers and Sharelink.
Killik (tel 071 224-2050) makes no initial charge or annual charges; and the
commission on dealings is 1.65 per cent, or a minimum of Pounds 40. Mr
Killik says it offers concessionary rates on 'bed and breakfast' shares - an
investor's existing shares can only be 'Pepped' if they are sold on the
market and bought again.
However, there is a dividend collection charge of Pounds 7.50. Mr Killik
points out that, if you deal in amounts of Pounds 2,400 or more, which is
the point at which 1.65 per cent becomes cheaper than the Pounds 40 minimum,
it is cheaper to have a self-select Pep. Dealing advice is also given at no
extra cost.
Pilling (061 832-6581) charges no initial or annual fees. Its commission
rate is 1.65 per cent, subject to a Pounds 30 minimum. The dividend
collection charge is Pounds 6.75, and advice is also part of the package.
Reykers (071 499-9097) lets you use your own stockbroker. There is a Pounds
40 initial fee, and a 1 per cent annual management fee which covers
collection and payment of dividends. Rates for a single-company self-select
Pep are a Pounds 20 initial fee and a 1 per cent annual management charge.
Investment advice is not given.
Sharelink (021 200 4545) makes an initial charge of Pounds 25, which is
being waived at the moment, and an annual administration fee of 0.75 per
cent of the value of the portfolio, subject to a minimum of Pounds 20. This
covers the dividend collection. Dealing charges are 1.5 per cent, with a
minimum of Pounds 17.50 and a maximum of Pounds 37.50 per order. No advice
is given.
Self-select Peps may prove more popular with the introduction this month of
the single-company Pep, which allows investors to take out a Pounds 3,000
Pep in addition to the Pounds 6,000 general Pep for any single tax year. If
you know that you want to buy and hold a particular company's shares, for
example, you should seriously consider using the self-select route, because
your investment dilemma is simplified by the need to select only that one
company.
Remember, however, that, for the vast majority of investors, it is the
exemption from income tax that is the most important advantage of a Pep.
This means that you should look for a stock which offers a healthy yield and
looks able to maintain its dividend.
There is one caveat for those wealthy investors who frequently face capital
gains tax bills, however. Losses on shares held in a Pep are arguably worse
than those held outside. Since there is no capital gains tax to pay on
shares held in a Pep, losses cannot be offset against CGT.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal
Equity Plans (24): There may be some nasty shocks ahead - Investment Trusts
/ They will become apparent when the spate of new issues saturates demand.
So private investors should ask four crucial questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERSONAL equity plan has been the driving force behind the
revitalisation of the investment trust market over the past few years.
Investors' freedom to place the full Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance into a
stock-market new issue has given investment trusts an important marketing
advantage over their unit trust rivals. Unit trusts are not quoted
companies, and do not qualify as 'new issues' - they are thus limited to the
normal Pounds 3,000 maximum on Pep investments in collective funds.
A further factor in the success of investment trusts is the chance that
investors have to earn a tax-free, and growing, income. M&amp;G Income, which
raised Pounds 246m on its launch last year, offered a yield of 6.55 per
cent, the equivalent of a gross 10.9 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers.
Normally, a problem with investment trust launches is that investors need
some persuading to buy shares which might quickly drop to a discount to net
assets. The beauty of a Pep, from the manager's point of view, is that the
one-off chance to get a Pounds 6,000 diversified tax-free investment
balances the discount fear. And trust managers have added a further layer of
protection by launching, in the main, split-capital trusts, which rarely
trade at a discount - and, indeed, often achieve a premium.
In an election year, the clinching argument, as far as those selling
investment trust Peps are concerned, has been: 'buy now while stocks last'.
The Labour party seems likely to abolish Peps (although existing plans would
remain in place).
Given that investment trusts have traditionally produced good performance
and that, until recently, they have been unjustly neglected by private
investors, there is much to welcome about this Pep-led boom.
But there are also dangers. The first is that, when the spate of new issues
eventually saturates investor demand, as it inevitably will, the sector's
discount to net assets will suddenly widen. The value of investors' shares
will drop, even if the stock market is stable or moving slightly ahead. That
could be a nasty shock for private investors.
The second danger is that new issues inevitably have higher costs, and these
will affect investment performance. Additional charges can be imposed on Pep
investors, which can outweigh the tax advantages. Fidelity's European Values
Trust, for example, offered only a minimal yield, which meant that, as a
Pep, it would be worthwhile only to those few people who were likely to use
up their capital gains tax allowance.
Another potential problem is that trusts launched on a high-yield basis, to
attract income-seeking Pep investors, might find that yield is achieved only
at the expense of capital growth.
County NatWest's investment trust team, in its 1991 annual, report suggested
four key questions for private investors to consider about investment-trust
new issues.
Be selective: 'Just because there's a new trust issue advertised all over
your favourite Sunday paper, or being thrust under your nose by some
independent financial adviser, this doesn't mean that it's necessarily for
you.'
Know what you're buying: This applies particularly to split-capital trusts,
where investors may not be aware that some 'income' shares have negligible
repayment values, and are thus effectively annuities.
Ask which investor is getting what: County NatWest warned that, with some
issues, institutions were given the sole opportunity to buy the safest
shares, with private investors left with the riskier securities.
Look beyond tax advantages: 'Don't let IFAs seduce you into a 'Pepable' new
issue without putting it through an expenses check, a management check and a
comparability check against existing investment trust Pep products.'
This last point should remind those who do not have Pounds 6,000 to invest
that many long-established trusts have Peps attached. SG Warburg's guide for
private investors lists 68 existing investment trust Peps, from Aberforth
Smaller Companies to Witan.
In the last Budget, the government changed the rules which determined where
trusts could invest in order to qualify for Pep status. In future 50 per
cent of assets will have to be in the European Community, rather than simply
in the UK. The new regulations were not issued until very late in 1991,
however, so there may yet be a rash of European plans early this year.
Even the new regulations were too strict for the largest investment trust,
Foreign &amp; Colonial, which sensibly decided not to restrict its investment
policy to meet such artificial regulations.
The government's arcane rules mean that F&amp;C qualifies as an overseas trust
for Pep status, and thus the maximum investment is just Pounds 1,500. But in
its Pep launch, F&amp;C 'topped up' its plan to Pounds 6,000 by adding blue-chip
shares - BT, BTR, BAT, Lloyds Bank and Shell - to cover the remainder.
F&amp;C also added an unusual flat-fee charging structure - to encourage
investors to put in the maximum Pounds 6,000 - and incentives for other Pep
holders to transfer their plans.
The scheme is an ingenious way to get round the absurdities of the current
Pep rules, but it would be far better for everyone if the next budget simply
allowed investors to put Pounds 6,000 into all trusts, including F&amp;C.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal
Equity Plans (23): Look at performance then at the spread - Unit Trusts /
Most investors should choose a trust with a high yield or the prospect of
dividend growth
</HEADLINE>

UNIT TRUST managers have been very grateful for the existence of personal
equity plans over the past couple of years.
Conventional unit trust sales have been hard to come by, given investor
caution following the 1987 crash and the 1990 Gulf crisis; and those few
small investors who have been persuaded into the equity market have recently
been enticed by the rival charms of investment trusts.
Net sales of unit trusts (gross sales less redemptions) in 1990 were just
Pounds 392m, and even the figure for the first 10 months of 1991 (Pounds
2.61bn) was well down on 1987's record of Pounds 6.33bn.
But sales of unit trust Peps have been growing strongly - from Pounds 310m
in 1989 to Pounds 498m in 1990, and Pounds 520m in the first three-quarters
of 1991. And Pep investments are highly stable, with monthly repurchases
running at only 12 per cent of sales in 1991, compared with a 72 per cent
repurchase rate on overall trust sales.
A big attraction - and selling point - for unit trust Peps is that they
rarely involve any additional charges. So if you are going to buy a unit
trust anyway, there is little reason not to buy one in Pep form and receive
your income and capital gains tax-free.
But the advantages of a Pep only become significant over the long term. Past
figures from the Unit Trust Association suggest that the Pep investor
placing Pounds 1,000 in the average unit trust would have beaten his fellow
non-Pep unitholder by around 50 per cent over 15 years and 100 per cent over
25.
The reason why it takes so long for Pep gains to come through is that, for
most investors, it is the income tax, rather than the capital gains tax,
exemption that is important. With capital gains tax exemption at Pounds
5,500 per individual per year, and with indexation allowed on post-1982
investments, few unitholders are likely to face a capital gains tax bill.
Most investors pay income tax at 25 or 40 per cent. But on a Pounds 3,000
investment, even a trust with a 5 per cent yield would pay an annual income
of only Pounds 150. So the potential tax saving in the first year would be
Pounds 60 for top-rate payers and just Pounds 37.50 for those on the basic
rate. Eventually, and with the help of reinvestment, this tax saving will
grow into a substantial sum.
The fact that Pep repurchases are so low - only Pounds 28.7m in the third
quarter of 1991 - indicates that investors have absorbed this lesson of
long-termism.
But it also means that most private investors must make yield a prime
consideration in choosing a unit trust Pep. A trust with a high yield, or
one with the prospect of substantial dividend growth, is the way to make the
best use of the tax advantages. Only those who frequently pay capital gains
tax should opt for a high-growth, low-yield Pep.
These calculations may change, of course, if a Labour government is elected
this year. An increase in the top rate of income tax to 50 per cent would
heighten the attractions of high-yielding trusts; a decrease in the CGT
threshold (and an increase in top rate CGT) would raise the allure of growth
trusts.
Otherwise, when choosing a unit trust Pep, investors have only two real
criteria they can use. The first is performance - and the important
consideration here is not to be seduced merely by short-term (one year or
less) growth. Remember that it is only in the long term that a Pep
investment will really pay off.
Look for consistency of performance over longer periods - there are tables
ranking unit trusts over five years at the back of this Review. The FT's
sister publication, Money Management magazine, carries performance
statistics every month.
Experts generally agree that first-time investors should stick to trusts
investing in the UK. Those who want to invest overseas should start with the
international funds rather than opt for the more volatile specialist country
funds.
The second criteria is to look at the spread between offer and bid prices
(the prices at which you buy and sell). The greater the spread, the more
your investment will have to grow to get your money back. Spreads tend to
vary between 5 and 9 per cent. If the performance records of two trusts are
equal, it is usually best to opt for the fund with the lower spread.
Larger investors may be put off unit trust Peps by the government's Pounds
3,000 limit on collective-fund plans (and Pounds 1,500 on those trusts
without 50 per cent of their assets in Europe). Investment trusts have been
able to sidestep the rule through the new-issue market, a route not open to
unit trusts.
Instead, unit trust managers have offered top-up schemes, in which Pounds
3,000 goes into the trust and the remainder into individual shares, but this
dilutes the diversification principle, which is one of the main attractions
of collective funds.
Investors need to check carefully that the top-up element is not spread so
widely as to incur substantial dealing costs. And if they are not likely to
pay capital gains tax, they should also ensure that the top-up investments
offer a decent enough yield to take advantage of the income tax exemption.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal
Equity Plans (22): Don't let the tax tail wag the dog - How to pick them /
Investors should ask themselves two crucial questions when looking at the
charges levied on the different forms of Pep on the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS tempting to buy anything that has a 'tax-free' label on it.
All other things being equal, you should indeed save tax. But all other
things are usually not equal. So do not commit the cardinal sin of 'letting
the tax tail wag the investment dog'.
This can easily happen when investing in Peps. They are free of both income
and capital gains tax, so you cannot ask for more tax efficiency. But they
cost a lot to administer.
In the early years of the Pep scheme, when only Pounds 2,400 could be put
into a plan, investors soon became disenchanted. Attempts at active
portfolio management with sums this small were doomed to failure. Minimum
dealing charges of maybe Pounds 30 or Pounds 40, when switching between
holdings of around Pounds 400, made it almost impossible to make a profit,
let alone deliver the full value of the tax incentive.
Understanding of Peps is now more sophisticated.
But you must ask yourself two questions before looking at the charges levied
on the different Peps on the market.
What is your own tax position? You only need to pay capital gains tax if you
sell shares or other securities for gains, after indexation, of more than
Pounds 5,500 in one tax year. Thus you need to be a very keen, or wealthy,
private investor before it will apply to you. If there is no realistic
chance of your paying any CGT in the near future, the exemption from income
tax is the only relief you will receive.
What investments do you already hold? If you do not have much money salted
away in long-term investments, then diversification within your Pep takes a
high priority. But if you have a large equity portfolio, you will probably
have to pay CGT, and Peps must be judged using different criteria.
Taking these considerations in turn, people who do not pay CGT should look
first at the income, or yield, from a Pep. Growth is important, of course,
but they are not buying extra tax concessions by paying for the
administrative charges of a Pep manager. Instead, they are cutting their
potential gain, by paying so much of the initial investment on Pep charges.
David Wells, of accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, illustrates the costs and
benefits of the tax savings as follows. Typical opening charges on a Pounds
6,000 Pep would be 5 per cent, plus VAT, plus a 0.2 per cent commission for
buying the shares. This comes to Pounds 363.80.
A direct purchase of shares might cost around 1.75 per cent in commission,
according to Mr Wells. This would only knock Pounds 105 off the initial
investment.
These figures in themselves should dampen the spirits of people planning to
use Peps to invest for growth.
Next, Mr Wells looked at annual management charges, which are typically 1
per cent, plus VAT. This comes to Pounds 70.50.
'You need a tax saving of at least that amount to justify the extra cost of
having a Pep,' he says. That means that this Pep would need a yield of 3.13
per cent before the savings in income tax for a 40 per cent taxpayer
outbalanced the extra costs.
If you only pay 25 per cent income tax then you need a higher yield before a
Pep becomes worthwhile.
Mr Wells' conclusion is clear: 'The emphasis of our Pep recommendations
should be on income-orientated plans with low initial charges. Higher
charges may, of course, be justified by superior performance, but this will
be proved only with hindsight.'
This rigorous approach is a good antidote for those who leap at the
'tax-free' label. Considerations such as these have led to a breed of
'high-yield' or 'income' Peps. They achieve their yield by combining a group
of high-yielding equities (those which have particularly high dividends in
relation to the share price) with income shares of split-capital investment
trusts.
Roz Barder, editor of Chase De Vere's Pep Guide, says that a 6 per cent
yield for an income Pep is typical, although some more speculative plans may
be able to offer yields approaching 10 per cent. These yields are good, but
Mr Wells' figures show that they are far from spectacular.
If you do not already hold a large variety of investments, then a Pep
investing in unit or investment trusts makes sense. You are only allowed to
put Pounds 3,000 into one of these Peps (except for new issues), which may
be a disadvantage, but you automatically buy into a wide spread of equities.
Past performance tables allow you to make an informed choice of fund
manager.
Most important, the vast majority of unit trust Peps, according to Ms
Barder, make no extra charge for investing via a Pep than they would if you
invested direct. Few charge more than an extra percentage point. If you
wanted to invest up to Pounds 3,000 in a unit trust anyway, then this neatly
delivers you from the agonies of choice - there is no point in not making
the investment via a Pep.
Finally, if you regularly need to pay CGT, and have an existing portfolio of
equities, then Peps are best approached as a tax-free 'pocket' for part of
your portfolio. Before the end of each tax year, transfer up to your maximum
allocation into a 'self-select' Pep.
You only need look at one criterion here - charges. The less the annual and
initial charges, the better the Pep will be.
The joker in the pack of all these careful calculations is the possibility
of a Labour government. As reported on page 4 of this Review, Labour has not
ruled out retaining Peps, but it has also not ruled out abolishing them. It
has pledged to honour tax reliefs on all plans opened before it takes
office.
Higher top rates of tax, which Labour has pledged to introduce, might make
Peps a handy tax shelter. All their advantages, for those in the top income
tax band, would automatically be increased. A cut in the threshold before
CGT is paid would also make Peps more valuable.
These are cogent arguments. But none of them provides any reason to pay more
in charges than you have to.

shelter in which a married couple could by now have amassed joint portfolios
of over Pounds 50,000. A pre-election boom seems likely, as Labour threatens
to end them; so . . .

JUST WHEN new opportunities are opening up in personal equity plans, the
threat of political change looms large with the impending general election.
But the Pep industry is gearing up for a pre-election boom. If Peps go, they
will not go quietly.
The personal equity plan was introduced by Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor
of the exchequer, at the beginning of 1987. Peps formed part of the drive
towards 'popular capitalism', which also involved incentives for small
investors to buy shares in privatised companies.
But it has always proved difficult to match up the political inspiration
behind Peps with the administrative reality of running tax-sheltered savings
plans of a fairly modest size. The Inland Revenue has insisted on imposing a
bureaucratic structure of approved plan managers, to guard against abuse.
But that has brought a heavy cost penalty.
Ordinarily, private individuals who invest in shares face a big tax burden.
They pay income tax at 25 or 40 per cent on dividends, and capital gains tax
 -also at up to 40 per cent - on any gains of over Pounds 5,500 in any
single tax year.
The personal equity plan, however, offers total protection from income tax
and capital gains tax. The income and capital gains can roll up tax-free.
Over a period of years this can have a powerful effect in boosting the
overall returns.
It sounds simple and attractive, but for several years the Treasury dithered
over how big to make the plans, and over the details of their contents. The
politicians wanted millions of people of relatively modest means to use Peps
to hold small parcels of shares in British companies. But the marketing
reality was that Peps would not succeed in pulling in really large sums
until relatively wealthy people could use them to hold significantly large
portfolios, and moreover could invest conveniently in collective funds (that
is, unit trusts and investment trusts) rather than in individual companies.
So, after Pounds 480m had been invested in Peps in 1987, demand collapsed to
Pounds 200m in 1988. Originally only Pounds 2,400 could be invested in an
annual plan, and of that just Pounds 540 could go into collective funds.
Subsequently, however, the scope has been greatly extended. Standard plans
now range up to a maximum of Pounds 6,000, of which Pounds 3,000 can go into
collective funds. In the 1990-91 tax year, 500,000 plans were taken out,
worth Pounds 1.6bn, or an average of Pounds 3,200 each. In all, over Pounds
4bn has been invested so far.
Interest has remained high. Investment trust companies, for instance, have
discovered a loophole in the Pep rules, so that the whole Pounds 6,000 can
be invested when a new trust is floated. This was successfully exploited,
for instance, when M &amp; G launched its Income Investment Trust last autumn.
Half of the Pounds 246m issue was 'pepped'.
From the beginning of this year, too, an extra Pounds 3,000 allowance can be
applied to a single-company Pep. These are restrictive vehicles, which may
be more useful for employee shareholders than for the public at large, but
nevertheless many companies are arranging facilities for the public to hold
their shares in this tax-efficient way.
One final significant change is being brought in. Until now, shares in Peps
have been limited to those of British companies, but in future companies in
other European Community member states will qualify, too.
What it all adds up to is that, from modest beginnings, the personal equity
plan has grown into a substantial and reasonably flexible tax shelter for
investments. A married couple can invest Pounds 18,000 between them this
financial year. If they had used up their maximum entitlements since the
beginning in 1987, they could have amassed joint portfolios of over Pounds
50,000, with another Pounds 18,000 investible from April 6.
The real significance of this could become evident if the Labout party wins
the coming general election. Labour has said it will abolish new plans, but
existing Peps will be permitted to run on indefinitely, benefiting as before
from tax exemptions.
At present, the tax advantages are marginal for most people. Although the
income tax relief is worth, say, 2 per cent in extra dividend yield to a
higher rate taxpayer, Pep charges will cancel out at least half of this.
Standard rate payers probably do not benefit at all, compared with holding
shares directly.
As for capital gains tax, few people at present pay it. With a little care,
and with some calculated bed-and-breakfasting, the Pounds 5,500 exemption
limit (Pounds 11,000 for a couple) will suffice.
But under Labour it could be very different, especially for the wealthy. The
top rate of tax on dividends is set to shoot up to 59 per cent, and there
would probably be a 50 per cent rate of capital gains tax on all profits
above a reduced exemption limit. Suddenly Peps would become very valuable
tax shelters indeed.
There may not be any need to rush. New Peps would not be abolished
immediately on a Labour victory - there would have to be a Budget - and
Labour might not win anyway.
Still, unit trust companies in particular will be hoping to benefit from any
flurry this spring. In the first nine months of 1991, net sales of unit
trust Peps amounted to Pounds 520m, possibly something like half of all unit
trust sales direct to the public.
But some unit trust groups have found Peps very difficult to administer,
especially if they offer Pounds 3,000 direct-share portfolios to top up the
Pounds 3,000 unit trust maximum to Pounds 6,000. One or two have been
heavily fined by Imro, the investment management regulatory body, for
failing to keep the details of the accounts in order.
What was originally intended to be a simple tax incentive has turned into
costly bureaucratic tangle. But if there is a change of government the
personal equity plan may yet achieve its period of fufilment, albeit in
circumstances which its Tory creators would not have chosen.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Balm
for home-buyers but it's hardly generous - What's new? / Citibank has begun
adding two years' free unemployment cover to its mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS

<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY HAS been a noticeable feature of many recent arrivals on the
personal finance market.
Lacking any single obvious successor to last year's Tessas, companies have
had to concentrate on calming the recession-shredded nerves of investors and
borrowers.
This month, Citibank has begun adding two years' free unemployment cover to
all its mortgages taken out by people aged between 21 and 60.
The insurance covers the original level of the mortgage instalment, up to a
maximum of Pounds 1,000 per month, replacing up to 12 months' payments after
a 60-day waiting period from the time the borrower becomes unemployed. The
waiting period can be cut to 30 days if the borrower buys additional
accident and sickness cover, priced at between Pounds 3 and Pounds 3.50 per
Pounds 100 of the monthly payment to be protected.
This offer is not particularly generous, bearing in mind Citibank's Pounds
250 arrangement fee, and interest penalties on early redemption of all
mortgages. A number of lenders will provide cover against accident and
sickness, as well as unemployment, for between Pounds 4.50 and Pounds 5.50
per Pounds 100 of the monthly payment. Housebuilders such as Croudace have
also been offering up to three years' free payment protection.
*****
LURING CAUTIOUS investors away from building society accounts is a constant
goal for investment managers, and Irish Life is the latest to attempt this,
by providing a partial guarantee.
The company is offering a single-premium insurance bond for a minimum of
Pounds 2,000, guaranteeing return of the capital on August 1, 1996, plus any
growth achieved. Investors effectively pay for the guarantee, through an
initial 5 per cent and an annual 1.25 per cent charge. The guarantee does
not apply to bonds cashed in before August 1, 1996.
The guaranteed bond is to be linked to Irish Life's managed fund. Over the
five years to December 6, 1991, Irish Life Global Managed 3 ranked 34th out
of 135 managed funds monitored by Finstat, showing a gain of 35.7 per cent,
compared with the 85.7 per cent put on by Family Assurance Concentrated
Growth.
Over one year to December 6, Irish Life Universal Equity ranked 94th out of
176 UK equity managed funds, gaining 5.2 per cent, compared with Aetna Life
Special Opportunities' top gain of 28.9 per cent.
If recent trends continue, investors would seem to stand a good chance of
better performance from a non-guaranteed bond.
*****
SUN LIFE can hardly make reassuring noises about the Pacific Growth
Portfolio unit trust it is due to launch at the beginning of February.
Concentrating on the main Pacific markets, but excluding Japan, the
portfolio will initially include mainly Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia,
moving on to Taiwan (when accessible to foreign investors), New Zealand and
eventually China.
Nick Wells, of Sun Life, uses the traditional 'not for widows and orphans'
description of the unit trust, which is to have a minimum lump-sum
investment level of Pounds 1,000 and a regular monthly savings plan taking
Pounds 25. Charges are to be 5.75 per cent initially and 1 1/2 per cent
annually.
'People should have a small part of their portfolio in this area on a
longer-term view - five years-plus, but look for a relatively bumpy ride,'
said Mr Wells, noting that fund manager Pamela Chan, based in London, would
be trying to iron out as many of the jolts as possible.
Sun Life is also re-organising money already under management, to make sure
that the new fund starts with at least Pounds 20m. 'With the confidence
level as it is, certainly in the UK, most investors will probably stick
where they are,' said Mr Wells. 'We can't guarantee success in terms of
performance, but we can give the fund the opportunity of getting off to a
reasonable start, with a size of portfolio you can manage and run.'
*****
INVESTORS used to the idea that risks should be spread by diversifying
investments may have misgivings about the concept of single-company personal
equity plans. But investment managers are finding different ways around such
objections.
Brokers Henderson Crosthwaite say they see their single-company Pep being
taken out only by people who already have a general Pep (with Henderson
Crosthwaite). The firm is offering two versions of the plan: self-selected,
with a 1 per cent annual charge, and discretionary with a 1 1/4 per cent
annual charge.
During the launch period, which ends next Friday, January 31, the initial
charge on either type of plan is Pounds 15 plus VAT, with a minimum
investment of Pounds 1,000 and minimum commission on dealings of Pounds 10.
After that date, the minimum investment goes up to Pounds 1,500, the initial
charge to Pounds 30 plus VAT, and dealing commission to 1.5 per cent or a
minimum of Pounds 25.
*****
LLOYDS BANK has three varieties of single-company Pep, with shares to be
selected from a list of 100 blue-chip companies based on, but not limited
to, the FT-SE 100.
Charges on all the plans are an annual fee of Pounds 20 plus VAT. Dealings
done on bulk dealing dates selected by Lloyds are charged at 0.2 per cent,
but investors who deal at other times pay 1.65 per cent, or a minimum of
Pounds 25. The bank also charges an administration fee of Pounds 10 for
switches.
The cheapest of the three uses one plan continuing over several years.
Investors open the plan, either with the full Pounds 3,000 allowed by the
Revenue, or with Pounds 300, to which they may add in instalments of at
least Pounds 100. In each succeeding year, the investor can then put up to
another Pounds 3,000 into the same company's shares, or move the complete
holding into another company.
Alternatively, the investor can open a separate plan each year, either
keeping to the same company each time, or choosing a different company year
by year.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): 'Do
your homework and avoid tips' - Serious riches / The Review meets a father
of three with a multinational lifestyle, who runs his portfolio in the same
way that he runs his business: he enjoys it, but it's a serious job needing
research
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STEVEN ALTNEU's CV lists 'stock market investing' as one of his hobbies.
Look elsewhere on the document, and it is obvious that he has the experience
to invest more effectively than most. He has worked for most of the American
banks you have ever heard of - they include Chase Manhattan, Merrill Lynch
and Dean Witter - and now, still aged only 45, he is a management
consultant.
His connections with the Wall Street stock market date back to his final
years at high school, when he took vacation jobs helping to operate IBM
machines.
With such a wealth of inside knowledge, might he not be expected to operate
like Gordon Gekko, the filmic corporate raider, buying and selling on 'tips'
from men in the know? Not a bit of it.
'I don't act on tips. I used to be quite an active speculator, but I've
learnt from my mistakes. Don't speculate unless you're prepared to make it a
full-time job. Avoid hot tips, friends' tips, taxi-drivers' tips like the
plague.'
He mentions an early investment in Woodside Petroleum. As a banker at Chase
Manhattan he was involved in a big syndicated loan with the company to
finance a gas project in Australia. It was public knowledge that further
developments were coming. 'I felt I really knew this company.'
So he bought. Unfortunately, it soon turned out that the good news was
already in the price. Then Woodside ran into delays. Exchange-rate
fluctuations also worked against him.
Eventually, he sold out at a loss. The lessons are revealing for all those
more amateur investors who would try to take on the market armed with a few
hunches about a company. 'It wasn't a company which I really understood from
the point of view of the investor. I understood it from the point of view of
lending, but I did not understand it as an equity risk rather than a debt
risk.'
Thus he belongs avidly to the 'homework' school of investment. He treats
running his portfolio in the same way that he treats running his business.
He enjoys it, but it is a serious job, requiring serious work. Reading
whatever research he can lay his hands on is vital.
He is also only happy to invest in markets or areas which he understands -
hence a concentration on Wall Street. However, he is also a believer in
globalisation, which explains why he is now learning about the European
markets. The statistics slip easily off the tongue: 'In 1970, US equity
markets accounted for 66 per cent of the total value of world markets. In
1990, the value of world stock markets had grown, but non-US markets
represented 67 per cent of the value. I feel that trend will continue.'
Fortunately, he is increasingly well qualified to carry out a global job. Mr
Altneu was born and raised in New York, and he is still an American citizen.
But his wife, Jane, is English (they met while studying together at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where she was on a Fulbright
scholarship), and the couple have two houses. One is in the leafy London
suburbs, and the other faces the Manhattan skyline from the New Jersey
shore.
Now, their three children - Rachel, aged 12, Daniel, 10, and Emily, 5 - are
all being educated at day-schools in London. Eventually, they have ambitions
to go to university in the US.
Mr Altneu's time at Chase (from 1972 to 1981) gave him a lot of time in
London, which was the hub for the bank's operations outside America. The
elaborate Persian rugs which decorate his home bear witness to the frequent
visits he made to Iran.
At Dean Witter, he was responsible for one of the first big financing deals
made with a Communist bloc country - a risk-conversion floater with the
Foreign Trade Bank of Hungary.
The problem with the Dean Witter job, as far as he was concerned, was that
he worked in mergers and acquisitions. Staff who deal in this area are privy
to so much market-sensitive information that, to
avoid conflicts of interest, stocks and shares have to be held in 'blind
trust'.
Mr Altneu was very pleased with the broker who managed his portfolio for him
at this time, Mahesh Kumar. When Mr Kumar moved to Lehman Brothers, Mr
Altneu happily moved his portfolio with him.
Lehman fits in readily with his own investing philosophy: 'My feeling is
that they are a very good house and they offer some superb products. They
will give you a considerable amount of information, and they go about their
business very objectively and scientifically.'
The multinational lifestyle does not make the more mundane items of personal
finance, such as paying tax and contributing to pensions, any easier. The US
continues to tax him, while UK authorities expect their share. Beyond
careful taking of losses towards the end of years when gains have been
realised - which helps to lessen the capital gains tax burden - there is not
much he can do about it.
Pension provision in the US is still a few years behind the UK, and his
arrangements are unusual. Under American law as it stood in the 1970s,
employees had to stay with a company for 10 years before they became
'vested' and earned the right to a company pension. He stayed at Chase
Manhattan just long enough to qualify. Therefore, when he retires, he will
receive what would in the UK be called a deferred pension.
Reaganite reforms of the 1980s reduced the qualifying period to five years,
and he stayed at Dean Witter long enough to qualify for another pension
fund. This time when he left, he opted to receive a transfer value, and
started an IRA, or Individual Retirement Account. This is broadly similar to
a British self-administered pension scheme.
The pension fund is administered on exactly the same terms as his general
portfolio. As far as Mr Altneu is concerned, all investment is for the long
term, and he sees no reason to be more conservative with his pension fund
than he is with his other investments.
Thus he keeps between 10 and 20 per cent of his portfolio in cash at all
times. Bonds currently make up a heavier weighting than usual, but he still
has 33 per cent in US equities. He will increase his equity holding over the
next few months, in anticipation of a recovery.
He may miss the bottom of the market, but that does not bother him greatly.
'Don't expect to buy at the bottom and sell at the top - leave something on
top for the next guy if necessary.' All he wants is to ensure that he enters
the market at a relatively sensible time, in the long term.
All this should ensure that Steven Altneu, who is now considering making
another career move and becoming a fully fledged investment manager, avoids
some of the mistakes of his ancestors. His grandfather first came to America
in 1904, as an immigrant. He set up an office-cleaning company in Manhattan.
The business went well, and 10 years later, he was offered the chance to buy
his premises, for Dollars 20,000. That was a lot of money at the time, and
he turned it down.
It might have been a good investment - that property, a seven-storey office
block, was at 177, Broadway. Nowadays, the world headquarters of Merrill
Lynch stands nearby.
Steven currently seems to be taking the long view a little more successfully
than his forebears.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): A
number to ring instead of Beattie's - The industry is inviting investors to
switch their privatisation holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNIT trust industry has turned aggressive. It launched a hard-hitting
marketing campaign in December, which sought to persuade investors to switch
their BT and other privatised shares into unit trust holdings.
A risque slogan - 'Why settle for a quickie with BT when you could have a
fulfilling relationship?' - tried to emphasise that unit trusts were best
for small investors in the long term.
And Philip Warland, the UTA's director general, attacked the tactics used by
the government in its privatisation programme. 'Privatisations which entice
people with certain swift gains are a perversion of capitalism. They replace
the desire to save with the lust for greed,' he said.
Mr Warland also argued that the government's perceived bias against
collective funds, such as the Pounds 3,000 personal equity plan limit on
unit trusts and existing investment trusts, was wrong-headed. He added that
only two other countries showed the same bias as the UK against collective
investments - Cuba and China.
Under the UTA's initiative, which will run until March 9, investors ring a
special telephone line* and give their name and address. They will then be
sent a brochure, giving details of schemes offered by three management
groups.
The three will be randomly chosen from nine companies: Brown Shipley, Crown,
Fidelity, Framlington, Invesco MIM, Prolific, Prudential Holborn, Scottish
Equitable and Societe Generale Touche Remnant.
Dealing charges will vary between the groups. Most will charge nothing at
all, and some are offering discounts on the bid-offer spread. The UTA also
says that groups will be flexible about their minimum investment levels
(normally Pounds 500 or Pounds 1,000), because those who buy into
privatisation offers have often received paltry allocations.
A limited number of trusts - mainly UK income and growth funds - are
available from most of the groups. Prudential is the exception, allowing
investors to switch into one of 16 different trusts.
The other groups' trusts are: Brown Shipley Growth, Crown Growth, Crown High
Income, Fidelity UK Growth, Framlington Managed Portfolio, Invesco MIM
Taxbreak Plus (a Pep), Prolific High Income, Scottish Equitable Worldwide
Tactical, Scottish Equitable High Income, and SGTR General Growth.
The UTA is not saying that these are the best trusts, or even the best
management companies - M&amp;G, for example, is not participating in the scheme.
Is it worth switching? Most privatisation stocks have performed extremely
well, and in the case of utilities such as water and electricity, have
recession-resisting characteristics.
A good unit trust, however, ought to provide a better diversified portfolio
than a collection of privatised stocks. A bad trust, of course, might not:
so investors should look for good performance, over the long term (five
years plus) as well as the short term when picking a trust.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16):
Simplicity with a low risk level - Unit Trusts / A new cash fund offers a
chequebook and high interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW cheque account, launched by Fidelity, represents a significant step
in the drive to widen the appeal of unit trusts in Britain.
The idea itself was simple. Fidelity has given a chequebook to those who
invest more than Pounds 5,000 in its existing cash unit trust.
But in the long run, the account could herald a challenge to the hold of
building societies on the private savings market.
For a start, Fidelity's account offers taxpayers a significantly higher rate
than is available on most building society instant-access accounts. At
launch, in November, the account was paying about 10.7 per cent gross, 1.5
to 2 percentage points higher than was available from most building
societies.
Fidelity can pay such a rate, because the fund is invested in money-market
instruments - short-term deposits of large banks - and because it has lower
costs than the building societies with their substantial branch networks.
Second, the account was designed to be very simple, with investors given
both a chequebook and a paying-in book. There is no bid-offer spread - just
one price for the units. The annual management charge of 0.5 per cent is
deducted before the gross yield is paid out.
In short, the account is designed to be as little like a conventional unit
trust as possible.
This also applies to risk. What prevents most people from investing in unit
trusts is the fear of losing their capital. There is very little chance of
this happening with this particular Fidelity unit trust. The worst that
could happen is that the trust might buy securities in a bank that fails,
such as BCCI (although obviously it spreads its investments over a
significant number of banks). But Fidelity chooses only those banks that
have high credit ratings, so the risk is very small.
Indeed, in one respect the risk is lower than that for building societies.
The trust is covered by the Investors' Compensation Scheme, under which the
first Pounds 30,000 of an investment can be refunded, followed by 90 per
cent of the next Pounds 20,000. Building society compensation is limited to
90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000.
So are there any drawbacks? The first is that the trust cannot accumulate
money gross - basic-rate tax is deducted at source and cannot be reclaimed.
This means that building societies will still be more attractive to
non-taxpayers.
The second is that the minimum withdrawal is Pounds 250, and investors will
not be able to use their chequebooks if the account falls below Pounds
5,000. If the latter occurs, and they want to realise part of their
holdings, the process may take a week or two.
The third drawback is that the trust does not offer standing orders or
direct debits - it is definitely a savings, not a current, account.
This may limit its appeal - but there are plenty of people with savings of
over Pounds 5,000 who might find it a good deal. And Fidelity hopes that,
once drawn into the world of unit trusts, they might eventually be tempted
into the equity-based funds.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): UK
income funds may face crisis - A research group predicts that some trusts
may be forced to cut their distributions in the months ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACKING A UK equity income trust has proved to be very profitable for
investors over the past decade - it was the second best unit-trust sector
over the 10 years to January 1, 1992, with an average rise of 405.2 per
cent.
But could this be about to change? Fund Research, the group which
specialises in analysing collective funds, warned last month that 'some
income funds will be forced either to cut their distributions in the months
ahead or 'trade' their portfolios heavily to capture income.'
The latter tactic would involve buying shares just before they pay their
dividends. Since shares fall in value when they become ex-dividend, this
could easily lead to a poor capital growth performance.
The problem for equity income funds is the recession. After borrowing too
much in the boom years, many UK companies face cash-flow difficulties.
Cutting the dividend is an obvious option to save cash, despite the pleas of
institutional investors such as M&amp;G for companies to maintain pay-outs.
The share price of a company that has announced a dividend cut will usually
fall very quickly - which means that shareholders will lose both capital and
income. And if fund managers opt for shares with very high yields, they can
face very high risks.
Shares trade on a high yield when the market feels there is a strong danger
that the company may fail to pay its dividend altogether - or even go bust.
Managers who buy high-income shares hope that the market is wrong about at
least some of these companies - and that the gains they accrue will outweigh
the occasional losses.
That was certainly true for much of the 1980s, but it may well be that in
the 1990s, the balance has moved in the opposite direction. Individual funds
will suffer accordingly. The Standard Life UK Equity High Income unit trust,
for example, has dropped by 20.5 per cent over the last six months.
According to Peter Jeffreys, managing director of Fund Research, the
better-managed funds can avoid these pitfalls. 'Quality is the watchword for
1992, with diligent research arguably more important than at any time in the
past.'
A good guide for consistency is whether a fund is above average (ie, appears
in the top half of its sector) over many different periods of time. The
following funds have produced above-average performances in the UK Equity
Income sector over one, three, five and 10 years; CU Equity Income, Equity &amp;
Law Higher Income, Invesco UK Income, James Capel Income, Lazard UK Income,
Lloyds Bank Income, New Court UK Equity Income, Pearl Income, Prolific High
Income and Schroder Income.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14):
Enthusiasts may spoil the scenery - Investment Trusts / Still the new issues
come. Can the good times last, or will supply exceed demand?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

IS THE investment trust industry over-doing it? The recent enthusiasm of
private investors for the sector has provoked a flurry of new issues, many
of them linked to personal equity plans. Eventually this supply will
overwhelm demand. The question is: when?
It might have been thought M&amp;G's success in raising Pounds 246m for its
income trust last year would have soaked up the bulk of private-investor
demand. Obviously, even M&amp;G did not think so and it is launching yet another
trust - based on its Recovery fund.
And another major trust is currently being launched - the Fleming Income and
Capital Investment Trust. Fleming is aiming for a minimum of Pounds 50m,
with a possible maximum of Pounds 250m.
Like many other recent trust launches, Fleming Income and Capital has a
split structure, with zero dividend (for steady capital appreciation) and
ordinary income (for yield and a geared capital performance) shares. The
hope is that the split structure will prevent the trust from trading at a
discount - traditionally the great barrier to investment-trust new issues.
The trust will aim for an overall yield of 6.9 per cent, which will result
in a yield on the ordinary income shares of 9.3 per cent - highly attractive
if they can be held in a Pep. And, indeed, the trust is deliberately
launched at a time to exploit a loophole in the Pep rules - a full Pounds
6,000 of shares can be placed in a Pep in each of the 1991-92 and 1992-93
tax years.
The enthusiasm for investment trusts has been supported by their manifest
outperformance of unit trusts over the past few years. However, it is
doubtful whether this is repeatable. A large part of the share-price
outperformance has been attributable to the narrowing of the discount to net
assets on which shares trade. In a neatly virtuous circle, the narrowing of
the discount has, in turn, been prompted by the return of the private
investor.
Although it is arguable that the discount will not widen to its old levels
of over 25 per cent, there is less scope for it to narrow further. Many
trusts still have institutional shareholders which are willing sellers.
In addition, investment trusts are also losing part of their cost edge over
their unitised rivals, now that trusts are paying 3 per cent commissions to
advisers.
Risk is also a factor. Investors who have bought some of the recent
split-capital issues may not understand the nature of the risk/reward
profile of their shares; and the fact that the discount may widen, and that
investment trusts can 'gear up' by borrowing, may also have eluded them.
In short, there is a danger that investment trusts will suffer the 'tourist
syndrome'. They were delightful havens when only few people knew about them;
but now that they have been discovered by the whole world, they may get
spoiled by over-development.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15):
Boldly go but get the right guide - Emerging markets look tempting, and a
trust can cut the risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKING feature of the 1991 investment trust league tables was the strong
performance of funds based in emerging markets.
The best trust of the year was Latin American, and emerging markets funds
from Templeton and Beta Global were in fourth and sixth place respectively.
The argument in favour of investing in emerging markets is simply put.
Economic growth rates in such countries are higher, and this should
translate into higher corporate earnings growth rates. In addition, the
underdevelopment of stock markets in such countries can offer greater
opportunity for picking 'bargain' stocks - since fewer analysts are looking
at the markets.
The risks involved are likely to be substantial, however. Many emerging
markets owe their prosperity to a limited number of commodities or
industries - and thus can be vulnerable to a sudden downturn in demand in
that sector. In addition, the number of companies available for investment
is limited, as is the liquidity in those companies' shares.
Investment trust managers have two counter-arguments. The first is that
their closed-end structure gives them protection from a sudden downturn. If
share prices fall suddenly, an open-ended fund, such as a unit trust, would
face redemptions from investors trying to cut their losses. To meet these
redemptions, the managers would have to sell shares; in illiquid emerging
markets, that would mean accepting rock-bottom prices.
An investment trust can simply sit tight through a downturn; if shareholders
want to realise their investments, they must find another buyer. The result
is that unit trusts shrink in bear markets; investment trust shares simply
sink to a discount. This should make it easier for investment trust managers
to outperform over the long term; although shareholders who buy when trusts
are at a premium and then sell when the discount is widest will not see the
benefit.
The second argument is that, while individual emerging markets may be risky,
trusts can reduce the dangers by investing across a range of countries. Mark
Mobius, the manager of Templeton Emerging Markets, says the trust is already
invested in 18 countries and is interested in backing many more over the
long term.
A global recession could affect a large number of emerging countries at the
same time - as was illustrated in the early 1980s by the international debt
crisis. But Mr Mobius reckons that his trust can still pick individual
stocks which will prosper.
That said, the success of many of these funds may depend on the asset
allocation skills of the managers - those that picked Latin America last
year did very well; those with a large exposure to, say, Thailand, will not
have prospered so much.
Picking the right manager could therefore be even more important than in
most sectors.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13):
Mauled in the market - The Professionals / UK equities have election nerves,
but the five see value elsewhere in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This feature is not a competition, but an allocation exercise, the purpose
of which is to see how five professional fund managers manage a Pounds
250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice. In
each case, the client is assumed to be either a wealthy individual or a
small self-administered pension fund. All the fund managers emphasise that
they are investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for
short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The
portfolios given here were drawn up as at the end of December, and will be
reviewed again at the end of March.
OUR PROFESSIONALS have, perhaps inevitably, been mauled along with the
majority by the equity market reversals of the past quarter.
Worst hit were Gartmore, where Paul Myners' 5 per cent holding in Japanese
warrants languishes at 60 per cent of its October value. Gartmore face an
approximate loss for the quarter of 7 per cent.
At Mercury, Simon Toynbee concedes that he jumped the gun by raising his UK
equity exposure in October to 60 per cent of the portfolio. With the UK
market falling by almost 9 per cent on the quarter, his portfolio slipped by
nearly 6 per cent. David Poole, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, also had 61 per
cent of his portfolio invested in the UK, and so lost about 6 per cent on
the quarter.
Damage limitation was achieved most effectively by Douglas McDougall, at
Baillie Gifford. He had a smaller exposure to the UK market, and was helped
by a 15 per cent holding in the south-east Asian markets, and excellent
performance by French bonds, also 15 per cent of the portfolio. The fall in
his portfolio was probably no more than 4 1/2 per cent.
Howard Beaufort, at Newton, also earned a late reward for having remained
consistently more bearish than his counterparts. Like Baillie Gifford,
Newton's portfolio had limited exposure to the UK, and saw benefit from a 12
per cent holding in French bonds. He might have limited losses even more
effectively than Baillie Gifford, had it not been for a large US stake and a
drab performance in Europe, in particular Sweden.
In view of Mr Beaufort's past bearishness, it is worth noting a change in
his tone concerning the UK: 'For the first time in 15 months, I have taken
my bullish hat and coat out of the wardrobe and am giving them a brushing
down,' he notes. 'The next few weeks will almost certainly prove to be a
rough ride, but opportunities will therefore present themselves in the first
quarter.'
Looking into 1992, most are now agreed that the UK will remain nervous ahead
of a general election, and vulnerable to a possible reversal in the US. They
see good value elsewhere in Europe, though views divide strongly over
prospects for Germany.
No one foresees fresh blood on the Tokyo markets, but nor do any yet see
good enough values to justify buying interest. They also agree that Hong
Kong and south-east Asia offer the brightest short-term market prospects.
Loyalty to bonds remains strong, particularly the French bonds that have
served them so well so far this year. Yields average 8.8 per cent at
present, which is attractive when inflation there is below 3 per cent.
Douglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford, plans no changes in the balance of
his portfolio. The imminent general election in the UK makes him nervous
about raising exposure to the market, even though it is 'fairly valued'.
Remaining optimistic about prospects for Germany, where he sees the east
beginning to recover, and interest rates likely to be cut before July, he
stands behind his 25 per cent European holding.
Paul Myners, at Gartmore, proposes to sell his remaining Yen cash to buy
equities in Europe, where he sees his 'favourite markets after Asia'. His
European market holding rises to 15 per cent, with emphasis on the
Netherlands and France. The Pacific Rim holdings stay at 12.5 per cent.
In the UK, which will continue to account for half of the portfolio, he
favours growth and smaller stocks. Japanese warrants are to be held,
'despite poor performance', in the hope of capturing leveraged recovery when
the Tokyo market turns upward. The US offers 'dubious value' at present, but
may offer buying opportunities as pundits over-react to bad news.
Simon Toynbee, at Mercury Asset Management, plans to trim cash holdings from
9 per cent to 7 per cent, using the funds to lift holdings in Europe. The
portfolio otherwise remains unchanged. Having paid a price for increasing
his UK holdings 'prematurely' in October, he does not plan to dilute the
holding. In spite of uncertainty until Wall Street rallies, he sees UK
corporate earnings recovering sharply late in 1992. With one third of the
portfolio outside the UK market, he feels hedged against falls which might
occur if the Labour party wins the general election.
Howard Beaufort, at Newton Investment Management, plans to cut his US
holding from 12 per cent to 8 per cent of the portfolio, and to lift UK
holdings by 4 per cent to 44 per cent. The portfolio otherwise remains
unchanged.
Mr Beaufort is gloomy about the US, where renewed weakness 'is a strong
near-term possibility'. The UK will also be fragile, but he feels that it
will be 'far more justifiable for markets to adopt a bullish stance' in the
opening months of 1992.
Elsewhere in Europe, he sees Germany 'likely to remain under a cloud', but
feels more bullish about the French markets. He remains nervous about Japan,
but sees support at present depressed levels.
David Poole, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, plans to trim US holdings still
further, while adding to European bonds and buying some sterling cash. In
the UK, 'significant weakness in oversold stocks has been used to buy'.
Seeing the markets of continental Europe impeded by Germany's high interest
rates, he foresees a recovery as rates fall in spring. He nevertheless warns
that Russian unrest and German wage demands 'remain the caveat to recovery'.
Sentiment is negative on the US, where high equity prices are 'discounting a
considerable recovery which does not appear to be happening'. By contrast,
he believes that Japan now offers 'fundamental value', and predicts
'outperformance in 1992'. Rueing his limited exposure to the rest of Asia,
Mr Poole pinpoints Hong Kong as 'an attractive and undervalued market' in
spite of the shadow cast by 1997.

Gilts gain favour, but be cautious - Bonds / What makes sense for
institutions may not hold good for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the UK's largest investment institutions have been building up their
holdings of bonds in recent months. They have been switching cash out of
equities in favour of fixed-interest investments.
For example, Norwich Union announced recently that it now has 16 per cent of
its main fund invested in bonds, against nothing at the start of 1991. The
rationale is simple:
Equities are most attractive at a time of high growth and inflation. Growth
boosts company profits and increases dividend payments, while capital gain
from rising share prices is a hedge against inflation.
In contrast, bonds pay a fixed rate of interest, not linked to company
profits, which makes them attractive in times of uncertainty about future
the profitability of companies. Moreover, investors' initial capital outlay
is simply returned at the end of the life of the bond with no capital gain.
This makes bonds more attractive when inflation is low.
Many institutional investors, including Norwich Union, are now predicting
that the UK and most other economies are heading for a period of relatively
low economic growth and low inflation. These are precisely the conditions
which favour investment in bonds.
So ought private investors to follow suit and immediately switch into the
bond markets? One argument against doing so is that UK government bonds, the
easiest and safest fixed-interest investment for a private investor to make,
look set for a hard time over the first part of ths year.
During 1991 as a whole, investment in gilts paid a handsome reward. As UK
interest rates came down, bond yields fell to match, with bond prices rising
as a result. The yield on 10-year UK government bonds fell from 11.2 per
cent in January 1991 to 9.83 per cent by the end of the first week in
January.
But the best of the gains came in the early part of the year. From the
middle of September onwards, the gilts market was treading water. Coming
into 1992, there is no reason to expect a fast buck from holdings of gilts.
First, there is a real possibility that UK interest rates may have to go up
again, to support stering within the European exchange rate mechanism. If
interest rates go up, so will bond yields - hence bond prices will fall.
Second, the prospect of a general election is unsettling the market.
During the last quarter of 1991, bond prices tended to swing with the
fortunes of the government in the opinion polls. This pattern is likely to
continue until the election is out of the way - which may not be until the
summer.
While the UK government bond market enters the new year under a cloud, the
outlook for many overseas markets is more encouraging.
The best performing bond market last year was that of Australia. A balanced
portfolio of Australian government bonds offered a total return of over 25
per cent over the year. Several other markets also turned in a better
performance than gilts, and there is a strong probability that many more
will do so in 1992.
However, the risks for a private investor in holding overseas government
bonds are substantial. Foreign exchange movements can easily wipe-out any
gains made from falling interest rates and rising bond prices.
The safest route into foreign bond markets is through one of the growing
number of international bond funds set up with private investors in mind.
The sector has boomed in recent years, with 25 authorised funds now listed
by Micropal, up from just three in 1982.
The big international bond funds can spread investments over a number of
overseas markets. This spreads the risk of any adverse currency movements
wrecking investment returns.
Over last year, the best performer in the sector was the Norwich
International Bond fund. Taking account of dealing costs, Pounds 100
invested at the start of 1991 was worth Pounds 117.70 by the year end,
according to Micropal figures.
In fact, this level of return was easily matched by the top performing
UK-only bond fund, the Whittingdale Gilt Growth fund. Other gilt funds also
matched their international rivals lower down the league table.
But with the gilts market now facing an uncertain period, the international
funds might be expected to outstrip their UK-only rivals.
However, a fund is only as good as its fund manager. And fund managers are
divided over which international markets are the best bets for 1992.
Many now favour the German government bond market, on the grounds that
German interest rates are so high now that there is only one way for them to
go: down. Other investment managers favour smaller European markets such as
Spain and Portugal, where interest rates are also expected to fall over the
next year.

Labour's market see-saw - Shares did famously in 1968 and 1975 but, as
Review readers hardly need to be told, past performance is no guide to the
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
LOVE HAS never really blossomed between the Labour party and the City, but
the two eventually establish some kind of working relationship when Labour
is in power.
It cannot be said that stock markets have prospered greatly under Labour. Of
the three post-war periods of Labour government, only one (1964-70) saw a
real rise in equity prices, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
To be fair, the decline in share price performance during the 1974-79 Labour
administration was almost entirely concentrated in its first year of office.
That bear market was due more to the oil crisis and the mistakes made by the
previous Heath administration.
And Labour governments have also produced the all-time peak for equity
prices in real terms (back in 1968) and the single best year for share
prices in both real and nominal terms (1975).
There is no certainty that this historical pattern will be repeated if
Labour wins this year's general election. It could well be that Britain's
entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and a narrowing of policy
differences between the parties, means that the effect of the choice of
government on the stock market may be much reduced.
On the other hand, the market perception is that a Labour government means
higher inflation and the risk of devaluation. If that perception leads to a
run on sterling, then Labour could be forced to raise interest rates - which
would depress bond and equity prices.
A clue to the short-term effect on prices might be found in the behaviour of
the market before the 1983 and 1987 elections. On both occasions the markets
rose sharply on expectations of a Thatcher victory, but did not do so well
after victory was achieved.
In 1983, equities went sideways for the rest of the year; in 1987, the
market peaked one month after the election, and plunged later in the year.
This is another example of the stock market's 'White Queen syndrome', named
after the Lewis Carroll character who screamed in anticipation of pricking
her finger, and then barely reacted to the actual event.
The corollary might be that markets will fall before the election if Labour
looks like winning, but might then stabilise if investors decide that a
change of government is not the end of the world.
But the effect of a Labour government is unlikely to be the same right
across the economy. There will be winners and losers among the stock market
sectors.
Winners
Engineering companies: Both County NatWest and Barclays de Zoete Wedd argue
that the engineering industry would benefit from Labour's plans to
reintroduce tax allowances for capital expenditure. Some companies in the
aerospace industry, however, would be hit by likely cuts in defence
expenditure.
Pharmaceuticals: BZW says these companies, which are listed in the
quaintly-named health &amp; household sector, should benefit from Labour's plans
for tax breaks on research and development expenditure.
Two defensive factors might also help pharmaceutical shares. Their strong
cash positions will be a plus point if interest rates under Labour are
pushed higher (because of the need to support sterling in the wake of
foreign exchange market nervousness). And investors might also buy
pharmaceutical stocks because of their exposure to overseas economies
Losers
Consumer companies: These may be affected in two ways. The first is by the
minimum wage - wages form a very high proportion of the costs of sectors
such as pubs and hotels. Many store groups might also be affected. The
second hit could be suffered by those companies producing luxury goods.
Demand for such products may face an adverse impact from the increased taxes
on high earners.
Contracting &amp; construction: Traditionally, this sector has been perceived as
a beneficiary of a Labour government. But County Nat West argues that 60 per
cent of it is exposed to private housebuilding, and that loss of activity in
this high margin area would not be compensated for by increases in lower
margin public construction projects. BZW, although believing Labour's effect
on the sector will be neutral, points out that construction companies would
be hit by plans for increased training expenditure and a minimum wage.
Conglomerates: Dick Barfield, of Standard Life, believes tighter controls on
corporate activity could damage sentiment towards acquisitive conglomerates
such as Hanson.
Utilities: Increased government involvement, through tougher legislation or
a tighter regulatory stance, would have an adverse impact on the privatised
utilities, thinks Mr Barfield. The water industry is an eventual candidate
for re-nationalisation.
Financial services: BZW argues that, if a Labour government leads to higher
interest rates, this will have a negative impact on financial groups. The
reversal of some of the Conservative savings reforms, such as the abolition
of Peps, could also hit the fund management industry.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): An
honest man bides his time - Gestetner has taken a tumble. But in a general

YOU ARE an honest man, a man of integrity,' said the Chinese soothsayer at
Wong Tai Sin Temple, in Hong Kong. He had been trying to bend back my
thumbs. As the thumbs remained straight and unbent this was, supposedly, a
sign of utmost honesty.
As a result of trying to live up to the soothsayer's expectations, I have
saved a lot of money.
Shares that are mentioned favourably by newspaper columnists quite often
rise in price, as a result of market makers expecting people to follow those
recommendations (and thus marking up the price) and/or people actually
buying the shares. Sometimes, after an initial flurry of interest, the share
price falls back again as earlier investors take profits.
In the autumn Quarterly Review, I selected shares in two companies
(Gestetner and Taveners) for a capital growth portfolio. At that time, I did
not personally own any shares in Gestetner, and I stated that for 'ethical
reasons' I would not buy any Gestetner shares 'until at least one week after
the publication' of the article. This was intended to demonstrate that I
would not be investing in Gestetner in such a way that I could profit from
having mentioned the shares in an article.
However, within days of that article's being published, Gestetner issued a
profits warning. The shares fell by 19.3 per cent within a week - the second
greatest price fall of any UK company during that week] My self-denying
ordnance had thus saved me from a considerable loss.
By December, Gestetner shares had fallen to a low of 108p, compared with the
portfolio's 'purchase' price of 183p.
Of course, in the 'real world', on the announcement of a dramatic downturn
in profits, the portfolio would have cut its losses and sold the Gestetner
shares and thus limited its loss to around 20p per share, and then perhaps
bought back the shares at a much lower level. The quarterly portfolio,
however, can only buy or sell if a clear indication is given in an article
as to the likely buying or selling price. As I had not anticipated such a
sharp drop in Gestetner share price, I had not mentioned in my article the
possibility of selling the shares. Thus, the portfolio was stuck with them.
Why had I not foreseen Gestetner's downturn in profits? Probably for some of
the same reasons that encouraged Ricoh, the Japanese office automation
equipment maker, to pay 250p per share for a 24.2 per cent stake in the
company last September: the company appeared to be trading quite well and
had good long-term prospects with a worldwide spread of interests.
As mentioned in the autumn issue, the portfolio purchased Gestetner shares
taking a five-year view: either its profits would eventually be enhanced by
its relationship with Ricoh, or Ricoh might make a takeover bid.
In December, Gestetner announced its results for its financial year to
October 31. Pre-tax profits had fallen by 57 per cent. According to a report
in the FT, Gestetner's finance director had said that the profits' shortfall
was caused by second-half sales being well below budget and 'management
mistakes, notably a late reaction to faltering sales, had contributed to the
decline'.
Gestetner's chairman stated that the recession had also affected profits, as
had a rationalisation of activities which had resulted in job losses for 10
per cent of the company's workforce.
I still view Gestetner as a 'long-term hold' - although Ricoh's own pre-tax
profits for the six months to end September, 1991, fell by 58.5 per cent.
On December 24, my personal pension scheme bought some Gestetner shares,
paying 114p a share. I was interested to see from the FT of December 28 that
one of Gestetner's directors had purchased 100,000 shares in the company
that month so, hopefully, this augurs well for the future. And surely Ricoh
will want to see Gestetner's shares improve to much nearer the price it paid
for its original stake in the company.
My other recommendation in the autumn Review was for Taveners. The portfolio
'bought' the shares for 70p each, and they are now around 80p. Judging by
the number of marshmallows my wife and youngest daughter ate during
Christmas, this marshmallow and boiled-sweet manufacturer ought to have
reasonable prospects. The takeover potential remains, with Finnish
confectionery group Karl Fazer owning 29.89 per cent of the company. Again,
the portfolio takes a longer-term view. My personal pension scheme still
retains its small Taveners shareholding.
The portfolio started out with Pounds 10,000 in cash and invested Pounds
5,195 of it, with the remainder being placed in Britannia Building Society
Capital Trust.
I have debated long and hard whether the portfolio ought to make further
equity investments or keep cash on deposit. I still believe that shares in
many companies in the UK and US are far too high and that a market
correction - either sudden or a gradual downwards movement - will happen
within the next 12 months.
The 500 companies in the US Standard and Poor's index now have an average
price-earnings ratio of over 20 - whereas 10 years ago the average was just
over 8.
With a general election in the UK, presidential elections in the US,
uncertainties and major problems in eastern Europe, the Middle East and
elsewhere, who can say with certainty what will happen to share prices? And
during a general share-price fall, the 'good' usually falls with the
over-priced and the 'bad'.
I like a number of companies - such as United Biscuits and the
photograph-booth operator Photo-Me, in the UK, and Dole Food, in the US  -
but not at current share price levels.
I considered the portfolio taking a risky, quick in-and-out gamble in the
hope of rapidly making up the losses made by its Gestetner investment. For
example, at the time of writing, shares in Regina (the 'Royal Jelly' firm)
are 1.75p, yet in the chairman's December 5 statement in the annual report,
he says that the company 'has paid off all its bank borrowings in the UK . .
. and, save for a small loan in Ireland, the group has no borrowings'. The
group has reversed its negative cash position and sales have 'stabilised'.
But an investment on a 'quick in-and-out' basis would not be for the
cautious, and so I am not recommending or including it in the portfolio.
With increased attention being focused on Spain this year, as host to the
Olympics and Expo '92, I had hoped that there would be a choice of major
investment trusts available which specialised in Spanish investment. Sadly,
all I could find was the First Spanish Investment Trust.
While the company is no doubt soundly managed, at the time of writing, its
interim results for 1991-92 had not been announced, and it needs a close
inspection of these results before an investment could be contemplated.
Its July 1991 annual report stated that the net asset value had fallen by
11.2 per cent, while the Madrid Stock Exchange index had decreased by 3.6
per cent in sterling terms over a similar period.
I am also somewhat concerned that the trust's list of holdings, at May 31,
1991, had 20.31 per cent of its holdings in Spanish banking shares and 30
per cent in Spanish construction and property shares.
The portfolio would certainly be interested in investing in the flotation of
Britain's biggest venture capital group, 3i, due later this year - but only
if the price was right.
Thus, the portfolio retains its shares in Gestetner and Taveners, and keeps
money on deposit ready to invest in attractive opportunities as they arise
and for the possible purchase of shares in 3i.

Federal oxygen facilitates the hazardous ascent of three summits

<TEXT>
WALL STREET's final quarter of 1991 was not for the faint-hearted. After
rising steadily if unspectacularly in the opening six weeks, US stock
markets were hit in mid-November by a 120-point plunge in the Dow Jones
index. Yet within six weeks, investors had recovered enough of their
composure to construct a dramatic late rally that powered the major indices
to a succession of all-time highs.
Between the beginning of October and the end of December, the Dow rose from
3,016.77 to 3,168.83, a gain of just over 5 per cent. The broader market
fared even better, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advancing 7.5 per cent,
from 387.86 to 492.72, and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks
rising almost 60 points, or 11 per cent, to 586.34. All three indices
finished the year at previously unachieved summits.
The dominant influences throughout the period were monetary policy and the
state of the economy. The former became ever more accommodating as the
latter slipped further into stagnation.
The quarter opened with a mixed bag of earnings results, the expected
disappointments (the car manufacturers' big losses, and IBM's 85 per cent
decline in profits) mingling with the occasional shocks (Citicorp's massive
write-off and Dollars 885m loss). Thanks to hopes for lower interest rates,
share prices edged higher during the first month, despite the gloomy news
from the corporate front.
The lack of an easing in monetary policy wiped out some of October's
advances, but in early November hopes of cheaper credit were realised when
the Federal Reserve reacted to some horrible unemployment numbers by
lowering the discount rate by half of a percentage point to 4.5 per cent.
The rate-cut boosted market sentiment, and the Dow again flirted with new
highs.
Yet the news on the economy got worse, and by mid-November the official data
showed an economy trapped in a spiral of rising unemployment, declining
sales, waning consumer confidence and stalled industrial production.
Eventually something had to give, and on November 15 the Dow plunged 120
points amid panic selling.
Although a throwaway remark from President Bush about imposing a cap on
credit-card interest rates, and the subsequent drafting by Congress of
legislation aimed at doing just that, was blamed for the sell-off, more
fundamental concerns about the lack of an economic recovery were behind the
losses.
The sharp declines in stocks - especially among small, biotechnology issues
 -were heralded by some as a necessary correction to an overvalued market,
and for the next month the market struggled to hold its ground as the bad
economic statistics piled up.
The mood changed suddenly after the Fed cut the discount rate by a full
percentage point to 3.5 per cent on December 20. The cut - the biggest for a
decade - took interest rates to their lowest levels for almost 30 years.
Inspired by the relative attractiveness of stocks compared with other,
lower-yielding securities, investors dived into the market with gusto.
Between December 21 and New Year's Eve the Dow rose by 230 points. Betting
that the Fed's aggressive easing would spark a recovery within six months,
investors saw stocks as the best home for their money in 1992.
In Canada, share prices mostly kept in step with Wall Street, although
concerns about the weakness of the domestic economy restricted gains. Over
the quarter, the Toronto composite index climbed from 3,387.88 to 3,512.40,
a gain of 3.6 per cent.
In Mexico, expectations of lower domestic interest rates, and of the
possible benefits to be had from the free trade pact with the US and Canada
(which should be signed in 1992), fuelled a 14 per cent gain in the Bolsa
index in local currency terms. The Bolsa ended the year at 1,432.46.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7):
Brokers prescribe pharmaceuticals for Scandinavia's malaise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICTING priorities between US and German monetary policy makers, and
downward revisions of economic and earnings-growth forecasts for 1992, took
their toll on European stock markets in the final quarter of 1991.
According to the FT-A World indices, Europe, excluding the UK, fell 4 per
cent in local currency terms in the quarter, limiting its rise for the year
to 10.6 per cent. Scandinavia was especially weak, as a result of the
banking crisis in Norway and disappointing third-quarter results in Sweden,
in particular Ericsson's swing into a loss. The FT-A Nordic index dropped
9.6 per cent
Norway was the poorest performer in Europe in the October-December period,
falling 18.6 per cent, for a drop of 11.2 per cent for the whole year. The
liquidity shortage, as a result of the problems in the financial sector,
left the market with little support, and share prices continued to adjust to
weak economic signals from abroad. Low prices for Norwegian export metals
weighed heavily on Elkem and Norsk Hydro, the latter accounting for around
18 per cent of the index. Brokers are taking a selective approach to Norway,
since the overall outlook is still uncertain. Several brokers are
recommending the purchase of the pharmaceutical company Hafslund Nycomed,
whose third-quarter results exceeded market expectations.
Sweden continued to eat into its rise of around 40 per cent clocked up in
the first seven months of the year. In the final quarter it fell 12.9 per
cent, for a rise of just 11.9 per cent for the whole year. The large number
of profit downgrades and a six-point rise in the central bank's lending rate
to 17.5 per cent to stem capital outflows were to blame.
Most brokers have an underweight position in the Swedish market, because
they say it is still expensive despite its fall since the early autumn. 'In
our view the biggest drawback to the Swedish market is the valuations,' says
Merrill Lynch, in its European equity strategy report for 1992. The broker
adds that it would require a 29 per cent fall in the equity index in 1992 to
return the price/earnings ratio to its historic average of 12.1.
However, the lifting of restrictions on foreigners owning shares could
provide some support to the market, once the distinction between free and
restricted shares becomes redundant. Some demand for Swedish equities is
expected from indexed funds, because internationally available shares will
rise from 2 per cent to 6 per cent of European market capitalisation.
As in Norway, brokers are keen on the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra,
and also Procordia, increasingly viewed as a healthcare products company.
Europe's other serious casualty was Austria, which fell 17.1 per cent in
local currency terms in the final quarter, because of the civil unrest in
neighbouring Yugoslavia. A steady stream of rights issues and a slowing
economy are likely to limit a Viennese recovery in the near term.
The Bundesbank's decision to raise interest rates dashed brokers' hopes of a
fourth-quarter rally in France. In the event, France fell by 4.8 per cent in
local currency terms. The French central bank did not impress investors with
a quarter-point cut in interest rates in mid-October. They were even less
impressed when the constraints of the ERM forced the central bank to put
rates back up a month later. But they were resigned to the next rate rise,
just before Christmas.
The effect of high real interest rates and vulnerable economic growth
forecasts on European bourses in 1992 has divided strategists. SG Warburg
believes it is still too early to overweight continental Europe, because
earnings downgrades have not been fully discounted. However, Hoare Govett
and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew recommend an overweight position in Germany.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): The
Sheep went astray, and Monkey business may be subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEAR of the Sheep failed to bring the Tokyo stock market the peace and
calm that are symbolic of the sign. Instead, the Gulf war, stock scandals
and Red Monday hit a market already reeling from the sharp falls experienced
in 1990.
The last quarter of 1991 offered no cheer. In October, the big four brokers
(Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi) did penance for their loss-compensation
to favoured clients, allegations of stock-price manipulation and connections
with gangsters, by suspending business at branches for up to six weeks.
While the Nikkei stock average managed to close the year on a positive note,
thanks to the surprise cut in the official discount rate on the last day of
trading for 1991, it remained 3.8 per cent lower from the end of the third
quarter, and down 4.5 per cent on the year.
Average daily turnover remained below 300m shares during the fourth quarter,
and turnover for the year fell to 91.7bn shares, the lowest since 1982.
Individual investors, disgusted with the special treatment of larger
institutional investors, continued to sell off holdings, moving to
investments with secured returns. This, in turn, squeezed the flow of new
money into investment-trust funds, active traders in the stock market.
The spate of poor interim corporate profits, announced during October,
clearly reflected the slowdown of the Japanese economy, adding to the
pessimism among investors.
The active buying by foreign investors, which had supported share prices in
the third quarter, gradually faded, and selling by domestic investors at
higher levels prevented shares from rising.
Meanwhile, in contrast to the sluggishness in the cash market, trading in
the stock futures market boomed. Arbitrage activity between the futures and
cash stock market grew to record highs, prompting authorities to blame
futures-related trading for the volatility in the cash stock market.
With the Year of the Monkey, the Tokyo stock market has entered its third
year of weakness, the longest post-war correction period.
Forecasts of a recovery remain mixed, and although further cuts of the
discount rate by the Bank of Japan are expected this quarter to help
business confidence, some fund managers point out that lower interest rates
will not necessarily mean higher prices.
In the Pacific Basin, Hong Kong remained firm during the fourth quarter, and
was one of the best performers of the year, rising over 40 per cent. Despite
increasing inflation, the currency's linkage to the US dollar has caused
interest rates to fall, resulting in excess funds flowing into property and
equity investments.
Although the Australian market faltered in the last three months of 1991, on
the year it gained over 25 per cent, due to the deepening recession and a
decline in interest rates. In contrast, Singapore regained its strength
towards the end of the year, as the appreciation of the Singapore dollar
helped soothe imported inflation.
South Korea's opening of its stock markets to foreign investment at the
beginning of this month is also worth noting. Up to Dollars 3bn of new money
is expected to flow into the market from foreign investments. Although
equity holdings by foreigners are limited to 10 per cent in a company, this
will provide underlying support for the market.
The economic environment, with high inflation and an increasing current
account deficit, remains unfavourable to the stock market. But with the
National Assembly and presidential elections anticipated, prospects for
increases in money supply providing economic stimulus ahead of the political
campaigns may be good news for equities.

Dawn's early light? - In the final quarter of 1991 only eight countries
covered by the FT-A World Indices produced a positive return. Yet in the US,
was that . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY SAY it is darkest just before the dawn. And just before Christmas,
international strategists had to decide whether a new light was dawning for
equities, or whether a seasonal surge was merely punctuating a period of
gloom.
The US Federal Reserve had greeted the winter solstice with a full
percentage point cut in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent on Friday,
December 20. By the close on Friday, January 3, the Dow Jones Industrial
average had posted 10 consecutive rises, for a gain since the rate-cut of
9.9 per cent.
Other markets followed. Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan cut the official
discount rate by half a point to 4.5 per cent on December 30, was more
hesitant, but accumulated a 9.3 per cent gain in the Nikkei average in the
six working days to January 5.
The response was more modest in Europe, where the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index
posted a gain of just 3 per cent in the two weeks following the Fed cut, in
spite of a rise of 6.1 per cent over the same period in the heavily weighted
UK market.
Meanwhile, the fourth quarter of 1991 had carried echoes of the third. In
October-December, only nine of the 24 countries covered by the FT-Actuaries
World Indices produced a positive total return in sterling terms; in
July-September 1991, only eight did so.
Overall, global equities registered deficits of 0.7 per cent and 2.2 per
cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of 1991. The year had
fallen into two clear halves, with the whole of 1991 producing a positive
total return of 23.5 per cent.
In the last quarter, it would have been wise to be out of Japanese equities,
Nordic Europe and the UK. For the full year, the best returns came from
Mexico and the US in North America; senior non-Japanese markets, such as
Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore, in the Pacific; and South Africa.
And what of 1992? Pick your expert, and you are likely to be told to be wary
of the burgeoning Wall Street market (priced at the end of 1991 on p/e
ratios of 25.2 for 1991 and 19.4 for 1992, according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
which prefers continental Europe, followed by the UK and Japan). But you
will also hear of top-ranked analysts, such as Elaine Garzarelli, of Lehman
Brothers, who were vociferously bullish of US equities at the turn of the
year.
On Japan, Baring Securities talks of both bull and bear points,
question-marks over economic recovery prospects, and the hurdle for share
prices that a p/e of, say, 37 presents nowadays; but it still postulates a
total return of 18 per cent for equities this year.
Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, was dismissive of the Tokyo market
towards the end of last year, expecting European equity markets to be the
best relative performers in 1992, the US next and Japan the worst. 'New lows
in stock prices in Tokyo in early 1992 would be our forecast,' said Barton
Biggs, its global allocation specialist, in New York on December 18.
This scenario would present a problem for UK fund managers in particular.
They are being asked to recognise that the UK is now part of the European
bloc, that convergence in equity performance with continental markets must
be a consequence of this, and that the spread of geographical risk will
require a new approach.
According to the convergence theory, when they look for global
diversification in the 1990s, UK fund managers should be looking at other
continents. Ironically, it is other European countries which have been the
focus of their overseas attention in recent years.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): In a
good year the worst blows came from abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE UK stock market moved into the final trading quarter of 1991, fund
managers and analysts agreed that the best of the year was over, and that
there would be less to go for in the three months to December 31.
In broad terms, this view proved correct, though reality turned out to be
more painful than envisaged.
Few commentators had anticipated the degree of volatility which left the
market down by 4.9 per cent on the FT-SE index, the widely-used benchmark,
and yet more than 6 per cent above the low point for the quarter.
Few had predicted that the economic recession would prove as deep and
enduring as it has. Hardly anyone foresaw the rash of corporate setbacks
and, in the case of the Maxwell saga, the scandals that would fall on the
City before the end of the year.
The hardest blows for the UK market came from developments elsewhere in the
financial global community. The sudden fall on Wall Street and in Tokyo in
mid-November jolted London, as it did the other European markets. But London
held up relatively well, and confidence was not badly shaken.
More damaging to UK investment confidence has been the upward movement in
European interest rates, led by the Bundesbank just before Christmas when it
reacted vigorously to the challenge from France. The Bundesbank's move
effectively put an end to hopes of another early cut in UK base rates, which
had been sustaining UK equities.
Moreover, the blow to interest rate hopes brought domestic politics to the
front of the UK investment stage. Interest rate worries, spelled out by
rising house repossession rates, suddenly cast a cloud over the re-election
prospects of John Major's government, which must face the polls this year,
perhaps in May.
The Bundesbank's move put sterling on a razor's edge, where it has since
remained. The possibility that either UK interest rates might have to be
raised to protect the pound, or that sterling might be devalued within the
ERM, shook the stock market in December. The question remains on the table,
even though devaluation has been firmly rejected by the government.
If the fourth quarter had ended before Christmas, the Footsie, crushed by
this range of adverse factors, would have been more than 10 per cent off on
the period. But matters then took a surprising turn for the better as London
decided to put its faith in the authorities in the US and Japan, who had
reacted to recessionary pressures by cutting their respective interest rates
decisively.
The final week of the year saw the London market rise by nearly 150 points
on the Footsie, in response to Wall Street's sudden leap to successive peaks
on the Dow Average. But, with half the market on Christmas holiday, there
was little genuine institutional business to support the swing to
confidence.
The UK stock market had a good 1991, with the Footsie rising by just over 16
per cent and total return just exceeding that on government bonds. But as
the new year dawned, analysts sounded very cautious. Prospects for an early
end to the recession remain doubtful, and a question-mark hangs over
sterling. Add to this the possibility of a change of government, implying a
probable change of attitude towards privatisation and public financing, and
it is not hard to see why the analysts are cautious.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): A
threat to life may mean a big pay-out - The Experts' Panel / But 'critical
illness' policies, which are the subject of heavy promotion, are not all
alike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consumer is being bombarded with new financial services products every
day, writes Philip Coggan. All too often, it is easy to be overwhelmed by
detail and confused about the true costs and benefits of the policies on
offer. So the Quarterly Review is launching an Experts' Panel. In each
issue, independent financial advisers will be asked to review a particular
policy field, and to recommend two or three products which seem to be good
value.
CRITICAL ILLNESS, or 'dread disease', policies have been the subject of
heavy sales promotion during the past year, but there are enormous
differences between the various products on the market.
In essence, these policies are a variant of life insurance. Pay-outs are
made when a life-threatening illness is diagnosed, rather than upon death.
Sometimes the policies have been sold on the basis that people would be able
to enjoy a 'spending spree' in their final months.
One of our experts, David Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott, chartered
accountants, declined to recommend any individual policies.
He said: 'There is a danger of these policies being oversold by salesmen
preying upon the fears and ignorance existing in the general public's mind
concerning long-term illness and disease.'
In some cases, he adds, 'other existing and more cost-effective contracts
would prove more beneficial.'
Mr Harris says that critical-illness insurance 'must be considered to be
additional to, and not a substitute for, life assurance, permanent health
and medical insurance.'
'My reservations concerning the current schemes available may be the reason
behind the seemingly low sales figures many life assurance companies have
experienced to date,' he says. 'Perhaps if these companies were to concern
themselves slightly more with producing a range of benefits that truly met
the needs of the marketplace - rather than an all-singing and dancing
product, covering illness and disease that the majority of the public deem
irrelevant to their needs - they would attract more customers.'
Another adviser with reservations about these policies is James Higgins, of
financial adviser Chamberlain de Broe. 'The various policies are constantly
being altered,' he says, 'and I note that Abbey Life, which has had the most
claims experience, has one of the most restrictive policies.
'The newer entrants to the market are somewhat bolder. Skandia Life and
Prolific, for example, provide a 10-year guarantee before any review of
terms. Their premiums are significantly lower, and the range of diseases
covered is far wider,' he adds.
'In addition to the diseases covered by Abbey Life's policy, Skandia also
covers multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, loss of limbs, loss of sight,
terminal illness, and Aids by blood transfusion within the UK.
'At first glance, the Skandia plan appears to be head and shoulders above
Abbey's. However, the bolt-ons are quite superficial in terms of the
underwriting risk, and are really additional selling points - for example,
the chances of catching Aids by blood transfusion in the UK are now
negligible.
'To confuse matters even further, companies have different definitions of
what constitutes a valid claim. In relation to heart disease, Prolific will
pay out for surgery to correct disease of the aorta while Skandia and Abbey
will not.'
'The best place to start is to identify precisely what cover you feel you
need. A husband who is the working partner may require income replacement
and lump-sum benefits in the event of incapacity and subsequent death. Women
tend to be longer lived, and may prefer to invest in longer-term care
policies which provide for nursing.
'It makes sense to review your existing policies, to see just what cover you
already have in terms of income replacement, medical cover and standard
life-assurance. It is by no means certain that a dread-disease policy will
be appropriate. If it is, then the newer, more competitive policies might be
more attractive.
'Finally, you should be aware that the sales commissions on dread disease
policies are particularly high (up to 80-100 per cent of the first year's
premium).'
John Edwards, a former FT journalist and now at Kidsons Impey Financial
Services, in Hereford, says: 'My first choice is the Lifeguard policy
offered by Pegasus Assurance, one of the oldest established companies in the
critical illness market. What I like about Pegasus is that the company is a
specialist in critical-illness policies; it is not just an add-on product to
boost flagging sales of other more popular forms of life assurance.
'As a result of being a specialist, the Lifeguard policy offers one of the
most comprehensive range of options, and can be specially tailored to suit
individual cases. It is very flexible.
'A nice touch is that children of policyholders are covered free of charge
for awards of up to Pounds 10,000 if they contract a critical illness
between the age of 21 days and 18 years.
'However, because of the wide range of benefits - some to cover illnesses
which are fairly unlikely to occur - Pegasus tends to be a bit pricey,
especially for younger people. This is an important factor, since the cost
of critical illnesses is fairly steep because of the greater risks involved
for the insurance company.
'So my alternative choice, and often my favoured recommendation, is
Skandia's Lifetime plan. Skandia is one of the newest companies in the
market, and it therefore provides protection for a wider range of illnesses
and injuries than most.'
'As well as being price-competitive, Skandia claims to be the only company
that will meet a disability claim if you are unable to continue your normal
job or profession.
'Normal should be underlined. With most critical illnesses policies you have
to be virtually crippled, and unable to work at all, before a disability
claim will be met. This is a potential time-bomb, when people who have been
paying out large premiums have their claims refused.
'Under the Lifetime policy, Skandia will pay a disability claim if you are
disabled to the extent that you are unable to perform your normal occupation
'as disclosed in the application form'. You have to be very specific about
what your normal employment involves.
'This is obviously a big selling point for Skandia. There is a greater
chance of them having to meet a disability claim, so the underwriting of the
Skandia policy is a good deal more restrictive. However, Skandia this month
has introduced the option of not accepting the permanent disability cover,
which broadens the range of people who can be covered, although it removes
the main attraction of the policy.
'Pegasus has a much broader definition of the ability to work, although it
claims to take 'status' into account. In the words of its salesman: 'We
don't expect a brain surgeon to become a road sweeper.' Nevertheless,
Pegasus is less likely to pay a disability claim than Skandia.
'The bulk of claims are for specified critical illnesses, like cancer, heart
attack or a stroke, which should be met whether or not you have to give up
work.'
Angela Cooper and Anita White, of financial advisers Noble Lowndes, say:
'When assessing critical-illness contracts, we look closely at the breadth
of cover, rather than concentrating on price, commission and charges.
'From our analysis, three companies have been identified as leaders in the
critical illness market: Abbey Life, Allied Dunbar and Prolific. In general,
these companies offer wider definitions for the critical illnesses. For
example, Allied Dunbar and Prolific cover all five major organ transplants,
whereas some companies will exclude at least two.
'Initially, it may appear that some diseases are excluded. For example,
Prolific and Allied Dunbar pay out specifically on the diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis, but Abbey Life would possibly cover this condition under their
permanent-disability clause.
'Similarly, Prolific will cover paralysis of two or more limbs, which Allied
Dunbar and Abbey Life may cover under their permanent disability clause.
Prolific covers for 'loss of independent existence', which broadly means
that the insured cannot function on a daily basis without assistance. This
is an unusual feature at present, but likely to become more popular.
'When selecting a critical-illness policy, it is preferable that the
contract fully covers, say, seven defined illnesses, rather than numerous
illnesses that have a narrow definition. It is essential that definitions
and terms for payment of any benefit are clearly understood.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A
capital plan like Sheila's - The Plowshares / Alison's mother wants to move
to a sheltered flat, but almost takes fright when Mr Ledger talks about
annuities
</HEADLINE>

John and Alison Plowshare, a couple in their late forties, live in one of
the smarter bits of North London. John is a partner in an architectural
practice and earned Pounds 60,000 last year, although this year has not
proved so profitable. Alison has a part-time job as a receptionist at the
local GP's surgery.
The Plowshares have two children: Lucy, who is 20 and at university in the
Midlands; and Toby, 17, who is still at school.
Through the death of John's parents and his subsequent inheritance, the
Plowshares have a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 in unit trusts, Pounds 6,000
each in a personal equity plan, and just over Pounds 36,000 deposited in the
building society as 'rainy day' money.
IT IS a cold winter's evening, and Alison Plowshare and her mother are
sitting doing the crossword together in front of the fire. However, Alison
is well aware that her mother is not concentrating.
Alison's mother, Mrs Geraldine Martin, is 72, still, thankfully, possessed
of all her faculties and in robust good health. She has been staying with
the Plowshares for a week and has clearly had something on her mind, though
until now no amount of gentle coaxing from Alison could get her to share it.
Fortunately the rigours of a particularly difficult clue finally inspire
Alison's mother to spill the beans. Abruptly, she leans forward and
announces: 'I think that I should move house.'
Alison is dumbfounded. Her mother has lived alone in their family home, a
large Victorian house in the suburbs, since her husband's death. She has
been in that classic position of owning a large house, which has gradually
been deteriorating, and becoming very uncomfortable, while living on very
little income, which is also quite uncomfortable. Until now, no amount of
cajoling or pleading could succeed in persuading her to sell the house, move
into something more suitable and use some of her tied-up capital to give
herself a better income.
Once the shock has passed, Alison is enormously relieved that her mother has
arrived at a decision. 'I think that I would like to sell the house and buy
a sheltered flat,' says Mrs Martin with a defiant air. 'I need something
smaller and easier to maintain and, now that I am a little older, I would
like to be nearer other people.'
Alison suddenly realises the reason behind this change of heart. Mrs
Martin's great friend Sheila has recently moved into a sheltered flat, and
the move has proved to be a great success.
The next day, eager to strike while the iron is hot, Alison takes her mother
back to her house and helps her to start the lengthy process of
re-organising her affairs.
Her mother's house is duly valued at Pounds 150,000 and put on the market.
The sheltered flat, in the same estate as Sheila's, is visited, approved of
and signed up for at a cost of Pounds 80,000.
It's at the accountants that the problems start.
'Mrs Martin, in your circumstances I would recommend that you consider
taking out an annuity,' says Mr Ledger - the Plowshares' own accountant, to
whom Alison has introduced her mother. 'You have very little income beyond
your state pension at the moment, but when your house is sold, you will have
a nice lump sum of capital left over from the purchase of your new flat. The
most sensible thing would be to buy an annuity with some of that capital.'
Neither Alison nor her mother is quite clear what an annuity is. 'One buys
an annuity and it gives you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life,'
says Mr Ledger. 'In your case, Mrs Martin, if you put Pounds 50,000 into an
annuity, you would receive a gross income of roughly Pounds 7,000 a year
until you die, a net income of Pounds 6,300 a year.'
Just as Alison is thinking that this is the best solution to her mother's
problems, her mother asks astutely: 'Would I still have the Pounds 50,000 in
my estate?' Mr Ledger has to admit that this is not the case. 'I'm afraid
that with a straightforward annuity, such as the one I am proposing here,
the income and the capital die with you.'
'That Pounds 50,000 is for my grandchildren,' says Mrs Martin firmly. 'I'm
not spending it on an annuity. I have left it to dear Lucy and Toby in my
will.'
However much Mr Ledger explains the tax advantages - the Inland Revenue
recognises that part of the income from an annuity is drawn from capital,
and so it doesn't tax that part - and however much he explains that Mrs
Martin's robust good health probably means that she will live for many years
to come, secure in the knowledge that her income will continue to arrive,
Mrs Martin is determined not to consider it.
However, the alternative is to put the money into a building society account
and live on the interest. 'This will give you an average gross income of
around Pounds 5,000 a year,' explains Mr Ledger. 'It will put you into the
25 per cent tax band - you will have to pay some income tax - and you will
be vulnerable to changes in the interest rate: your income will fluctuate,
Mrs Martin.'
Alison's mother is still not convinced.
Later that night Alison talks the problem over with her husband John. 'I
only want what's best for her,' says Alison. 'Lucy and Toby will only want
what's best for her. I just wish that she wanted what's best for her. With
the service charges and bills on her new flat, she will need a regular,
guaranteed income and the higher the better.'
The impasse continues for several weeks as the Plowshares and Mrs Martin
wait for a buyer.
One evening, when Alison and John are watching the news on television,
Alison's mother rings: 'I've sold the house and I'm off,' she says. 'And I'm
going to buy one of those annuity things. I need a nice steady income for
the rest of my life. My family are very long-lived, unlike your father's. I
have every intention of getting good value out of my annuity by living until
I get a telegram from the Queen. Toby and Lucy can have the value of my flat
in my will, and they will just have to be happy with that.'
Alison heaves a sigh of relief: 'I do think that you are right,' she says.
'How clever of you to work it all out.'
'Well, I didn't really,' says her mother. 'My dear friend Sheila has an
annuity, and she explained it all to me.'
