FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): A
real top rate of 59% - If Labour wins . . . / There are limits to what the
Opposition can divulge, but savers should ignore the cries of salesmen

SPARE A thought for the Opposition.
The Labour party is under pressure to provide details of exactly what tax
rates it would impose throughout the next government. The faintest
obfuscation is punished in the press.
Meanwhile, Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is in purdah. He is not allowed to
comment, even vaguely, about changes to come in the budget that is less than
two months away.
Bear this in mind when looking at Labour's proposals. There are limits to
what it can be expected to divulge, and also on what it can commit itself to
at this stage.
The broad principles are clear. According to Margaret Beckett, the shadow
treasury minister: 'We are looking for a greater degree of equity. We want
the tax system to treat everyone fairly, but we think people on the highest
earnings can afford to pay more at the top end.'
This in itself limits the financial plans that people should make in
preparing for a Labour government - while another problem with forward
planning, of course, is that Labour may not win the coming general election.
The broader issues of macro-economics are likely to be more important than
alterations to the tax system. However, there are few moves that savers and
investors can make to protect themselves against the chance of a Labour
government which do not make sense anyway. For this reason, it is best to
ignore some of the more desperate 'buy now while stocks last' pleas, which
may come from salesmen and advisers.
What follows is a summary of Labour's current thinking.
The first budget
Income tax: The top rate would rise from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. This is
a firm pledge. Mrs Beckett suggests that this will go no higher: 'While 50
per cent is fair at the top end, it is enough.' The threshold for this top
band would be around Pounds 40,000. Below this, people would continue to pay
40 per cent.
However, the upper limit for national insurance contributions would be
phased out. In the current regime, contributions are only paid, at the rate
of 9 per cent, on the first Pounds 18,200 of earned income. Abolishing the
threshold would mean that the top rate of tax effectively became 59 per
cent.
Income tax for those in lower tax brackets should eventually come down to
below 25 per cent, though Labour now makes it quite clear that this would be
unlikely in the first budget.
Married couples' tax allowance: This will be frozen. Note that it will be
left to 'wither on the vine' - with inflation gradually reducing the value
of the benefit.
Investment income. This would be surcharged. Labour wants to make unearned
income subject to national insurance contributions at the same rate (9 per
cent) as earned income. The idea is to put earned and unearned income on a
'level playing field'.
Thresholds would be high - an income of Pounds 3,000 from investment would
probably be needed before you paid any tax on it. Thus, this measure would
be unlikely to affect those with less than Pounds 30,000 in savings. People
above the state retirement age would be exempt. Income from pensions paid to
people who retire before this age is also exempt, but any other investment
income they derive would be liable to this charge.
However, this measure has still caused more concern than any other Labour
proposal. It discourages saving. There is also the argument that so-called
'unearned' income usually derives from money saved out of earned income.
Mrs Beckett defends the proposal against these charges, saying that it
equalises the taxation of earned and unearned income. 'It may be the case
that it's income they've earned over a lifetime, but it may be income that
they have not worked for at all. We don't think it's unfair to treat the
same level of income as subject to the same level of charge.'
She cites accountants who say that their clients do better by living off
their investments, rather than going out and earning money. However, the
move still removes an incentive to save for people between middle age and
retirement.
Tessas: Tax-exempt special saver accounts seem likely to stay. Labour
welcomes them as having 'one small part' to play in increasing saving, and
dampening demand, but suspects that they are not encouraging much new
saving.
Pensions: State pensions will be increased by Pounds 5 a week for single
pensioners and Pounds 8 a week for married couples, over and above the rate
of inflation.
Labour would reinvigorate the State Earnings-related Pensions Scheme (Serps)
by relating it to earnings over the 20 best years of the user's career,
rather than the average of the whole of it.
Any new personal pension plans would have to guarantee a return of at least
the amount to be gained via the new Serps.
Business Expansion Scheme: The BES for private 'assured tenancies' would be
ended, possibly in the first budget. Labour is highly critical of the scheme
as it works at present. But a scheme similar to the original Business
Start-up Scheme might well be established, with big incentives to invest in
small firms and manufacturing.
The long-term plans
Tax avoidance: Loopholes will be plugged, probably by a system modelled on
the US, where those on high income have to pay a minimum proportion of that
income in tax, regardless of any other allowances and reliefs.
Labour would set a maximum level of allowances for people above a certain
income. This could substantially choke off the appeal of 'tax shelter'
investments, such as enterprise-zone property.
Capital gains tax: The threshold will probably come down from the present
Pounds 5,500, but stay above the level of income tax allowances. Mrs Beckett
categorically denies that the Pounds 1,000 figure bandied about in the press
has any basis in fact - the threshold will stay much higher than this.
One scheme in favour with researchers would cut the level of tax according
to how long an investment had been held before sale. Stags involved in
short-term speculation would pay heavy amounts of tax, while patient holders
of shares for 10 years or more would pay virtually nothing. Clearly, this
scheme could be complicated, but if it could be made to work it would be a
powerful and direct incentive for long-termism.
Inheritance tax: A 'more effective and progressive form of taxation' than
IHT would be introduced, to tax wealth. Tax would be payable on gifts as
well as legacies, so the new tax would resemble capital transfer tax. IHT
would also, probably, be based on the recipient, encouraging wider dispersal
of wealth. This makes comparisons of thresholds and rates awkward.
On a recipient basis, the threshold would probably be a lot lower than the
current Pounds 140,000. However, it would allow people to avoid tax being
paid on their estate altogether, if they spread their money among enough
people in their wills. Another possible measure is to tax transfers between
individuals on a lifetime basis, rather than annually.
Labour dissents strongly from the suggestion, signalled by the
Conservatives, that the next budget should actually make IHT more lenient by
increasing the threshold.
Personal equity plans: Labour will honour existing tax commitments on all
existing plans. Beyond that, the party is examining Peps, and is now less
negative about them than it was. Complete abolition is still an option, but
Labour is interested in using the Pep concept to encourage investment in
manufacturing industries.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): The
early shoot catches the frost - Keynote / Amid election jitters, the
prospect of lower inflation and interest rates points to gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THOSE GREEN shoots of economic recovery never appeared in the autumn, as
chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont claimed. Will they appear in the
spring? And if they do, will they be frostbitten by some chilly pre-election
winds?
Certainly, the final quarter of 1991 turned out to be disappointing for
British investors. As measured by the All-Share Index, the equity market
fell by 6 per cent during the October-December period, and sentiment became
thoroughly depressed before a freak Christmas and New Year rally to some
extent restored the balance. The market jumped by more than 5 per cent in
the last week of the year.
It was influenced in this by the strength of Wall Street. US equities
remained comfortably ahead, with the Dow Jones Average up about 5 per cent
during the final quarter, and hitting new highs at the year-end.
The disparity in performance on the opposite sides of the Atlantic was all
to do with interest rates. While the Americans continued to slash the cost
of money in order to stimulate the economy - with the official Discount Rate
falling to 3 1/2 per cent, the lowest in a quarter of a century - the
European markets were steeped in gloom, emanating mostly from the Frankfurt
headquarters of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.
On December 19, after the Maastricht European summit was safely over, the
Bundesbank raised its own discount rate by an unexpectedly large 1/2 per
cent to 8 per cent, the highest for many years. The Bundesbank is determined
to neutralise the acute inflationary pressures which have resulted from the
reunification of the country in 1990 and have pushed inflation above 4 per
cent. But this tough medicine is entirely inappropriate for most other
countries of the European Community, which are already in recession.
This certainly applies to the UK. Bank base rates failed to fall from 10 1/2
per cent throughout the fourth quarter of 1991, despite a fall in UK
inflation to 3.7 per cent at one stage and despite disappointing figures
from the real economy.
The third-quarter GDP statistics indicated that the onshore economy was
continuing to shrink, although buoyant North Sea oil production allowed Mr
Lamont to claim a 'technical' recovery because overall GDP showed a tiny
rise for the quarter. Throughout the final quarter, economic indicators such
as new car registrations, house prices and retail sales showed that the
economy was very flat.
Hopes of a revival in the banking system were dashed as it became clear that
bad debts were piling up at least as fast as they had in 1990. The crash of
the Robert Maxwell empire, leaving debts of about Pounds 2bn in question,
highlighted the risks faced by the financial sector.
In the troubled housing sector, repossessions mounted alarmingly, although a
special package of measures agreed between the building societies and the
government just before Christmas is designed to prevent a disastrous
'meltdown' during 1992. Overstretched borrowers will, in many cases, be
helped to stay in their homes, at least for the time being. But house prices
have stayed weak.
Towards the end of the year, sterling began to come under pressure on the
foreign exchanges, and although the British government refused to follow
German interest rates upwards, as many other EC member governments did, the
clouds were gathering.
A sterling crisis could be a serious blow for prime minister John Major as
he faces the inevitability of a general election during the next few months.
Election jitters seem bound to be an increasing problem for the stock
market.
In any case, equity prices have been held back by disappointment over the
extent of industrial recovery. Early in 1991, there were hopes that a
profits revival would be well under way by the end of the year. But earnings
per share seem likely to have dropped by at least 12 per cent, with hopes of
an upturn postponed well into this year. At least dividends generally
remained solid in 1992, increasing on average by a little over 5 per cent.
But dividend cover is now historically very low.
For investors, the election is the big immediate issue, and they should seek
to reduce their vulnerability to high taxation should Labour win. But they
must also consider the fundamental changes that are continuing to take place
as the British economy slowly adjusts to the commitment of sterling to the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System some 15 months ago.
In recent weeks there have been increasingly strident calls from some
economists and backbench MPs for devaluation as a way of avoiding the full
rigours of the ERM. But devaluation will not happen this side of the
election, and perhaps not afterwards, although it will be a risk for several
years into the future.
Within the ERM, especially while the Bundesbank is so anxious to fight
inflation, economic activity is going to be restrained, and companies are
going to find it much harder to make profits. Real interest rates will stay
high, although there should be scope for nominal rates to ease from the
summer onwards as the problems in Germany abate.
Investors should note that fixed-income investments proved quite lucrative
last year. The total pre-tax return on British government long-dated
securities, or gilt-edged, was about 20 per cent if you add capital gains to
the interest income. This was very similar to the 20 1/2 per cent pre-tax
total return on UK shares.
The prospect is for further falls in underlying inflation and interest rates
over the course of this year, albeit possibly more sharply in the second
half than the first. So there is a case for taking money out of bank and
building society deposit accounts, where returns may decline in due course,
and putting it into gilts to take advantage of further capital gains as
yields ease in this market, too.
If gilts perform strongly, equities are likely to show reasonable returns as
well. But in an environment of low inflation and slow economic growth it
cannot be assumed that equities will continue to outperform during the 1990s
on the scale that they did in the 1980s.
Investors face a period of possibly erratic sentiment in the near term, and
if the election is inconclusive they may need strong nerves for quite a
while. Yet nobody ever made much money in the stock market by waiting until
all the lights had turned green, let alone the shoots.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Appointments: Hopkins quits NIIDB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Hopkins, chief executive of the Industrial Development Board, Northern
Ireland's main jobs promotion agency, is quitting after four years.
The announcement came as a surprise to business circles. A brief statement
issued by the Department of Economic Development confirmed that Hopkins had
been invited to take up a position in the private sector. As a permanent
secretary, Hopkins is one of the highest paid civil servants in the
province; his post carries a salary of over Pounds 60,000.
His resignation comes at a time of changes in direction for the organisation
as a result of the government's emphasis on competitiveness.
Government sources stressed that his departure was unrelated to recent
criticism of the IDB by Noel Stewart, senior partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte. Stewart argued last week that the IDB did not have the calibre of
executives required to achieve the government's new competitive strategy. He
pointed out that it would take time to develop the skills required for such
a sophisticated plan and he criticised the IDB's overseas operations.

Crawley readily admits that Girobank is an institution which has never lived
up to its potential, but says that this was partly because there was never
enough money to promote its products properly. It was bought from the Post
Office 18 months ago, and its new owner is intent on remedying this
deficiency.
Crawley says that Girobank is 20 years ahead of the competition and has 2m
customers, or 10 times as many as Midland's Firstdirect. He is particularly
interested in building on its potential for telephone selling, as well as
its traditional money transmission business.
Crawley, 65, is replacing Scott Durward, the society's chief executive who
resigned last month. Crawley has been chairman of Alliance &amp; Leicester since
August 1990.

FT  24 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market closes well below best levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market managed to stay in positive territory throughout a busy
trading session but was looking decidedly ragged towards the close of
trading ahead of a dreadful set of figures from Lonrho, one of the Footsie
constituents - announced, most unusually, after the close of the market.
Also upsetting the market's equilibrium at the close of business in London
was a deterioration in sentiment on Wall Street, which was looking decidedly
unhappy after a relatively steady opening.
Closing well below its best levels, the FT-SE 100-share index settled a net
3.3 higher at 2,525.3. At its highest yesterday, the index was some 15.2
points ahead at 2,537.2. Its lowest point came in mid-afternoon when it
dropped to show an overall gain of just 0.6 at 2,536.5. Turnover yesterday
reached 573.4m shares, and was substantially boosted by a substantial
placing of stock in Burton, the retailing group, by Cazenove, the
stockbroker. Trading in London yesterday started with marketmakers pushing
prices higher in response to a good rally on Wall Street overnight - after
two negative sessions - and a solid showing by Tokyo.
The market's mood quickly shifted, however, with ICI shares tumbling and
dragging many stocks with it. Some dealers mistakenly picked up hints that
Hanson was about to unload the 2.8 per cent stake in ICI it acquired in the
early part of last year. It later transpired that the weakness in ICI had
been triggered by two leading UK brokers issuing a bearish circulars on the
company.
Fisons, another of the big drug companies, dropped sharply after a broker's
profits downgrade and accompanying sell recommendation.
Activity from mid-session onwards tended to fade away, special situations
apart, and dealers reported a generally disappointing level of business.
'The market hasn't performed as well as some people had expected, and there
has been stock coming in with every bounce,' said one senior trader. He also
mentioned selling connected with the end of the two-week trading account.
In its latest Equity Strategy note Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank,
adopted a cautious line on the market: 'We are not expecting a major run in
the next week or so; there are too many uncertainties for that.'
Kleinwort did say, however, that it would be a net buyer of UK equities at
current levels, concentrating on the strongest cyclicals and US-exposed
companies.
County NatWest, meanwhile, said it saw no reason to change its view that the
Footsie will make little progress short term. Mr Bob Semple, County's equity
strategist, said the March 10 budget, 'will provide the basis for a Tory
manifesto promising jam tomorrow but, before then, investors will have to
struggle through a results season in which maintained or cut dividends will
be a feature.'
The troubled British Aerospace group surged higher as the market responded
to whispers that the UK's GEC or possibly General Electric of the US may be
taking a hard look at the company with a view to buying a significant stake.
Lonrho shares dived after-hours, and were quoted a good 40p below the
official closing level after the poor results. Dealers expect some heavy
action in Lonrho when market opens this morning.

FT  24 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION of a massive stake sale and continuing apprehension over the
direction of Wall Street preoccupied the derivatives markets yesterday,
writes Peter John.
On the Liffe, the March contract in the Footsie futures opened at a healthy
36-point premium to the underlying equity market and up on the previous
day's close in response to a stronger market in New York.
The contract continued firm and reached 2,574 at one stage. However, the
rise was overdone and the equities showed no inclination to follow. Then a
strong rumour swept through the markets that Lord Hanson was about to place
the 2.82 per cent stake he acquired in ICI back in May.
This dual pressure pushed March back to a mere 26-point premium to cash, not
far ahead of its estimated fair value of 22. As afternoon trading began
there was a general assumption that Wall Street would open easier and March
fell to 2,543. However, a late, and decent-sized buy order, helped the March
contract to close at 2,557 with 6,600 contracts traded.
In LTOM, turnover of 26,495 was comfortably above the previous day's, with
BAe, said to be a bid candidate, topping the list of stock option traders.

FT  24 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lonrho slide expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL results from Lonrho were a late shock to the market. The group
announced annual profits well below expectations, a reduced dividend and a
decision to pass the forthcoming interim dividend.
The shares had been firm during the day, bouncing back from the effect of
recent bear raids on the stock and buoyed by the news of a disposal. The
sale, of a 50 per cent stake in German freight forwarder Kuehne &amp; Nagel, is
likely to boost 1992 profits by around Pounds 85m.
There was a feeling that Lonrho might have delayed announcing its results
until after the market closed because it intended to announce a big South
African disposal.
At the official close, the shares stood at 164p, up 9 on the day with a
hefty 6.3m traded. However, it has come down from 230p in late November and,
in after hours trading, the price was marked down sharply, with marketmakers
quoting a spread of 118 bid and 123 offer. One observer said a price as low
as 110p was quoted.
Assuming the shares open at those levels today, the price will leave Lonrho
with one of the cheapest market valuations in the FT-SE 100 and put pressure
on its future in the Index. At 164p, Lonrho is capitalised at just over
Pounds 1bn, while at 120p it is capitalised at Pounds 787.2m.
ICI suffer
An early fall in ICI was misinterpreted as a sign that Hanson had decided to
sell the 2.82 per cent stake it acquired in the company, and the shares
tumbled 15 at one stage.
In fact the fall was prompted by bearish notes from two securities houses.
Smith New Court advised clients to trim holdings of leading chemicals shares
because the whole sector is overvalued. The comments were part of a 20-page
strategy note which is expected to reach clients on Monday. The house also
cut its 1991 forecasts for ICI by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1bn after reducing
its estimate by Pounds 150m only a few weeks ago.
Meanwhile, the chemicals team at Kleinwort Benson said they have reiterated
their view that in spite of the recent move towards cyclical stocks,
expectations of a near-term recovery in ICI's bulk chemicals business are
premature and the shares should be sold above 1250p.
ICI shares closed 2 off at 1250p on turnover of 1.6m.
Reuters firm
Confidence over its new dealing system and enthusiasm in the US helped
Reuters to close as one of the strongest stocks in the FT-SE 100. The shares
rose 14 to 1060p.
There was a strong belief in the market that dummy runs for Reuters much
vaunted automated foreign exchange dealing system Dealing 2000-2 would be
held in a number of banks in New York and London from early next week. Mr
Brian Newman of securities house Henderson Crosthwaite said yesterday:
'Foreign exchange dealers have indicated that actual trading will begin no
more than a week later.'
He added that his forecast of Pounds 335m for the 1991 profits expected to
be announced on February 12 was beginning to look conservative.
Also, Mr Eric Philo of Goldman Sachs, who has had the company on his buy
list for some time, was talking about it to US clients yesterday.
Predatory talk, combined with a bear squeeze, helped push British Aerospace
along in heavy volume of 6.2m. Talk in the market first of all fingered GE
of the US as a possible predator, although this was quickly dismissed as
politically unacceptable. Attention later switched to GEC as the market
continued to focus on BAe's cash-flow problems and perceived lack of
direction. The shares finished 14 higher at 298p.
Ship builder VSEL is set for stormy waters after losing the Type 23 frigate
order to Yarrow. News of the award came to the market late and VSEL was 2
weaker at 431p.
Fading speculation over Vicker's sale of its stake in Rolls Royce left the
parent company 4 lighter at 181p. Rolls eased a penny to 139p.
Small rolling stock producer Waggon added 13 to 373p as a buyer moved into a
thin market.
A leap in the Hong Kong market sent Cable &amp; Wireless surging 16 to 595p in
volume of 2.4m. Around 60 per cent of the telecoms group's income comes from
the British colony.
Further speculation of the imminent deal between British Airways and the
Dutch airline KLM added 7 to BA at 251p.
Park Food Group jumped 54 to 483p on a reduction in half-year losses, a
sharply increased interim dividend and a confident statement from the
chairman.
A repetition of a November profits warning prompted Ranks Hovis McDougall to
fall 14 to 215p.
A strong performance from holiday groups followed Airtours' AGM, in which
the company announced a 95 per cent rise in holiday bookings year-on-year.
The group also announced a share split. The shares added 7 to 903p.
Competitor Owners Abroad saw heavy volume with County NatWest putting
through a line of 1m in a total turnover of 3.4m. The shares gained 4 to
107p.
There was also heavy turnover of 5.1m in hotel group Queens Moat, the shares
nudging forward 3 1/2 to 77 1/2 p. Recent buy notes have added to positive
market sentiment. Paul Slattery at Kleinwort said: 'We are strong buyers of
Queens Moat - we consider it to be the best hotel recovery stock.'
Fisons fell 16 to 336p with 8m traded on concerns that the drugs Opticrom
and Imferon, banned last year by the US Food and Drug Administration, would
not be back on the US market before the half year, later than previously
thought.
As a result Hoare Govett revised its 1992 profit forecast to Pounds 230m
from Pounds 245m, although remaining a buyer of the stock. Strauss Turnbull
cut its 1992 profit forecast to Pounds 220m from Pounds 239m for the same
reason.
A hefty and positive analysis of the pharmaceuticals stocks from Nikko
Securities helped the sector's stars to gain ground. Nikko's Mr Andrew
Porter highlighted the high growth rates and the defensive characteristics
of drug stocks, and the persistent recession.
SmithKline Beecham, which remains one of the house's top eight buys, rose 6
to 891p. Glaxo recovered 12 to 855p.
Commercial Union fell 4 to 468p after Barclays de Zoete Wedd recommended a
switch out of the insurance company and into Sun Alliance Group, which was
unchanged at 292p.
According to BZW, Commercial Union has outperformed the market by about 20
per cent since the beginning of December, while Sun Alliance has
underperformed by 30 per cent since July. This may give Sun Alliance more
room to raise its dividend than Commercial Union.
Severe losses in the insurance industry is not the reason to close 39 small
UK branches, said Sun Alliance yesterday. It is simply a matter of cost
effectiveness, and the company plans to concentrate all non-life business in
50 major branch locations over the next five months.
Banks maintained a weak tone, with Barclays losing 5 to 384p and Lloyds 6 to
393p. This followed recent depressing analysis of the sector and
expectations of large provisions for bad debts when the big four clearing
banks announce their annual results towards the end of February.
Analysis by Shearson Lehman Brothers suggests that although 'Lloyds clearly
remains the quality stock in the big four', National Westminster, down 3 at
284p yesterday, is the prime recommendation, because of an expected
'substantial loss elimination from its US operations'.
In contrast, analysts at County NatWest recently suggested that their parent
company has more than its fair share of problems with its balance sheet, and
recommended Bank of Scotland, down 3 at 107p, as the best buy in the sector.
Water shares rebounded in a technical rally, after recent consistent
weakness. In thin trading, Northumbria Water gained 9 to 365p and Thames
Water added 6 to 346p.
Analyst Dr Angela Whelan at BZW said: 'Because of the recent general climate
of uncertainty the shares have become cheap and are now looking quite
attractive, The outlook however remains volatile.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Broad range of influences
leaves bourses mixed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BROAD range of influences, both domestic and international, left bourses
mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT eased on profit-taking, on strike threats and on an easier German
bond market. Volume fell from DM7.4bn to DM6.2bn as the FAZ index fell 4.29
to 680.83 at midsession, followed by a 10.53 fall to 1,669.57 in the DAX at
the close.
Carmakers reflected worries that a steel strike could hit their production:
BMW fell DM5 to DM511.50, and Daimler-Benz by DM6 to DM744.50. Engineers and
steelmakers were mixed to lower, Deutsche Babcock losing DM7 to DM168 after
starring in the German equities upsurge with a 27 per cent gain this year.
Some secondary stocks showed gains. The software group, SAP, put on DM100 to
DM1,610 on strong 1991 results; and GEA, the environmental engineering
group, closed DM5 higher at DM525 after a previous two-day gain of 6 per
cent.
Mr Brian Wilkinson of Paribas Capital Markets said that GEA had been strong
ahead of a meeting with analysts yesterday, and improved on hopes that the
company, which has had acquisitional growth, could improve this year on an
internal efficiency drive.
Yesterday's outperformer was Horten, the retail group, up DM7 to DM197 for a
two-day gain of 8.8 per cent, as turnover in the shares doubled from DM13m
to DM26m.
MILAN recovered from the technical weakness of the previous few days, but
was held up by another breakdown in the electronic trading system. The Comit
index rose 10.32 to 548.27 in turnover estimated at L140bn after Wednesday's
L105bn. Trading continued to be led by domestic operators.
Insurers remained in the limelight, with Generali up L660 to L31,050 and
gaining another L200 after hours. Alleanza put on L500 to L12,150. La
Fondiaria rose L1,400 to L38,700 as three of its subsidiaries, La
Previdente, Latina and Ausonia were suspended pending news of a
restructuring later in the day. After the close, Fondiaria said that it
planned to fuse Ausonia with La Previdente on the basis of one La Previdente
share for every 22 Ausonia shares.
PARIS ended slightly lower, trading was dominated by technical factors ahead
of today's close of the January account. The CAC 40 index fell 2.63 to
1,838.69 in turnover of FFr2.2bn after FFr2.3bn.
Credit Local de France, a newcomer to the financial sector, rose FFr8 to
FFr225 in unusually high volume of 311,000 shares.
Saint-Gobain rose FFr5.90 to FFr494.10 as investors waited for its 1991
results. After the close, the building company announced a 25.6 per cent
fall in profits. LVMH, the luxury good manufacturer, fell FFr30 to FFr4,290
ahead of announcing a pleasing 11 per cent rise in turnover.
AMSTERDAM moved back throughout the day, finishing lower as activity
dwindled ahead of this weekend's G7 meeting. Inflation worries in Germany
stemming from the steel industry wage demand there also kept investors on
the sidelines. The CBS Tendency Index closed down 0.4 at 120.9.
MADRID had a flat day with the only interest coming in block trades,
following Wednesday's trend. Block trades of 556,050 in Acesa at Pta1,155
and of 331,000 in Endesa at Pta3,025 were confirmed. The general index
closed off 0.29 to 251.07.
OSLO was dragged down by Norsk Hydro after the company said that it would
take a special charge of NKr2.4bn against fourth quarter pre-tax earnings to
cover the planned restructuring measures and writedowns of assets within
Hydro's agriculture and magnesium divisions.
The all-share index fell 9.88, or 2.2 per cent to 443.78, in turnover of
NKr314.3m. Hydro shed NKr12.5 at NKr144.5.
STOCKHOLM closed broadly up, but below the day's highs, in active trade
following advances in New York and in reaction to an unexpected decline in
consumer prices. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 7.93 at 974.35 on
turnover of SKr594m, reversing a two-day slide. Consumer prices fell 0.1 per
cent in December after rising 0.5 per cent the month previously.
HELSINKI closed higher, after sliding for the past four trading days, as
buyers returned. The Hex index rose 6.4 to 854.8 in turnover of FM17.5m, of
which free shares made up FM6.2m. The most traded issue was Kymmene free
shares, which rose 90 penni to FM79.
COPENHAGEN closed slightly lower in fairly active trading with Danisco, the
food and drink group, recovering after its recent heavy fall. Danisco, which
has declined some DKr200 since reporting first-half results in December,
gained DKr13 to DKr825. Banks were steady, while Hafnia stood out in a
little changed insurance sector with a DKr14 rise to DKr419.
ISTANBUL was lifted by last-minute buying. The 75-share index closed at a
provisional 4,873.76, up 75.75 or 1.6 per cent.

FT  24 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei extends recovery
to second day running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices fluctuated on option-related trading, and the Nikkei average
closed marginally higher, up for the second day running for the first time
this year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average, which gained 3.2 per cent on Wednesday, added another
46.60 to 21,5180.72 after a high of 21,794.17 and a low of 21,440.53.
Volume fell to 250m shares from 270m, as most institutional investors
remained inactive. However, traders said that the total number of orders had
risen sharply, reflecting a rise in individual interest.
Gainers led losers by 654 to 331, with 161 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first-section stocks rose 6.97 points to 1,610.78 and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.09 to 1,239.01.
Speculative activity by options players dominated price movements, as
options traders are entitled to exercise contracts every Thursday.
The Nikkei saw volatile movement, as holders of call options, or buying
rights, tried to push it up while market participants with put options, or
selling rights, were seen selling stocks to lower the index.
Rumours that financial authorities had requested life assurance companies to
support the market added some cheer, and some banks and individuals were
seen small-lot buying. However, traders said that buying by foreign
investors, which had previously supported international blue chips, had
disappeared.
Some high-technology issues lost earlier gains. Sony closed down Y10 at
Y4,260 and Fujitsu, Y20 at Y800. Hitachi, which rose in the morning on
forecasts of a recovery in the US semiconductor market, finally finished
unchanged on profit-taking by institutional investors.
However, some issues in the sector gained on bargain-hunting and hopes of a
recovery in the US economy. TDK surged Y150 to Y4,660 and Fanuc added Y60 to
Y4,350.
Investment trust selling depressed Nippon Steel, which fell Y4 to Y352.
Investment trust groups, which face redemptions of unit trusts sold to
investors three years ago, have started to liquidate holdings because of the
lack of a new inflow of funds.
Paper stocks were actively traded on hopes of recovery in the industry's
profits. Jujo Paper rose Y16 to Y635, but Oji Paper, which gained on
Wednesday, fell Y8 to Y873 on profit taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 255.86 to 22,979.34 in volume of 46.1m
shares. The market posted broadly based gains on active buying by
individuals and foreign investors.
Roundup
Hong Kong stood out while other Pacific Rim markets remained mixed.
HONG KONG soared to a record close on a report that counter-revolutionary
charges against the former Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang had been dropped. The
Hang Seng index put on 75.12 to 4,625.84.
Turnover was heavy at HKDollars 3.52bn, up from HKDollars 2.31bn. An
official Chinese denial of the Zhao Ziyang report came after the market had
closed.
SEOUL rose as high interest rates, which had attracted money away from the
market, showed signs of easing. The composite index closed 21.19 higher at
667.47 as turnover climbed to Won631bn from Won462bn. Three-year corporate
bond market yields have fallen to around 17.95 per cent from a 1991 peak of
19.6 per cent.
AUSTRALIA saw mixed trading with offshore institutional and some domestic
selling leading the market back down after earlier gains. The All Ordinaries
index rose 4.0 to 1,635.5 as turnover eased from ADollars 281m to ADollars
259m.
One analyst said that Asian institutions were selling, and returning to
their domestic equity markets. 'They see Asia coming out of the recession
before Australia, and some want to take full advantage,' he said.
SINGAPORE closed mixed after profit-taking emerged to pare early gains in
moderate trading. The Straits Times Industrial index closed at 1,545.72, up
4.42. NEW ZEALAND broke a four-day losing streak, the NZSE-40 index rising
3.58 to 1,476.16.
BANGKOK reported heavy trading in property and finance issues, as turnover
rose from Bt8.49bn to Bt10.89bn and the SET index ended 7.55 higher at
780.26.
Tanayong, a property company, topped the most active list as it rose Bt12,
or 10 per cent, to Bt132 with Bt1bn of shares changing hands.
JAKARTA saw active trading, in volume of nearly 10m shares as the index rose
0.42 to 256.58. Brokers said much of the activity came from local investors
who had shunned the market for the past eighteen months in favour of high
interest bank deposits.
BOMBAY closed with the BSE index at 2,150.41, up 17.59 but down from the
day's high of 2,184.99. Speculative demand was sustained but analysts said
that state-owned investment institutions sold heavily in all major stocks,
smothering the rally.

FT  24 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Retailing trio enliven trading in
Brussels - Optimistic company announcements have attracted the investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian bourse has only recently shaken off the depressing effect of
last November's inconclusive general election. After falling to around 1,060
in December, the Bel20 has since recovered, closing at 1,183.63 yesterday.
But confusion over the shape of the next government has not stopped the
Belgians shopping. Recent weeks have seen increased activity in the Belgian
retailing sector, which accounts for about 5 or 6 per cent of the entire
market. Shares in the three principal distribution companies  - GIB Group,
Delhaize 'Le Lion' and Colruyt - have all shown strong increases over the
last month, in spite of some profit-taking in the last week.
This is not a new or short-lived phenomenon. Colruyt and Delhaize have
improved relative to the rest of the bourse during the last year, while GIB
has managed only a marginal outperformance. 'They are always among the most
active stocks,' points out one Brussels analyst. By the middle of January,
Colruyt, the smallest of the trio, had outperformed the lacklustre Belgian
market by 65 per cent on a yearly basis though it has since slipped back to
just over 50 per cent.
Belgium's quoted retailers are founded on the supermarket business. For
example, although GIB also owns fast-food restaurants, department stores and
do-it-yourself outlets (including a strong US presence), some 65 per cent of
its BFr205bn (Dollars 6.3bn) turnover in 1990 came from supermarkets and
hypermarkets.
Recent enthusiasm for the retailers seems to have been spurred by a number
of optimistic company announcements. Delhaize - largest of the three - said
on January 10 that it was expecting to record a 14 per cent increase in
consolidated net profit for 1991, on the back of a 16.4 per cent rise in
sales to BFr310bn (Dollars 9.5bn). The principal motor for this growth was
the company's Food Lion supermarket chain in the US, which pushed up its
sales by 15.3 per cent by opening more than 100 new stores last year. A
further 125 are expected to open in 1992.
In the same week, GIB announced that it was planning to invest BFr6.4bn
(Dollars 198m) during 1992 - up 21 per cent on last year - concentrating,
among other things, on the installation of electronic payment and scanning
systems in its supermarkets.
Colruyt, meanwhile, has been plugging away at the low-cost, no-frills end of
the Belgian retail market and paying back debt built up during the difficult
years of 1985 and 1986. It, too, has recently unveiled a handsome increase
in 1991 turnover - up 19 per cent to BFr34.3bn (Dollars 1.061bn).
Such virtues have attracted the attention of investors on both sides of the
Atlantic. Delhaize's share price in Brussels has risen partly on the back of
its trading performance, but also because of increased interest in Food
Lion, which is separately quoted in New York. In turning to Europe, say
analysts, US investors are shunning the depressed British retail market and
looking to fill their shopping trolleys with undervalued continental stocks.
Belgian retailing is still a relatively low-margin business, because of high
labour costs. Computerisation of store check-outs and the development of
own-brand products - both of which lag behind, say, British supermarket
groups - should lead to strong improvement in profitability in the coming
years.
In this way, the most sluggish of the Belgian trio, GIB, is also the most
interesting because it is only now pushing through the investments which
other retailers have carried out. '(Buyers of GIB stock) are betting on an
adjustment or improvement in the competition in the business,' says Mr
Thierry Masset, a retail analyst with Generale de Banque in Brussels.
Optimists say that this, in effect, is a one-way bet. Belgian planning law
makes it difficult for new groups to win permission to build large
supermarkets. 'The only way of getting into the market is to acquire another
company,' says one London-based retail analyst. If GIB falls behind with its
investment programme or does not develop quickly enough, he adds, then there
could well be plenty of frustrated buyers waiting to bid for the entire
group.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian palm oil growth
levels off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN PALM oil production grew to 6.14m tonnes last year from 6.1m
tonnes a year earlier, a rise of 0.7 per cent, according to the Palm Oil
Registration and Licensing Authority.
With slow output growth being outpaced by demand the country's stockpile was
reduced to 683,000 tonnes at the end of December, from 719,000 tonnes a year
ago.
The latest figure tends to confirm that Malaysian palm oil production is
levelling off. Nearly a decade of dramatic expansion ended with a leap in
1989 of 1m tonnes, or 20 per cent, to 6.06m tonnes. The official forecast
for this year's output is 6.3m tonnes.
The spot month crude palm oil price on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange
is currently about MDollars 910 (Pounds 190) a tonne, little changed from a
year ago.
Traders are predicting that prices will fall in the spring when the seasonal
monsoon flood recedes and full harvest returns.
To help sustain production and promote exports, the Malaysian government
announced late last month its decision to push forward a Dollars 500m
(MDollars 1.35bn) export credit programme. This is intended to support
immediate deliveries of up to 1.5m tonnes, or nearly a quarter of current
domestic production, which represent the minimum needs of six countries.
China, India, Pakistan and Russia, the four largest importers, are entitled
to draw on Dollars 100m each, and Egypt and Iraq Dollars 50m each. In
bilateral payment agreements, domestic exporters will be paid by the local
central bank, buyers abroad will pay their banks for remittance to Malaysia.
Last July, the former Soviet Union requested from Malaysia Dollars 200m in
official credit in order to revive imports, which were affected by local
financial difficulties and had fallen sharply.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelters seek help for their
tormentors - The problems behind the damaging flood of Russian aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN aluminium smelter manager can hardly be expected to give much
thought to the crisis Russian exports are causing in the west European
industry.
As he struggles to keep production going so that he can earn foreign
currency to buy food for his workforce and their families and urgently
needed spare parts for worn-out equipment, he faces more pressing problems.
Uncertain supplies of alumina, the essential raw material, and electricity,
without which the power-hungry aluminium industry cannot operate;
difficulties in finding transport to bring raw materials in and ship metal
out; and the complexities of new export taxes on his metal are all
conspiring to make his life a nightmare.
The European aluminium industry understands the seriousness of the Russian
manager's situation. But it cannot simply stand inactive as a flood of
Russian aluminium threatens to devastate a large part of European smelting
capacity.
The unexpected surge in exports of aluminium from the former Soviet Union to
1m tonnes last year has already forced the closure of 500,000 tonnes of west
European smelting capacity, or roughly 12 per cent.
If Russian exports do not fall substantially, more capacity will go because
Europe is the western industry's high-cost production area.
Against the present aluminium price, hovering just above 50 cents a lb, the
Anthony Bird Associates consultancy group estimates Italy's average cost at
76 cents, Spain's at 72 cents, Germany's at 65 cents and the UK's at 62
cents. Compared with this Venezuela's average cost is put at 47 cents,
Canada's at 49 cents and Australia's at 50 cents.
Nevertheless, as Mr Hans Seebauer, secretary-general of the European
Aluminium Association, points out: 'we in Europe have environmentally clean
smelters which are closing down but in the former Soviet Union smelters
emitting high levels of pollutants continue to operate'.
His association has made an urgent call for help to the European Commission,
asking for trade talks to start as soon as possible. Otherwise, he says, the
European aluminium industry is faced with 'further dismantling.' However, Mr
Seebauer insists: 'We don't want to solve the problem negatively. We have to
find a way of helping the former Soviet Union. But we also have to find a
way to stop it choking our industry.'
He has some imaginative suggestions to offer. For example, the western
industry could help the Russians to modernise their smelters, a process that
would inevitably mean the closure of some capacity in the short term.
Mr Seebauer suggests there are European aluminium companies that would be
willing to buy metal from Russia from the mid-1990s and could offer firm
commitments. Armed with such contracts, the Russians should be able to raise
finance through normal commercial banking channels.
Mr Karl Wobbe, who heads the aluminium operations of VAW of Germany, has
personal experience of the frustrations of dealing with the Russian
industry. He says it is not possible for the European aluminium companies to
solve the complex difficulties unaided. VAW has for some time had a research
and development partnership with the former Soviet Union's Vami research
institute and has been invited to modernise some smelters. 'We've done some
feasibility studies, but there is no money available (in Russia) for this,'
he says.
Ironically, by driving down aluminium prices to their lowest-ever level in
real terms, Russian exports have seriously undermined the European
industry's financial strength - and thus its ability to help Russia.
Mr Wobbe suggests that the deadlock would be broken if individual European
governments or the European Community offered some kind of financial
guarantee to companies willing to help the Russian industry.
The European Aluminium Association has already contacted the governments of
France, Germany and the UK and officials at the European Commission. All
were sympathetic but uncertain what could be done. The European governments
are also acutely aware that the Dollars 1bn in foreign currency Russia
earned from aluminium exports last year is Dollars 1bn they will not be
asked to provide in some other form of loans or aid.
Mr Wobbe points to another looming cloud of uncertainty. Of the estimated
3.5m tonnes of aluminium production capacity in the former Soviet Union,
about half went into military and associated equipment such as rockets and
aeroplanes. This demand has virtually disappeared. He says: 'Russia has some
excellent equipment for fabricating aluminium but it must be adapted. They
need money and technology and they are asking for help.
'Many western companies have been to talk about possible joint ventures and
to look at the plants and equipment. There is a growing sense of
disappointment among the Russians that none of these visits have come to
anything.'
This lack of western interest is understandable given the lack of the
financial and statistical information a big quoted company would expect to
have before entering a joint venture. Also the Russians, according to Mr
Wobbe, are short of ideas of their own. 'Make a proposal, is what they say.
They don't think about their domestic market. They want to use their cheap
labour to make low-cost fabricated aluminium products for export and for
foreign currency. 'We must help the Russians convert their aluminium
industry at all levels and help them use aluminium domestically for their
own population,' says Mr Wobbe.
In the meantime, VAW is keeping its financial commitments in the former
Soviet Union to a minimum. It is
taking Russian metal, converting it to foil and the foil is made into
products for the domestic market at a plant in Michailovsk in the Ural
mountains.
The Russians would like this co-operative effort to develop into a proper
joint venture but Mr Wobbe says: 'It could all change very quickly. We never
know whether the same management will be in place in two or three months
time. There might still be another political upheaval. The risk of this is
very high - too high to put much money in at the moment. But this is a
market with huge potential'.
Meanwhile, the European Aluminium Association continues to hope that the
Commission soon will put formal pressure on the Russians to reduce aluminium
exports to the 1990 level (about 300,000 tonnes). Among other proposals,
should negotiations fail, is one for a quota system that would allow
duty-free imports up to a certain tonnage, above which duty would be levied.
However, as Mr Seebauer points out: 'This would help the situation in the
short term. But in the longer term a more profound solution is needed'.
An article on the outlook for Russian aluminium production appeared on
Wednesday, January 22.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to import more cotton
after crop setback
</HEADLINE>

THE INDIAN government has decided to allow the Cotton Corporation of India
to import 1m bales (170 kg each) of cotton during the 1991-92 season
(September-August). The move is in response to concern about runaway
inflation in cotton prices following a sharp setback in the crop.
The government had originally planned to limit imports to 500,000 bales.
The mills have made it clear, however, that imports will not make sense
while the 50 per cent duty remains. The textiles ministry supports the
industry's stand but the finance ministry has yet to take a decision on the
subject.
As the government is taking its time to sort out the contentious duty issue,
some of the leading textile mills like Century, Bombay Dyeing, Arvind and
Madura Coats have decided to import about 200,000 bales on their own against
exports of yarn and fabrics.
Meanwhile, the government, which earlier sanctioned the export of 500,000
bales of cotton in anticipation of a good crop has now restricted overseas
sales to 100,000 bales. In the last cotton season, India exported 1.18m
bales of cotton.
The Cotton Advisory Board, which at the beginning of the season forecast a
crop of 13m bales, now thinks that production will be only 11.65m bales.
According to Mr RK Khattar, president of the Eastern India Textile Mills
Association, the setback in production results mainly from insufficient
rains in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and a cyclonic storm in
Andhra Pradesh. According to the advisory board Maharashtra will now be
producing 900,000 bales, against the earlier forecast of 1.5m bales; Gujarat
1.3m bales, against 1.9m; and Madhya Pradesh 1m bales, against 1.6m.
Apart from the production shortfall, the quality of the crop, particularly
in Gujarat leaves much to be desired. As a result, there is a great rush for
the good quality cotton grown in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Cotton is
now fetching 70 per cent more than in corresponding period of the previous
year.
The total supply of Indian cotton in 1991-92 is expected to be 13.59m bales,
including the carryover of 1.94m bales. Imports of 1.2m bales are likely to
be needed to meet total Indian consumption estimated at 12.4m bales.

The zinc market was again in bullish mood, closing well ahead on the LME.
Three-month metal moved through expected resistance at Dollars 1,180 a
tonne, and one chartist said its target was now Dollars 1,200. The morning
rise was fuelled by speculative buying following Wednesday's constructive
close, coupled with trade and option covering. Three-month nickel moved
closer to Dollars 8,000 a tonne as the market absorbed the latest bout of
profit taking. London's dry cargo freight futures market took its lead from
a 15-point fall in the Baltic Freight Index, posting sharp losses in hectic
trade, dealers said. The index fall to 1,516 was bigger than expected and
some traders see the possibility of a renewed downturn although sentiment is
still constructive on stable panamax demand. 'People I talk to say it looks
relatively good, they're doing business and there are stronger panamax
fixtures in the Pacific,' one dealer said. On the bullion market platinum
moved ahead in response to an increasingly tight physical market reflected
in sharply higher lease rates. Platinum leasing rates have risen to around
eight-month highs, with nervous operators reluctant to roll over Russian
platinum swaps in response to Moscow's economic crisis.

THE WINDWARD Islands exported 222,087 tonnes of bananas to Britain last
year, 20 per cent less than exports in 1990. The industry in the four
islands (St Lucia, Dominica, St Vincent and Grenada) was affected by drought
between March and August last year, according to the Windward Islands Banana
Growers Association.
The Association said the islands earned Dollars 120.9m from exports to
Britain last year, 15 per cent less than earnings in 1990. Output declined
in all the islands, with St Lucia, the major producer in the group,
suffering the largest drop as exports fell 32,664 tonnes to 99,005 tonnes.
The islands are members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of
countries which is seeking a continuation of preferential entry to the

FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IPE launches gasoline futures
on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Petroleum Exchange launches its unleaded gasoline futures
contract on Monday in a bid to attract new users to the derivatives product.
'There has been a lot of interest from blenders, end-users and producers,'
said Mr Alastair Harris, marketing and research director at the IPE, 'it
will be a useful tool for companies with fleet management operations.'
Mr Harris says that many of these companies will not be using the Rotterdam
forward market for unleaded gasoline, but will have been using trading
companies to hedge their exposure to petrol prices.
The IPE has introduced a designated broker scheme for the first time at the
exchange to get the new contract off the ground. So far, seven brokers have
signed up to trade the futures product.
The specifications for the IPE's product are slightly different from the one
traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange, but will still allow brokers to
take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
The exchange hopes its product will complement the Nymex contract by
providing a specifically European contract to attract new business.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Bonds: D-Mark sector absorbs heavy flow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark sector is absorbing a heavy flow of paper as investors lock in
historically high coupon levels on the expectation that rates are set to
fall. The market absorbed more than DM2bn of fresh supply last week, and new
issues totalling in excess of DM2.5bn, including a further DM500m yesterday,
have been launched so far this week.
Yesterday, Saskatchewan, the Canadian province, launched a DM300m seven-year
offering via CSFB Effectenwave of enthusiasm for Quebec's DM500m 10-year
deal, which has performed strongly relative to the underlying Bund market.
However, the Saskatchewan deal met rather less demand, trading at a discount
to co-managers' fees.
Two other offerings, each totalling DM100m, were targetted at retail
investors. Teollisuuden Voima, a Finnish nuclear power company, brought a
seven-year offering via Dresdner Bank and Europaische Hypotekenbank also
launched a seven-year deal.
In the dollar sector, the US' General Electric Capital Corporation launched
a Dollars 200m four-year deal, via Kidder Peabody. The deal was considered
aggressively priced, but the name is well liked by Swiss retail investors.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Halifax launches biggest
issue by UK mutual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX Building Society yesterday launched the largest capital-raising
issue by a mutual savings institution in the bond market, although it paid a
higher price than originally envisaged for the funds.
The issue of Pounds 100m permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs), the
deeply subordinated capital instruments approved by the Building Societies
Commission last summer, was priced to yield 275 basis points more than
long-dated UK government bonds.
Halifax first announced its intention to issue Pibs last autumn, arguing
that it should pay 230 to 250 basis points over UK government securities.
The paper launched yesterday, but largely pre-placed with UK institutional
investors by Warburg Securities, carries a semi-annual coupon of 12 per cent
and was priced at 100.28.
The cost of capital for the Halifax is still substantially less than for
smaller building societies. For example, the next largest issue, a Pounds
75m deal by the Leeds Permanent, currently trades at a yield 335 basis
points more than UK government bonds.
The pricing of this and earlier Pibs issues partly reflects concern among
investors over the long-term credit quality of building societies. Falling
property prices and rising mortgage defaults have hit profitability and
forced the takeover of some smaller institutions by their larger
competitors.
Halifax is the largest UK building society and carries a Aa1/AA credit
rating for senior debt from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit
ratings agencies. This is two notches higher than the next best credits in
the sector.
However, Pibs carry no maturity date and are deeply subordinated, ranking
even below depositors' funds held in share accounts in the event of winding
up. Interest payments can be suspended if the issuer runs into trouble,
hence the instrument can absorb losses in the manner of equity.
Yesterday's issue was made in large denominations of Pounds 50,000 and was
aimed primarily at institutional investors. Some other recent issues have
been made in denominations as low as Pounds 1,000 in an effort to attract
more retail investors. However, Warburg commented that buyers included some
stockbrokers on behalf of wealthy private individuals.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street heralds a
profitable year - The changing rankings of securities houses in bumper times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Wall Street securities houses, 1992 has started in the nicest possible
way - with a soaring stock market and a fresh wave of the tremendous
issuance of new corporate debt and equity which helped make 1991 so very
profitable.
In just the first three weeks of this year, issues of investment grade debt
in the US totalled more than Dollars 20bn - some 10 per cent of the entire
1991 total. Common stock issue volume was less dramatic, raising Dollars
1.78bn, 3.2 per cent of last year's tally, but investment bankers say equity
deals in the pipeline indicate that the early months of 1992 will maintain
last year's hot pace.
The year 1991 itself proved a banner one, with total domestic financing
volume reaching a record Dollars 586bn, up 88 per cent from 1990, the
previous all-time high, according to IDD Information Services. And that, in
turn, has translated into bumper profits for Wall Street, which derives much
of its income from underwriting the sale of securities.
Yet behind the overall growth lie some significant changes in the rankings
of the Wall Street houses. For the fourth year running, Merrill Lynch
maintained its position as the leading underwriter of all new issues - just
one year short of the five-year record previously held by Salomon Brothers.
It also headed the investment grade corporate debt league.
Goldman Sachs maintained its number two position for total underwriting and
rose from second to first place in common stock offerings, which are far
more profitable for securities firms than debt issues. Lehman Brothers, an
American Express offshoot which has suffered some big setbacks in recent
years, jumped from seventh to third place in total domestic underwritings,
thanks to an aggressive performance in the debt market. And Salomon
Brothers, which has been the subject of a bond market scandal, dropped from
fourth to seventh for all domestic issues.
The two main factors behind last year's new issue wave were the steady
decline in US interest rates and the concomitant surge in stock market
prices. And both these driving forces were given a powerful new thrust on
December 20 when the Federal Reserve took the highly unusual move of cutting
the discount rate by a full point to 3.5 per cent. The timing of the cut,
just before the Christmas holiday, means that many companies have only begun
reacting in the first few weeks of this year.
A key question now is whether this early surge can be sustained through the
rest of 1992, a year which many expect to produce a gradual US recovery from
recession and an eventual reversal of the downward trend of interest rates.
Mr Grant Kvalheim, head of global capital markets at Merrill Lynch says that
'if interest rates stay at this kind of level its going to be a busy year.'
However, rising rates could put a severe damper on the debt boom, while
sharp downward corrections in the stock markets would have the same effect
on equities, at least in the short-term. Says Mr Bob Scott, managing
director in charge of the capital markets group at investment bank Morgan
Stanley: 'If rates were to move higher for any reason, you could see the
pace of (debt) financings slow quite quickly.'
But whatever happens to the debt market, many on Wall Street expect equity
issues to remain reasonably strong for several years as corporate America
deleverages its balance sheets from the excesses of the 1980s, when
companies' indebtedness rose sharply relative to equity. That process is now
being sharply reversed: in 1991 equity issues totalled Dollars 54.8bn,
compared to just Dollars 19bn in 1990 and Dollars 43.5bn in 1986, the
previous record year.
Factors behind the deleveraging include some companies' difficulties in
servicing debt during the recession; banks' reluctance to extend new
borrowings because of their own bad loan problems; and a fear among blue
chip companies that if they do not improve their capital ratios they may
risk downgrading by the credit rating agencies.
Many companies which went private in the 1980s through highly leveraged
buy-outs have returned to the equity market over the past year through
initial public offerings (IPOs) of shares. The latest example is Burlington
Industries, a textile group taken private five years ago by Morgan Stanley,
which announced this week that it would return to the market with an Dollars
855m IPO. Bankers hint that even bigger deals are in the pipeline.
Many other privately-owned businesses have been attracted to IPOs by the
extremely high prices that the market is currently prepared to pay for
shares. Last year, IPOs totalled Dollars 24bn, up from Dollars 10bn in 1990,
and represented 44 per cent of the entire deluge of common stock. Some 40
per cent of the IPO offerings represented some kind of deleveraging.
Mr Mike Ryan, managing director of the equity transactions group at Merrill
Lynch, reckons that factors like these 'will prolong the trend of equity new
issuance over the better part of the next few years.' He adds that the
current level of the stock market means that 'companies which considered
equity last year are now making it a serious priority at board level'.
This substitution of equity for debt is a normal phenomenon which regularly
takes place at this point in the economic cycle, although the sheer scale of
the move towards debt in the 1980s may give added weight now to the swing
back to equities. After all, 1991 was the first time in eight years that US
companies issued more stock than they retired.
Argues Mr Ryan: 'There was such an extended period in the 1980s, when debt
was king, that the current (equity) cycle is going to be magnified on the
upside, just to get back to a bit of equilibrium.'
The surge in corporate debt issues has been a corollary of declining US
interest rates, as companies have called in higher-priced bonds and issued
new ones with lower rates. The belief that interest rates are near the
bottom of the cycle, with perhaps one more Fed easing before monetary policy
turns harder, has also been encouraging companies to bring forward future
funding needs from the second half of this year.
A big dilemma facing treasurers is whether to concentrate debt in cheap
short-term instruments, such as commercial paper or move up the yield curve
and issue more expensive, but much longer-term, bonds in the belief that
long-term rates may not be this low again for many years.
Says Morgan Stanley's Mr Bob Scott: 'Yields on US Treasury securities are at
their lowest for about 12 years and companies have reason to assume that
interest rates over the next 10 years will be higher than now.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: France set to back down on
capital gains tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH Treasury is understood to be ready to back down over proposals
designed to tighten rules governing the taxation of capital gains earned by
French residents.
The proposals, as originally conceived, could have driven debt issuance by
French borrowers offshore and reduced the liquidity of the French bond
market.
Yesterday, Credit Foncier changed plans to launch a domestic issue with an
international tranche because of fears of the tax changes. Instead, the
financial institution launched a FFr3bn Eurobond and a FFr1.2bn domestic
bond issues.
In fact, the proposals were intended to facilitate taxation of capital gains
earned on 'stripped' bonds - bonds which have been reduced to their
component parts of individual coupons. But the proposals, in their initial
form, would also have affected the issuance of fungible debt held by French
investors.
French borrowers, in an effort to increase the liquidity of their debt,
frequently add new tranches to existing issues, a practice which would have
been penalised under the proposed changes.
The proposal would have scuppered the chances of France's burgeoning public
debt market, set up last month by four leading state-owned entities
including Credit Foncier. The market, designed to combine international and
domestic distribution, imitates the structure of the French Treasury market,
with a group of committed market-makers called Specialistes en Valeurs du
Secteur Public (SVP).
The change would also have gone against the French government's strong
tradition of promoting market reform and encouraging liquidity.
The Treasury is expected to back down following representations by the
French banks.

<TEXT>
EAST JAPAN RAILWAY, one of the seven divisions of Japan Railway Group, the
former Japanese National Railway, which was incorporated in 1987, has
announced plans to raise up to Y80bn (Dollars 649m) in straight bonds on
domestic and overseas markets by the middle of this year.
This will be the first bond issue by any of the seven operating units of the
rail group. The announcement follows last year's decision by the Ministry of
Transport to postpone privatisation of the railway units due to the
sluggishness of the Japanese stock markets.
The move is expected to promote further expansion of the domestic corporate
bond market. Companies are turning to the Japanese straight bond market,
originally seen as immature because of rigid issuance restrictions and an
illiquid secondary market.
Last year, due to the stock market slump which made large equity-linked
financing difficult, and to the loosening of restrictions by the Ministry of
Finance, the straight bond market saw an increase in straight bond issues.
In 1991, domestic straight bond issues totalled Y2,380bn, up 30 per cent
from 1990, and issues in the Euro market rose 2.5 times to Y3,500bn.
East Japan Railway said that it would continue to tap the straight bond
market for fund-raising. The company needs funds for instalment payments for
the 'Bullet Train' facilities worth Y3,100bn. East Japan Railway must repay
Y150bn of maturing long-term debt this year, and the unit plans to spend
Y200bn in capital investments in the year to March 1993.
East Japan Railway said that issue terms and details of the bonds have yet
to be fixed. The remaining railway units, including Central Japan Railway
and West Japan Railway, are expected to follow suit by raising funds through
the corporate bond market.

MR JOHN 'Jack' Sandner was re-elected as chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) for a record eighth time. Mr Sandner, who has served seven
one-year terms as chairman, will now serve a two-year term under new rules
approved by the CME last year.
Mr Sandner is a lawyer by training and a former Golden Gloves boxing
champion. He was chairman from 1980 to 1982, from 1986 to 1988, and again in
1991.
He said he plans to press on with the initiatives he began in 1991 'to
ensure that the CME remains the most important and innovative centre of risk
management in the world.'
At the CME, the chairman is elected by the board of governors rather than by
direct vote of exchange members. The CME board of governors is composed of
24 representatives of the three divisions of the exchange and eight
appointed outside governors.
While there has been some grumbling on the CME floor about the exchange's
entrenched leadership, the continuity in its top ranks has enabled it to
pursue a consistent, strategic expansion of its innovative financial
products.

MARC RICH &amp; CO AG v SOCIETA ITALIANA IMPIANTI
Court of Appeal
(Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Woolf and Lord Justice Scott):
December 19 1991
SUBMISSION to the jurisdiction of the courts of a foreign country by the
lodging of a defence covers the whole proceedings, including earlier
interlocutory orders and decisions. Accordingly, an earlier decision as to
the non-existence of an arbitration agreement is a decision of a competent
court binding on a party who submits to the jurisdiction at a later stage,
and bars him from asserting in the UK that the claim should go to
arbitration.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff, Marc
Rich &amp; Co AG, from Mr Justice Hobhouse's dismissal of its application for an
interim injunction to restrain the defendant, Societa Italiana Impianti PA,
from pursuing an action in Genoa pending appointment of an arbitrator.
LORD JUSTICE NEILL said Marc Rich was Swiss. Impianti was Italian. In 1987
Impianti sold a cargo of oil to Marc Rich. The contract for sale was
negotiated in Italy.
Following the sale Marc Rich alleged that the cargo was contaminated, and
contended that the contract incorporated an English law London arbitration
clause.
On February 29 1988 Marc Rich appointed an arbitrator. Meanwhile, on
February 18, Impianti had issued proceedings in Genoa seeking a declaration
of non-liability.
On May 20 Marc Rich issued an originating summons in the Commercial Court in
London seeking appointment of an arbitrator pursuant to section 10(3) of the
Arbitration Act 1950. It obtained leave to serve out of the jurisdiction.
Impianti applied to set aside leave, contending that the contract did not
contain an arbitration clause and that the dispute should be resolved in
Italy.
Mr Justice Hirst dismissed the application. He held that the 1968 Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention did not apply; that the putative law
of the contract was English; and that it was a proper case for leave.
Impianti appealed. The Court of Appeal referred questions on the
interpretation of Article 1 of the Convention to the European Court.
Meanwhile, Marc Rich had taken steps to contest jurisdiction in Genoa. On
October 4 1988 it lodged a defence document pleading lack of jurisdiction,
but, in the event of recognition of jurisdiction, claiming compensation for
loss.
On January 25 1991 the Corte di Cassazione in Rome rejected a plea by Marc
Rich that the Genoa proceedings be stayed on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction. It held there was no arbitration agreement and that the only
jurisdiction was Italy where the contract had been formed.
On May 14 Marc Rich lodged a further pleading in Genoa, contesting
Impianti's non-liability claim. On June 4 and July 2 it introduced
documentary evidence.
On April 25 the European Court gave its judgment on the question referred by
the Court of Appeal.
Article 1(4) of the Convention provided 'the Convention shall not apply to .
. . (4) arbitration'. The first question referred was whether the article
1(4) exception extended to litigation as to the initial existence of an
arbitration agreement.
In paragraph 22 of its judgment the Court said Impianti contended that the
article 1(4) exclusion did not extend to such disputes. Further contentions
were set out in paragraphs 23, 24 and 25.
In the first sentence of paragraph 26 the Court said 'those interpretations
cannot be accepted'. In paragraph 29 it said the exclusion extended to
litigation pending before a national court concerning appointment of an
arbitrator, even if existence of an arbitration agreement was a preliminary
issue in that litigation.
Those paragraphs were not easy to interpret. The Court appeared in the first
sentence of paragraph 26 to reject the paragraph 22 contention. On the other
hand, paragraph 29 was capable of meaning that the exclusion covered section
10(3) cases.
In the light of the European Court's answer, the appeal from Mr Justice
Hirst's judgment was dismissed.
On October 29 Marc Rich sought an injunction to restrain Impianti from
taking further steps in Genoa until final award in the arbitration.
Mr Justice Hobhouse concluded on the balance of convenience that it would
not be appropriate to grant an interim injunction after Marc Rich had
apparently voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the Italian court.
He refused the application. Marc Rich now appealed.
On the appeal the question, not argued below, was whether the Rome decision
was binding as to the existence of the arbitration agreement. If so, the
basis for the summons and relief disappeared.
Article 26 of the Convention provided that a judgment given in a contracting
state should be recognised in other contracting states.
Section 32(1) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 provided that
an overseas judgment should not be recognised in the UK if the proceedings
were brought in the overseas court (a) contrary to agreement and (b) without
the agreement of the person against whom judgment was given, 'and (c) that
person did not . . . submit to the jurisdiction of that court'.
Section 32(4)(a) provided that nothing in subsection (1) should affect
recognition in the UK of a judgment 'which is required to be recognised or
enforced there under the 1968 Convention'.
Section 33(1) provided that a person against whom judgment was given should
not be treated as having submitted to the jurisdiction only because he
appeared to contest jurisdiction, or to ask for a stay on the ground that
the dispute should be submitted to arbitration.
Impianti contended that the Rome judgment was the judgment of a competent
court, and that Marc Rich had submitted to the jurisdiction by lodging the
first defence in October 1988, or by lodging the second defence in May 1991
and the documents in June and July.
Accordingly, it was argued, all the elements of an issue estoppel were
present - final judgment on the merits by a competent court between the same
parties on the same issues. Marc Rich said the Rome court was not a
competent court in that the defence was not a submission to the
jurisdiction.
In the alternative Impianti said the judgment had to be recognised under the
Convention and, in the light of section 32(4)(a), section 32(1) did not
apply.
If one considered the form of the question sent to the European Court of
Justice and the argument recorded in paragraph 22 of the judgment, the
European judgment did not provide any clear authority for the proposition
that the Rome judgment was one to which section 32(4)(a) applied.
It was unnecessary to express any final view on the question. The case would
not be decided on the basis of section 32(4)(a).
The question was whether Marc Rich submitted to the jurisdiction of Italian
courts at a time and in a manner which prevented it from relying on section
32 because of non-fulfilment of condition (1)(c).
Section 33 should not be construed too narrowly. It might not have been
necessary for Marc Rich to lodge an alternative defence on the merits on
October 1988, but the pleading made it abundantly clear that the primary
purpose of the document was to challenge the jurisdiction. It was assumed
that the first defence did not amount to a submission.
The second defence, lodged in May 1991, was another matter. It was a plain
and unequivocal submission to the jurisdiction of the Italian court to deal
with the merits of the claim. Marc Rich was seeking rejection of Impianti's
claim. The matter was put beyond doubt by the lodging of documents.
Once Marc Rich had submitted to the jurisdiction to try the merits of the
case, that submission covered the whole proceedings. It could no longer
dispute earlier interlocutory orders, nor challenge the validity or
competence of any earlier decision in the proceedings.
It followed that the Rome judgment was the judgment of a competent court.
Marc Rich must be regarded as having submitted to the jurisdiction. The
condition in section 32(1)(c) could not be satisfied. Marc Rich was bound by
the decision that the contract did not contain an arbitration agreement.
The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed.
For Marc Rich: Iain Milligan QC (Clyde &amp; Co).
For Impianti: Peter Gross (Ince &amp; Co).

ABERFOYLE, the Tasman-ian-based mining group, has joined the list of
Australian resources companies which have fallen victim to historically low
world metal prices, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The base metals company has cut its annual dividend to 10 cents a share from
27.5 cents after 1991 earnings fell to ADollars 10.9m (Dollars 8.38m) from
ADollars 30.0m. Revenue fell to Dollars 125.6m from ADollars 179.1m. The
directors said the decline was caused by sharply lower metal prices and near
exhaustion of the company's long-standing Que River operation.
Yesterday's report indicated the Hellyer operation was the company's most
profitable.

WESTFIELD Trust, Australia's largest listed property trust, has shrugged off
depressed property markets and reported record earnings for 1991.
The Sydney-based regional shopping centre owner lifted earnings by almost 10
per cent to ADollars 121m (USDollars 93m) for 1991 from ADollars 110.3m a
year earlier.
The trust is maintaining its unbroken record of distribution rise since its
inception in 1982 with a 20.01 cents pay-out per unit, up from 19.62 cents.
Mr Frank Lowy, chairman, said yesterday that 10 of the trust's 16 properties
were re-valued during the year, showing a net rise of ADollars 89.2m. This
contrasted sharply with falls in valuations for many other types of property
and lifted net asset backing of the trust's securities to ADollars 2.30 each
from ADollars 2.21.
The trust's properties had a vacancy rate of just 1 per cent and total sales
rose 6 per cent to ADollars 2.54 m in the period. 'Westfield Trust is in a
sound financial position, with no net borrowings at balance date,' he said.
'The underlying strength of regional shopping centres has become more
apparent in these difficult times, emphasising their status as the premier
form of real estate investment.
'Provided there is no further deterioration in the economic situation,
directors believe that the distribution to unitholders will be maintained in
1992.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: JCL to be liquidated with Y129bn
outstanding debts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JCL, a property and sales affiliate of Janome Sewing x Machine, one of the
world's leading sewing machine makers, began liquidation proceedings
yesterday with outstanding debts of Y129bn (Dollars 1.04bn), which arose
from Janome's dealings with a stock speculator group.
The collapse of JCL symbolises the sometimes disastrous results of
conservative Japanese manufacturing companies' diversification into property
development and their uncharacteristic links with stock speculators during
the financial frenzy of the late 1980s.
Janome was entangled in the failure early last year of Nanatomi, a property
and stock speculator which had outstanding debts of Y300bn and was then
Japan's third largest bankruptcy on record. Through JCL and another ailing
affiliate, New Home Credit, Janome had guaranteed loans of about Y187bn for
Nanatomi, and was left exposed after the company's collapse.
JCL had come to guarantee the money after a Nanatomi executive, Mr Masayuki
Yasuda, was appointed to the Janome board in 1989, and later became its
vice-president. While he claimed to have ended his days as a stock
speculator, Mr Yasuda later admitted to close links to Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani,
the head of the Koshin speculator group charged with attempting to extort
Y30bn from Janome.
Nanatomi and Koshin began buying Janome shares in late 1985, when the sewing
machine maker became one of many targets of the speculative buying that was
characteristic of the Tokyo market at that time.
At the start of 1986, Janome shares were at Y380, by March they reached
Y1,900 and in November they were trading at Y2,600.
The speculators' purchase of Janome shares was partly inspired by the belief
that the company's 180 fully-owned sales outlets in Japan were a potential
property goldmine, bearing in mind the then fast-rising price of land.
Meanwhile, Janome had hoped the loans to Nanatomi would ensure that the
speculators' holding, which reached almost 40 per cent, would not be
on-passed to another predator.
JCL was established in 1988 as part of Janome's plans to expand into
non-manufacturing business such as jewellery, restaurants and sports clubs.
The company, apparently in expectation of yesterday's filing with the Tokyo
District Court, had last year reduced its staff from 60 to five.
While JCL is to be liquidated, Janome has the backing of its main bank,
Kyowa Saitama Bank, which has already replaced several executives at the
sewing machine company and whose affiliates took control of 81 per cent of
JCL shares. The former president of Saitama Bank resigned last year to take
responsibility for its exposure to Janome before his bank merged with Kyowa
Bank.
Janome has announced that a large part of a Tokyo plant will sold to pay off
debts, while Kyowa Saitama has assured other creditors that it is supporting
the company. The sewing machine maker is reported to have sold some of its
cross-held shares in financial institutions to raise funds, including part
of its stake in Kyowa Saitama.
Other listed companies caught in the Nanatomi collapse, including Tobishima
Corporation, the construction company, are also being restructured with the
assistance of their main bank - in Tobishima's case, Fuji Bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN Plantations (M Plant) has agreed to sell its five plantation
companies domiciled in England, and some Malaysian estates for MDollars 185m
(USDollars 69m) to Amalgamated Steel Mills (ASM), one of Malaysia's largest
industrial groups.
The sale, approved by ASM shareholders, marks one of the last chapters in
the unravelling of the acquisition in 1989 for MDollars 592m of the then
financially troubled Multi-Purpose conglomerate by Kamunting, a tiny,
public-listed toll road operator.
Kamunting and M Plant each has a 32.5 per cent shareholding in the other,
the latter acquiring it with a MDollars 167m loan but partially settled by a
subsequent MDollars 120m rights.
Kamunting's successful effort in enlisting M Plant's support for the
Multi-Purpose bid left the plantation group with MDollars 358m in loans,
needed mostly to meet obligations it held on MDollars 249m in Kamunting loan
notes.
Debts within Kamunting and Multi-Purpose led, during the past two years, to
a stream of asset-sales.
M Plant's outstanding bank debts stand at MDollars 200m. The cash deal with
ASM was partially discounted from the MDollars 203m market value, said Mr
Lim Thian Keong, managing director, because it was a block offer which
attracted few bids.
The UK-based estate rubber and oil palm companies, are, in order of size:
Brooklands, Henrietta, Chembong, Kuala Pahi and Kampong Kuantan. KL Land is
locally incorporated.
ASM, controlled by Mr William Cheng and his holding company, Lion, is an
aggressive group involved in steel products, property, cars and components,
finance, retail and food. It is planning a MDollars 8.6bn steel production
complex in joint venture with the Taiwanese state-owned China Steel.
ASM turnover for the year to June 1991 was MDollars 1.8bn against MDollars
1.3bn a year earlier.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ready to stamp on the world
stage - Donald Gordon, S Africa's leading insurer, talks to Philip Gawith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Donald Gordon visits London next week after a break in South Africa,
he will do so firm in the knowledge that 1991 was the year he emerged into
the big time in international insurance.
It was a watershed year in the fortunes of a man who has left an indelible
stamp on the South African insurance industry, and he wants to do the same
on the world stage. Two developments did much to enhance the status of Mr
Gordon and Liberty Life, the largest proprietary life insurance company in
South Africa, which he founded in 1958.
First, the tie-up between Transatlantic Holdings - the UK holding company
for the Liberty group's offshore interests listed in Luxembourg  - and UAP,
France's largest insurer. Under the deal, the two pooled their holdings in
Sun Life of the UK into a new vehicle, Rockleigh Corporation. Rockleigh
holds over 95 per cent of the issued share capital in Sun Life. UAP paid
Pounds 140m for a 16.8 per cent strategic stake in Transatlantic.
Second, an international issue of 12m shares by Liberty Life. The issue,
which raised Dollars 140m, was the first in London by a South African
company since the early 1980s.
One of Mr Gordon's top issues is the future of Sun Life, whose de-listing
seems imminent. Once Rockleigh's stake reaches 96 per cent it will be able
to acquire compulsorily the balance of the shares.
Although any strategy will first have to be agreed with UAP, Mr Gordon feels
there are a number of advantages to de-listing. He cites not being
constrained by financial year-ends, being able to restructure the capital or
the company more easily than when minorities are involved and not being
curbed by the restrictive rules of the London Stock Exchange.
The bottom line is what Rockleigh can do to improve Sun Life's performance.
Although Mr Gordon describes Sun Life's most recent results as exceptional,
he says 'we can make some contribution that will improve those numbers.'
He argues that having large shareholders 'is a great advantage. We
(Rockleigh) now have a much greater incentive to make Sun Life really
productive. We cannot allow it just to remain a passive investment.'
Specific plans for Sun Life await clarification on a de-listing and talks
with UAP. But Mr Gordon will want to take to Sun Life some of the techniques
which made Liberty successful.
Apart from growing quickly to become South Africa's third largest insurer,
with assets of over R30bn - behind the much older Cape-based mutuals, Old
Mutual and Sanlam - Liberty has chalked up an impressive performance record.
Its rise in dividends has only once been less than 20 per cent a year since
its listing in 1962, and its average annual combined rate of growth
(increase in net asset value and dividend distribution) has been 44 per cent
per share over the last decade.
How has this been achieved? One feature has been product innovation. Another
has been successful staff training. Recruiting and retaining high quality
staff is reflected in productivity per agent that is three times the
industry average, low lapse ratios and high average premiums.
Liberty is well known for its policy of taking high-quality strategic
investments. At June 30 1991, Liberty's top 20 equity holdings constituted
84 per cent of total group equities. These include dominant stakes in two
premier companies, South African Breweries and the Standard Bank group.
Mr Gordon says that UAP has a similar approach to taking strategic stakes
and adds: 'Sun Life has recently looked more at this approach.' The
convergence of thinking between Mr Gordon and Sun Life goes further. He
believes the acrimony between the two following his unsuccessful attempt to
gain control of the company in 1987 is past. 'The relationship with Sun Life
and its management has not only improved but has become far more
collaborative.' He says this may be related to the arrival of some senior
Sun Life managers after 1987.
Can Mr Gordon replicate his South African achievements in the European
environment? He believes so. 'The expertise we're reflecting in the South
African market is, in my view, more sophisticated than anything I've seen
anywhere in the world.'
Local opinion backs him. Ms Janet Mills, analyst at stockbroker Martin &amp; Co,
observes: 'If he gets it as right as he's got insurance in South Africa,
then Sun Life will go from strength to strength.'
The UAP link will be of great assistance to Mr Gordon. Not only do close
ties with Europe's second largest insurer confer the stamp of respectability
which the City of London has been slow to offer - in spite of his being on
the board of Guardian Royal Exchange since 1971 - but they provide an
important bridgehead into Europe for Transatlantic.
UAP is a potentially powerful source of finance for Mr Gordon's ambitions.
The chances of Transatlantic making acquisitions in the insurance field,
strengthened by UAP's shareholding, must be considered good. Mr Gordon will
not make predictions, but he does note that the 'international insurance
industry has never been more depressed' offering opportunities for cash-rich
companies such as Liberty and Transatlantic.
The share placement, which breached an international capital market drought
that had applied against South African companies for most of the 1980s, was
important in confirming Liberty and Mr Gordon's stature in the City. Mr
Oliver Baring of SG Warburg, the merchant bank which managed the share
issue, says the 'whole exercise went extremely well', the shares being
placed with a 'very blue chip institutional list'.
Mr Gordon notes: 'We may want to use shares for acquisition purposes in the
international market and thus wanted to establish the integrity of Liberty's
paper.' Although some of the shares flowed back to South Africa, Mr Gordon
maintains that 'the calibre of the shareholders remains fundamentally intact
and there is some evidence of new UK and continental shareholders acquiring
shares.'
Further down the line,is achieving a London listing for Transatlantic which
would make future capital raising easier and represent the sort of tangible
recognition he desires.
'There is an understanding between ourselves and our major shareholders that
we would move towards a listing in London at the appropriate time. The
fundamental reason would be if this assisted in creating a more liquid
market in the shares and whether it would be in the interests of the company
and shareholders.' He questions whether the timing is right but believes
this is probably the correct path to follow.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Platinum prices hit Rustenburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER platinum prices contributed to a 19 per cent fall in Rustenburg
Platinum's pre-tax profits to R498.8m (Dollars 179.4m) for the six months to
December.
Sales at the world's largest platinum producer, which is part of the
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, fell 15 per cent to R1.5bn
as values of platinum and rhodium, a by-product of mining platinum, slid by
12 per cent and 17 per cent respectively over the reporting period. Despite
a reduction in costs, profits on metal sales still dropped by 15.2 per cent
to R558.5m.
After taking account of renewals and replacements charges, and tax, lease
and tax normalisation, distributable profits fell 17.7 per cent to R219.7m.
This was slightly better than market expectations of a 20 to 25 per cent
decline in earnings.
It is a measure of the difficulties the platinum industry is experiencing
that Rustenburg, which has a strong balance sheet, saw fit to cut its
interim dividend to 87.5 cents a share from 125 cents. Earnings per share
dropped to 175.3 cents from 213.1 cents, so dividend cover was lifted from
1.7 to 2.
The company notes that metal prices, particularly rhodium, are currently
below those achieved in the first half of the year, and if they don't
improve results for the second half will be weaker.
Lebowa Platinum, a smaller platinum producer also in the JCI group, made an
after-tax loss of R9.4m compared with a R1.2m profit in the previous period.
This was largely a function of the high costs in relation to revenue because
of the mine's sustained drive to increase tonnage milled to 70,000 tonnes
per month.
Tonnage milled did increase by 52.3 per cent to approach 60,000 tonnes per
month, but revenues were only up by 12.3 per cent because of lower metal
prices and lower than planned head grades
Because of the cash-flow strain the mine is experiencing, the company has
decided to expand output from 70,000 to 100,000 tonnes per month. This will
be achieved through mining outcrop ore using open-cast methods rather than
through underground production.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Stratus to supply International
Computers

STRATUS COMPUTER of the US has agreed to supply International Computers
(ICL), the UK-based company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake,
with fault-tolerant computers in a deal which underlines the interdependence
of computer manufacturers today.
Stratus, based in Marlboro, Massachusetts, also supplies its computers under
non-exclusive agreements to International Business Machines (IBM), the
world's largest computer manufacturer, which at one time comprised 30 per
cent of Stratus' market, Olivetti of Italy, Ericsson of Sweden, and NEC of
Japan.
The company turned over Dollars 448.6m in 1991, a rise of 11 per cent on the
preceding year, with earnings of Dollars 49.7m, up 23 per cent.
Fault-tolerant or continuous availability computers are designed so that
single faults will not stop the system functioning. They have become
essential for critical applications including money transfer and security
where malfunctioning computers cannot be tolerated. The worldwide market for
systems of this kind is estimated at Dollars 12bn.
The market leader is Tandem Computers of the US; other manufacturers
including Digital Equipment and Hewlett Packard now also offer
fault-tolerant systems.
Mr William Foster, president and chief executive officer, said Stratus and
ICL were complementary; ICL had special expertise in the Unix operating
system which was the fastest-growing area of the Stratus marketplace.
Mr David Berry, director of associated services at ICL, said he expected to
sell Pounds 10m (Dollars 18.1m) worth of Stratus hardware in the first year
of a five-year plan in which revenues should reach between Pounds 50m and
Pounds 100m.
Stratus and ICL sales forces would complement each other in the UK rather
than compete. ICL's chief aim in selling Stratus hardware would be to
strengthen its role in the financial services market as well as public
utilities, telecommunications and security.
ICL and Stratus have worked together informally since 1987; ICL installed
Stratus computers at Deutsche Press-Agentur, Germany's largest press agency.

CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment, reported a
Dollars 404m annual loss for 1991, compared with earnings of Dollars 210m in
1990. The loss per share for last year was Dollars 4.00, against earnings
per share in 1990 of Dollars 2.07.
The loss was attributed primarily to a Dollars 373m pre-tax, non-recurring
charge, most of which was taken in the fourth quarter, and a 12 per cent
decline in sales volume. The charge was for plant closings and employee
redundancy costs.
Although the company has been embroiled in a labour dispute with the United
Auto Workers since the beginning of November, it said this did not have a
significant effect on the deterioration in sales. It did admit that with
some 9,300 workers idled, operations have been disrupted.
The company's outlook for this year is also clouded by the labour dispute.
It said that because of the uncertainties about the economy and resolving
the labour problems, it was 'not practical to forecast 1992 profitability at
this time'. But it is expected the first quarter of 1992 will be
unprofitable.
In the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of Dollars 318m, or
Dollars 3.16 per share. This compares with earnings of Dollars 11m, or 11
cents, in the year-ago period.
Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter were Dollars 2.46bn, down by
Dollars 299m from the 1990 period.

<TEXT>
FOURTH-QUARTER earnings of Amoco, the US oil and natural gas group with
large interests in chemicals, fell to Dollars 200m, or 40 cents a share,
from Dollars 538m, or Dollars 1.07, in the corresponding quarter of 1990,
Reuter reports from Chicago.
The group attributed the fall to lower crude oil prices and higher
exploration expenses. Crude oil prices averaged Dollars 20 a barrel, or more
than Dollars 10 a barrel below the 1990 fourth-quarter level.
Exploration expenses were up Dollars 85m.
Amoco added that its chemical operations incurred a loss in the quarter,
reflecting a soft economy and industry overcapacity.
Amoco's 1991 full-year profits declined to Dollars 1.53bn, or Dollars 3.07 a
share, from Dollars 1.91bn, or Dollars 3.77, in 1990. The 1991 net includes
a Dollars 311m, or 62 cents-a-share gain.
Worldwide capital and exploration expenditures in 1991 amounted to Dollars
3.9bn, compared with Dollars 3.7bn in 1990.
Amoco recently announced a capital and exploration expenditure budget of
Dollars 3.7bn for 1992.
Domestic exploration and production operations earned Dollars 107m in the
fourth quarter, while foreign exploration and production earnings amounted
to Dollars 46m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the Montreal-based transport equipment-maker, expects its
acquisition of de Havilland of Canada to give it extra clout in the world
regional aircraft market.
De Havilland's twin-engined Dash 8 turboprop is expected to be marketed as a
complement to the slightly larger and longer-range Regional Jet, which is
built by Bombardier's Canadair subsidiary in Montreal.
At the same time, Bombardier has indicated that de Havilland's operations
willbe integrated with those ofits other airframe manufacturing
subsidiaries, namely, Short Brothers of Belfast and theUS executive
jet-maker Learjet.
Bombardier is buying a 51 per cent interest in loss-making de Havilland from
Boeing of Seattle, with generous financial assistance from the Canadian and
Ontario governments. The province of Ontario will have a 49 per cent equity
stake in de Havilland, but Bombardier will have the option to buy the
province's shares after four years.
Bombardier and Ontario will contribute a total of CDollars 100m (USDollars
86.2m) in new equity in proportion to their shareholdings. The federal and
Ontario governments will provide CDollars 490m in other financial support,
mainly loans.
In addition, the Export Development Corporation has agreed to provide
subsidised export financing to put de Havilland on an equal footing with its
competitors.
The two governments have been desperate to find a buyer for de Havilland
since a bid by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia was torpedoed by
the European Commission last September. The EC contended that the proposed
takeover would have created a dominant player in the European commuter
aircraft industry.
The 63-year-old company has enormous symbolic value to Canada. Maker of such
famous aircraft as the Tiger Moth, the Mosquito and the Twin Otter, it is
one of only two airframe builders in the country and one of the biggest
industrial employers in the Toronto area.
De Havilland's only remaining product is the Dash-8. It has delivered 300
Dash-8s and has orders for about 90 on hand.
Bombardier's airframe manufacturing subsidiaries have been increasingly
integrated, with one company providing components, research and testing
facilities for the others. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, Bombardier's chairman, said
'by combining their resources, skills and experience and building on their
united strengths, Bombardier and de Havilland can look forward to achieving
a strategic position in the aerospace industry.'
Boeing put de Havilland on the block almost two years ago after losing
patience with the company, which last made a profit in 1982. Although its
products are widely respected, de Havilland has been bedevilled by high
costs, low productivity and uncertainty over its future.

<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), one of Finland's leading
commercial banks, was fined yesterday in the Helsinki city court for
financial misconduct in breach of bourse regulations, writes Robert Taylor.
Each director, plus the former president of KOP, Mr Jaakko Lassila - who
resigned just before Christmas - were fined between FM2,800 (Dollars 695)
and FM7,000 each.
The court found them guilty of failing to notify the Helsinki bourse last
spring of losses stemming from a series of exchange transactions they had
made. It was not until the middle of May, two months after KOP directors
knew of the loss, that the bourse was informed.
Under bourse regulations, all listed companies are required to immediately
provide information that might influence their share price.
Finland's bank inspection board was so concerned at the behaviour of the
directors that it called in the police.

FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Swiss banks do their own thing -
Different approaches to insurance marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND'S big three banks, known for following virtually identical
marketing strategies, have shown a refreshing streak of independence in
their recent advance into the insurance business in the plush Swiss market.
All three are taking advantage of the deregulation of the Swiss financial
industry two years ago, which has enabled insurance companies and banks to
tread on each other's turf. They are also following the popular 'Allfinanz'
or 'bancassurance' trends to seek synergies in insurance and banking
activities established elsewhere in Europe.
Yesterday, it was the turn of Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) to unveil its approach
to Allfinanz, which is to form a joint venture with Zurich Insurance. Each
company will sell products and services of the other through their existing
branches and offices.
By contrast, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and CS Holding, the parent
company of Credit Suisse, have decided to go it alone. CS, generally
acknowledged to be the most adventurous of the big three, began operating
its life insurance subsidiary, CS Life, in October, 1990, and UBS followed
last month, setting up SBG Leben (UBS Life).
The marketing strategies of the three differ considerably. The SBC-Zurich
venture, which still does not have a name, will target high-earning
individuals seeking to supplement their state pensions. SBC branches will
offer them various insurance policies and pension plans from Zurich's Vita
life insurance subsidiary, while Vita salesmen will push SBC investment
trusts.
SBG Leben is going after small company pension funds, following
implementation of a Swiss law which forces companies with fewer than 100
employees to put its pension fund under the management of a life insurance
company.
CS Life, on the other hand, has focused strictly on its high net worth
private clients, offering them big single premium policies that come with a
useful tax break.
'I am happy we are not all taking the same approach,' Mr Walter Frehner,
president of the executive board of SBC, said yesterday.
It will be interesting to see which of these strategies proves successful.
CS Holding said last autumn that CS Life had greatly exceeded its target
since it began operations, and the other two are optimistic about the market
potential.
It will also be interesting to see how much the new arrangements ruffle
traditional relationships between the big Swiss banks and insurance
companies.
SBC, for example, has an 18 per cent stake in La Baloise, but its Basle
neighbour apparently was not interested in a partnership. Credit Suisse has
close ties with Zurich, and Zurich officials confirmed yesterday that Mr
Fritz Gerber, chairman, would leave the CS Holding board.

Norsk Hydro shares

<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest company, is to take a NKr2.4bn (Dollars 387m)
special charge against its 1991 fourth-quarter accounts. The announcement
wiped 8 per cent off the company's stock market capitalisation yesterday.
The charge will cover the costs of restructuring and asset write-downs
associated with the agriculture and magnesium divisions.
Norsk Hydro's shares plunged NKr12.50, nearly 8 per cent, to NKr144.50 on
the news.
The company said NKr1bn of the charge related to the agriculture division
and NKr1.4bn to the magnesium division. Of the total, some NKr800m will
cover costs for the restructuring, while around NKr1.6bn represents
write-downs.
For the first nine months of 1991, group net income was NKr1.04bn, down from
NKr1.89bn a year earlier. Agriculture had an operating profit of NKr433m, on
sales of NKr20.03bn, while light metals - which includes the magnesium
division - achieved an operating income of NKr460m on sales of NKr13.10bn.
One Oslo-based analyst forecast that the final-quarter charges would push
Hydro into a net loss of between NKr800m and NKr1bn for 1991. The results
are due to be published on February 20. Hydro made a net profit of NKr2.9bn
in 1990.
Norsk Hydro said a big part of the charge against the magnesium division
earnings represented a write-down of the book value of the plant in
Becancour, Canada.
Last October Hydro charged NKr500m in its third-quarter accounts to cover
costs associated with the restructuring of the agriculture and magnesium
divisions, which it said was meant to lead to annual cost reductions of
about NKr260m. Hydro said a strong deterioration of the magnesium market,
combined with increased exports from eastern Europe, created a need for
adjustments in marketing and production activities.
To this end, Hydro said plans for restructuring would be completed during
the first half of 1991. However, this would depend to a large extent on the
outcome of the US trade policy cases.
Hydro said although there was over-capacity in the European fertiliser
industry, demand was expected to grow outside Europe.
To contend with these market conditions, the company intends to reduce
European capacity.

<TEXT>
SAINT-GOBAIN, the leading French glass, pipes and building materials group,
yesterday reported a 25 per cent decline on last year's profits, indicating
a slight recovery from the 40 per cent fall in the first half.
Net profits fell from FFr3.35bn (Dollars 610m) to FFr2.5bn, on sales up by 9
per cent, from FFr69.07bn in 1990 to FFr75.05bn last year.
All of the sale increase came from the first full-year incorporation of
Norton, the US abrasives group, and Solaglas, the British building
glass-producer, both bought in early 1990. Stripping these out, sales fell
by 1 per cent.
Flat glass prices improved slightly towards the end of last year, while
volume growth has started to slacken in Germany. Sales remain depressed in
France and show little sign of recovery in the US, said Mr Jean-Louis Beffa,
the chairman.

NESTLE, the Swiss foods group which launched a FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.5bn)
bid with Indosuez on Monday for Source Perrier of France, said sales in 1991
reached SFr50.5bn (Dollars 35.8bn), 9 per cent above 1990 levels. It
confirmed that 1991 profits were also higher, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The better-than-expected increase in sales was attributed to favourable
trends in all parts of the world, except the Gulf region, and to a slightly
positive net movement of foreign currencies against the Swiss franc.
Sales volume, excluding acquisitions and disposals, grew at more than 4 per
cent, with the largest increases in Latin America and Asia. In Europe and
North America, all product groups contributed to the increase, except the
pet food business in the US, which suffered from a stagnating market and
intensive competition.
The group said it expected further growth in sales and profits this year. A
complete financial statement is to be published on March 20.
Sales of Sandoz, the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, grew 9 per
cent to SFr13.4bn last year.

<TEXT>
DEEP differences within the French government have forced Groupe Bull to
delay the announcement of its choice of a US equity and technology partner
until next week.
The loss-making, government-owned computer manufacturer had been expected to
announce this week its choice between International Business Machines
(IBM)and Hewlett Packard as a source of an important computing technology
called 'Risc', which is expected to form a critical part of its product
strategy for the remainder of the decade.
The winning partner is expected to take an equity stake, thought to be
between 5 and 10 per cent, as a token of its commitment to the relationship.
IBM looks increasingly the likely winner. Last week, it was clear that Mr
Francois Mitterrand, the French president, and the French Finance Ministry
were in favour of IBM, while Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, and Mr
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, favoured Hewlett Packard.
Mrs Cresson and Mr Strauss-Kahn are now thought to be reconsidering,
although the decision could still go either way.
A plan to link Bull with the profitable French Telecom is thought to have
only Mrs Cresson's support. Brussels believes the company will sign a deal
with IBM and use the agreement as justification for a FFr6bn (Dollars 1.1bn)
subsidy from the French government. The EC is already examining the proposed
subsidy under its competition laws.
Mr Gerard Roucairol, Bull vice-president for corporate research, said
yesterday the company was satisfied with the quality of the technology on
offer from either of the US companies.
Despite huge losses last year, Bull's transformation plan is beginning to
work. It has managed to make FFr1bn of savings a year already, and has cut
9,000 staff, a quarter of the workforce.

<TEXT>
FONDIARIA, Italy's second biggest private-sector insurance group, yesterday
announced a wide-ranging restructuring of three stock market-listed
subsidiaries. It wants to create bigger and more competitive units ahead of
a long-awaited liberalisation of motor insurance premiums.
The three companies - Latina, La Previdente and Ausonia - are small or
medium-sized insurers with both life and non-life operations. Under the
proposed reorganisation, Ausonia will be merged into La Previdente via a
rights issue, while La Previdente will also be expanded through the purchase
of Latina's motor business.
Meanwhile, La Previdente's life insurance activities are to be transferred
to Latina Vita, which will change its name to La Previdente Vita.
'This is the first of what are likely to be many Italian insurance
rationalisations from within,' said Mr Simon Rudolph, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley in London. 'The aim is to beef up capital and expertise, especially
with the liberalisation of motor premiums on the way.'
A committee of Italy's lower house of parliament this week approved measures
to deregulate motor insurance premiums. The move, which is due to go into
operation next year, should become law following acceptance by the senate
next week.
Both Latina and Ausonia derive much of their premiums from motor insurance,
while La Previdente tends to specialise in personal lines.

<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON the creation of a pan-Nordic insurance grouping failed to produce a
breakthrough yesterday after an inconclusive meeting in Stockholm between
Skandia, the region's largest insurance company, the Norwegian group Uni
Storebrand, Denmark's Hafnia, and Pohjola, the Finnish insurance company.
Billed as a showdown, yesterday's discussion was the latest stage in what
has turned out to be a protracted and tangled affair. In a joint statement,
the companies said they had briefed each other on how the talks were
progressing and agreed they would not comment further.
The uncertainties surrounding Skandia's future started as long ago as
October 1990, when Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest
commercial bank, acquired a 28.2 per cent share option in the Swedish
insurer from the Wallenberg investment companies, Investor and Providentia,
with the aim of creating a large banking and insurance giant.
In the face of stiff resistance from Skandia's management, SEB accepted
defeat last November and sold most of its option to two Nordic insurance
companies, Uni Storebrand and Hafnia. They were believed - in alliance with
Pohjola, which already had a stake in Skandia, and an unidentified European
insurer - to want to build a pan-Nordic insurance conglomerate centred on
Skandia.
However, November's deal between SEB and the insurance companies failed to
settle the matter. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, expressed
doubts as to whether a pan-Nordic insurance conglomerate could emerge from
this.
The power play among the Nordic insurance companies was complicated further
by the fact that Skandia already owns a Norwegian subsidiary, Vesta, which
poses a severe competitive threat to Uni Storebrand on its home territory.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bass chief warns about the costs of
rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN Prosser, chairman of Bass, the UK's leading brewer, warned
shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting that rationalisation measures
would involve further exceptional charges against profits.
The group has already announced that it is to close breweries at Edinburgh
and Sheffield. The meeting was told that the group was aggressively reducing
its cost base and that this action was 'essential to strengthen further our
market position amid intensifying price and brand competition.'
Mr Prosser said beer sales to the free trade in the October-December quarter
had increased by more than 10 per cent, with a particularly strong
performance in the take-home trade. Total beer volumes were only 0.5 per
cent down, having benefited from an increase of nearly 5 per cent in the
final four weeks of December.
'We believe this means that our market share gains have continued in the new
financial year,' he said.
Christmas trade in the group's pubs had been 'more encouraging' than in the
preceding weeks but beer volume per pub was 9 per cent below last year with
a consequent loss of high marginal profitability.
Another 389 pubs were sold during the quarter, fetching Pounds 69m and
bringing the total sold to 1,899 against a disposal target of 2,740. New
leases had been signed or agreed for 540 of the leased estate's 1,229 pubs.
Mr Prosser said that in the Holiday Inn business, economic conditions in
some parts of the US had continued to affect occupancies in company managed
hotels but this had been almost offset by increased room rates.
US franchise hotels' occupancy rates were similar to those in the same
period last year.

Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 726,000
(Pounds 474,000) on turnover up 28 per cent at Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 17.3m).
Earnings per share were 5.1p (4.9p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.25p
(1p).

<TEXT>
In a further move in its financial restructuring, Albrighton, the USM-quoted
building products group, has sold Transplastix, its architectural glazing
subsidiary, for Pounds 2.3m cash.
The buyer is Yule Catto, the chemicals and building products group.
Transplastix's profits before interest and management charges were Pounds
1.01m in the year to March 31 1991; net assets amounted to Pounds 1.45m.
Recently Albrighton has sold Frank England, Triad Timber Components, Lovells
Confectionery and Insuwall - all to reduce group indebtedness.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hill &amp; Smith dips 9%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HILL &amp; Smith Holdings, the West Midlands-based steel stockholder and
fabricator, saw its pre-tax profits fall by some 9 per cent to Pounds 4.64m
over the 12 months to end-September.
The fall from the previous year's Pounds 5.12m came despite turnover ahead 5
per cent to Pounds 75.8m.
Nevertheless, Mr John Silk, chairman, described the outcome as 'good results
in the current UK economic climate'. The group's steel stockholding and drop
forging activities 'struggled for market share in a climate of falling
margins', but other group businesses performed well, he said.
Reflecting a property revaluation during the year, shareholders' funds
jumped 41 per cent to Pounds 29m. Gearing fell from 32 per cent to 14 per
cent.
Earnings per share emerged at 12.29p (13.06p); a recommended final dividend
of 3.9p brings the total for the year to 6p (5.7p).

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Weakening oil prices hold BP over the
barrel - The pressures behind the oil producer's cost-cutting campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum is poised to make substantial job cuts in its group
headquarters staff as part of a cost-cutting drive.
The move follows announcements late last year that the company is seeking
redundancies in its chemicals and research and development divisions.
The expected staff cuts come as the company is preparing to announce on
February 13 its results for the fourth quarter ended December. They are
likely to be the worst quarterly figures for years. If the trend continues,
BP could report a loss for the current first quarter, its first such
deficit.
BP has been cutting jobs across the company as part of a cost reduction
campaign initiated by Mr Bob Horton, chairman. But it has come under further
financial pressure in the past few months as oil prices have weakened and
show few signs of picking up for much of this year.
'We are looking at a number of actions this year in view of the oil price
and redundancies are among them,' the company said. 'We are also looking at
consolidating all of the headquarters staff in the Finsbury Circus building
(BP's new HQ) and which activities can be done outside of the company.'
Among the world's big oil companies, BP is one of the most exposed to
fluctuations in the oil price. Mr Horton has said in the past that every
Dollars 1 a barrel increase in world oil prices adds Pounds 200m to the
bottom line.
Oil prices have fallen almost Dollars 5 a barrel since November and look
like remaining at current levels of about Dollars 18 a barrel as the
industry moves into the traditionally weak spring period.
'The trouble for BP is that their whole strategy is based on the oil price
moving to Dollars 25 a barrel by the second half of the 1990s,' said Mr
Fergus McLeod, oil industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, 'and
that is now looking increasingly unlikely.'
The weakness of the dollar against sterling has combined with the low oil
price to make an even more dismal picture for BP's finances. The company
sees most of its revenue in dollars, but faces rising sterling costs for
North Sea operations. Sterling oil prices now stand at about Pounds 10 a
barrel while the level for most North Sea operations to show a profit is
Pounds 2 higher.
With few signs of a rise in the oil price, Mr McLeod has cut his earnings
estimate for BP this year by 48 per cent to Pounds 590m, based on an oil
price forecast of Dollars 18 a barrel. The shares have fallen from more than
350p in October to yesterday's closing level of 288 1/2 p.
The company's chemicals operations are looking to make cost-savings of some
Dollars 150m (Pounds 83m) in the next two years and part of this will be
achieved by a programme of redundancies.
Similarly, BP Oil, the group's refining and marketing division, plans to
save a like amount by the end of this year as part of a two-year programme
which saw it reduce outgoings by Dollars 60m to the end of last year.
Against this austere background, Mr Horton is finding that an expensive
corporate staff of some 1,400 is becoming a heavy burden in spite of halving
the headquarters' workforce in 1990 when more than 1,000 jobs were cut.
BP is negotiating 400 job cuts among the 2,000 staff that work at its
Sunbury research and development centre just outside London. It has launched
a programme of voluntary redundancy in its chemicals division which fell
into the red for the first time in 10 years in the middle of last year, amid
a long-term downturn in the world chemicals business.
In addition the company is rumoured to be considering job reductions and
even the possible closure of its Glasgow office, which employs several
thousand staff, as the centre of its European exploration activities.
Low prices could push the debt-to-equity ratio higher than its current 78
per cent to 97 per cent by the year end, according to County NatWest. Cuts
in cash flow could force the company to constrain capital expenditure and
phase in some developments rather than invest too much up front.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimates that BP will report
earnings from operations as low as Pounds 48m for the final quarter of last
year, although this could be doubled by gains from asset sales. This
compares with income of Pounds 456m in the fourth quarter of 1990, which
received a boost from high oil prices at the onset of the Gulf conflict.
In addition, the City has been revising downwards its forecasts for BP's
earnings for the full year to below Pounds 1bn - a drop of between 15 and 20
per cent on 1990's level.
BP earns 60 per cent of its revenues from crude oil production and suffers
when prices are low. This year, the recession means that its chemicals and
refining divisions will be equally hard-hit and not able to offset losses
from lower crude prices.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Burton cautious on 1992 outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN Hoskyns, chairman of Burton Group, yesterday told the clothing
company's shareholders that he remained 'extremely cautious about the
economic outlook for 1992'.
Speaking at the annual meeting, Sir John said Burton had 'witnessed the
deepest recession in retailing since the war at the same time as a collapse
in the property market'.
But he said sales growth had been re-established in the current financial
year. Stripped of the increase in VAT, sales were running 1 per cent ahead
of the previous year.
Trade had been very poor at the beginning of the financial year but had
picked up over the crucial Christmas period showing a 5 per cent improvement
in the five weeks from the beginning of December.
He added, however, that the increase in sales had been bought at the expense
of some erosion on gross margin as a result of an extensive discounting
campaign.
Analysts suggested that sales were still showing a like-for-like decline
once the contribution from additional trading space had been stripped out
and warned that the company's discounting promotions might backfire.
'My concern is that Burton has set a precedent with the discounting.
Customers will find it unpalatable when they try to restore prices to the
full margin. Some of their retail brands have passed their expiry date,'
said Ms Julie Ramshaw, retailing analyst at Morgan Stanley, the US
investment bank.
Burton's shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 35 1/2 p.
Sir John yesterday headed a much-changed board as four directors had left
and seven joined since the previous annual meeting.
The company's Pounds 161m rights issue in August had cut year-end debt from
62 per cent to 43 per cent and Burton subsequently sold the Harvey Nichols
department store for Pounds 60m and the leasehold of 214 Oxford Street for
Pounds 51m.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Park Food forecasts substantial upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARK FOOD GROUP reported record sales of food and drinks hampers for 1991
and forecast substantially higher pre-tax profits for the full year to March
31.
The statement accompanied interim results for the seasonally unfavourable
six months to September 30 which showed a loss of Pounds 4.39m, against a
loss of Pounds 4.51m for the same period in 1990.
Turnover was Pounds 15.7m, against Pounds 20.3m last time.
An interim deficit is usual for the group due to the seasonality of its
Christmas hamper business.
Turnover for the last full year, to March 31 1991, was Pounds 119.6m with
pre-tax profits amounting to Pounds 3.99m.
The interim dividend is lifted to 5p (2.3p); directors anticipate a final
distribution of not less than 8p.
Mr Peter Johnson, chairman, attri-buted the company's success to the fact
that 'we have increased the number of our agents, average mem-ber spend has
increased substantially, and we are buying far more effi-ciently.'
He added that orders for next Christ-mas were already 'showing significant
increases over last year', and he be-lieved that results for March 1993
would show a further significant improvement.
The group has recently returned to its original core business of hampers,
sold through a nationwide network of of more than 64,000 agents, following
the disposal last June of its loss-making drinks division and of its frozen
food distribution branch in December.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Defence costs Macarthy Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTS OF Pounds 3.12m were incurred by Macarthy, the retailer and
pharmaceutical manufacturer, in defending itself against three separate bids
last year. The amount was included in a Pounds 3.26m extraordinary charge
for the year to September 28.
The sum compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.31m (Pounds 4.61m), a rise
of 15 per cent, at the higher end of City forecasts.
The company faced bids from Lloyds Chemists, the chemists chain, UniChem,
the pharmaceuticals wholesaler and Grampian, the Scottish mini-conglomerate.
The first two were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, on
which decisions are still waited, while Grampian's bid attracted only an 11
per cent take up.
Mr Ian Parsons, chief executive, said that profits rose in spite of the
group being in various discussions with potential bidders during almost all
of the second half.
Earnings per share were 13.8p (11.6p). Macarthy is proposing a 33 per cent
cut in the final dividend to 5p (7.5p) for a total 20 per cent down at 10p
(12.5p).
Mr Parsons said that the 1990 dividend had been based on an assumption that
the economy would recover. The reduced dividend provided for cover of 1.4
times.
Turnover for the year fell from Pounds 372.6m to Pounds 206.5m after the
disposal of the pharmaceutical wholesale business. Sales for continuing
businesses rose by 6 per cent.
Its over-the-counter retailing business and the retail healthfood business
both suffered from the downturn in spending as the UK recession deepened.
The veterinary products division increased sales by 11 per cent and turned a
Pounds 164,000 loss into an operating profit of Pounds 580,000.
Pharmaceutical products also put in a resilient performance with operating
profits up 41 per cent to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 2.6m).
Steps had been taken to reduce costs by several hundred thousand pounds,
including some redundancies. Borrowings of Pounds 16m at the year end give
gearing of 60 per cent.
COMMENT
Uncertainty, high costs and a damaging effect on staff morale, not to
mention the impact on business plans, can all be pointed to as adverse
effects on Macarthy of last year's series of bids. But on the brighter side,
all the attention from its suitors may have been the necessary trigger to
spur the company into getting its house in order. Macarthy itself admits
that the previous dividend was based on overly optimistic assumptions, but
the decision to cut the dividend this year must have taken some serious
talking, not to mention courage, particularly as Macarthy is, in effect,
still in a bid situation. That decision seems sensible, given the group's
uncomfortably high gearing. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m this
year, makes for a prospective multiple of nearly 17, which is high, unless
bid activity is revived. Given that, based on fundamentals, a more
appropriate multiple would be about 12, it seems worth waiting for the MMC
to make up its mind.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Amicable Smaller seeks Pounds 33.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMICABLE SMALLER Enter-prise Trust is attempting to raise up to Pounds
33.5m, after expenses, via an offer for subscription on the main market.
It is the second investment trust launch over the past week to concentrate
on smaller company shares.
Hoare Govett's annual report on its smaller companies index, published
yesterday, showed that smaller company shares have outperformed the FT-A
All-Share Index since 1955 by an annual average of 4.5 per cent.
However, smaller company shares have been badly hit by high interest rates
and the UK economic recession, and have underperformed the All-Share over
each of the past three years.
The directors believe that smaller companies are due for a revival and will
invest in stocks among the smallest 10 per cent, by market capitalisation,
on the UK market.
A maximum of 35m shares, and a minimum of 20m, are being offered at 100p
each with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The warrants confer the
right to sub-scribe for one ordinary share at 100p in the years 1993 to
2000.
The warrants, together with the limited 10 year life of the trust, are
designed to limit the discount to net assets at which the shares trade after
flotation.
Scottish Amicable, which is managing the trust, is expecting an annualised
yield on the shares of about 5 per cent. The management fee is 0.1875 per
cent of the assets, payable quarterly.
Allied Provincial Securities has undertaken to subscribe or procure
subscribers for 17m ordinary shares, with warrants.
Minimum application for shares in the trust, which is suitable for inclusion
within a personal equity plan in both 1991-92 and 1992-93, is for 500
shares. The deadline for applications is February 26 and dealings are
expected to start on March 5.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BSkyB and UIP settle row caused by Dollars
800m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED International Pictures, the distributor for three Hollywood studios
and British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, yesterday
announced that they had settled all their legal differences.
In what could have become a messy and expensive series of law suits, BSkyB
decided to try to overturn an Dollars 800m (Pounds 442m) movie rights deal
it signed with UIP in 1988.
BSkyB, a venture in which Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake, claimed that the UIP joint venture for distribution and
licensing of pay TV rights was anti-competitive and in breach of the Treaty
of Rome.
BSkyB also issued a writ in London seeking damages of more than Pounds 150m.
In October UIP went on the offensive and announced it was beginning legal
action to try to break up BSkyB, which was formed from the merger of British
Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television.
UIP argued that the satellite company was an anti-competitive cartel.
Yesterday all the litigation was called off, apparently without any money
changing hands:
The legal proceedings between BSkyB and UIP in the High Court are being
brought to an end;
UIP has withdrawn its case against BSkyB's shareholders over the merger;
BSkyB is withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission against UIP.
The rows between the satellite broadcaster and one of the most powerful of
Hollywood's film groupings largely grew out of BSkyB's pressing need to
renegotiate film deals entered into at a time when BSB and Sky were
competing desperately against each other.
BSkyB now has a deal on a long-term basis to show films from the UIP studios
 -Paramount, MCA and MGM-Pathe - on both of its subscription film channels.
Film channel subscriptions are the financial heart of the BSkyB business.
Both sides made the following statement yesterday: 'UIP and BSkyB are
satisfied that the new deal is fair to each of the parties and good for the
consumer.'
The UK satellite company now has revised deals with all of the Hollywood
studios, apart from Warner Bros, the Time Warner subsidiary where talks are
continuing.
BSkyB is expected to break even on an operational basis later this year.
In the last three months new satellite dish installation in the UK has been
above 100,000 a month.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Letter: Casting doubt on Home Office 'surprise' over poll
tax issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEPHEN CASTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With regard to the 'apparent loophole' in the law over the
admissibility of computerised records as evidence in civil proceedings in
magistrates' courts ('Poll tax dilemma that is a matter of records', January
18), I doubt that the Home Office has been 'taken by surprise'.
During 1987 and 1988 I carried out reviews of the position in English (and
to some extent, Scottish) law of admissibility of computer evidence in both
civil and criminal proceedings. These studies were commissioned by the
Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency. Copies of the final reports
were, I believe, submitted by the CCTA to the Treasury, the Home Office, the
Lord Chancellor's department and the Scottish Office.
Incidentally, I am not sure it is true that 'the government knows it could
easily close the loophole by parliamentary order'. Even if it were true,
however, it would not alter the inherent problem in the central issue here:
the need for computer systems and operational practices properly capable of
forensic scrutiny, delivering undoubted evidential reliability.
It is thus not just computerised poll tax records which are affected. The
report signposted similar potential difficulties arising in, for example,
the authentication of 'dematerialised' Taurus share certificates, and the
'phantom withdrawal' syndrome of ATM cash-dispensers.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Letter: Central banks of main industrial countries should
assist Russia by stabilising external value of rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof WILLEM BUITER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister of the Russian federation and
minister of economics and finance, in his article, 'Russia needs three kinds
of economic aid - and quickly' (January 22), appealed for western funds to
help stabilise or peg the external value of the rouble. Western advisers
have proposed a rouble stabilisation fund of between Dollars 5bn and Dollars
6bn. I recommend that the task of stabilising the external value of the
rouble be assigned for the foreseeable future to the central banks of the
main industrial countries.
Monetary and fiscal control are necessary conditions for stabilising the
internal and external value of a currency. Let us assume that Russia
succeeds in creating a fiscal framework consistent with the non-inflationary
financing of essential public expenditures and a central bank capable of
delivering tight money it has yet to achieve either). Those with unbounded
confidence in the operation of markets might argue that no stabilisation
fund for the rouble would then be required. If the rouble is left to float
freely, there is no need for intervention and therefore no need for a
stabilisation fund. The rouble will find its market value which (by
definition) is also its equilibrium value.
This argument does not stand up. Until the credibility of a framework of
monetary restraint and fiscal prudence is established (and this will take
time) a freely floating exchange rate makes no sense, especially in a
country with no informative history in which to anchor exchange rate
expectations.
Intervention to peg the rouble at some target value will therefore be
necessary. It does not, however, follow that Russia must possess a fund of
convertible currencies. Someone must be willing to intervene, but that
someone need not, and in my view initially should not be, the central bank
of the Russian Federation.
All necessary intervention can be performed by the central banks of the main
western industrial countries acting in concert, perhaps through a single
agent. The Bundesbank comes to mind. The Russian central bank should pursue
monetary targets consistent with non-inflationary growth. Those managing the
western rouble stabilisation fund would buy or sell roubles in exchange for
a basket of convertible currencies to stabilise the value of the rouble in
terms of the Ecu, the SDR or some other currency basket.
This scheme does not require placing billions of dollars-worth of foreign
exchange under the immediate control of a Russian institution with an
atrocious record of monetary irresponsibility. In addition, the western
rouble stabilisation fund would not suffer from credibility problems and
speculative attacks, since it would be backed by the combined resources and
records of the western industrial countries.
As Russia achieves monetary and fiscal respectability, its central bank can
build up its international reserves and begin to share in the interventions
in the rouble market.

Sir, What was the reason for using the triangular road sign denoting a

FT  24 JAN 92 / Economic weight-watchers: The G7 meeting may be routine, but
the issues it faces are not
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The choice of venue says it all.
In September 1985, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the
world's leading industrial democracies met in Manhattan's prestigious Plaza
Hotel to launch a new chapter of international economic policy
co-ordination. Seventeen months later, in February 1987, they assembled
under the chandeliers of the Louvre Palace in Paris to announce a bold
currency stabilisation pact.
Tomorrow that co-ordination process continues - but in a Long Island suburb
of New York within 20 minutes' drive of JF Kennedy airport.
The prolonged recession in the English-speaking countries and slow growth
elsewhere have presented the Group of Seven nations with bigger economic
problems than in the mid-1980s when their main concern was to push an
overmighty dollar lower. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the
break-up of the Soviet Union have thrown up challenges for the US, Japan,
Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Canada that were undreamed of only three
years ago.
But tomorrow's meeting is likely to show that international economic policy
co-operation has only limited potential to change the world. The G7, which
some thought would evolve into a 'directorate' for the world economy after
the Louvre Accord, now works best as a forum for information exchange, with
the ministers and central bankers deciding their economic and monetary
policies according to the Sinatra doctrine of 'doing it my way'.
Officials preparing tomorrow's talks have stressed the routine character of
the meeting. For the past four years, the G7 has gathered around this time
to discuss the world economy and carry out the 'mutual surveillance' of each
economy's performance with the help of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). Tomorrow's meeting will see another session of this economic
weight-watchers' club. After lunch, the discussion will focus on the
economic crisis in the former Soviet Union.
The talks are due to finish after just six hours, so that Mr Nicholas Brady,
the US Treasury secretary, can join millions of other Americans in watching
the Superbowl on Sunday. The tight schedule will allow some visiting
ministers, including Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, to hurry to the
airport and home to deal with domestic political concerns.
On the other hand, it would be wrong to write off this latest instance of
high-level hobnobbing as no more than an expensive photo opportunity. While
the complexity of international events has apparently taught the G7
humility, adversity may be fostering solidarity.
Officials preparing the meeting hope that the atmosphere will be more
constructive than in recent G7 gatherings, which have been marked by
disputes between the US and Germany, Europe's strongest economy, over
economic policy priorities and how best to share the financial burden of
helping eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics move towards the
market economy.
The Bundesbank's decision in December to raise its key interest rates to
levels last seen in the 1930s, however, makes wholehearted agreement between
Washington and Bonn improbable. The US will press its main trading partners
to put greater stress on promoting economic growth, while the German
government, faced with a rash of double-digit pay claims, will underline its
determination to keep bearing down on domestic inflationary pressures.
But US Treasury officials, at least, believe the slowdown in growth in
Germany and Japan, and the absence of recovery in the recession-hit
English-speaking members of the G7, may contain the seeds of a new
international consensus on economic management that may solidify around the
time of the spring meetings of the IMF in late April.
The US Treasury draws encouragement from the US-Japanese growth strategy
unveiled in Tokyo earlier this month by US President George Bush and the
Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. Although the agreement was
criticised by many as little more than a rehash of existing domestic policy
commitments, it bore some fruit last week in the shape of joint US-Japanese
action on the foreign exchange markets to curb the dollar's rise and limit
trade friction between the two countries.
However, there seems little chance that the US and its European trade
partners will agree similar pacts in the near future. Germany will be unable
to start relaxing its tight monetary policy until wage pressures are brought
under control. The UK and France must keep interest rates high, because they
are committed to keeping their currencies in the bands of the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System.
Nor have the G7 governments much fiscal room for manoeuvre. There are likely
to be some adjustments. Treasury officials in Washington indicate that
President Bush's State of the Union message next Tuesday will signal fiscal
changes to boost growth in the short term in spite of the chronic US budget
deficit. With a general election looming, Mr Lamont is under growing
pressure to squeeze what fiscal stimulus he can from his March 10 Budget.
And the US may press France to relax fiscal policy to offset low growth this
year.
But these will be changes at the margin and unlikely in themselves to
reverse the steady scaling back of growth forecasts in the big industrial
countries.
The budgetary constraints confronting all industrialised democracies are one
reason not to expect agreement on large-scale financial assistance for
Russia and the other former Soviet republics from the G7 meeting. Although
the Russian authorities and their western advisers have made impassioned
pleas for multi-billion dollar stabilisation funds to support the rouble and
Russia's price reform, the G7 is unlikely to move before the republics have
become members of the International Monetary Fund and subject to IMF
discipline.
The prevailing view was summed up by Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under
secretary for international affairs, in an interview with BBC Television
last weekend. He warned that economic reform in the former Soviet Union
would be a long process which could not be bought by simply pumping in
western financial assistance. It was premature to think, for example, of
forming a stabilisation fund for the rouble.
While senior G7 officials privately express grave concern about economic
developments in the former Soviet Union, the ministers are unlikely to do
much more than push along the process of turning the republics into IMF
members. 'We hope to get to a point where the G7 ministers can agree on the
right parameters for entry,' one senior official said. A US Treasury
official said the G7's aim was to have Russia in the IMF in the next few
months.
Such a limited outcome would disappoint expectations in the former Soviet
republics and elsewhere. But G7 officials believe that the republics must do
more to make themselves attractive to western investors.
On the other hand, Germany is expected to warn that the economic and
political instability in the republics, and growing uncertainty about the
security of the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal, could be contributing
to the weakness of world growth by depressing investor and consumer
confidence.
There is little that finance ministers can do about the threat of nuclear
proliferation. But they can hope to boost confidence in other ways.
One would be to rekindle hopes that the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks can be brought to a speedy and successful end. More
than one G7 delegation has suggested making a strong statement about the
trade talks at the conclusion of the Long Island meeting.
However, the finance ministers have done this before, with little sign that
their appeals have had any effect on the negotiators in Geneva.
This time could be different, particularly if the finance ministers can
enlist their heads of government behind the cause of trade liberalisation.
As growth in the G7 countries converges near to zero, freer trade is one of
the few engines of recovery left to economic policymakers.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Personal View: Next steps for education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I welcome the Financial Times' decision to devote four leading articles to
education policy this month. They recognised the priority that education
commands in British politics. Nevertheless, I was surprised at the writers'
readiness to urge a pause in the reform of education in favour of
consolidation around a 'new consensus emerging across the party divide'.
To the extent that there is a new consensus, it has been built on the
government's agenda for reform set in 1987 with the Education Reform Act. In
just over three years
The national curriculum framework has been virtually completed to the
timetable first established.
Tests for all seven-year-olds have been introduced and the main principles
of tests at 14 have been settled. The principle of publishing test results
is widely supported.
Schools have been given greater autonomy through local management. Two
thirds of secondary schools and one third of primary schools control their
budgets; the rest will do so by April 1994 at the latest. Local management
of schools has transformed their funding and management.
Two hundred schools have taken the further step of acquiring Grant
Maintained status as a means to wider managerial freedom - and are thriving
on it.
The numbers going on to higher education have been massively increased.
None of this was considered possible in 1987. We started as we always seem
to do when embarking on social reform in the UK with the usual trench
warfare in support of old and unsatisfactory systems. The government has
demonstrated that it is possible to reform education swiftly and effectively
if the case for change is established and the objectives and timescales are
clear. It has required hard work by teachers and administrators to maintain
the pace of change.
My aim now is to take forward the reform programme and maintain the momentum
behind efforts to secure better standards. The impetus partly derives from
issues thrown up by reform itself. I doubt that there would have been any
serious thinking about classroom practice in primary schools without the
motor of change produced by the introduction of the national curriculum. The
case for a new national system of school inspection lies in the need to
underpin the new autonomy of schools with a more rigorous system of quality
assurance and accountability to parents. This strategy has to be built on
logical steps.
I propose that schools should play a bigger part in training future
teachers, who need the experience that can only come from school-based work
supervised by serving teachers. There have been experiments with this
through the last decade, including the Articled Teachers' Scheme. We must
apply the lesson of those experiments.
I will want to think further about primary teacher training in the light of
the report I published on Wednesday on primary school curriculum
organisation and classroom practice. The same principle of more school-based
training should apply to primary teachers as well. The test is whether the
newly-qualified teacher has skills that can be made to work in the
classroom.
I have tried to take forward a debate about how primary school teachers have
responded to the requirements of the national curriculum. The demands of the
curriculum have made it clear that the ways in which primary pupils are
taught and the ways their classes are organised are not always designed to
get the best from children. There must be a new debate among teachers based
on hard evidence about what approaches are effective and not on dogma about
child-centred education. That is why I have published the report of the
three wise men. I shall distribute it to primary schools and I hope it will
form the agenda for considering and planning change.
The Schools Bill - intended to implement the policies in the Parent's
Charter - extends schools' 10-year-old obligation to publish information
about their performance. More data will allow parents to see how schools
perform relative to each other.
Regular inspection is an essential supplement to information about
performance - increasingly so as schools' autonomy grows. The Schools Bill
lays down clear requirements about the frequency of inspection and the
publication of reports. Her Majesty's Inspectorate will be responsible for
overseeing the system. There will be national consistency; open, fair
reporting; and accountability to parents.
There is a good case for pressing forward with these changes. They maintain
the fundamental direction of reform. I have always expected argument about
their pace, cost and details, but the changes are part of the consensus, not
a departure from it.
There is wide agreement that we need radically to improve vocational
education and training in post-16 education, and especially to increase
staying-on rates.
The first of the new general vocational qualifications will be introduced
from September in some further education colleges and schools - and will be
more widely available from September 1993. They will be designed mainly for
young people in full-time education who want to keep career options open and
will be of equal value and equal esteem to A levels.
The government intends to bring in an Advanced Diploma from 1994 which will
further strengthen the esteem of vocational routes to higher education and
encourage breadth of study post-16.
Legislation is being prepared to remove further education and sixth form
colleges from local authority control to complete the process of devolution
begun by the Education Reform Act. The government's aim is to give these
colleges more flexibility, more freedom from town-hall bureaucracy and to
endow them with the ability to respond better to growing demand from
industry and students. The new funding arrangements will give the colleges
every incentive to increase recruitment and widen choice.
There should be no let-up in the pressure for better standards. The steps I
am taking are not short-term measures served up on the altar of an
approaching election. Each is justified on its own terms and is part of a
strategy to sustain education reform. Improving teaching and learning
remains the most urgent priority in education, and an important one for
society.
The author is secretary of state for education.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Politics comes to the Finanzplatz: The German government is
out to shake up the country's fragmented capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the space of a few days over last weekend, the German Finance Ministry
published a project for sweeping reforms of the country's securities and
money markets, and the Frankfurt stock exchange board aired plans to
introduce computerised trading. Then Chancellor Helmut Kohl, no less, popped
up in the city championing finance minister Mr Theo Waigel's reforms,
computers for all, and nominating Frankfurt as the natural home of the
European central bank. It was, said a man from the Finance Ministry,
'probably a coincidence'.
Probably hogwash. Nothing much goes on in German economic life that is not
carefully programmed. And what happened, suddenly last weekend, was that the
government took the country's financial establishment by the scruff of the
neck and gave it a thorough shaking.
'Nothing has happened for 30 years,' says Mr Paul Berwein, a leading
Bavarian broker. 'But now everything is in the process of change.'
Undoubtedly correct. Behind all three initiatives lies a concerted drive to
get German markets out of their provincial backyards and up to the
technological and service standards of competing financial centres in New
York, London and Tokyo. The campaign slogan is 'Finanzplatz Deutschland' and
the campaign base has moved from the boardrooms of banks and bourses all
over Germany, to the former barracks which serves as a Finance Ministry in
Bonn.
Over the past two years, Finance Ministry officials from Mr Gert Haller's
finance and credit department have listened to all the interested parties:
banks, traders, investors, lawyers and politicians. Following a round-table
session last October, Mr Haller selected from the disordered debate the
elements which he considered crucial for the development of Finanzplatz
Deutschland, bundled them up with a few ideas of his own, patched them
together with a package of proposed legal amendments . . . and went public.
Chancellor Kohl's immediate endorsement of the strategy gives Mr Waigel a
formidable ally in the task of pushing it through. The politicians have now
taken matters in hand after years of squabbling among the country's eight
provincial bourses, which typically see any attempt at change as a threat to
their supposed independence, an assault on German federalism, or further
encroachment by the Frankfurt bully-boys, who already account for 70 per
cent of securities turnover in Germany.
The government view is that it is high time a more mature debate got under
way. As Mr Waigel's paper said: 'As the third largest industrial nation in
the world, Germany needs a fully-developed financial market.'
It pointed to reforms in the US, Britain and Tokyo, and implied that unless
Germany's financial industries kept pace they would lose more domestic
business to outsiders. The fragmented and cumbersome nature of German
markets and systems hampered participation in the development of global
dealings. The country could be disadvantaged in the single European market
and would be unable to assume its 'predestined pivotal role' in the
financing of economic development in central and eastern Europe. On this
last point it warned: 'The competition is already in position'.
The ministry's strategy for re-arming Finanzplatz Deutschland comprises:
Legal amendments to give investment trusts greater flexibility. These
include permission for them to issue money market funds, and approval for
securities lending.
Supervision of securities markets by a national, self-regulatory authority,
reinforced with new laws and sanctions for breaches of rules. Insider
dealing, for example, would be punishable by up to two years' jail.
Improvements in investor protection and information, and greater
transparency of markets.
Political support for the introduction of new technology, notably
computerised dealing.
Backing for an industry project for the establishment by the eight regional
bourses of a Deutsche Borse AG, a company which would provide central
services for all participants.
All the necessary legal changes should be completed, and decisions taken on
computerised trading and the Deutsche Borse, by the end of the year, the
paper says.
Implementation of the plan will serve two main functions: modernising
antiquated market structures and plugging the gaping holes in the existing
regulatory system. At present regulation of the eight bourses is split
between state governments, the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in Berlin,
and market participants. Confusing and opaque, this system's value and
efficiency has been brought openly into question by several recent scandals.
The Frankfurt exchange is currently investigating alleged insider trading at
Deutsche Bank; the Finance Ministry in Hesse, home state to the Frankfurt
financial services industry, is probing certain market practices, while the
city's tax men are grilling 400 traders at leading banks and brokers over
alleged tax evasion.
Nothing much there to match the big securities scandals in Tokyo, New York
and London. But bankers and the government agree that their collective
impact is politically embarrassing and damaging to the industry's
reputation.
Moreover, the existing fractured structures mean that the country has no
central, liquid stock market. 'Most of Germany's major stocks are quoted on
all eight exchanges,' says Mr Berwein. 'There are different prices in
Bremen, Stuttgart and Berlin. Arbitrageurs operate in between and what
liquidity there is is divided between all eight. This is not to the
advantage of the issuer or the investors.'
The present federal structure, as one senior Finance Ministry official
points out, is almost impossibly complicated: the country's stock exchanges
are governed through inter-state treaties between all 16 German Lander, even
those without stock exchanges, and 'too much argument and long-winded voting
processes' for even the smallest adjustments.
Mr Christian Strenger, managing director of DWS Deutsche Gesellschaft fur
Wertpapiersparen, a Deutsche Bank investment management subsidiary with some
DM50bn under its control, says: 'Looking in from the outside the existing
system is not easy to understand. It is beautiful in some ways, but it has
laborious ways of working and foreigners have a tough time understanding
what is going on.'
Mr Berwein, whose brokerage is part of the London-based Warburg group,
agrees: 'It is lunatic for the supervision of a modern stock exchange to be
handled in this way.'
One result of this lunacy, according to local securities industry
practitioners, has been the export of a big slice of the German securities
market. Foreign investors seeking D-Mark assets, and put off by high costs
and the intricacies of the eight-exchange German market, have turned to
offshore sources. A large proportion of the trade in shares of the 30
biggest German companies is handled through Seaq International, a
London-based telephone dealing operation. In 1990, for example, 16 per cent
of all trade in shares of the Bayer chemical group was carried out through
Seaq. A drop last year to 14 per cent, is attributed by bankers to an
earlier welcome initiative from Bonn: the scrapping of stock exchange
turnover tax at the start of last year.
Bankers have warmly welcomed Mr Waigel's new package. Mr Fritz Losukow, a
director of Commerzbank, for example, proclaims that it is 'sensational'
that the government has at last taken the initiative and given more support
to the capital markets.
Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, a main board director at Dresdner Bank, is just as
keen: 'We are very happy . . . the activities of German capital markets have
never before been put in the limelight by the government,' he says. 'Recent
scandals could have been avoided if we had had insider trading laws. With
voluntary controls you have no weapon to hand when you come to a problem.'
It is in part the scandals that have brought Germany's eminently
conservative banking community to the point of favouring central regulation
and a more powerful central organisation for the stock market.
Another important factor is the realisation that European Community
regulations on the free movement of capital are inevitable. Germany also
needs new instruments and structures if it is not to surrender its role as a
conduit of capital to east Europe and others. And then there are the immense
capital demands for the reconstruction of the former DDR.
But will the proposals stick?
There are certainly some little local problems to overcome. In the past, for
example, the independent Bundesbankhas opposed investment trusts being able
to issue money market funds, on the grounds that they undermine its minimum
reserve policy. Ministry officials claim the central bank is coming to
recognise the need for more flexibility in capital markets. Commercial
bankers, meanwhile, say that the Bundesbank has not changed minimum reserve
requirements for years, and that they are obsolete. 'Money market funds are
something the German market has been desperate for,' one said.
A far greater obstacle is likely to be the entrenched opposition in the
Lander to any loss of control over regulation. And since the opposition SPD
governs most of the federal states, and controls the Bundesrat (the upper
house through which all legislation must pass), Mr Waigel is not going to
have an easy time.
The Hesse Land government, for one, is adamant that it will oppose
centralisation. 'We want responsibility for regulating bourses to remain at
state level,' insists one local Finance Ministry official. 'We are not
prepared to enter into any compromise which will reduce our authority.'
But Hesse and the other states have already given much away. They weakened
their hand - probably fatally - in 1990 when they asked the government to
represent federal interests at the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions, the world regulators' club. Mr Waigel also has a powerful and
persuasive ally in the banks, which often have strong regional links. Many
are part-owned by state governments, and are regarded as valued financial
advisers as well as being sources of capital.
It may thus take longer than the 10 months Mr Waigel has given himself to
see his proposals in place, but most of the pointers indicate that
Finanzplatz Deutschland will come into being sometime next year.
Where will that leave the regional stock exchanges. A senior Finance
Ministry official suggests they might keep some functions such as control of
issuing licences to traders and firms. The ministry view is that their
proper job is to act as gateways into capital markets for new flotations, or
as specialists in particular regional industries. 'The regional bourses must
take responsibility for their own competitiveness,' says the ministry paper.
'On the other hand, Finanzplatz Deutschland, if it wants to compete with the
great exchanges of the world, needs a strong, internationally competitive
central bourse (Deutsche Borse AG) at its disposal. In this sense, 'stock
exchange federalism' must be further developed.'
There is, in short, an unmistakeable head of political steam behind the
current reform effort. 'The government's approach is extremely determined
and this speaks for a quick implementation of the proposals,' says Mr
Strenger of DWS. 'The minister is not equivocating, he is saying exactly
what should be done.'

FT  24 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Life policies oversold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPUTE within the Unit Trust Association, which has resulted in the
departure of five of its leading life assurance company members, has been a
clear sign of growing tension within the retail investment services
industry.
The enormous commercial success and political lobbying power of the life
industry is increasingly resented by other competitors. The life companies
tend to respond by suggesting this amounts to sour grapes on the part of
rivals who have failed to market their products so effectively. But they
ought to worry about whether their success has been at the expense of the
financial well-being of too many of their clients.
A survey conducted for the Securities and Investments Board, the investment
watchdog body, has shown that typically about 30 per cent of long-term plans
lapse within two years. This involves heavy losses for those involved, and
is clear evidence of overselling.
Direct sales forces are worse in this respect than independent advisers. In
the category of unit-linked pension plans marketed through direct sales
forces the two-year lapse rate is an alarming 45 per cent.
But the sales campaigns continue at a high pitch. This month, about 700 of
the salesmen of MI Group are moving over to the already existing but almost
unknown Citibank Life. The life industry has become sales-led to a
disturbing degree. No longer do companies look for sales forces, but sales
forces look for companies.
Low quality
It is the industry's oldest cliche that life assurance is sold and not
bought. But the importance of the name and quality of the product has never
been as low as now, and the power of a well-organised sales force never as
high.
Even some of the traditional offices ought to be very worried. Until now,
the life companies have maintained a strong and united lobby in order to
secure the regulatory concessions that could underpin their growth. For
example, when the Financial Services Act was being developed in the
mid-1980s, polarisation was a compromise which enabled life companies to
escape the consequences of poor disclosure to clients and conflicts of
interest among their agents. Salesmen could only sell the products of a
single company, and independent intermediaries had to offer unbiased advice
right across the market place.
In practice, however, this has led to shrinkage of the independent sector,
which has proved especially damaging to unit trust companies: they cannot in
most cases afford to develop other distribution methods, such as sales
forces or direct mail. There are, in addition, potentially serious effects
on many of the mutually-owned life offices which have also been slow to
diversify their distribution.
Tougher stand
The UTA has decided to make a much tougher stand against polarisation and
against poor life company standards of disclosure of commissions and other
costs than it did in the mid-1980s. The recent squeeze on unit trust sales
has concentrated minds.
There is indeed growing concern about not only the costs but also the
suitability of a significant proportion of sales of life contracts. All the
same, the general tone of the UTA's submission to SIB before Christmas may
have been unwisely strident. The accusations were indiscriminate and
inflammatory; in contrast, it may be in the UTA's interests to make common
cause with the more moderate elements in the life industry rather than to
put the life offices in a position that they are forced to defend their
existing selling methods without qualification. Now the UTA, after internal
protests, is being forced to put out a bowdlerised version.
But whatever the detailed compromises the UTA must stick vigorously to its
campaign to release unit trusts from the shackles of polarisation. If the
life companies should protest that this would be unfair, they could be told
that, by improving their standards of disclosure to investors, they could be
freed too. But so long as the overselling of life products continues they
should not expect much sympathy from the regulators.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Cajoling the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DO NOT fret about our rising current account surplus, Japan's Ministry of
Finance has told the world: its recent surge merely reflects 'special'
factors which will ultimately go away. But Japan has got its logic upside
down: the world economy needs Japan's current account surplus to resume its
rising trend; but not in 1992. It is the 'special' slowdown of Japanese
domestic demand, thereby cutting import demand, that is most worrying the
rest of the growth-starved world.
The world will need Japan's current account surplus once economic growth
finally picks up. The contraction of the world's savings pool over the past
decade, alongside a continually rising demand for investment capital, has
forced up world real interest rates.
Only Japan has bucked the trend. Its willingness to save more than it
invests domestically, thereby exporting the surplus, has prevented real
rates from rising further. The corollary of such a capital outflow is a
current account surplus. This surplus has provided a convenient totem for
protectionists in general and troubled US and European multinationals in
particular. But the rest of the world should give three cheers for Japan's
prudence.
Future income
Japan's motives are not purely altruistic. It will have a rapidly ageing
population over the next 30 years. So both individuals and the government
are investing abroad to provide a future income stream. The government has
accumulated a social security fund which now exceeds 50 per cent of Japanese
gross domestic product. The Japanese government has gross debts of more than
60 per cent of GDP, but almost all of them are held by the social security
fund. Overall, the government should be a net creditor by 1994.
Yet last year's rising trade surplus reflects the current slowdown in
Japanese domestic demand rather than any structural rise in its savings
propensities. National savings have risen while imports have slumped,
falling by 14.4 per cent in the year to last November. This Japanese growth
recession is one Japanese export that the rest of the world certainly does
not need. Moreover, the continuing financial squeeze and lack of confidence
among Japan's banks represents a further important source of deflationary
pressures worldwide.
Austere budget
The Japanese government could offset this domestic slowdown by a more active
fiscal policy. But the 1992 budget is typically, if needlessly, austere;
there is ample room for an expansionary supplementary budget package; and
there are many areas in which the government could usefully increase public
investment.
Yet the main threat to growth is the persistently tight stance of Japanese
monetary policy. The Bank of Japan's reluctance to ease policy at more than
a cautious pace is understandable. Its governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, has done
an exceptional job of repairing the damage done by the loose monetary policy
pursued by his predecessor under heavy US pressure. Japan's asset market
bubble has been deflated with, so far, the minimum of disruption to the real
economy.
Yet a renewed bout of asset price inflation is no longer the main threat to
Japan's financial stability, as Mr Mieno must well understand. Confidence is
low, banks do not want to lend, retail sales are sluggish, overtime working
is down, and bankruptcies are rising, especially among heavily-indebted
small and medium sized companies. That share prices are still falling, even
after the collapse of the last two years, reflects this growing sense of
gloom. Little wonder then that monetary growth remains very sluggish.
Against this depressing background, the last thing either Japan, or the
world, needs is persistently high Japanese interest rates aimed at boosting
the value of the yen in a mis-conceived attempt to cut the trade surplus.
What Japan does need is an easier monetary policy, as Mr Mieno will be
(respectfully) informed at this weekend's meeting of officials from the
world's seven largest industrialised countries. He should listen with
'special' attention.

In the second of its three programmes about Billy Wilder, Arena (9.30 BBC2)
covers the making of various movies from Ace In The Hole to Sabrina.
Discussing Sunset Boulevard, Wilder explains that Mae West was the original
choice to play the ageing star of the silent movies, though Gloria Swanson
eventually got the part. At 12.05 BBC2 screens Sunset Boulevard itself, just
about the best Hollywood put-down ever made, matched only by Kenneth Anger's
weird book, Hollywood Babylon, in its readiness to concentrate on the warts
and forget the all. The script is wonderfully acid.
Channel 4 presents the first in another series (the fourth) of Whose Line Is
It Anyway? (10.35) one of the few really different ideas to have turned up
in television light entertainment in 25 years. Once again Clive Anderson
chairs the contest in which entertainers improvise before a studio audience.
Clashing head on with Sunset Boulevard at 12.05 is Monterey Pop (C4), DA
Pennebaker's account of the 1967 International Pop Festival where the
performers included Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, and, in an
extraordinary finale, Ravi Shankar.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: The Gulf Between Us - West Yorkshire Playhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before it opened Trevor Griffiths' new play, which he directs himself,
was sending shockwaves around the north of England: a leading playwright of
the left was being let loose on a war still warm in the public imagination.
That he is the first major playwright to confront the Gulf War on stage says
something about our reluctance to look our recent history in the face. The
fuzzy awkwardness of his response says yet more about the disarray among
left-wing thinkers still struggling to find a new coinage in the ruins of
the old order.
While setting the play in an unnamed war and country, Griffiths makes it
quite clear what and where they are. It opens with the unforgettable image
of the Gulf war: a bomber closing in on its target with view-finders trained
for the much-vaunted surgical strike. Seconds later we are on the
bomb-shattered ground beside the swathed ruins of a mosque with a neat
torpedo hole in both sides.
Billy Ryder (Paul Slack), a cocky British brickie turned entrepreneur, has
been ordered at gunpoint to repair the damage before nightfall. His 'mate'
for the job is a bearded oddball transformed, by an error on his identity
papers, from a gilder into a builder. They are guarded by an innocent called
Ismael, (Akram Telawe) who carries a cellular telephone in one hand and a
machine gun in the other. In the background is the din of rioting women who
believe their children were inside the mosque when it was struck.
This then is a play about the morality of warfare as seen by the people on
the ground: echoes of the infamous bunker tragedy, when sheltering women
were killed at the height of the Gulf War, are too clear for there to be any
serious doubt that the children will turn out to have died. One awaits the
impassioned lecture about wasted life and US imperialism, which is dutifully
delivered by the woman doctor who discovers the corpses deep into the second
act.
Yet instead of using the incident to score propaganda points, the Arab
authorities are uncharacteristically bent on a cover-up. This is the
plotting twist that enables Griffiths to establish his position. He is not
simply banging the drum of East against West but of footsoldiers and
civilians against the war machine, whether operated by bungling local
officers or cynical long-range decision-makers.
Old-fashioned Marxist historical analysis is softened and refracted by the
introduction of what Griffiths himself calls a 'magic realism', centred on
the figures of O'Toole and a wacky Asian youth who turns out to be his
apprentice. Dave Hill, tall, bearded and studiedly ambiguous, plays O'Toole
like an Old Testament seer whose identity baffles the touchingly prosaic
Billy and Ismael, turning their naive preconceptions to the sort of
subversive social comedy at which Griffiths excels.
When isolated in a spot of orange light O'Toole becomes a prophetic
story-teller, urging us to learn the lessons of history; moving forward into
the plot, he acts as a deliberate spoiler, smashing a brick down on Billy's
hand to prevent him completing the mosque wall before its message is clear.
Like so much in this play he is a fascinating and flawed figure,
representing a wholly admirable desire to escape the shackles of polemical
theatre, but in doing so, allowing the focus to become fuzzy and the impact
dissipated. At worst he is a device for evading the underlying issues of the
conflict: its economic imperatives, its religious trappings. A complicated,
and ongoing, political mess is sentimentalised into a simplistic fable about
the inevitable sacrifice of innocent lives in war.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: Tallis Scholars - St John's, Smith Square
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The elderly lady with whom I attended this concert remarkably heard her
first Palestrina Mass at Brompton Oratory in 1913. At that time, as she
remarked, it would have been unthinkable to predict the sort of public
following in this area now enjoyed by the Tallis Scholars following their
television profile on The South Bank Show.
For this appearance the choir had attracted a capacity audience (not perhaps
surprising when Allegri's Miserere was on the programme). More telling was
the attentiveness with which people listened. Apparently it is the composers
of the Italian renaissance, rather than their English contemporaries, who
draw the crowds when the Tallis Scholars are on tour, for example in Japan,
and Palestrina and Gesualdo helped fill St John's on Wednesday.
When one considers the continual turnover of personnel in chamber choirs,
the Tallis Scholars have maintained an unusually distinctive style. For this
the firm and scholarly direction of their founder, Peter Phillips, must be
the main cause. He leads a choir of a dozen singers, a little smaller in
size than some comparable groups, and draws from them a bright sound, almost
astringent when he wants it to be, which gives a cutting edge to words and
rhythms.
It is a style of early music singing that focusses keenly upon essentials.
In Palestrina's Missa Ut re mi fa sol la, an interesting mass to hear as its
cantus-firmus (the music's central building-block) simply runs up the scale
defined in its title, each of the various sections was neatly
differentiated. The flowing lines of the 'Sanctus', for example, achieved a
contrast of mood without recourse to exaggeration.
It may be that the Tallis Scholars' way with the music would have sounded
consciously interpreted in Palestrina's day, but it is effective and
reasonably economical according to today's understanding on such matters. A
group of four of Gesualdo's Tenebrae responsories caught well the unsettling
quirkiness of that composer's music. The Allegri was made the more effective
by placing a quartet of singers away from the main body in a rear gallery.
In every item the standard of choral singing per se was exceptionally high.
Whether it is the increasing popularity of early music that has brought
forward performers of this quality or the performers that have attracted the
audiences, it is impossible to say. Either way the spread of knowledge and
enjoyment in this music proceeds apace.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: English Heritage reveals the need to shore up rotten
wood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jocelyn Stevens has already warned that he regards the staff of English
Heritage as so much dead wood that he will axe vigorously when he takes over
as chairman in April. But a report produced by EH suggests that much of his
formidable energy will be best spent shoring up the rotten wood in many of
England's 500,000 listed buildings.
A comprehensive report from English Heritage reveals that over seven per
cent of the listed buildings in the country are at risk, while another 14.6
per cent are in a vulnerable condition, making over 100,000 structures
giving cause for concern. Listed buildings are given protection from
demolition, but not from neglect, and the state of many, especially those in
remote areas, left vacant and of no practical use, such as windmills,
chapels, follies, barns, warehouses, etc. is causing concern.
Around two per cent of the building stock of England is listed, but this
only protects it from demolition or drastic alteration: not from being left
to decay. That is perhaps the main significance of the Buildings at Risk
survey: it highlights a problem, and, ideally, prods local authorities into
taking action.
What makes matters worse is that, in actual numbers, most of the buildings
causing concern are 'domestic', which, if lived in, could be brought up to
scratch. Once they are left to deteriorate repair becomes costly. The fact
that two thirds of the buildings at risk are not in conservation areas (a
half of all listed buildings nestle in such protective covering) probably
accounts for the lack of concern for them.
The report is good at highlighting the problem but poor at coming up with
solutions. It points out that at greatest risk are Grade II buildings.
Legislation is needed to extend financial aid to these, especially those not
in conservation areas.
The cheap solution would be to require owners of listed buildings to accept
responsibility for them, with local authorities not offering money for
repairs but threatening to wield the legislative stick of enforced
renovation.
The survey produces few surprises and few solutions. Perhaps Jocelyn Stevens
will provide the drive to put pressure on the Government to take the slow
deterioration of the nation's building heritage more seriously. One hopes he
will spend less time in alienating personnel and concentrate his energies on
unlocking the legislation, and the money, needed to preserve the commonplace
physical legacies of our history.

DISGRUNTLED parents, who find that the toys they bought at Christmas have
either been discarded or have turned into an obsession, may prefer to join
the growing number of consumers who have turned to electronic learning aids.
Stimulated by the national fixation for electronic games, the UK market for
such learning aids has doubled in three years, according to a report from
the Economist Intelligence Unit. Nevertheless, with the market for 1991
valued at Pounds 23m, the market is still tiny compared with the Pounds 325m
market for electronic games.
More than half the products sold in the sector are for five- to
ten-year-olds, according to the Retail Business report. The largest
suppliers in the UK are VTech, Adams Leisure/Grandstand and Texas
Instruments.
Although the report predicts the market will grow by 20 per cent a year, the
authors believe the sector needs a 'blockbuster' product to project learning
aids into the mainstream toy market. This may not happen until 1995.

MANY hospital management information systems have been based on large
centralised computer systems, which can prove unwieldly and expensive. But
software now under development that runs on personal computers, using a
client-server architecture, could help reduce the costs.
Devised by Meta Generics, of Cambridge, for King's Healthcare (formerly
Camberwell Health Authority), in London, the HS2000 system uses standard
operating systems such as Dos and Unix as well as off-the-shelf hardware.
As a result, systems can be put together for either large or small
hospitals, and expanded as required to enable doctors, nurses and
administrative staff to work from one information base.
A further advantage of HS2000, which will be marketed by Sema, of Cambridge,
is that graphical user interfaces and a mouse enable staff to manipulate
visual information - moving a patient from intensive care, say, to a general
ward.

<TEXT>
A POLYMER suited to the agricultural, construction and automotive industries
can now be produced from mixed industrial or domestic plastic waste in a
single step, writes Paul Godden.
The homomicronisation process, developed by the Swiss company,
NewPlast-Process, of Geneva, uses roughly-washed, mixed waste, which can
even include impurities like rubber and copper. Because of this the NewPlast
polymer costs SFr .50/kg (10p/kg) compared with SFr 1.20/kg for virgin
polyethylene. It is also less expensive than most recycled plastics where
the waste has to be sorted to ensure that polymers are not mixed.
The process 'stirs' the dry waste granules at high speed in a special steel
drum, at ambient temperature, with a specially designed rotor. The resultant
friction causes the materials to polymerise and form a homogenous mass. This
mass is treated by conventional machinery to produce pellets suitable for
subsequent processing.

The 100mm x 30mm panel mounted with the LEDs slides 50mm back and forth at a

SUPERCOMPUTERS, traditionally restricted to research laboratories and

bigger than today's file servers.
The desk-side unit, just 29 inches high, has been developed by Wavetracer,
of Acton, Massachusetts. The two Zephyr models have 4,096 or 8,192
microprocessors, so the larger machine can process more than 8,000 streams
of data in parallel. (Traditional serial computers can only process one
stream of data at a time.)
The company says that in tests by the US Department of Defence the more
powerful model, the Model 8, was capable of computing more than 700m
operations per second. Although less than half the speed of a Cray
supercomputer, Wavetracer points out that at Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 84,000)
the Zephyr is just a fraction of the price. The machines are sold in the UK

FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology: Electronic standards join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's leading reinsurers have agreed to work together to establish
international standards for electronic data interchange and messaging.
The development of standards will allow users in one market to communicate
more easily with those in another, thereby accelerating the development of
electronic trading internationally.
Systems allowing insurance brokers (who operate on behalf of buyers) to
contract business and process claims electronically are already used in
London and Europe.
The London Insurance Market Network (Limnet), the product of a joint effort
by Lloyd's of London, London brokers and companies, was launched in 1987. In
spite of some delays a pilot electronic trading scheme involving two dozen
Lloyd's agencies and brokers will begin in April.
The Reinsurance and Insurance Network, Rinet, set up by eight major European
reinsurance companies including the German and Swiss giants, Munich Re and
Swiss Re, was launched later that year.
The joint approach will allow underwriters and brokers who have access to
either system to trade across both. According to Michael Seddon of Limnet
the move has been partially brought about by pressure from the US market.
Representatives from Limnet and Rinet visited the US last year. 'The
Americans said separate developments didn't make sense. They were
instrumental in bringing us together,' said Seddon.
Two US organisations, the Reinsurance Market Association and the Reinsurance
Association of America, will back the joint initiative.
Seddon says Limnet and Rinet have developed their work along slightly
separate lines and that some rework will be involved. But the need for
compromise is accepted.
He adds that the decision to harmonise standards has been taken just in
time. In a couple of years 'we'd have been looking at translation of
standards rather than the development of a common standard'.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology: Conflict of man and machine - How the Airbus
A320 fly-by-wire system takes control away from pilots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aircraft falling out of the sky are bad for confidence. They worry
passengers, regulators, airlines, aircraft makers and governments.
In the case of the Airbus A320 which ploughed into the snowy, forested
Vosges mountains last Monday night, the aircraft's ultra-modern control
technology has been the subject of fierce debate.
This is because the same model of aircraft has crashed three times in its
four-year history and because the controls which the pilots use are unique
to this particular commercial passenger aircraft.
They are computerised controls, sometimes known as fly-by-wire.
'Probably the worst name for them,' says Freddy Yetman of the British
Airline Pilots Association. Wires and levers are what controlled the
aircraft at the time of the first world war, he explains.
The A320 still uses the hydraulics that have been standard in passenger
aircraft for decades. In order to increase safety, however, it adds
computers between the pilot and the hydraulic motors. The computerised
controls in the A320 stop the pilot from stalling the plane, for example.
An A320 pilot uses a joystick like one in a computer game. When the lever is
pulled back, the computer is signalled to operate movable parts on the wing
and tail to turn the nose of the aircraft up.
If the pilot pulls back on the joystick and tries to stall, the computer
calculates the angle at which this would happen and stops the nose rising
just before this point.
It is here that many criticisms of computerised controls are voiced. 'There
is a danger of over-confidence if the pilot is left out of the control
loop,' concedes an executive at one aircraft manufacturer.
Airbus says that the computers in the A320 can be switched off to give the
pilot direct control over the aircraft. But is switching off the computers
uppermost in a pilot's mind in an emergency?
'Some pilots think it (computerised control) is complicated if anything
unusual happens,' says Yetman.
The next generation of aircraft, exemplified by the Boeing 777, takes a
different approach from Airbus. It has a more traditional cockpit in which
control wheels, rather than a joystick, control the aircraft.
These control wheels are linked to each other so that pilot and co-pilot can
see and feel what the other is doing. When the pilot moves one control
wheel, the other wiggles in sympathy.
On a more sophisticated level, the computer will not simply override the
pilot's decision if it calculates a manoeuvre to be unsafe. Instead, it
resists it. The control wheels have motors in them that make turning them
progressively more difficult if the manoeuvre is extreme. 'So the pilot can
bend the wings if he thinks that is better than the alternative,' explains
Boeing.
Other advances include liquid crystals displays in the cockpit instead of
ordinary television screens (which were in themselves an advance over
dials).
The 777 and the A320 are not directly comparable, however, because the
Boeing carries more than twice as many passengers and is almost a decade
newer in design.
The origins of the control technology in both aircraft is more than 20 years
old. It was developed by the defence industry in an effort to create a more
manoeuvrable fighter aircraft. Defence designers wanted to build something
that was inherently unstable.
Rather like a pencil balanced on your fingertip, such an aircraft can move
quickly in any direction. But no human pilot could react fast enough to keep
control, let alone shoot at an enemy. Computers, however, were fast enough
to make rapid small adjustments to keep the aircraft flying. By distancing
the pilot from the controls, the performance of the aircraft was improved.
In the case of a civil airliner, the priority is not manoeuvrability but
safety.
In spite of this emphasis the aircraft has crashed three times, although
inquiries into the first two accidents blamed pilot error. So what is the
solution to the problem?
Better training is one possibility. After the A320 crash in India in 1990,
Airbus contacted its customers to remind them of the landing procedures.
In the UK, A320 pilots do a ground school, simulator course and are tested
by examiners authorised by the CAA. Then follows a series of flights with
training crews before pilots are authorised to fly. They have to return to
the simulator every six months to renew their authorisation.
Training standards are set by individual countries' civil aviation
authorities, subject to international minimum if the flight is
international.
There are more than 250 A320 flying today with 26 airlines. Another 550 have
been ordered. The Boeing 777 enters service in 1995. More than 90 have been
ordered already.
Computerised controls seem here to stay and the powers in the world of
aviation are stacked up behind them. Regulatory bodies have certified them,
accident inquiries have blamed the pilots and still the pilots 'find it a
fine aircraft to fly,' says Yetman.
Much more evidence yet will have to be amassed against the the A320 if the
aircraft is to be found guilty through criticisms of its fly-by-wire
controls.

FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): New rules governing use of VDUs
criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH and safety rules covering an estimated 7m workers who use visual
display units (VDUs) launched yesterday immediately came under attack from
trade unions and environmental health officers.
Unions claimed that the new rules provided too many loopholes for employers
and failed to meet the requirements of a European Community directive.
At the same time, the Institution of Environmental Health Officers warned
that the new regulations might lead to safety inspectors spending too much
time visiting offices and neglecting more dangerous premises.
The new rules, which are published in a consultation document by the Health
and Safety Executive, cover the design of desks and chairs, as well as the
provision of work breaks and eye tests for workers who use VDUs.
The TUC warned that the proposed regulations would not meet EC standards. Mr
Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union and chairman
of the TUC's health and safety committee, said the TUC would be lobbying
unions throughout the EC on the issue.
Mr Tuffin is also a commissioner on the Health and Safety Commission.
Unions claim that thousands of VDU workers will be excluded from the
regulations because the definition of a regular user has been too narrowly
defined. They also say that the proposals would not entitle all VDU workers
to a full eye test.
The Institution of Environmental Health Officers said it was concerned that
office workers would become anxious as a result of the new rules. That would
mean greater pressure on environmental health officers to respond to queries
and complaints, taking away resources from high-risk premises.

British Printing Industries Federation to reverse a previous decision to
stop being a managing agent for Youth Training.
They include arrangements for more of the monitoring visits of YT schemes to
be done by a central unit and fewer by Tecs. The department said the
initiative did not put the Tecs' right to negotiate individual contracts
with providers in jeopardy.
The federation and several large companies announced that they would
withdraw from YT last year because of the burden of negotiating locally with
the 82 Tecs in England and Wales and 22 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs),
their equivalent in Scotland. Midland Bank and Mothercare have withdrawn for
similar reasons. Only the federation has said it will reverse its decision.
A conference between Tecs and national providers of training will be held on
Tuesday where the changes will be discussed. Mr Robert Jackson, employment
minister, who has been in discussions the providers about the issue will
attend the conference.
A number of changes will be announced. They include:
Standardising the monitoring of quality standards. Although quality criteria
are standard, Tecs have done their own monitoring. Providing a contracting
forum at a convened conference to be held in this month.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure from SNP over steel - News
in brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONALISATION is not the answer to the proposed closure of the Ravenscraig
steel works, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday, as
he introduced a motion condemning British Steel's repeated failure to
'support and invest in' its Scottish plants, David Owen writes.
Instead, the option of finding a buyer for the plant should be kept open as
long as possible although the chances were slim, he said.
His remarks followed a Scottish National Party assertion that 'public
ownership of steel' in the Scottish economy was needed. 'It is unacceptable
that Scotland should face a future without a steel industry,' said Mr Jim
Sillars, SNP deputy leader.
The government formally applied to the European Commission yesterday to
create an enterprise zone in Lanarkshire in order to offset the impact of
closing the Ravenscraig works.
Last night's debate also followed a government move to shift attention to
more favourable news for the region by announcing that a contract for three
Type 23 frigates had been won by Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde.
The announcement was welcomed by MPs on all sides of the House. Mr George
Galloway (Lab Glasgow Hillhead) advocated naming the vessels Stewart, Lang
and Forsyth in honour of three ministers who, he said, were unlikely to be
much longer in office.
SUNDAY TRADING: Directors of supermarket chains and not local managers
should be the target of any future prosecutions for breaches of the Sunday
trading laws, Mr David Harris (C St Ives) suggested in the Commons
yesterday.
Mrs Angela Rumbold, home office minister, acknowledged cross-party support
for a private member's bill to prevent deregulation of Sunday trading in
England and Wales.
She maintained that it would be 'foolish' to proceed with fresh legislation
before a pending European Court of Justice ruling.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Call for new R&amp;D audit rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEFINITION of research-and-development expenditure in company accounts
should be revised to make it more relevant to contemporary business, the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants has recommended.
Companies are already required to disclose research-and-development (R&amp;D)
expenditure under SSAP 13, an existing accounting standard, and may soon be
required to provide details of other spending that influences future growth.
The institute says in a submission to the Accounting Standards Board (ASB)
that R&amp;D is defined too much in scientific terms, rather than in a way
applicable to most businesses, and so the figure is not taken seriously by
managers.
It neglects types of investment common in service companies, including
expenditure on developing computer software, innovation and training.
The ASB is expected to release a reporting standard in the autumn that will
include recommendations on R&amp;D and other 'revenue expenditure'.

FT  24 JAN 92 / P&amp;O stirs up cross-Channel route dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S two biggest ferry operators yesterday looked poised for a bitter
battle over the future of the Dover-Calais route, the shortest and busiest
cross-Channel link between Britain and France.
P&amp;O appeared to be staking a claim to the route by announcing that it was
seeking a 'rationalisation' of the two ferry companies' operations on the
crossing in preparation for the opening of the Channel tunnel in 1993.
Sealink Stena Line, P&amp;O's troubled rival, said it was rebuilding its
strength after a recent cost restructuring. 'We are not going to go away,'
the company said.
P&amp;O signalled its move in a letter to the Office of Fair Trading in which it
sought to be released from undertakings not to combine operations with other
ferry companies on the Dover-Calais route.
Ferry operators believe they will be able to compete with the Channel tunnel
only by joining forces and offering a single, high-frequency service between
Dover and Calais.
When the ferry companies last made a joint submission, in 1989, Mr Nicholas
Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, invited them to re-submit their
application closer to the tunnel's opening.
P&amp;O has approached the OFT alone, avoiding any mention of joint services in
its submission, and instead repeatedly emphasising the need for
'rationalisation' of the short sea routes.
It has offered to hold all 1993 passenger fares at this year's levels and
all freight tariffs at this year's levels adjusted for inflation if its
application succeeds.
Lord Sterling, P&amp;O's chairman, refused to say what form he expected any
rationalisation to take. He said the purpose of the application was to give
the company the freedom to enter negotiations and discussions.
Sealink, which has suffered severe financial difficulties since being taken
over by Stena Line of Sweden, said it was not prepared to enter negotiations
until the benefits of its recently completed cost restructuring had been
given time to show through.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Enterprise zones win tax-break extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INLAND Revenue ruling has enabled 100 per cent capital allowances in
Britain's enterprise zones to be extended, in special circumstances, by 10
years beyond the life of the zone.
The allowances are disliked by the government and the European Commission
because they distort markets and encourage tax avoidance, but the difficulty
was supposed to be limited to the zones' 10-year lifespan.
The first use of the extended tax break will be in Trafford Park, Greater
Manchester, where it is hoped to salvage part of a flagship project of the
park's development corporation. The project was halted by the effect of the
sharp decline of London commercial property values on its developer,
Rosehaugh.
The corporation, which is a government agency, yesterday relaunched its
Wharfside project along the mainly derelict south bank of Manchester Ship
Canal, opposite the successful Salford Quays.
Now a less ambitious scheme is going ahead with Amec, the Cheshire-based
civil engineering, contracting and property development group.
The Revenue ruling states that if a building contract is awarded on
enterprise-zone land before the zone's life expires, the 100 per cent
capital allowances can be applied to any building started within 10 years of
the contract date.
In the Trafford Park case, the development corporation contracted to sell
the land involved to Amec Properties, which in turn signed a building
contract with Fairclough, another member of the Amec group. The contracts
were signed last August, just before expiry of the enterprise zone.
The Revenue confirmed on December 17 that anything Amec now builds on the
land will enjoy 100 per cent capital allowances. That means that a company
with a tax obligation can buy a building there and pay 35 per cent of the
costs out of its taxes.
The Manchester Ship Canal company, which owns land in the former zone, is
also understood to have agreed a building contract on it before the zone
expired to protect future capital allowances. Other developers in expiring
and extant enterprise zones around the country are believed to have followed
suit.

FT  24 JAN 92 / PowerGen to build coal import facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, yesterday proved it was serious about
replacing the coal it buys from British Coal with cheaper imports by
announcing an outlay of Pounds 40m on a new 5m-tonne coal terminal in
Liverpool.
The announcement will add to the uncertainty over the future size of British
Coal now the electricity industry is privatised. British Coal supplies
PowerGen with 26.4m tonnes, falling to 24.6m tonnes in the year to March
1993, and National Power with 44m tonnes, falling to 40m tonnes.
The terminal, which will be designed and built by NEI Clarke Chapman on the
Gladstone Dock, leased by the Mersey Dock and Harbour Company to PowerGen,
is expected to be operating by late next year.
'This will allow PowerGen to withdraw their Fiddlers' Ferry power station
(in Warrington, Cheshire) completely from the UK market,' said Mr Gerard
McCloskey, of the newsletter International Coal Report. He said that
PowerGen was also beginning to squeeze British Coal further by selling
imported coal to industrial customers in competition with British Coal.
National Power, the other large generator, was doing likewise.
British Coal has argued in the past that the two generators were bluffing
about their ability to import coal without pushing the price up - but in
Commons Energy Committee meetings earlier this week National Power
reaffirmed that it planned to be in a position to import half its coal by
the mid 90s. PowerGen said it did not believe that would push prices up, as
there was plenty of spare coal produced worldwide.
PowerGen can already import 5m tonnes to its Kingsnorth power station on the
Thames, and has a joint venture with National Power and Associated British
Ports to build a 10m-tonne terminal at Immingham on the Humber. National
Power is developing two 3m-tonne terminals at Hull and on the Tees, and a
5m-tonne terminal at Bristol.
The two generators' plans to replace British coal with orimulsion, a
bitumen-based fuel, still face strong environmental opposition.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Bidding for Scots pit may reopen

<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL said yesterday it did not rule out reopening talks with
Caledonian Mining, the unsuccessful bidder in the competition for leasing
the Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh, James Buxton writes.
That follows a report that Monktonhall Mineworkers, a company formed by
redundant mineworkers and managers, had yet to complete its business plan
and secure finance.
British Coal said that it would 'explore all credible alternatives' before
taking a final decision, although discussions with Monktonhall Mineworkers
were continuing, with no scheduled completion date.
British Coal said just before Christmas that it would negotiate leasing the
colliery with Monktonhall Mineworkers, rejecting the bid from Caledonian
Mining, the privately owned mining equipment company. It did so on the
recommendation of the consultants Wardell Armstrong.
Mr Ben Mason, managing director of Caledonian, said it was still interested
in leasing the pit, the first British Coal has offered to lease.

FT  24 JAN 92 / US considers big cuts in land and sea missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is considering deep new cuts in multiple-warhead missiles based on
land and at sea, in an effort to prompt similar reductions by the four
nuclear-armed former Soviet republics, led by Russia.
President George Bush may announce his plan to cut the core of the US
nuclear force in his State of the Union address to Congress next week, the
launch-pad for his re-election campaign this year, US officials yesterday.
The latest US proposals reflect rising concern over the collapse of the
former Soviet Union, the risks of nuclear proliferation, and the desire to
encourage the republics to preserve central command and control of their
arsenal of 27,000 nuclear warheads.
The New York Times reported yesterday that the White House and the Defence
Department are drawing up plans to cut or eliminate multi-warhead long-range
missiles, including the land-based MX and the older Minuteman. Some of the
cuts would be unilateral; others would depend on the response of Russia,
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, the nuclear-armed republics.
It was unclear yesterday whether Mr Bush intends to make concessions on
sea-based multi-warhead strategic missiles, an area where the US has
jealously guarded its technological superiority. One complicating factor is
that a US offer could put pressure on the British and French governments to
place their own nuclear systems on the bargaining table.
If Mr Bush agrees to cut the Trident I and newer Trident II missiles, 'it
would be a dramatic move,' said one US official yesterday.
Last September, Mr Bush announced a combination of unilateral reductions and
proposals for negotiated reductions in the air, sea and land-based US
nuclear arsenal. Hailed at the time as dramatic, the US offer risks being
overtaken by the collapse of Soviet military power and the virtual
disappearance of the Soviet threat.
In testimony to Congress this week, two top intelligence officials,
including Mr Robert Gates, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, said
Russia was drastically cutting defence spending and posed virtually no
threat to the US. Russian military procurement in the first quarter was
expected to drop by 80 per cent, the officials said.
The nuclear cuts under consideration were first mooted by Mr James Baker, US
Secretary of State, during a visit to the former Soviet Union at the end of
last year. He is due to visit Moscow early next week, when Mr Bush is to
give his State of the Union address.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Summit call for more UN assertiveness likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD leaders due to attend the first UN Security Council summit in New York
at the end of this month are expected to call for a much more active UN
peace-keeping and peace-making role in world affairs.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new UN secretary-general, is to be asked to
recommend to the council, by May 1, new ways to identify potential conflicts
and to make suggestions on the additional resources the UN will require for
strengthening its so-called 'preventive diplomacy'.
'The world now has the best chance for peace, security and development since
the foundation of the UN,' a draft statement drawn up by Britain, which
holds the rotating presidency of the council, states.
The UN charter specifically prohibits interference in a state's internal
affairs but that clause has been interpreted less strictly in recent years.
The draft notes that the range of UN peace-keeping tasks had been broadened
considerably in recent years, and that the monitoring of elections and human
rights had become 'integral parts of a wider effort to maintain
international peace and security'.
The final statement is expected to be in the form of a presidential text to
be read out by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, who invited the other
security council members to the meeting.
Among those who have accepted Mr Major's invitation are US President George
Bush, French President Francois Mitterrand, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng, all from permanent members of the
security council.

<TEXT>
MEXICO received Dollars 15.02bn in new foreign investment last year, a 54
per cent increase on 1990, according to figures calculated by the Monterrey
newspaper, El Norte, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The figures are difficult to calculate because of the need to distinguish
between new investment and appreciation on existing investment. But El Norte
estimates that Mexico's capital markets received two-thirds of the flow of
new investment in 1991 - Dollars 5.64bn on the stock exchange, Dollars
3.41bn in Mexican government paper, and Dollars 2.15bn in internationally
issued bonds. The government also granted permission for a further Dollars
3.8bn in direct foreign investment.
Thus, about 60 per cent of the new foreign investment is volatile, in that
it can be withdrawn at short notice.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Scandals bring bad start to the year for Miyazawa: Japan's
PM could come under fire from his party
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, will run into a barrage of
criticism from MPs after the Diet assembles today for its first session of
1992.
Top of the government's agenda is securing the smooth passage of the budget
for the financial year starting in April. The bill includes plans for
increased public works spending, which Mr Miyazawa promised Mr George Bush
during the US president's recent visit to Japan.
But Mr Miyazawa will be under pressure from opposition parties to give
priority to debate over a financial scandal involving Mr Fumio Abe, a former
minister and close associate of the prime minister, who is under arrest on
suspicion of taking bribes.
Opposition MPs may also demand an inquiry into a separate affair concerning
payments made to politicians by Sagawa Kyubin, a transport group under
investigation for alleged links with gangster-owned companies.
Both the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the opposition will be
manoeuvring with one event on their minds - the election in July for the
upper house of the Diet. The LDP has a majority in the lower house but not
in the upper house, where it lost control in 1989 at the height of the
Recruit bribery scandal.
In extremis, the LDP could call an election of the lower house at the same
time, since the ruling party tends to fare better in double elections. But
party leaders will be loath to do this because lower house elections swallow
large amounts of campaign funds.
Mr Miyazawa is in an awkward position. Because of the LDP's lack of a
majority in the upper house, he has to seek a compromise with the opposition
parties. But for all his renowned intelligence, he is poor at backroom
politicking, and his personal support in the LDP is weak; so, if he does
badly, he may find himself under attack from snipers in his own party. There
are already suggestions floating around Nagatacho, Tokyo's political
district, that the prime minister should resign.
The matter of Mr Abe makes things much worse. Mr Abe is suspected of
accepting Y80bn (Pounds 350m) in political donations from Kyowa, a
steelframe maker turned property developer, in return for leaking road
planning information during his stint as director general of the Hokkaido
Development Agency in 1989.
Mr Abe was, until a month ago, Mr Miyazawa's faction manager. How close the
two men were is a matter of speculation and the opposition parties want to
question Mr Miyazawa as soon as possible.
The Sagawa Kyubin affair is a more difficult target for the opposition
because details have yet to be made public and because opposition MPs are
among those suspected to have received money from the scandal-hit company.
Mr Miyazawa's planned response to questions about political financing is to
introduce a fund-raising reform bill which would force politicians to
disclose more information about their sources of money. However, opposition
parties do not see the plan as a substitute to probing current scandals.
Besides, MPs from all parties are in little hurry to enact a law which might
reduce the flow of donations.
Even if the prime minister safely negotiates the quicksands of scandal he
could be swamped by the difficulties of the other bills before the Diet. The
opposition Social Democratic party (the former Japan Socialist party) wants
cuts in proposed defence spending.
Opposition parties also have serious doubts about a controversial bill
authorising the despatch of Japanese troops overseas on United Nations
peacekeeping missions.
The government will come under further fire over Japan's position in the
Uruguay Round of the Gatt trade talks. MPs of all parties are likely to
press the government for assurances that it will not lift the ban on rice
imports.
Mr Miyazawa's position was strengthened this month when Mr Shin Kanemaru,
LDP elder statesman, became party vice president at Mr Miyazawa's request.
But it seems unlikely that Mr Kanemaru will be standing close to the prime
minister when Mr Miyazawa comes under fire in the Diet. The next few weeks
could be a lonely time for Mr Miyazawa.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Algerian economic rescue plan drawn up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Algerian government has drawn up an emergency plan to revive the
economy, channelling funds into industry, public works projects and housing.
The authorities have had to draw down on precious resources and stimulate
growth faster than originally intended in order to satisfy the disaffected
electorate, half of whom voted for the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the
recently annulled elections.
Economic recovery is regarded by senior officials as a central element in
retaining social stability and drawing support away from the FIS. The FIS is
credited with having drawn much of its support from cities, where youth
unemployment is more than 25 per cent and the housing shortage is acute.
To increase stagnant output and boost social spending, the government will
raise imports from Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 4.2bn) to Dollars 9bn. Of this,
Dollars 200m will be added to last year's food import bill of Dollars 1.7bn.
Imports of intermediate goods for industry will increase from Dollars 2.6bn
to Dollars 3.2bn.
The authorities want to streamline bureaucratic procedures blocking the use
of multilateral credits, some dating from the early 1980s.
The plan, expected to be announced by the weekend, is operating with tight
constraints imposed by the country's heavy burden of debt service and scarce
foreign reserves. The authorities are counting on a reduction in the annual
cost of servicing medium- and long-term debt from Dollars 9.3bn last year to
Dollars 7.6bn.
Essential to this calculation is the completion of the Dollars 1.5bn
refinancing package with the commercial banks, under negotiation for 18
months. The completion of this refinancing was being held up by Bankers
Trust before elections in the second round of Algeria's first multi-party
elections were annulled.
The US bank is understood to have bought some Dollars 56m worth of Algerian
paper on the secondary market and is unhappy to see the redemption date of
this paper pushed back - inevitable if the refinancing package goes through.
However, Algerian authorities are concerned that political uncertainties
could now influence other banks and so delay the arrival of funds. The
outcome of these negotiations could affect further disbursements of the EC's
Ecu400m (Pounds 285.2m) loan and in turn condition the government's attitude
towards Dollars 23.5bn foreign debt as a whole.
Until now successive governments have been adamant in their refusal to
contemplate rescheduling or default.
Even with this assistance, the debt burden will account for more than 60 per
cent of the Dollars 11.3bn income anticipated from 1992 sales of oil, gas,
condensates and refined products.
For the basket of these four items, the Finance Ministry has calculated an
average price equivalent to Dollars 21 a barrel, and income from
hydrocarbons sales will be down Dollars 1bn overall on 1991.
Net hard currency reserves stand at Dollars 1bn, plus Dollars 2bn in gold
which previous governments have refused to touch.
Another key to the emergency plan will be the attitude of international oil
companies to the two-month-old amendments to the 1986 hydrocarbons law which
allowed foreign companies to enter joint ventures in already developed
oilfields. Some 20 companies have expressed an interest and their
participation would immediately inject much-needed hard cash.

<TEXT>
THREE members of an advance party of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata
Party's ekta yatra (unity tour) were killed yesterday in an attack by Sikh
militants while they were going through Punjab en route to Srinagar, capital
of Kashmir. Three people were killed and seven injured when the militants
fired at them from cars.
The ekta yatra is led by Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, the president of the BJP.
It is made up of a caravan of buses and other vehicles that has been through
12 states in the last 45 days and has been stressing the dangers of
terrorism and separatism and to promote what he calls the unity of India
under its Hindu culture. Critics have called the march a provocation for
India's minorities, and the government has expressed fears it could ignite
religious riots in this volatile nation.
The caravan is scheduled to reach Srinagar on Sunday, India's Republic Day,
when the BJP plans to defy the Sikh militants demanding independence and
hoist the national flag.
Before he left New Delhi yesterday, Mr Joshi was warned by Mr S B Chavan,
the minister for home affairs, that he would be travelling through territory
in which militants both in Punjab and Kashmir are active. Mr Chavan asked
him to reduce the size of the 210-vehicle caravan since he was unable to

their respective states, have publicly vowed to attack the caravan and to
kill Mr Joshi.
Mr Joshi will be travelling through Punjab today and the militants' attack
on an advance party of the caravan has raised fears that the BJP president
and his party will also be attacked.
Even more dangerous is the Jammu to Srinagar road which the caravan will
negotiate in the next two or three days.

FT  24 JAN 92 / S African parliament on sidelines

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S race-based parliament, which begins sitting today in Cape
Town, is rapidly becoming irrelevant to the business of government.
If the African National Congress (ANC) has its way, over 50,000 people will
parade through the streets of Cape Town today to demand its dissolution.
They need hardly bother.
For as South Africa advances towards a power-sharing interim government,
parliament has, in effect, been sidelined. Legislation aimed at putting a
multi-racial government in place will be drawn up at the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party negotiation forum which is
becoming the focus of real power in South Africa.
Indeed, parliament plans to sit only three days a week this year to allow
MPs more time to attend Codesa, which is charged with negotiating the
dissolution of the parliament itself. The current tricameral parliament
includes whites, coloureds and Indians but excludes blacks.
Not surprisingly, today's ceremonial opening of parliament is likely to
reflect the institution's diminished status. Previously, President F W de
Klerk has chosen the opening to announce reforms which have changed the
course of South African history: in 1990, the legalisation of black
political opposition and last year the abolition of apartheid's bed-rock
legislation, the Population Registration Act.
His aides say he will make no such leap forward in today's speech.
He is expected to stress the achievements of the National party government
elected in September 1989: South Africa's return to international sport, the
normalisation of international diplomatic and trade relations and the
limited return to international capital markets.
Mr de Klerk will no doubt hope to boost the morale of whites, shaken by a
three-year recession, sharply rising crime and uncertainty about the
political future. In the next 12 months, he is likely to seek white support
in a referendum: they will be asked to approve the creation of a
multi-racial interim government.
Privately, Nationalist officials and ministers fear Mr de Klerk may lose
such a referendum, given the depth of white fear and opposition to reform -
which has recently prompted a series of bombs at multi-racial schools and
other public buildings. Much depends on what form of power-sharing is
offered to whites: Mr de Klerk has said he will bring blacks into parliament
and the cabinet to form a government of national unity to serve for five
years or more - but so far the ANC has rejected this.
None the less, the momentum towards interim government seems stronger by the
day. Real negotiations on the issue will only begin at Codesa early next
month. However difficult they may prove, it seems likely that this year's
session of parliament will be the last to exclude blacks.
Mr de Klerk is expected to visit London and other European capitals early
next month. While in Britain he is expected to attend the England-Ireland
rugby match at Twickenham as a guest of Mr John Major, the prime minister.

FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Boeing takes tougher line in Airbus
subsidy row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Frank Shrontz, chairman of US aircraft manufacturer Boeing, yesterday
launched his most comprehensive attack yet on alleged government subsidies
to Europe's Airbus Industrie, and warned that American rival McDonnell
Douglas must not become an 'Asian Airbus', subsidised by Taiwan.
'Airbus and the European Community should understand our position', he said
in a speech in New York. 'Twenty-one years of subsidy is far too much.
Enough is enough.'
He repeated a threat of retaliatory action under US law as a 'last resort'
if the issue could not be resolved through the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt).
The broadside follows five years of slow movement in two cases brought by
the US under the Gatt, seeking to prevent EC members from subsidising Airbus
 -which has overtaken McDonnell Douglas to become the world's second largest
civil aircraft manufacturer. The US claims the subsidies total about Dollars
8m (Pounds 4.4m) for every aircraft Airbus has sold.
Mr Shrontz dismissed as a 'distraction' recent allegations by Airbus that
Boeing and other US aerospace groups get indirect subsidies from the US in
the form of military and other contracts. Mr Shrontz said this ignored the
fact that British, French, German and Spanish companies had received more
than twice as much business from their governments as had Boeing.
He also expressed concern over the recently announced plan for Taiwan
Aerospace, a government-backed business, to take a 40 per cent equity stake
in McDonnell Douglas's civil aircraft business.
He said the new entity might become 'another subsidised competitor, shielded
from market reality'.
If development funds for McDonnell Douglas were provided by Taiwan, he said,
it would be creating ' an Asian Airbus where, once again, deep government
pockets eliminate the need for disciplined business decisions'.

SUMITOMO of America, a US subsidiary of the Japanese company, has accused
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission of cancelling a Dollars
122m (Pounds 67.4m) contract to buy railway carriages 'for
non-business-related reasons'.
This comes as the latest demonstration of Americans' growing resentment over
the US trade imbalance with Japan.
The contract was for the Green Line, a 23-mile, 14-station line, scheduled
to go into operation in 1995, is part of a 30-year, Dollars 150bn mass
transport system for Los Angeles County.
Under mounting public pressure to keep jobs and funding in the US, the
county transportation commission reversed its December decision to place the
contract with Sumitomo, which supplied rail cars for the first stage of the
system.
Despite an eleventh-hour plan by Sumitomo to make General Electric of the US
a 'substantial participant' in its bid for the project, the transport
commission voted unanimously to withdraw the contract.
Mr Kenji Miyahara, president of Sumitomo of America, said the termination
indicated Japan-bashing.

FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel argues environmental gains of trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING world trade is not ruinous to the environment: on the contrary, an
efficient trading system is likely to provide a 'vital ingredient' in
generating resources needed to ensure a cleaner environment, Mr Arthur
Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), told a conference in Bangkok yesterday.
Mr Dunkel's address, which at the same time warned of possible trade clashes
resulting from a proliferation of different national environmental
standards, sets the scene for debate this year on trade and the environment.
At the end of February, Gatt plans to publish a long-awaited report on the
subject. The World Bank has also commissioned a study that may be drafted by
April. Debate will focus on the 'earth summit' being convened by the United
Nations in Brazil in June.
Mr Dunkel rebutted complaints that the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
reform did not address environmental issues, insisting that successful
completion of the round 'was the single most important contribution that
Gatt could make in the fields of sustainable development and the
environment'.
He argued that Gatt's efforts to attack protectionism in agriculture and
reduce farm subsidies would not simply correct price distortions, but would
produce significant environmental gains by cutting the intensive use of
pesticides and chemical fertilisers that underpinned excessive farm
production in Europe and the US.
The Uruguay Round would also bring the economies of eastern and central
Europe into the world trading system, 'giving them access to modern
technology and less environmentally-damaging methods of production', Mr
Dunkel said.
Mr Dunkel insisted that 'a healthy environment and a healthy economy go
hand-in-hand'.
He nevertheless sympathised with concerns that industries would suffer
competitively if they incurred the cost of enforcing strict environmental
standards: 'The danger is for one country's environmental programme to
become another country's trade distortion,' he said.
He called on advanced countries to share environmentally sound technology.

<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN defence officials said yesterday they had made great advances
towards creating their own army but had not yet settled several contentious
issues over the division of the Black Sea Fleet.
Lt-Gen Ivan Bizhan, the deputy minister of defence, said 270,000 soldiers
had sworn allegiance to Ukraine, about a quarter of the 1.3m Soviet military
personnel stationed in Ukraine. Another 240,000 officers and men of
Ukrainian descent serving outside Ukraine had said they wanted to be moved
to Ukraine.
He said three meetings between Ukrainian and Commonwealth military
authorities had largely resolved the prickly question of what constituted
the strategic forces which should remain under Commonwealth control.
The minister said that by 1994 all strategic nuclear weapons would be
removed from Ukraine and no strategic Commonwealth forces would be stationed
there.
However, he said there had been no agreement on the division of the Black
Sea fleet and there was still some dispute about parachute divisions,
military academies, military sanatoriums and dachas and food supplies stored
in Ukraine.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Bonn takes tough line on Soviet debt

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Soviet republics like Ukraine, which have yet to sign the
western-inspired memorandum of understanding on repaying the debts of the
former Soviet Union, could be refused membership of the International
Monetary Fund.
Germany will press at the G7 meeting to block membership for those not
prepared to honour Soviet debts, not with the aim of excluding them, but
rather to force them into line.
Ukraine is by far the most important of the four which have so far refused
to accept responsibility. The others are Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were forcibly incorporated into the
Soviet Union in 1940, have rejected responsibility for a share of the Soviet
debt apart from that related to projects in the Baltic states.
Germany, the largest creditor of the former Soviet Union, is determined that
'a country cannot become a member of the IMF without accepting its
responsibility for its debts,' according to officials in Bonn. That means in
effect that they will be compelled to sign the memorandum of understanding.
At the same time Germany is hoping for the speediest possible incorporation
of the ex-Soviet republics into the IMF, in order to give them access both
to credits and expertise.
Officials in Bonn believe that a letter of intent on a Fund programme for
Russia could be agreed by the end of February, submitted to the IMF board in
March, and full membership of the Fund could follow in April, clearing the
way for IMF credits.
The most difficult problem is that of quotas for the former Soviet republics
within the fund: the debate ranges from a lower limit of 3 per cent, to an
upper limit of 6 per cent. The difference concerns whether intra-republican
trade is taken into account: if the former Soviet Union had joined as a
single unit, such trade would not have been considered. However given
current fragmentation, intra-republican links have become external trade.
Eight ex-Soviet republics have applied to join the fund.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Progressive Democrats tell Haughey to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Charles Haughey's coalition partners last night told him to resign or
lose their support.
The Progressive Democrats told the Irish prime minister 'to take the
necessary step to restore the authority and effectiveness of the government'
or face the withdrawal of their support following the Budget day next
Wednesday.
This is a thinly-veiled call for his resignation. Without PD support the
government will collapse, precipitating a general election.
The ultimatum was issued after a day in which Mr Haughey came under intense
pressure to resign from cabinet colleagues.
The crisis erupted on Tuesday when Mr Sean Doherty, a former justice
minister, said Mr Haughey had known of illegal phone-tapping in 1982 for
which Mr Doherty took the blame at the time.
Government and party spokesmen were uncharacteristically silent about a
meeting yesterday between Mr O'Malley and Mr Haughey.
Speculation was rife yesterday that Mr Haughey was about to resign, although
his spokesman said: 'I have no sense of that at the moment'.
PD senators were yesterday instructed by Mr O'Malley to support the tabling
of an opposition no-confidence motion in Mr Haughey, but the motion was
ruled out of order by the Senate's chairman.
On Wednesday night the PD issued a strong warning to Mr Haughey, saying they
viewed this latest crisis 'with the utmost gravity' and that 'the
credibility and stability of the government (must) be immediately restored'.
Several Fianna Fail ministers, led by by Mr Bertie Ahern the finance
minister, were yesterday working on a proposal to hold a parliamentary party
meeting after the presentation of the 1992 Budget in the Dail next week, at
which Mr Haughey would either resign, or face a vote of no confidence.
An attempt to oust Mr Haughey last November, led by two cabinet ministers
and a group of backbenchers, failed. Mr Haughey was able to sway wavering
backbenchers then by a commitment to finish an immediate agenda of work
ahead of him, and then reconsider his position. This was interpreted as this
spring.
At a press conference last week however, Mr Haughey said 'there is no
timetable' for his departure. It is thought that a majority of Fianna Fail
backbenchers would now support Mr Haughey's removal. The most likely
contender for Mr Haughey's replacement is Mr Albert Reynolds, the former
finance minister who was sacked for leading November's attempt to oust Mr
Haughey.

<TEXT>
THE European Parliament is considering a code of conduct for the estimated
3,000 professional lobbyists who have established themselves in Brussels to
influence Community laws and decisions.
This move parallels a similar step by the European Commission, whose 1992
work programme, to be unveiled next month, also talks of the need for a
proper code of conduct between the Commission and pressure groups.
For all their mock horror at the growth in Euro-lobbying, most EC
legislators and officials are privately delighted that so many people now
consider them worth influencing. But as the stakes mount, so does industry
pressure, with, for instance, the tobacco lobby now pulling out all the
stops to head off a near-total ban on tobacco advertising.
Two days of public hearings this week gave professional lobbyists the
unusual chance to lobby in favour of themselves rather than their clients.
Most of them baulked at having to register as lobbyists, as they are
required to do in the US and Germany.
However, their message did not get home to Mr Marc Galle, the Belgian
Socialist rapporteur of the parliament's rules committee, who said yesterday
his report in April would recommend just such a register.
Most MEPs and lobbyists preferred a code of conduct to prevent such abuses
as lobbyists stealing documents off MEPs' desks, and MEPs and their
assistants taking money to act as consultants. A record of MEPs' declared
financial interests exists, but it is skimpy and held only in Luxembourg.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to restrict the level of foreign participation and shareholdings
have led to a large drop in the number of applications for manufacturing
ventures in Malaysia. The value of inward investments last year fell by 52
per cent to MDollars 23.6bn (Dollars 8.7bn) from MDollars 48.8bn in 1990.
Ms Rafidah Aziz, international trade and industry minister, attributed the
drop to the unusually large number of investment applications in previous
years and to the general climate of uncertainty facing foreign investors.
Proposed investments with majority foreign shareholding dropped from
MDollars 13.2bn in 1990 to MDollars 2bn last year, while those wholly
foreign-owned fell from MDollars 13.7bn to MDollars 10.9bn.
Last year, the Malaysian budget included tough qualifying rules and
shareholding requirements for foreign investors and abolished tax holidays.
Malaysia says the new rules are necessary to stem the deterioration in the
national current account deficits, projected to reach 10 per cent or more of
GNP.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHADOW has been cast over the political future of Mr Manfred Stolpe, prime
minister of Brandenburg state, by Mr Joachim Gauck, the German official in
charge of the files of the former East German security police, the Stasi.
Mr Stolpe admitted this week to regular contacts over a 30-year period with
the Stasi. A Social Democrat and east Germany's most highly-regarded native
politician, he has frequently been mentioned as a future German president.
He served as the senior lay official of the Protestant church in east Berlin
and Brandenburg until the collapse of the communist regime in 1989.
However, Mr Gauck said in an interview yesterday: 'Manfred Stolpe will have
to do some explaining. . . . Who cleared him (for contacts with Stasi
officers)?' Mr Stolpe's bishop, Mr Gottfried Forck, has said he knew nothing
about the contacts.
Mr Gauck stressed that the criteria for being a Stasi informer were not
simply whether a person had signed a pledge and received money. The decisive
question was whether the relationship was 'conspiratorial or open'. Both the
Protestant church and the public would be asking Mr Stolpe to explain why he
had kept his contacts a secret from his superior, Mr Gauck said.
Despite the disclosures, however, Mr Stolpe has attracted widespread support
from nearly all the political parties for his past humanitarian work in
divided Germany. A spokesman for the Gauck Commission said this week that
the Stasi files held nothing which 'incriminated' Mr Stolpe.
The east German politician said on Wednesday that he would apply to read his
own file. However, it is understood to have been destroyed by the Stasi
along with the records of other prominent east Germans.

Italy's Senate yesterday approved plans to raise L15,000bn (Dollars 12.6bn)
through privatisations this year, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The plans,
pushed through parliament as a decree law following strong political
opposition, involve transforming state-owned groups into joint stock
companies, prior to their possible sale, and identifying other assets, such
as property, which could be sold.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Germany presses for IMF block over Soviet debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FORMER Soviet republics like Ukraine, which have yet to sign the
western-inspired memorandum of understanding on repaying the debts of the
former Soviet Union, could be refused membership of the International
Monetary Fund.
Germany will press the Group of Seven to block membership for those not
prepared to honour Soviet debts, not with the aim of excluding them, but
rather to force them into line.
Ukraine is by far the most important of the four which have so far refused
to accept responsibility. The others are Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were forcibly incorporated into the
Soviet Union in 1940, have rejected responsibility for a share of the Soviet
debt apart from that related to projects in the Baltic states.
Germany, the largest creditor of the former Soviet Union, is determined that
'a country cannot become a member of the IMF without accepting its
responsibility for its debts,' according to officials in Bonn. That means in
effect that they will be compelled to sign the memorandum of understanding.
At the same time Germany is hoping for the speediest possible incorporation
of the ex-Soviet republics into the IMF, in order to give them access both
to credits and expertise.
Officials in Bonn believe that a letter of intent on a Fund programme for
Russia could be agreed by the end of February, submitted to the IMF board in
March, and full membership of the Fund could follow in April, clearing the
way for IMF credits.
The most difficult problem is that of quotas for the former Soviet republics
within the fund: the debate ranges from a lower limit of 3 per cent, to an
upper limit of 6 per cent. The difference concerns whether intra-republican
trade is taken into account: if the former Soviet Union had joined as a
single unit, such trade would not have been considered. However given
current fragmentation, intra-republican links have become external trade.
The issue will be a key point on the agenda of the finance ministers'
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in New York tomorrow.
In Bonn, the attitude is that the quota is not fundamental, although given
their huge economic problems, the greater access the republics have to IMF
funds, underpinned by strict conditions, the better.
Eight ex-Soviet republics - Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia and
Kazakhstan, plus the three Baltic republics, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -
have now applied to join the fund.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Unemployment jumps fourfold in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Hungary quadrupled last year as companies shed labour in the
face of recession in both domestic and east European markets.
December saw the largest jump in unemployment since Hungary's economic
reforms began. A rise of 55,000 last month took the year-end unemployment
total to 406,000, or 8.5 per cent of the workforce.
The official forecast that unemployment will not exceed 580,000 in 1992 sits
uneasily with the latest indications that job losses are intensifying.
An impending wave of bankruptcies is likely to reinforce the trend, although
the recession is set to ease. Gross domestic product is officially expected
to stabilise in 1992 after falling about 8 per cent in 1991.
The immediate political fall-out from rising unemployment has been contained
by a widespread public perception that many, especially gypsies, abuse the
unemployment benefit system.

UKRAINIAN defence officials said yesterday they had made great advances
towards creating their own army but had not yet settled several contentious
issues over the division of the Black Sea Fleet.
Lt-Gen Ivan Bizhan, the deputy minister of defence, said 270,000 soldiers
had sworn allegiance to Ukraine, about a quarter of the 1.3m Soviet military
personnel stationed in Ukraine. Another 240,000 officers and men of
Ukrainian descent serving outside Ukraine had said they wanted to be moved
to Ukraine.
He said three meetings between Ukrainian and Commonwealth military
authorities had largely resolved the prickly question of what constituted
the strategic forces which should remain under Commonwealth control.
The minister said that by 1994 all strategic nuclear weapons would be
removed from Ukraine and no strategic Commonwealth forces would be stationed
there.
However, he said there had been no agreement on the division of the Black
Sea fleet and there was still some dispute about parachute divisions,
military academies, military sanatoriums and dachas and food supplies stored
in Ukraine.

FT  24 JAN 92 / Miners pay rise threat to Russian economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government was yesterday struggling to retain control of its
economic reform programme after President Boris Yeltsin reportedly conceded
large pay rises for miners and abandoned the target for a balanced budget in
the first quarter of the year.
Mr Yeltsin, who met representatives from Russia's biggest coalfield, the
Kuzbass, on Wednesday, was reported by the Interfax news agency to have
conceded their case for higher salaries.
Such a concession to the powerful mineworkers would open the way to further
wage demands by other industrial workers.
At the same time, the chairman of the Russian central bank, Mr Georgy
Matiukhin, told the Russian parliament that monetary reform was 'senseless -
a complete waste of time and energy' at a time of unrestrained monetary
growth.
Mr Matiukhin said Russian internal debt had risen to Rbs375bn, out of a
total debt of the former Soviet Union of Rbs500bn  - though other figures
published yesterday showed the Russian debt to be even higher, at Rbs572bn
from a total Soviet debt of Rbs990bn. The bank chairman said that he
expected to print Rbs34.3bn in the first quarter of 1992, a significant rise
over the same period last year.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform,
wrote this week in the Financial Times that Russia could 'sink into a
disastrous wage-price spiral' unless inflation were soon stopped. He also
told the Russian parliament on Tuesday that the first quarter's budget
deficit would equal 1 per cent of the country's GNP, or Rbs11.5bn despite a
pledge to balance the budget.
Commentators have cast doubt on the projected small size of the deficit.
President Yeltsin yesterday suspended all import restrictions and declared
Russia open to foreign investment, Reuter reports from Moscow.
A government resolution said customs tariffs were suspended with effect from
January 15. A new customs regime would be drawn up, with a view to
introduction on April 1.
Mr Yeltsin was also due to sign a decree allowing every citizen or
organisation to trade at any place in any goods, except those banned for
sale, without needing to obtain permission from the authorities.

FT  23 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets lacked direction yesterday as dealers began to feel
uncertain about the trend on Wall Street, writes Peter John.
On the Liffe, early trading in the March FT-SE future contract helped the
underlying cash market to pick up from its weak opening. Volumes were not
heavy but a few dealers had been able to leave themselves short overnight.
Consequently, they were able to benefit from the effect of the sharp
overnight fall on Wall Street and buy back their short positions more
cheaply.
In the afternoon, the March contract began to drift off in spite of the
relative firmness in New York. There was some nervousness ahead of the
announcement about the UK Budget date and when it came, the date, which was
in the middle of market predictions, provided no direction.
The only impetus appeared to come from a large sell order carried out by one
securities house. At the official close, March was 2,558, down 19 on the
previous day but still at a hefty premium to its estimated fair value of
around 20 points.
In the LTOM, volumes remained low, with the FT-SE option turnover of 2,639
contracts particularly poor. Total volume of 22,990 lots was modestly up on
the previous day.

FT  23 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone hit by revisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the UK's biggest cellular radio group was yesterday hit by a
number of downgrades as the company completed a series of meetings with
analysts.
Attention focused on Vodafone's non-core businesses, in particular its
partly owned Orbitel manufacturing subsidiary. According to one analyst,
Orbitel is looking at losses of Pounds 6m this year. Another subsidiary,
Vodata, which produces value added telecoms services, is also not performing
as well as thought.
For the year 1992-93 County NatWest is now predicting profits of Pounds
290m, down Pounds 20m, Kleinwort Benson forecasts Pounds 300m, down Pounds
25m, while Hoare Govett, in its second downgrade in three weeks, puts
profits at Pounds 280m, a reduction of Pounds 30m from its original figure.
However, analysts remain supportive of the company. Mr James Dodd at
Kleinwort said: 'The outlook on products and on the non-network business is
prudent, but the cellular side seems to be holding up well.' Mr Paul Norris
at BZW, which turned cautious on Vodafone recently, said: 'The latest series
of downgrades are really just points of detail against the fundamentals of
the business, which remain solid.' But Hoare expressed worries over cellular
subscriber rates. Vodafone lost 8 to 348p in heavy turnover of 4.2m.
Cadbury wanted
Confectionery and soft drinks group Cadbury Schweppes was firm yesterday
after two securities houses registered their enthusiasm for the company.
Hoare Govett, broker to the company, reiterated its buy stance on the
shares. The house's foods team underlined its confidence that Cadbury would
still match its forecast for 1991 profits of Pounds 315m when the company
announces full-year results on March 4. This compares with a 1990 figure of
Pounds 279m.
The broker has maintained its estimate in spite of a fall in soft drink
volumes, flat confectionery sales and poor general trading conditions. It
argues that Cadbury represents a flight to quality.
Also, SG Warburg was said to have sent a note to clients highlighting the
value of Cadbury's brands. The shares were ahead 5 at one stage but eased
with a weak market to end 3 up at 445p.
Another weak performance by crude oil prices - February Brent slipped 10
cents more to around Dollars 17.70 a barrel - kept the oil sector on the
back foot. Profits downgrades by a number of the City's top broking firms
caused a bout of weakness in BP and Shell. BP were 7 weaker at 286p on 4.4m
shares traded and Shell 5 easier at 493p on 3.2m.
British Gas, still sustained by suggestions that the group may be
considering a hive-off of its industrial gas marketing operations, closed
only marginally down at 245p; turnover in the stock reached a heavy 10m
shares.
Lasmo, given a strong boost in recent sessions by a number of broker buy
notes, retreated after a firm opening and closed slightly easier on balance
at 254p, with volume reaching 5.4m shares, its heaviest for many weeks.
A mid-morning decline in the shares followed a bearish note issued by
Strauss Turnbull, who said the group had adopted a change in accounting
policy which could affect the dividend policy. Strauss also mentioned the
high level of capital expenditure and said Lasmo had agreed to take on an
environmental indemnity claim referring to Ultramar's refinery business.
High drama at MEPC's annual meeting yesterday left the property group 17
weaker at 381p. The board's decision to pay an increased final dividend was
challenged by associates of Mr Harry Hyams, a significant minority
shareholder. A vote was taken, and the dividend passed with ease, but it
unsettled the market in brisk turnover of close to 1m shares.
There was also talk that MEPC was on the verge of successfully letting its
Alban Gate office development in the City, but it denied this to analysts.
The sharp fall in MEPC pulled down the rest of the property sector. British
Land slipped 6 to 257p, Hammerson ordinary 7 to 528p and Land Securities 9
to 464p.
Merger talks between Rosehaugh and Stanhope - which have been under way
since the summer - were finally called off yesterday, a move one analyst
described as 'a disaster for both companies'. The merger had been seen by
some in the market as the first of many such moves to rationalise the
depressed and crowded property sector. Rosehaugh lost 1 1/4 to 5 1/4 p,
while Stanhope eased 1 1/2 to 23 1/2 p.
In the financial sector, Union Discount fell 24 to 150p, compared with a
1991/92 high of 600p. Union's annual results early next month are expected
to suffer from fears that the company's leasing subsidiary has been hit
badly by the recession and from the general malaise affecting the discount
house sector at present.
Discount houses are particularly sensitive to interest rate movements,
benefiting from lower rates but faced recently with a firming of money
market rates, following higher rates in Germany. Sterling's membership of
the European exchange rate mechanism also means that the potential for
volatility in rate movements has been severely restricted.
Lep Group, the security and freight forwarding company in which ADT has a 27
per cent stake, halved in price to 8 1/2 p as the company announced 'very
substantial write-offs and provisions' to cover its US property portfolio.
Lep said it was undergoing a restructuring which would 'likely include a
partial conversion of debt into equity'. The group was also reviewing the
proposed sale of the National Guardian Corporation, its US security
business. ADT dropped 15 to 423p.
Construction equipment suppliers BM Group fell 18 to 382p after announcing a
Pounds 60m rights issue to repay the debt of its latest acquistion, Thomas
Robinson, and to cover the cost of another company it is negotiating to buy
in Canada. Thomas Robinson jumped 11 1/2 to 24p.
Reports that Cable and Wireless had suspended talks with AT&amp;T, of the US,
over a possible alliance left the telecoms group off 10 at 579p after
moderate volume of 2.1m.
BT, which slipped under the flotation offer price on Tuesday for the first
time, eased further on Oftel regulatory worries. Both the old and the new
shares were off a penny at 315p and 108 1/2 p respectively. Sentiment
remains bearish on the group, with individual investors joining
institutional investors in becoming sellers.
Pharmaceuticals were weak on the back of a depressed Wall Street, but the
price of Wellcome was marked up as analysts were enthusiastic after meetings
with the company. The shares rose 22 to 1077p on desultory turnover.
Glaxo fell 16 to 843p. It was announced that more than 25 per cent of
Glaxo's shares are now held in the US in the form of American Depositary
Receipts, against some 22 per cent in September.
A confident presentation to analysts from Fisons failed to translate into
the share price, which declined 6 to 352p.
Food company Hillsdown Holdings fell 7 to 153p as securities house Hoare
Govett placed 6.5m shares with clients at 150 1/2 p.
Photocopier group Southern Business was active after a broker placed just
under 6m of its shares in the market. The stock shed 3 to 90p on turnover of
13m.
Further weakness in Meyer International left the builders merchant 10 lower
at 391p as Hoare Govett downgraded its forecast. The broker is now looking
for profits of Pounds 26m this year, down Pounds 4m.
Public houses and hotels group Greenalls saw its 'A' shares surge ahead 36
before ending a net 28 ahead at 207p.
The company announced that it was to abolish its two-tier share structure.
Under the changes, 'A' shareholders will receive one ordinary for every two
'A' shares held.
There was strong speculation that the enfranchisement will pave the way for
an acquisition and Boddington Group was seen as the target. There has been
heavy turnover in Boddington shares recently, and yesterday it was announced
that Scottish Amicable Investment Managers had disposed of just over 2m
shares, 1.92 per cent of the company's equity. One leading integrated
securities house has been a keen buyer, and Boddingtons yesterday gained 4
to 179p. Greene King, also affected by the bid talk, advanced 7 to 475p.

FT  23 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late sell programme upsets equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE 'sell' programme from one of the big UK investment houses and a
flurry of selling by nervous investors as news filtered into the market that
the UK Budget will be announced on March 10 took their toll of a London
equity market regarded as ripe for a bout of profit-taking.
The FT-SE 100-share index finished a relatively dull trading session only 5
points off the day's low, closing a net 21.4 down at 2,522.0. At its highest
level for the day the index still showed a decline of 4.2 at 2,539.2. It
reached its lowest point for the sess-ion of 2,517.0 during the late
afternoon.
Marketmakers moved quick-ly to lower their quotations for leading blue chips
at the outset of trading, seeking to head off selling by arbitrageurs acting
for US institutions. There was a flurry of US-sourced selling first thing,
reflecting the widespread and often substantial losses among blue chips on
Wall Street overnight which saw the US market retreat more than 30 Dow
points.
After the initial bout of weakness, however, institutions began to nibble at
a number of leading stocks, taking advantage of what were described as
generous quotations. Marketmakers kept one eye on the Footsie future as well
as the Seaq screens, and moved quickly in mid-morning to follow a sharp
rally in the derivatives market.
Activity tended to wilt over the lunchtime period but then accelerated to
accommodate the opening of Wall Street. The latter's overnight fall, which
caused widespread dismay among some London brokers, was followed yesterday
by a neutral opening.
The lack of direction from America left London to its own devices, and a
decline in the Footsie future, coupled with a late trading programme which
was said to have been heavily weighted on the sell side, triggered a late
plunge in the cash market index.
The sell programme included big lines of blue chip stocks, while there were
hints that Hoare Govett, one of the leading UK brokerages, had placed a
substantial block of shares in Hillsdown, the food group.
Property issues fell heavily after news that merger talks between Rosehaugh
and Stanhope had come to nothing, and reports that there had been
considerable shareholder opposition at the annual meeting of MEPC to the
group's dividend policy.
Drug shares, among the market's most volatile stocks, were mixed, with the
leaders tending to lose ground on profit-taking. Wellcome, however, gave one
of the best individual performances among the Footsie constituents, after
suggestions that one of the top UK broking houses had lifted its profits
forecasts.
Telecom shares remained sharply in focus, with BT, formerly British
Telecommunications, suffering from worries about the consultative document
on pricing due to be published at the end of the month by Oftel, the
telecoms watchdog. Cable and Wireless, heavily traded recently as stories of
a link with AT&amp;T, of the US, have done the rounds of the market, fell
further. Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular telephones group, declined
sharply after a series of profits downgrades by analysts.
Turnover in equities was again disappointing, reaching only 515.6m shares on
the Seaq, compared with Tuesday's programme-boosted 619.4m and Monday's
418.2m.

Wall Street
US STOCK prices wavered in a narrowly mixed range for most of yesterday, as
the market digested a surfeit of corporate results, but a late round of
programme trading pushed the market sharply higher, writes Karen Zagor in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which retreated 30.64 on Tuesday, closed
32.42 ahead at 3,255.81 after a fairly heavy New York SE volume of 228m
shares. Advances outpaced declines by 1,132 to 618. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 rose 5.49 to 418.13.
Shares started to move up in the afternoon following a successful two-year
note auction, but it was the computer-driven programmes that triggered the
late rally.
Baxter International lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 in heavy trading on
news that the company's supply contract with Hospital Corp, valued at
Dollars 250m a year, might be in jeopardy. Hospital Corp is allowing its
units to accept bids for some supplies.
Monsanto tumbled Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 67 after the big US chemical
company unveiled 1991 earnings of Dollars 296m, down 45 per cent from the
previous year's figure.
Banc One, the strong mid-western commercial banking group, added Dollars 1
1/2 at Dollars 49 5/8 on the back of a 25 per cent rise in 1991 net profits
to Dollars 529.5m.
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing receded Dollars 1 to Dollars 96 1/8 on
reporting disappointing fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.18 a share,
against Dollars 1.34 a year earlier. The company also warned that it expects
a difficult start to 1992.
Browning Ferris edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 22 5/8 after posting
first-quarter earnings of 26 cents a share, compared with 40 cents a year
ago.
Campbell Soup advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 39 after Goldman Sachs added
the stock to its recommended list.
News that Conseco had agreed to buy Bankers Life &amp; Casualty for Dollars 600m
from ICH Corp lifted Conseco's stock Dollars 5 to Dollars 69 3/4 . The issue
has traded in a range of Dollars 13 3/4 to Dollars 70 in the last year. On
the American Stock Exchange, ICH put on Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 4 3/8 .
A strong buy rating by Merrill Lynch on Delta Air Lines' stock boosted the
issue Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 74 1/4 . Among other airlines, AMR rose
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 74 1/8 and UAL gained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 150
7/8 . USAir firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 3/8 . Its results were
released after the market closed.
Computer Associates jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 after the company
turned in third-quarter earnings of 43 cents a share against 35 cents a year
earlier.
The secondary market posted stronger gains than the primary market, with the
Nasdaq composite ending 15.81 up at 620.68.
Henley Group advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 3/4 . The manufacturer said it
was creating a board committee to consider a recapitalisation plan that
would distribute Dollars 250m to shareholders.
Canada
TORONTO stocks rebounded from morning weakness to end firmer on balance. The
composite index was finally 18.3 ahead at 3,638.8, after a day's low of
3,607.6. Rises led declines by 327 to 253 following volume of 27.9m shares,
against 31.7m.
Dofasco gained CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 18 1/2 . The company's Algoma Steel
unit announced a major restructuring which, among other things, would give
Algoma's employees 60 per cent ownership of the unit and would turn the
other 40 per cent over to Algoma's creditors and preferred shareholders.
Deprenyl Research was up CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 22 3/8 . The company said
its board recommended a two-for-one stock split.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Money Markets: London rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHT conditions returned to the UK money market yesterday in the face of
another substantial liquidity shortage, with overnight money squeezed higher
during the day but longer rates holding steady, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.15bn liquidity shortage in early
morning, against Pounds 750m on Tuesday. The largest factor contributing to
the drain on funds was maturing treasury bills and assistance from previous
weeks at Pounds 947m.
However, there was no early rush for funds from market participants. In
early assistance the Bank of England injected a modest Pounds 167m, through
the outright purchase of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and the
purchase of paper for resale to the market on February 10 at 10 7/16 per
cent.
Later in the morning a further Pounds 116m was added, again through the
purchase of band 1 bills and repurchase paper on the same terms.
However, this was not enough to hold the overnight money rate steady. From
an opening level of 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, overnight funds traded up to
13-12 1/2 per cent by early afternoon. As liquidity was squeezed operators
looked to the authorities for additional assistance.
In the early afternoon Pounds 337m was injected through the purchase of band
1 bank and treasury bills and band 2 bank bills, all at 10 3/8 per cent.
Late assistance amounted to Pounds 485m, bringing the total injection for
the day to Pounds 1.105bn.
Overnight funds fell back to close at 11-10 3/4 per cent, still above
Tuesday's closing level.
In Frankfurt, call money continued to trade at around 9.40/9.50 per cent in
spite of a net drain of funds at the Bundesbank's regular repurchase
operations. The authorities offered DM9.2bn one month funds at 9.4 per cent,
not fully replacing a DM13.3bn expiring repurchase pact.
In Tokyo, unsecured call money traded slightly lower to 5 7/16 per cent,
from 5 9/16 per cent on Tuesday, with the Bank of Japan injecting a net
Y200bn in its daily operations.
However, the three months certificate of deposit rate collapsed to 4.95 per
cent, from 5.20 per cent on Tuesday and 5.25 per cent on Monday.
Analysts said the fall reflected increased expectations of another reduction
in interest rates but was exaggerated by easy market conditions, allowed by
the authorities in the face of a weak stock market this week.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar confined to tight range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS OF central bank intervention to cap any rise in the dollar continued
to dominate the foreign exchange markets yesterday, confining the US
currency to a tight range, writes Simon London.
Trading was nervous overnight in Tokyo, although intervention by the Bank of
Japan and the US Federal Reserve, rumoured late on Tuesday, failed to
materialise. The US unit fell sharply against the yen in London late on
Tuesday when the US authorities were reported to be preparing the ground for
intervention.
However, reports that the Bank of Japan was checking rates, matching action
by the Federal Reserve in New York, sent the dollar to Y123.15, its low of
the session.
The dollar ended in Tokyo at Y123.34 and DM1.5878, from a close in New York
of Y123.60 and DM1.5865. The slight weakness of the yen was blamed on a
sharp fall in some Japanese money market interest rates.
For example, three months certificates of deposit traded down to 4.95 per
cent from 5.20 per cent on Tuesday.
In Europe, the major currencies were again tied within very tight trading
ranges. The threat of intervention and caution ahead of this weekend's
meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers were blamed for the
generally featureless trade.
After peaking at Y123.64 and DM1.5905 very early in the European session,
the US currency fell back until US housing construction data prompted a mild
recovery.
Figures for December showed a 0.2 per cent decrease in new housing starts
against November, for a seasonally adjusted rate of growth of 2.6 per cent,
seen by most analysts as a positive indicator of economic activity.
The dollar responded with a firmer tone, improving to Y123.45 and DM1.5885.
The US currency closed in London at Y123.20 from Tuesday's Y123.10, and
DM1.5875 from DM1.5830. In New York the dollar firmed to finish at Y123.35
and DM1.5895.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark weakened following
the collapse of pay negotiations between the steel workers union and
employers. The collapse of talks means that the union will now hold a strike
ballot in pursuit of its pay claim.
The German currency closed easier at FFr3.4086, from FFr3.4095 on Tuesday;
L752.20 from L752.70; and Pta63.19 from Pta63.21.
Sterling's gain was greater than other European currencies against the
D-Mark, however, rising to a more comfortable level above its permitted
floor within the ERM. The pound ended at DM2.8675, from DM2.86 on Tuesday.
Today, German M3 money supply statistics for December are due for release.
Broad money growth ran at 5.1 per cent in November, just outside the
Bundesbank's 3 per cent to 5 per cent target range. Any acceleration will be
taken as a sign that German interest rates must stay high.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slow revival forecast for cocoa
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORY COULD be repeating itself in the depressed world cocoa market,
according to Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house owned by ED &amp; F. Man.
The market, which has been buffeted by low prices and overproduction for the
past few years, is now in a similar state to the mid-1960s, when stocks were
also at record highs and prices at record lows.
'Although prices rose, the recovery was insufficient to stimulate production
or curb consumption growth,' says Gill in its latest cocoa market report. It
predicts several years of deficits, and 'as a result, the general trend in
bean prices through to the mid-1990s will be up rather than down'.
Gill &amp; Duffus has cut its world production forecast for 1991-92 to 2.24m
tonnes from a September estimate of 2.32m tonnes, mainly because of a
deterioration in prospects for Nigeria. The forecast for the Ivory Coast,
the world's biggest producer, has been reduced by 40,000 tonnes to 710,000
because of dry weather.
The total deficit - the first after seven years of surplus - is now
estimated at 177,000 tonnes, compared with the earlier forecast of 148,000
tonnes. This will still leave closing stocks for the year at 1.35m tonnes.
World consumption will continue to rise, by 2 per cent to 2.39m tonnes for
1991-92, Gill predicts. 'Looking forward to 1992-93 we expect another year
of record consumption as prices remain low in real terms and western
economies recover from recession.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aids epidemic likely to hit
African copper supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIDS epidemic will make a gradual, but unavoidable, impact on copper
mining in Zaire and Zambia, two of the world's biggest producers of the
metal, suggest the Economist Intelligence Unit in a special report today.
In an otherwise fairly optimistic view of world copper consumption, demand
and prices, it says: 'Essentially, the danger is that skilled workers,
supervisors and managers will die of Aids faster than replacements can be
trained.
'The result will be not a sudden collapse in mine output. Rather there will
be a slow but steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents,
delays and misjudgements, and output will suffer.'
The report shows that copper mine production in the two countries peaked at
1.2m tonnes in 1974 and gradually fell to 850,000 tonnes in 1990. The EIU
sees their combined output falling to 600,000 tonnes by 1993 before
recovering a little in the following three years.
Mr Peter Parkinson, author of the report, says that transport systems in the
African copper belt will always be precarious and will also be affected by
the Aids epidemic. So the amount of copper in the 'pipeline' will tend to
increase.
'The political conditions under which the mines have to operate may also
deteriorate. Ironically, (at present) there is some hope for the emergence
of more open and pluralistic political systems in both Zaire and Zambia, but
there is a clear danger that, as the epidemic fastens its grip, the normal
constraints of civil society will tend to give way.'
The report points out that Indonesia is emerging to take up some of the
slack caused by Africa's problems and is becoming a 'sizeable low-cost
producer.' Between 1990 and 1996 the EIU forecasts Indonesia's copper output
will jump by 85 per cent to 315,000 tonnes.
Mr Parkinson suggests copper companies will take a lesson from their
precious metal counterparts and in future attempt to stabilise revenue
through long-term forward sales and linked loan techniques. 'This may lead
to downward pressure on prices, as has happened with gold and silver, and
hence to lower profits and/or continued efforts to reduce costs. In the
shorter run this will be of most benefit to the more efficient producers; in
the longer run it will be of greater benefit to those with higher ore
grades.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Food aid 'may cut US subsidy
bill'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US congressman who has been organising a Democratic response to pleas for
food aid from the former Soviet republics is arguing that a humanitarian
response will mean the US government will need to pay less in production
subsidies to American farmers.
President Bush is expected to seek more money for farm subsidies in his 1993
budget. However, Congressman Dave Nagle, an Iowa Democrat, said new offers
of aid could drive the market price of maize up 30 cents a bushel to Dollars
2.75 a bushel. 'This would wipe out the need to pay deficiency payments on
corn,' he said.
Ms Susan Keith, government relations representative with the US Corngrowers
Association, said the government would probably have to pay about Dollars
1.5bn in 'deficiency payments' - production subsidies - for 1991 for maize
because the price was below Dollars 2.75 a bushel.
US maize sales to the former Soviet Union have plummeted because it can no
longer afford to pay cash. The US sold about 16.5m tonnes to Moscow in
1989-90, but only 8.5m tonnes the next year. The downturn in exports does
have an immediate budget impact, Ms Keith said. 'If we were selling maize to
the Soviets at the level of two years ago, you would probably see a 30 cents
price increase.'
US wheat prices are above the Dollars 4 per bushel at which production
subsidies must be paid. Stocks are quite low by historical standards, but Mr
Barry Jenkins, a spokesman for US Wheatgrowers, said the 390m-400m bushels
in stocks would make plenty of bread without a significant increase in
prices.
Cargill, in its January bulletin, notes that '1991 harvests were poor in
much of the world, causing a record decline in production. Grain stocks are
declining to pipeline levels.'
Still, needs are great, particularly in the former Soviet republics and
countries torn by war.
'Conditions are realigning to give US agriculture an opportunity like that
of the early 1970s, to assist and trade at a time of need and to grow out of
a number of its own problems and persistent stagnation,' Cargill says.
Reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy could result
in UK millers having to use imports to get the quality wheats needed for
bread production, widening the food trade gap unnecessarily, the National
Association of British and Irish Millers said yesterday. The reforms would
encourage farmers to grow high yielding, lower quality grains irrespective
of demand in order to maximise the guaranteed return which the intervention
system offers.

<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Bank of Japan (IBJ), a leading Japanese bank, and Wako
Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, agreed yesterday to merge their
asset management affiliates by the end of March this year.
The move comes as Japanese investment management companies are faced with
declining profits due to the sluggish stock market and faltering investor
confidence. It also comes ahead of the deregulation of the Japanese
financial industry, where barriers between banks and securities houses are
expected to be abolished next year.
IBJ Capital Management and Wako International Capital Management will merge
to form IBJW Asset Management. The IBJ group will own a 67 per cent stake,
while Wako Securities will hold 33 per cent. The company will be capitalised
at Y300m.
IBJ specialises in fund management for institutional investors, while Wako
depends largely on funds from individuals. As of September last year, IBJ
had Y823.1bn in customer assets under management, placing it sixth in the
industry, while Wako, ranking 55th, had Y128.5bn in managed assets.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Long-dated Treasuries weaken on housing
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-dated US Treasury bonds moved sharply lower at midday yesterday in a
market made nervous by stronger-than-expected December housing starts.
US housing starts rose 2.6 per cent in December to a 1.1m annual rate, while
building permits rose 5.8 per cent to 1.05m, slightly higher than the 1.09m
widely expected. But the gains were offset by news that total housing starts
for the year showed their lowest reading since 1945.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost ground in the early afternoon,
ahead of the two-year note auction, and remained depressed through the rest
of the day. In late trading, the issue was  21/32 lower at 104 5/16 ,
yielding 7.63 per cent. The declines were less dramatic at the short end of
the yield curve, where notes were quoted about  1/8 lower in late trading.
The Federal Reserve entered the market to arrange overnight system
repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 4 7/16 per cent. There
was no policy meaning attached to the Fed's action.
With Fed funds trading above the perceived target of 4 per cent for the
rate, economists had expected the Fed's intervention, which adds reserves to
the system.
Prices started to recover after the Dollars 13.75bn two-year note auction,
which saw reasonably strong demand and had an average yield of 4.99 per
cent. The Treasury will sell Dollars 9.25bn of five-year notes today.
JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs boosted by a sharp fall in
short-term interest rates.
The Bank of Japan made a larger-than-expected addition of funds to the money
market yesterday, prompting the rate on three-month certificates of deposit
to fall as low as 4.94 per cent, from 5.20 per cent.
The Bank of Japan's addition of funds to the money market was seen as an
effort to buoy the Tokyo stock market, and led to speculation that the
central bank may cut the official discount rate soon.
The benchmark No 129 which opened at 5.275 per cent, reached a record high
to yield 5.17 per cent at the close of trading. Strong demand for short and
medium-dated securities led to a steepening in the yield curve. However,
prices slipped back in London trading as some bond investors took profits,
encouraged by the strength of the yen against the dollar.
WORRIES about possible strike action wiped out early gains in the German
government bond market yesterday, with the market closing lower on the day.
Talks between German steelworkers and employers broke down early on
Wednesday morning, with the result that a strike vote will be taken by the
steelworkers' union this Sunday. Separate talks in the German banking sector
broke down yesterday after the union rejected a 5 per cent pay offer.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.54 and reached a high of 88.78,
a technical resistance level, before falling back to 88.36 in reasonable
volumes.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch government's financing agency raised a
further Fl 3.4bn from sales of its tap issues. The agency has sold a total
of Fl 12.2bn this week of the two tap issues - the 8.25 per cent bond due
2002 and the 8.25 per cent bond due 2007.
Traders reported some switching out of German bunds into Dutch bonds to take
advantage of the 50 basis point yield spread.
LONG-DATED UK government bond prices slipped back following the German
market, while shorter maturities were mainly unchanged on the day.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening of 115
5/8 to 115 1/2 by late afternoon.

<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, intends to
take measures to better accommodate the increasing number of large
institutional investors which use futures and options.
The CBOT board has proposed to lift position limits on three of the
exchange's main financial contracts, the Treasury bond and the five and
10-year Treasury note futures. The move must be approved by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. Option limits on those contracts would remain
the same.
The board also approved regulations that will allow member firms to provide
average prices and order quantities when executing large orders or series of
orders. The aim is to make the market more efficient for fund managers.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange earlier this month won approval from the
CFTC to lift position limits on futures and options on Eurodollars and
leading currencies. It cited the need to accommodate the trading
requirements of large managed funds.
Late last year, the CME put in place a system for average pricing of large
orders.
Managed funds are estimated to contain as much as Dollars 30bn, up from just
Dollars 10bn at the start of 1990.

SANYO Securities, the second-tier Japanese broker, announced yesterday that
one of its largest shareholders, Nitto Tochi Tatemono, will absorb Sanyo
Finance Company, a financially-troubled affiliate, writes Robert Thomson in
Tokyo.
Nitto Tochi, a property management company run by the founders of the
securities house, will take over the financial company, which was hurt by
its Y25bn exposure to the bankrupt Yuho Chemical.
After the failure of Yuho in late 1990, Japan's Ministry of Finance asked
leading brokers to report on the activities of their financial affiliates.
Later, the ministry warned the brokers to ensure that these affiliates were
prudent in their lending.

CHEMICAL Banking Corporation, the US bank resulting from the merger of
Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, pushed ahead with its Dollars
1.36bn share offering yesterday, the largest international equity deal to
emerge so far this year.
The share issue was priced at Dollars 27.25 per share, representing a
discount of 2.2 per cent on Tuesday's closing price of Dollars 27.875.
The issue was for 50m shares, including 5m shares available for
international investors, and there is a 15 per cent over-allotment option.

MARRIOTT, the large US hotels chain, yesterday announced an expansion of its
presence in the UK market through a franchising agreement that will bring 18
Scott's Hotels outlets, with some 3,000 rooms, under the Marriott brand
name, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
Scott's, a Toronto-based company which has been operating hotels in Britain
since 1970, will continue to own and run the hotels which will be converted
to the Marriott name.
Scott will benefit from access to Marriott's worldwide reservations system.
Marriott, which already manages two hotels in the UK, will get reservations
fees and the large presence it has long been seeking in the British market.
It claimed yesterday that the deal would push it into the UK's top 10 hotel
groups ranked by number of rooms. Only 23 of Marriott's near-700 hotels are
outside the US, but it is now starting a major international expansion.

MR Umberto Agnelli, vice-president of Istituto Finanziario Italiano, the
Agnellis' holding company, said his family would not launch a counter-bid
for Source Perrier, Reuter reports from Rome.
The French mineral water and cheese company is currently subject to a
FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.48bn) bid by Nestle, the Swiss food group and
Indosuez, the French bank.
Mr Agnelli said his family and its partners in Exor, Perrier's parent, were
sure they would be able to maintain control of the French firm.
Exor, currently being bid for by Agnelli's food holding company Ifint,
together with allies Saint Louis Bouchon and Societe Generale units, Omnico
and Geneval, control 49.3 per cent of Perrier.

<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the Montreal-based transport equipment maker, is expanding its
airframe manufacturing business by buying a 51 per cent interest in
loss-making de Havilland of Canada with assistance from the Canadian and
Ontario governments.
A new corporate entity, to be known as de Havilland Inc, is to purchase
assets worth CDollars 260m (USDollars 224.10m) from Boeing of Seattle, which
has owned de Havilland since 1986. Boeing will receive CDollars 70m in cash.
The buyers will also assume liabilities of about CDollars 190m.
The province of Ontario will have a 49 per cent equity stake in de
Havilland, but Bombardier will have the right to acquire that interest after
four years. Ontario and the federal government have also provided various
other financial inducements.
The two governments have been desperate to find a buyer for de Havilland
since a bid by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia was blocked by the
European Commission last September. The EC contended that the proposed
takeover would have created a dominant player in the European commuter
aircraft industry.
The 63-year-old company has enormous symbolic value to Canada. Maker of such
famous aircraft as the Tiger Moth, the Mosquito and the Twin Otter, it is
one of only two airframe builders in Canada and one of the biggest
industrial employers in the Toronto area.
De Havilland's only remaining product is the twin-engined Dash-8.
The de Havilland purchase marks Bombardier's fourth investment in an
aircraft manufacturer. It already controls Short Bros of Belfast, the US
business jet maker Learjet, and Canadair, the Montreal-based manufacturer of
business jets and fire-fighting aircraft.
Boeing put de Havilland on the block almost two years ago after losing
patience with the company, which last made a profit in 1982. Although its
products are widely respected, de Havilland has been bedevilled by high
costs, low productivity and uncertainty over its future.

ICI Australia, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, cannot confidently

Sales for the three months to December were 3 per cent down on the same

He said the immediate outlook was dominated by the uncertainty of both

<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL cost containment and productivity increases at the Randfontein
mine allowed Johannesburg Consolidated Investment's (JCI) gold mines to show
a 28.6 increase in net profits for the December quarter.
Net profits rose to R58.4m (Dollars 20.90m) from R45.4m the previous
quarter. Of this, R54.5m came from Randfontein, which recorded a 46.1 per
cent rise.
A large part of Randfontein's success arose from a productivity bonus scheme
agreed with workers in exchange for a low annual wage increase last year.
The mine produced 7,821kg of gold at R26,018 per kg in the December 1991
quarter, compared with 7,363kg at R27,694 per kg in the December 1990
quarter.
Mr Bill Nairn, managing director of the gold and uranium division, said
workers had received, in terms of the productivity scheme, about 23 per cent
of the benefits from the mine's improved performance. This involved the mine
paying out about R5.2m in productivity bonuses during the quarter, which
translates to a wage rise of about 12 per cent.
The interim dividend was lifted by 25 per cent to 25 cents per share.

<TEXT>
COLES MYER, Australia's biggest retailer, has signalled further
concentration on its core operations with a decision to put its Sandhurst
Farms agribusiness offshoot up for sale.
Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive, announced the move yesterday, saying the
company could no longer justify retention of a business of such magnitude.
'We are predominantly a retail operation and fresh food manufacture no
longer fits comfortably into our business structure,' he said. 'Further, the
rapid expansion of Sandhurst means that it has outgrown the reason for its
acquisition which was to supply dairy and beef products to our supermarkets
divisions.'
Coles Myer acquired Sandhurst in 1987 and developed it into one of the
country's largest agribusiness operations with annual sales of about
ADollars 120m (USDollars 88.2m) involving 75m litres of milk and 60,000 head
of cattle.

Algoma

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES of loss-making Algoma Steel will end up controlling Canada's third
biggest steelmaker under restructuring proposals filed in an Ontario court
yesterday.
The innovative rescue plan, which still requires approval of all parties,
provides for Algoma to be restructured in a new corporate entity in which 60
per cent of the common shares will be issued to employees over five years.
Workers and senior management will also have eight of the 13 seats on the
company's board of directors.
The remaining 40 per cent of the equity will be held by creditors and
preferred shareholders.
The plan requires concessions from all participants in the rescue. The
workforce will be cut by 1,600 people, over one quarter of the total.
Remaining employees will forego CDollars 200m (USDollars 172.4m) in
compensation and benefits over five years.
Algoma is a subsidiary of Dofasco, Canada's biggest steelmaker, which bought
it in 1988 from Canadian Pacific. The company has been bedevilled by
problems, ranging from the remote location of its plant in Sault Ste-Marie,
at the eastern edge of Lake Superior, to high labour costs and a
debilitating strike in 1990.
Dofasco wrote off its entire investment in 1990. Algoma suffered a CDollars
9.4m loss in the first nine months of last year, following a CDollars 702m
loss, including large writedowns, in 1990. It has debts of about CDollars
800m, and has been operating under court protection for the past year.
Under the restructuring plan, Dofasco will receive preferred shares in
exchange for debentures it holds, but will forego any common shares to which
it may be entitled. It has pledged a capital injection of CDollars 40m in
exchange for CDollars 300m of tax losses.
The Ontario government will provide a CDollars 75m loan guarantee. The
Ontario and Canadian governments will also guarantee part of a CDollars 40m
operating credit to be provided by Royal Bank of Canada.
Mr Earl Joudrie, recently appointed chairman, said the proposals are a
compromise which should resolve Algoma's immediate cash requirements,
restore long-term financial stability, establish a realistic capital
structure and improve the company's competitive position.

MINNESOTA, Mining &amp; Manufacturing (3M), the St Paul, Minnesota-based
conglomerate, has registered its first full-year decline in earnings since
1985. Net 1991 income fell to Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 5.26 a share, from
Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 5.91, in 1990.
Annual sales of the group, whose interests range from office supplies and
industrial materials to health care products, were up by 2.5 per cent to
Dollars 13.34bn, from Dollars 13.02bn in 1990.
Mr ID DeSimone, chairman, said a weak global economy was the main reason for
the company's poorer performance, though higher research and development
spending and depreciation expense also affected profits.
Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 259m, or Dollars 1.18, down 12.2 per
cent from Dollars 295m, or Dollars 1.34, last year.
Currency fluctuations shaved 7 cents per share off the last quarter's
results, and lower non-operating income cut them another 9 cents.
Fourth-quarter sales were down to Dollars 3.22bn from Dollars 3.28bn for the
year-ago period.
The US recession continued to hold back domestic demand for 3M products, but
foreign demand was relatively robust. 3M's US sales declined by 1 per cent,
while foreign sales rose by 6 per cent.
Mr DeSimone said he had 'yet to see evidence of meaningful economic
recovery' in the US, and he did not expect to see a significant earnings
improvement until the second half of the year.
But with better economic growth predicted for foreign markets, Mr DeSimone
believes the company will grow faster abroad.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH Corona, the US typewriter manufacturer 48 per cent owned by Hanson
group of the UK, yesterday turned in essentially flat second-quarter
earnings after a weak first quarter.
The Connecticut-based company earned Dollars 7m, or 23 cents a share, in the
three months to December 31, compared with Dollars 6.8m, or 23 cents, a year
earlier. Sales were Dollars 111.7m in the 1991 second quarter, up from
Dollars 106.7m the previous year.
The latest second-quarter results include a pre-tax provision of Dollars 2m
to cover the cost of replacing software chips in personal world processors.
The company also took a Dollars 5m charge to settle a shareholder class
action suit, but this was recorded as paid-in capital and was not charged
against the company's earnings.
For the first half, Smith Corona's earnings slid to Dollars 11.1m, or 37
cents, from Dollars 13.5m, or 45 cents, a year ago. Revenues fell to Dollars
198.9m in 1991 from Dollars 225.3m.
Smith Corona is benefiting from reduced borrowing levels and lower interest
rates, which have cut the company's interest expense. Long-term debt at the
end of the second quarter was Dollars 27m, compared with Dollars 56m a year
earlier.
Mr Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive, attributed the improved
second-quarter performance to better US sales of typewriter and personal
word processors that more than compensated for a decline in international
markets.
In recent years, the group has been hit by eroding demand and strong pricing
pressures.
'We are particularly gratified with an improvement in demand in domestic
markets in a recessionary environment,' he said.

<TEXT>
SUN MICROSYSTEMS, the leading manufacturer of computer workstations, and
Cray Research, the world leader in very high performance supercomputers, are
to collaborate in the development of technology that will enable their
products to work together more efficiently.
Workstations are widely used in computer-aided design applications such as
mechanical or electronic design, while supercomputer power is typically
applied to the most challenging computing tasks such as modelling the
performance of an airframe design.
Both types of computers may, therefore, be used for related tasks.
Cray Research will use technology developed by Sun Microsystems to build
high performance computers based upon Sun's SPARC reduced instruction set
computing (Risc) microprocessors.
Cray said it intended to produce new high-end SPARC servers that are planned
for delivery late in 1993, and may cost in the Dollars 1mto Dollars 3m
range.
However, it denied reports it might build a new type of supercomputer,
called a massively parallel processor (MPP), based upon the SPARC chip.
Cray is facing mounting competition from several new MPP entrants into the
supercomputer, including Intel, the leading US microprocessor manufacturer.
The agreement with Cray boosts Sun Microsystems' efforts to encourage the
development of a wide range of computers based upon its SPARC architecture.
For its part, Cray is diversifying its product line to include lower-cost
computers at a time when sales of big supercomputers, which can cost as much
as Dollars 20m, are flat.

YAMANOUCHI Pharmaceutical of Tokyo has taken a 29 per cent stake in Roberts

Yamanouchi will buy 4m newly-issued shares in Roberts at Dollars 23.84 a

The move appears to be part of a growing trend of alliances between US and

network in the US. Roberts may have access to Yamanouchi's manufacturing

<TEXT>
FOURTH-QUARTER earnings of Amoco, the US oil and natural gas group with
large interests in chemicals, fell to Dollars 200m, or 40 cents a share,
from Dollars 538m, or Dollars 1.07, in the corresponding quarter of 1990,
Reuter reports from Chicago.
The group attributed the fall in earnings to lower crude oil prices and
higher exploration expenses. Crude oil prices averaged Dollars 20 a barrel,
or more than Dollars 10 a barrel below the 1990 fourth-quarter level.
Exploration expenses were up Dollars 85m.
Amoco added that its chemical operations incurred loss in the quarter,
reflecting a soft economy and industry overcapacity.
Amoco's 1991 full-year profits declined to Dollars 1.53bn, or Dollars 3.07 a
share, from Dollars 1.91bn, or Dollars 3.77, in 1990. The 1991 net includes
a Dollars 311m, or 62 cents-a-share gain.
Worldwide capital and exploration expenditures in 1991 amounted to Dollars
3.9bn, compared with Dollars 3.7bn in 1990.
Amoco recently announced a capital and exploration expenditure budget of
Dollars 3.7bn for 1992.
Domestic exploration and production operations earned Dollars 107m in the
fourth quarter, while foreign exploration and production earnings amounted
to Dollars 46m.
Refining, marketing and transportation activities reported a profit of
Dollars 109m.
Chemical operations incurred a Dollars 31m loss reflecting lower margins and
volumes for most product lines, and charges and writedowns from streamlining
operations.
Full-year 1991 worldwide net liquids production averaged 744,000 barrels a
day, down from 782,000 barrels in 1990.
'Lower crude oil and natural gas prices were in sharp contrast to the 1990
fourth quarter when the Kuwaiti crisis and uncertainty over supplies led to
significantly higher prices,' said Amoco's chairman, Mr H. Laurance Fuller.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: One-off gain helps USAir to
Dollars 1.6m net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USAIR, one of the middle-ranking US carriers, yesterday unveiled a tiny
Dollars 1.63m net profit in the final quarter of 1991. The result was a
sharp improvement on the Dollars 221.1m loss in the same period a year
earlier, when the Gulf-inspired fuel price increase hit the entire industry.
Comparisons, however, are confused by a one-time pre-tax gain of Dollars
107m due to the freezing of a fully-funded salaried employees' pension plan.
This will be replaced in 1993 by a defined contribution pension scheme.
Sharply lower fuel prices also helped, as did the absence of restructuring
charges, which knocked Dollars 90m off the 1990 fourth-quarter figures.
Nevertheless, the company, whose operations are heavily biased towards the
east coast, did manage a Dollars 61.2m operating profit in the final
quarter, compared with a Dollars 270.1m loss a year ago. This was then
largely eroded at the after-tax level by a net Dollars 58.3m interest
charge. Seth Schofield, USAir's chief executive, suggested that the company
did see some improvement in the final quarter, although he warned that 1992
could still be a difficult year for the industry.
USAir is still showing a Dollars 305.3m loss after tax for the year, or a
Dollars 414.8m deficit at the pre-tax level - although at one stage in 1991
it was predicting a pre-tax deficit of over Dollars 500m.
Shares in the company closed  7/8 higher at 16 3/8 yesterday, ahead of the
results' release. They are now double their lows in 1991, when fears about
the company's long-term future were rife.

<TEXT>
UNION PACIFIC, one of the largest US railroad companies, kicked off the
sector's reporting season with news of an 8 per cent improvement in
fourth-quarter operating income at Dollars 359m.
At the after-tax level, this reduced to a 5 per cent gain, but the railroad
operations earned Dollars 163m, up 13 per cent on the previous year.
The company said the operating environment throughout 1991 was 'very
difficult', but car loadings during the 12 months had increased by around 4
per cent, despite an industry drop of 3 per cent.
It also held out some hope for an improvement in 1992. 'We remain cautiously
optimistic about the coming year,' commented Mr Drew Lewis, Union Pacific's
chief executive.
Nevertheless, shares in Union Pacific, whose track is concentrated west of
the Mississippi, still closed Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 46 3/4 .
Later in the day, CSX, another of the large transportation companies, also
reported an underlying 4 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net earnings,
to Dollars 134m. The company had already warned of a Dollars 755m one-off
charge to cover labour reductions and other productivity moves, and after
this, the net loss for the quarter was Dollars 356m. The net loss for the
year, after the charge, was Dollars 272m - compared with 1990's profit of
Dollars 416m.
Like CSX, Union Pacific figures for the full year bear the brunt of a hefty
Dollars 870m pre-tax special charge, taken in the third quarter to cover
labour productivity changes, including large redundancies, and the
abandonment of certain light-used track. After this charge, 1991 operating
profits fell from Dollars 1.32bn to Dollars 461m, on revenues of Dollars
7.02bn, against Dollars 6.96bn. Net income fell to Dollars 64m, against
Dollars 618m in the previous year.
Meanwhile, at Santa Fe Pacific - a third railroad operator owning the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, together with other minerals and
pipeline interests - fourth-quarter results showed a Dollars 32.8m profit
after tax, a considerable advance on the Dollars 54.6m loss in the same
period a year earlier. Operating profits from the rail business reached
Dollars 65.1m, compared with Dollars 22.4m in the final quarter of 1990,
with car loadings up by 8 per cent.
For the full year, net income was Dollars 96.4m against a Dollars 111.8m
loss. The shares closed Dollars  3/8 down at Dollars 12 3/4 .

BANC ONE, the strongly capitalised, Ohio-based commercial banking group that
has been expanding by acquisition, yesterday unveiled a 25 per cent increase
in net profits for 1991, to Dollars 529.5m.
The bank, which made several acquisitions last year, has outperformed the
troubled US banking industry by following a conservative lending policy and
concentrating on its lucrative business areas in and near the Mid-west.
Banc One's ratio of common equity to total assets at year-end was 7.7 per
cent, well above the industry average and more than double the capital ratio
of Citicorp, the biggest US bank.
The bank's return on assets was 1.56 per cent and its return on equity was
16.6 per cent.
Banc One's acquisitions last year, which included First Illinois and banks
in Indiana, Kentucky and Colorado, helped its total assets to grow by more
than Dollars 12bn, to Dollars 46.3bn. The bank raised Dollars 570m of new
equity capital during 1991.
In the fourth quarter of 1991, Banc One's net profits rose by 33 per cent,
to Dollars 144.3m. The fourth-quarter results included for the first time
the operations of Banc One in Texas on a consolidated basis.
Banc One's bad debt provisions were Dollars 154m during the fourth quarter.
Net write-offs amounted to Dollars 142m.
On Wall Street, Banc One's share price closed Dollars 1 1/2 higher at
Dollars 49 5/8.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Revco files new proposals for
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVCO, the Ohio-based drugstore retailer which has been in bankruptcy since
1988, yesterday filed an amended reorganisation plan with the bankruptcy
court - improving the cash recovery element from an earlier scheme.
Revco creditors are already facing a reorganisation proposal from Jack
Eckerd, a rival chain, which essentially involves Eckerd acquiring Revco.
Yesterday, Revco said it was tabling its new plan in order to give creditors
a choice.
It added that the new scheme should give creditors recoveries 'equal to or
better than other plans in the case' and should 'ensure an independent
Revco, proposes no massive store closings and preserves thousands of jobs'.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Heavy trade in Zale bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A bankruptcy decision looms today for Zale Corporation, the largest
retail jeweller in the US, analysts reported volatile trading in the various
debt issues belonging to company and its subsidiaries.
The retail group faces an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed by
bondholders in early January. At midnight today, a 20-day response period
for Zale expires, and a court hearing has been scheduled for Friday morning.
The initial response of Zale to the filing was to suggest the bondholders'
move was 'unfortunate' and that it would prefer to achieve an out-of-court
reorganisation. Since then, analysts suggest, the company has sought to win
support among creditors for a restructuring that would involve a
'pre-packaged bankruptcy' - where the bankruptcy process is used briefly, to
implement technically a financial reorganisation.
But some observers still thought it likely that Zale would be forced to
accede to the Chapter 11 petition, and that a full bankruptcy process would
result.

CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment, reported a
Dollars 404m annual loss for 1991, compared with earnings of Dollars 210m in
1990. The loss per share for last year was Dollars 4.00, compared with
earnings per share in 1990 of Dollars 2.07.
The loss was attributed primarily to a Dollars 373m pre-tax, non-recurring
charge, most of which was taken in the fourth quarter, and a 12 per cent
decline in physical sales volume. The charge was for plant closings and
employee redundancy costs.
Although the company has been embroiled in a labour dispute with the United
Auto Workers since the start of last November, it said this did not have a
significant effect on the deterioration in sales. It did, however, admit
that with some 9,300 workers idled, operations have been disrupted.
The company's outlook for this year is also clouded by the labour dispute.
It said that because of the uncertainties about the economy and resolving
the labour problems, it was 'not practical to forecast 1992 profitability at
this time'.
But it is expected that the first quarter of 1992 will be unprofitable.
In the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of Dollars 318m, or
Dollars 3.16 per share. This compares with earnings of Dollars 11m, or 11
cents, in the year-ago period.
A non-recurring Dollars 324m charge was taken in the fourth quarter. Most of
this was related to the closings of a York, Pennsylvania plant and the
consolidation of two plants into one in Brazil.
Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter were Dollars 2.46bn, down by
Dollars 299m from the 1990 period.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Independent's owner hopes for modest profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on
Sunday, is hoping for a modest profit in the year to September in spite of
one of the worst advertising recessions for broadsheet newspapers for
decades.
Last year NP incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.3m, although this included
a Pounds 1.5m provision for redundancy costs. Last September the company
completed an Pounds 8.25m refinancing.
Now there are growing hopes that a taxable profit of about Pounds 500,000 is
possible this year even though there are still few signs of the recession
lifting.
The first hint of financially better times for The Independent came
yesterday at NP's annual meeting when Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor and
chief executive, said the company had achieved a 'worthwhile' profit in its
first quarter. This compares with a loss of Pounds 1m for the same period in
1990.
The company's first quarter includes the strong newspaper advertising months
of October and November and the second quarter will be much more difficult.
'Moreover, the recession still lies heavily on our readers and on our
advertising customers. There is no buoyancy in our markets,' Mr Whittam
Smith said.
'Nonetheless we have got ourselves into a position in which we can make
progress in difficult trading conditions,' he added.
It is clear that the company hopes that the 'progress' will include a year
in the black, even if only modestly so.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Geevor looks for new lease of life from
reverse takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEEVOR, the UK mining company with an 85-year history, is likely to be
swallowed up in a Pounds 10m reverse takeover which will give it new assets,
management and ownership.
Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, chairman, said yesterday that a private UK company,
which he refused to identify, would be putting its North American assets
into Geevor in exchange for shares which would give the vendors a
substantial majority of the enlarged capital.
The assets include an underground coal mine in Pennsylvania which had been
operating for 10 years, underground and surface coal reserves and resources,
two operating coal reprocessing plants and coal refuse tips, and various
gold and silver mining interests.
These would be expected to generate an operating cash flow for Geevor and
offer potential for further expansion.
Mr Wellesley-Wood pointed out that the operations were similar to those
previously held by Geevor, so present shareholders would have an interest in
a similar company.
Geevor shares were suspended at 4 3/4 p yesterday, pending the outcome of
negotiations involving Smith New Court for Geevor and Charterhouse for the
vendors. He suggested talks would take at least another two weeks. The
proposed deal would be subject to shareholders' approval.
Interest on the Pounds 1.25m 10 per cent secured convertible loan notes
1996, due on December 31 but deferred at that time, would be paid in full on
completion of the proposed deal.
The loan notes were issued after Geevor was nearly killed off when the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce withdrew banking facilities last year in
controversial circumstances. Some shareholders took up the loan notes partly
so that Geevor could pursue the bank in the courts.
Mr Wellesley-Wood said that, should the reverse takeover be approved,
Geevor's name would be changed - probably to Phoenix Mining.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London &amp; Clydesdale Holdings, a housebuilder which operates throughout
Scotland, finished the year to September 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.82m - much in line with market expectations.
The profit was generated from turnover of Pounds 21.4m, and compared with
Pounds 3.31m from sales of Pounds 20.8m in 1989-90.
Interest charges more than doubled to Pounds 1.54m mainly reflecting the
acquisition of sites and retention of an investment property which provided
an additional rental of Pounds 200,000.
Earnings per share fell to 14.9p (24.5p) and the total dividend is again 7p
with a final of 5.2p. The tax charge benefited from certain expenses
previously incurred now being allowed against tax.
Mr Norman Chalmers, chairman, said current house sales were down on last
year. 'We are present discounting to achieve sales and consequently do not
anticipate a particularly good result for the first six months'.
Commercial property should contribute again to the year's results.

purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A newly-formed property investment company has spent Pounds 12.5m on buying
a portfolio of industrial property in the north-east of England and two
industrial estates in Dorset.
North Eastern Industrial Properties was set up by Prime Estates
(Northumbria), an associate of Hunting Gate Group, a private property and
construction group, Charterhouse Property Services, part of the bank, and TR
Property Investment Trust, which has just bought New England Properties, a
USM-quoted property company.
It bought the properties from English Industrial Estates, the government
funded property company, and from EP Investments, an associate of Hunting
Gate Group.
The investors subscribed for 4.15m preferred ordinary shares at Pounds 1
each. In addition a Pounds 9.4m loan was provided by Bayerische
Hypotheken-Und Wechsel-Bank.
The properties, which cover 926,000 sq ft, offer a relatively high yield of
12 per cent.
Mr Jonathan Walters, group chief executive of Hunting Gate Group, considered
there was potential for rental growth since the price of the buildings was
below its replacement cost with rents as low as Pounds 1 per sq ft.
Mr Walters said that investors in North Eastern Industrial Properties were
brought together by Lazard Brothers, which acted as the placing agent.
Hunting Gate Property Services, a subsidiary of Hunting Gate Group, was
advising NEIP on the management of the portfolio.

McKay Securities, the Berkshire-based property group, bucked the sector
trend with a rise from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 2.01m in pre-tax profits for

The increase reflected gross rents and service charges ahead to Pounds 5.48m

(Pounds 1.18m) although this excluded Pounds 378,213 (Pounds 633,010) of

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TREVIAN Holdings, the USM-quoted property investment, development and
trading group, has recommended an offer from fellow property group Frogmore
Estates.
The bid follows the sale by Mr Lewis Davis, Trevian managing director, of
his 12.9 per cent holding to Frogmore, which as a result owns 42 per cent of
Trevian.
Frogmore is offering 45p cash for each of the outstanding shares, thereby
valuing the company at about Pounds 4.95m. Mr Lewis yesterday resigned from
the boards of Trevian, its subsidiaries and its associates.
The offer represents a premium of about 12.5 per cent over the mid-market
quotation of ordinary shares at the close of business on Tuesday. Trevian's
shares yesterday closed up 3p at 43p while Frogmore finished down 2p at
320p.
Trevian also reported pre-tax losses reduced to Pounds 341,000 (Pounds
423,000) in the six months to October 5. This figure incorporated provisions
against certain trading properties. Turnover rose to Pounds 490,000 (Pounds
410,000) and losses per share were cut to 3.6p (4.1p).

FT  23 JAN 92 / LEP shares fall after warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP Group, the troubled security and freight forwarding group, saw its
already depressed shares halved to 8 1/2 p yesterday after it announced that
it would have to make 'a very substantial amount of write-offs and
provisions' against its property exposure and renegotiate its finances.
The refinancing of the group's Pounds 470m debt is likely to lead to a
partial swap of debt for equity by its bankers and follows a refinancing
agreed in September.
That agreement was 'basically a holding position whilst we ascertained what
the long-term needs (of the group) would be', according to Mr John East,
finance director.
Shares in ADT, the security group which owns 27 per cent of LEP, also
dropped on the news, losing 3 per cent to 423p.
LEP Group said that write-offs and provisions would have to be made for
'most or all' of its exposure to US property, as well as some of its UK
property exposure. The sum is likely to be significantly higher than the
Pounds 20m extraordinary provision it suggested it would have to make
against its US property exposure, when it reported interim results in
September.
LEP's involvement in US property is mainly in California, where property
values have been particularly hard hit. The group's US properties were
valued in its 1990 accounts at Dollars 150m (Pounds 83.70m).
Further provisions are likely to be needed against its UK properties which
were valued at the end of December 1990 at about Pounds 145m. Most of this
relates to the Swiss Bank House, which is in the books at Pounds 123m. The
UK properties are being individually valued, Mr East said. The group's dire
financial situation has triggered an extensive reassessment of its
activities. 'We're reviewing the whole business,' Mr East said.
After discussions with bankers, LEP is reconsidering the disposal of its US
security business, National Guardian Corporation, which was planned to
reduce debt.
The US business has been on the market since at least June last year and
talks were continuing with two prospective buyers, Mr East said.
However, if the banks decided to take a long-term view of the group by
converting some of their debt into equity, they might decide that in the
long run it would be better to keep NGC as part of the group, according to
LEP's financial adviser.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Greenalls enfranchises shares amid rights issue speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALLS, the UK pubs and hotels group, is to abolish the two-tier share
structure that has enabled the Greenall family to maintain control of the
company.
Enfranchisement of the group's shares will complete its transformation from
a 230-year-old family-owned regional brewer into a national retailer.
The move roused speculation yesterday that it was the prelude to a rights
issue to fund a large acquisition, either of pubs or hotels, and sparked a
stock exchange scrutiny of share dealings prior to the announcement.
Under the enfranchisement proposals, 'A' shareholders, who have had superior
voting rights, will get one ordinary share for every two 'A' shares.
The price of the 'A' shares, which had been unchanged at 153p since December
3, rose sharply on Tuesday to 171p, a gain of 18 per cent. They rose again
yesterday to 207p before closing at 199p, a gain of 28p.
Mr Andrew Thomas, managing director, denied there were any plans for a
rights issue or any immediate acquisition. But he added: 'It is important
that the company has maximum flexibility in terms of access to financial
markets in order to respond rapidly to opportunities for investing in
existing business areas as they arise.'
Changing the share structure would help provide that flexibility by
increasing the number of institutional investors and improving the
marketability of the shares. Mr Thomas, 49, who is to become chairman and
chief executive in September, conceded the changes could make the group more
vulnerable to a bid, but they would help expansion.
The group would like to add at least another 100 pubs to its estate of
1,400; and to increase its 105 catering inns and budget hotels by about 50
per cent. It has ambitions to add to its De Vere hotel chain, particularly
in London; and it aims to establish a substantial presence in the
off-licence business. The changes in the share structure will reduce the
voting rights of the Greenall family interests from 53 per cent to 17 per
cent.
The family, which comprises Lord Daresbury, his four children and 11
grandchildren, will get Pounds 24.7m from the placing by Cazenove of 6.5m
shares with institutions at 380p a share, leaving them with a holding of 24m
shares. The ordinary shares rose 1p yesterday to close at at 398p.

FT  23 JAN 92 / The knife comes out for a second time / A report on
restructuring at United Technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not every day that the chairman of one of the largest companies in the
US announces that he is setting in motion 'a transformation that is more
profound and more potent than any single event in the corporation's
history'.
Yet that was the message this week from Mr Robert Daniell, chairman of
United Technologies, the Connecticut-based aerospace and building products
group best known for its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engines, Sikorsky helicopters,
Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners.
Mr Daniell was announcing plans for restructuring the business over the next
two years, which will involve: the elimination of 13,900 jobs, about 7 per
cent of the workforce; the closure or consolidation of more than 100
facilities around the world; improvements in product design, engineering and
manufacturing processes; and a Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 708m) charge against
fourth-quarter earnings, pushing UTC to a net loss of Dollars 1.02bn in
1991.
The goal is to improve UTC's financial performance, which has been hit by
recession and a downturn in US defence spending, and boost its return on
equity to 18 per cent by 1994, compared with about 15 per cent in 1990.
Since the summer, the company has been signalling its intentions to cut
costs yet Wall Street was surprised and impressed by the scale of this
week's pruning, while a little sceptical over how easily UTC can achieve its
aims.
UTC faces tough markets for many of its main products over the next few
years, and some analysts still need convincing that, in spite of a widely
praised shake-up at the group over the past five years, its management is
ruthless enough to achieve the necessary change. That is presumably why Mr
Daniell went out of his way this week to assure Wall Street that 'United
Technologies will be a very different company, leaner and tougher minded'.
UTC has already improved on the bureaucratic, complacent business that Mr
Daniell took over as chief executive in the mid-1980s. At that time,
customers of Pratt &amp; Whitney, one of the world's big three aero-engine
manufacturers and UTC's most important business, were so tired of poor
service that they were deserting to US rival, General Electric.
Mr Daniell set about the kind of cultural change many large US corporations
are now attempting: pushing responsibility from the centre to smaller groups
more responsive to customers, while cutting costs by staff reductions and
improvements in manufacturing techniques and stock control.
The changes had a dramatic effect. Pratt cut its manufacturing costs by 21
per cent between 1987 and 1991, while its improved service and new PW4000
engine for wide-bodied jets helped push its share of firm aero-engine market
orders from 29 per cent in 1988 to 35 per cent in 1990. UTC's net income
rose from Dollars 636m in 1985 to Dollars 751m in 1990, with Pratt
accounting for 60 per cent of operating profits.
However, the past year has seen UTC's financial performance reverse, with
group operating profits dropping from Dollars 1.65bn in 1990 to Dollars 968m
on virtually unchanged revenues of Dollars 21bn. The most serious drop is in
its power division - essentially Pratt - where profits were halved from
Dollars 1.01bn to Dollars 502m. Like rivals GE and Britain's Rolls-Royce,
Pratt has been badly hit by the recession in the commercial airline business
and the wave of consolidations and bankruptcies among US carriers.
Sales of commercial spare parts, which aero-engine manufacturers rely on for
a large part of their profits, have slumped, while competition for new
orders is forcing manufacturers into give-away prices. Moreover, the end of
the Cold War and the gradual reduction in the Pentagon's budget means that
most US defence contractors face declining business.
The Otis elevator and Carrier air-conditioning businesses have also been
badly mauled by the severe downturn in the US building industry, while
depression in the car industry has hit UTC's autoparts division.
This much harsher environment has exposed UTC's reshaping over the past five
years as not having gone far enough, fast enough. Pratt &amp; Whitney, for
example, says its manufacturing costs are still 5 per cent higher than those
of rival GE Aircraft Engines. At the same time, Pratt's market share of firm
engine orders slipped back to 29 per cent last year.
Mr Daniell's new restructuring is meant to solve these problems. All UTC
businesses will be shedding staff and cutting production capacity, but the
biggest changes will be at Pratt, which will cut its labour force by 5,000,
or 11 per cent, and eliminate 30 per cent of its manufacturing space.
Pratt aims to be the industry's low-cost producer by 1994 and the changes
will also involve revamping its manufacturing processes and relations with
suppliers.
Unless the plan goes badly awry, Pratt's medium-term future should be
reasonably bright, because of its model range, emphasis on international
partnerships and the expected growth of world airline traffic in the second
half of the 1990s.
Otis and Carrier, the world leaders in their markets, would also benefit
from a recovery in the US economy. Carrier, which has repeatedly
disappointed Wall Street with poor earnings, may be about to benefit from a
burst of capital spending which could boost its market share.
It will probably take years to determine whether this week's package amounts
to the 'profound' transformation promised by Mr Daniell, or is a more
superficial recessionary remedy. But at the very least, the plan will give a
much-needed boost to UTC's profits potential over the next few years.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Stanhope, Rosehaugh merger talks cease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSEHAUGH and Stanhope, the indebted property companies which jointly own
the Broadgate office complex in the City of London, yesterday called a halt
to their merger talks.
The companies issued a statement to the stock exchange, saying 'agreement is
unlikely in the near future and . . . a further period of prolonged
uncertainty would not be in the best interests of shareholders'. The news
sent Stanhope's share price down from 25p to 23.5p and Rosehaugh's share
price down from 6 1/2 p to 5 1/4 p.
Ever since the talks were announced last summer, progress has been slow. One
of the problems facing the groups was getting agreement among their 70
banks. The banks, which had loans secured against more solid assets, were
concerned that a merger and reconstruction could impair the quality of their
loans.
Rosehaugh, which announced the breach of its covenants and pre-tax losses of
Pounds 227m in December, issued a statement to the stock exchange yesterday
which said discussions with its banks had always been on the basis that it
would remain an independent company.
Rosehaugh is trying to negotiate a medium-term facility with its banks. It
has a stand-still agreement until the end of the month which may need to be
renewed.
Both companies believed merger discussions might resume.
Stanhope, which was the stronger party in the talks, announced annual
pre-tax losses of Pounds 77m and a 30 per cent fall in net asset value in
October.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Maxwell investigators find seventh trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEVENTH secretive Liechtenstein foundation, the Hesto Trust, has been
uncovered by investigators who are probing an alleged scheme by the late Mr
Robert Maxwell to support the share price of Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
It also emerged yesterday that at least Pounds 200m missing from the public
Maxwell companies and their pension funds was used to buy shares in MCC in
April, June and July last year, and that to conceal the identity of the
buyer, the orders were placed by Swiss and Liechtenstein trusts managed by
independent lawyers.
It has now been established that in almost all of the 20 to 30 share deals
under investigation, the money to pay for the shares was channelled through
the private Maxwell companies, particularly Robert Maxwell Group and
Bishopsgate Investment Trust, and was not routed through the overseas
trusts.
That new evidence will intensify investigators' questions about whether
Goldman Sachs and other stockbrokers who sold shares - ostensibly to the
trusts - should have been aware of the real identity of the buyer.
At the time, Goldman obtained verbal confirmation from clients buying MCC
shares that they were not connected to Mr Maxwell, and written confirmation
subsequently from all but one.
Hesto, together with six other foundations, or 'stiftungs', named last week
by the Financial Times, is believed to have had a central role in the share
support operation.
The MCC shares ostensibly acquired by the overseas vehicles were held in
some of Mr Maxwell's 400 private companies.
The private companies used them as security to raise more loans - and then
used some of that money to buy more MCC shares, in a spiral which piled ever
greater amounts of debt on a tiny base of assets.
As well as the Pounds 200m used in concealed support of MCC shares,
investigators have traced Pounds 200m spent in raising Mr Maxwell's
publicly-declared holding in MCC from 51 per cent to 68 per cent, and a
further Pounds 100m in funding the 1991 trading losses of the private
Maxwell companies. It is unlikely that this money can be recovered.
No evidence has yet been found to suggest that the trusts have been used to
stockpile cash or assets, nor to route funds anywhere but back to Maxwell
companies.
Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, which has had more than 100 staff
administering the private Maxwell companies under UK insolvency law, said
yesterday that 'the majority of funds' flowing out of the private Group
appeared to have been consumed in buying MCC shares, in trading losses,
paying off the bank loans of some of the private companies, or in interest
payments on those loans.
Mr John Talbot, the joint administrator, said last night the sale of Vista
Computers Systems had been agreed. The administrators are believed to have
received several expressions of interest in the 51 per cent stake in Mirror
Group Newspapers.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Germans to vote on strikes as pay talks break down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of industrial strife in west Germany loomed yesterday as pay
talks in the steel and banking industries broke down and unions prepared for
strike ballots.
Mr Peter Ulrich Schmithals, the steel employers' chief negotiator, said
yesterday after 14 hours of fruitless pay talks with union leaders: 'That
was definitely our last negotiating attempt.' Both sides, deadlocked over a
1 percentage point difference, refused to call in independent arbitrators.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed again for moderate settlements. Forecasts
had shown some weakening in economic growth, but, he added: 'I see no
recessionary tendencies - provided wage settlements are reasonable.'
Steel unions have offered to reduce their claim of 10.5 per cent to around
6.5 per cent. However, Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of Thyssen Stahl, which
employs a third of all the country's steelworkers, said recently that he
would rather face a strike than pay more than 6 per cent.
The 100,000 members of the steel section of the IG Metall union will start a
strike ballot on Sunday evening. The result will be known by Friday. A 75
per cent majority is needed for the industry's 135,000 workers to be called
out on strike.
Union leaders said they had the resources to hold out for a long time.
However, the outcome of the vote is uncertain because job security has
become a real issue. The steel industry is in the throes of hefty
rationalisation. Thyssen Stahl, for example, last week reported a 42 per
cent profits slump for 1991, and warned of heavy job losses.
Observers said that market conditions and heavy stocks meant companies could
weather a short stoppage.
There were early warnings of more stress to come as union leaders
representing 360,000 engineering workers in the state of Hesse agreed to put
in a claim for 9.5 per cent.
This is likely to set the pattern for other regional branches of the IG
Metall engineering section, which claims to have almost 4m members in the
country's manufacturing sector. This, too, is suffering from the effects of
the economic slowdown.
The 3m-strong OTV public service union, demanding a 10 per cent pay
increase, has indicated its willingness to strike.
The white-collar HBV and DAG unions, representing most of west Germany's
430,000 bank and insurance workers, broke off negotiations yesterday and
said members would be balloted 'soon' on strike action. They have sought a
10.5 per cent rise, and been offered less than 5 per cent.
The roots of the tension in the labour market lie mainly in the stresses
caused by the costs of unification of Germany in October 1990.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Radical teaching reforms urged: Primary school report may
help end 'silly practices' says Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL reform of primary school teaching practices, rejecting the 'dogma of
recent decades', is urged in a report published yesterday. It also calls for
an emphasis on whole-class and subject-specific teaching.
'There is a need for fundamental changes in primary education,' said Mr
Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, responding to the report which the
government published. It was produced by three primary school experts
appointed by Mr Clarke only seven weeks ago.
Ministers have no direct powers over teaching practices, but the report will
be sent to every school and teacher training college in England and Wales.
Mr Clarke said he hoped it would 'help to get rid of some of the rather
silly practices which have crept into schools in recent decades'.
Dubbed the 'three wise men' by Mr Clarke, the report's authors are Professor
Robin Alexander of Leeds University, Mr Jim Rose, Her Majesty's chief
inspector of primary schools, and Mr Christopher Woodhead, chief executive
of the National Curriculum Council.
They highlight the marked decline in reading and numeracy standards revealed
by national tests for seven-year-olds last year. They also attack the
prevalence of 'highly questionable dogmas which have led to excessively
complex classroom practices and devalued the place of subjects in the
curriculum'. Instead, they urge an increase in single subject and whole
class teaching.
The report advocates the grouping of pupils by ability in each subject and
calls for all schools to have access to specialist expertise in all nine
national curriculum subjects.
Reform of primary teacher training is also implicit in the report. At
present, most primary school teachers take a four-year Bachelor of Education
course, which combines subject study with educational theory and teaching
practice. An increase in the teaching element and reductions in the theory
and overall course length are now likely.
The report was broadly welcomed by the opposition and teacher unions. Mr
Jack Straw, shadow education spokesman, said it was 'an important
contribution to the debate about teaching methods'. Mr Matthew Taylor,
Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'It backs what most teachers are
doing - a mixture of old and new methods.'
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the AMMA teachers' union, said the
report should lead to 'a real professional discussion' of the issues. But Mr
Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, condemned
it as 'rushed, based on the experience of just three people'.

FT  23 JAN 92 / US pledges extra Dollars 645m to former Soviet states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday called for a global effort to foster
democracy and free markets in the former Soviet Union, and pledged Dollars
645m (Pounds 360m) in fresh US technical and humanitarian aid to the newly
independent republics.
Mr Bush's announcement came at the opening of an international conference in
Washington called by the US in December to co-ordinate aid to the republics.
It appeared to be aimed at defusing tensions with European allies which have
criticised the US for dragging its feet over Soviet aid.
In a further conciliatory gesture, the US agreed to a follow-up aid
conference sponsored by the European Community in Lisbon before June. Unlike
the Washington meeting, the former Soviet republics will be invited to
attend.
In his speech, Mr Bush urged foreign ministers and senior officials from 47
countries and five international financial institutions to 'pull together'
to meet the historic challenge of winning the post-Cold War peace.
He paid tribute to the 'courageous' economic reforms carried out by Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, but he acknowledged that the challenge of
dismantling communism and centrally planned economies was enormous.
Ultimate success or failure rested squarely with the people of Russia,
Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia, he said.
Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who is hosting the
conference, praised the European Community, especially Germany, for
shouldering much of the burden of providing food, medicine and other
humanitarian aid to the former Soviet Union and the republics.
However, both of them avoided responding to Russia's request for a Dollars
7bn fund to stabilise the rouble and further money for a 'safety net'
against the shock of radical economic reform - both of which are regarded as
being vital to the transition to a free market.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said that the main industrialised
countries would soon have to confront Russia's request. It was 'not far over
the horizon,' he said.
The US and Britain want the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
to take the lead on macroeconomic reform.
Although the IMF and the bank are offering technical advice, direct
financial aid will be delayed until Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic states and
other reformist republics take up full membership of these institutions -
some time before the end of this year.
The Washington conference aims to map out 'action plans' on pooling and
distributing aid to the republics.
Total pledges from the leading industrialised nations and the EC amount to
Dollars 20bn, though the latest US pledge is dependent on Congressional
approval.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Bush facing pressure over taxes and economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday responded to fresh evidence of US economic
weakness and to pressure from Republican conservatives by saying he would
focus on measures to encourage jobs, investment and savings in his State of
the Union address next week.
Mr Bush said he would avoid purely political measures that would hurt the
economy by putting upward pressure on interest rates - a reference to calls
for tax cuts for middle-income Americans. Conservative Republicans in
Congress are trying to steer Mr Bush away from across-the-board income tax
cuts championed by leading Congressional Democrats.
The Republicans have threatened to unveil competing proposals if the
president fails to announce bold cuts in capital gains taxes as part of his
bid to stimulate growth.
The Federal Reserve's latest 'Beige Book' assessment of US regional economic
trends, released yesterday, offered no evidence of economic recovery.
Manufacturers reported steady or declining output in most districts and
weakening domestic order books. There was no sign of a revival in consumer
or business loan demand.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 15
per cent last year, making 1991 the worst year for the housing industry
since 1945. Building activity declined in every region of the economy.
Analysts, however, drew some comfort from a mild recovery of starts towards
the end of last year. Starts rose 2.6 per cent between November and
December.
Mr Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, an
independent adviser to Congress, said he expected lower interest rates to
spur a mild economic recovery in the second half of this year.
The CBO's semi-annual economic forecast predicts 1.6 per cent growth this
year, rising to 3.6 per cent next year. It cautions against a fiscal
stimulus, arguing that 'policies that would aid the economy's short-term
recovery are all too likely to undercut its long-run performance'.
Mr Bush's growth package is expected to include tax relief for first-time
homebuyers, tax incentives for personal savings, faster depreciation
allowances, lower capital gains taxes, tax relief for medical insurance and
a rise in the personal exemption, possibly restricted to taxpayers with
children.
Some conservative Republicans, however, fear Mr Bush will not strike the
right balance between short-term relief for hard-pressed individuals and
longer-term measures to stimulate business investment.

FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Rosehaugh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chances of a Rosehaugh/Stanhope merger were always limited, given the
complexity of their corporate structures and the difficulty of getting two
sets of shareholders and three groups of bankers to agree on anything. Even
so, last night's announcement that the talks have finally been called off
creates a rather unnerving vacuum.
One must assume that the trouble in the negotiations lay principally in
persuading Stanhope's bankers to take on the Rosehaugh rump, consisting of
its assets minus the 50 per cent stake in the RSD joint venture. Conspiracy
theory says that Stanhope would be happy for Rosehaugh to be put into
liquidation, thereby allowing it to achieve full control of RSD by the back
door. Such an idea hardly seems plausible. Stanhope's balance sheet and
profit and loss account could not stand the pressure, while a
capital-raising exercise would be out of all proportion to the size of the
company.
The theory also assumes the banks will pull the plug on Rosehaugh when the
standstill agreement expires at the end of next week. Whatever yesterday's
news may have done for sentiment, such a solution would serve little
purpose. An orderly liquidation of Rosehaugh assets is effectively under
way. Formalising the procedure would only precipitate bigger write-downs for
the banks and further destabilise a still fragile property market.

FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the stranger arguments doing the rounds in the oil market is that
Saudi Arabia is happy with low crude prices because it wants to see
President Bush re-elected - the theory being that cheap oil will help
stimulate the US economy in time for November's election. Given that most
oil shares have been struggling to overcome the effects of the depressed
crude price, it is perhaps worth considering a different view of Saudi
thinking.
The fact that the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates joined several Opec
colleagues and voluntarily cut their production two days ago sits oddly with
the notion that they want to keep prices below Dollars 18 per barrel, let
alone allow them to move even lower. The Saudi government will be acutely
aware that every Dollars 1 off the oil price reduces its revenues by Dollars
2.5bn at a time when the country is running a budget deficit estimated at
Dollars 8bn this year. There must be cheaper ways to help Mr Bush.
There is the additional consideration of the Saudis' role in the Middle East
after the Gulf war and the importance of establishing good relations with
Iran. Finally, the Saudis are doubtless aware a lengthy period of weak oil
prices could increase the danger of consumer countries slapping on
additional taxes to satisfy their consciences over the environment. The
forthcoming Opec meeting should resolve the argument, but the case for
slightly higher oil prices looks the stronger.

FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Greenalls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greenalls' decision to enfranchise Pounds 470m worth of its equity is a
useful blow for UK shareholder democracy. The reason for relinquishing
family control is simple enough; the company wants to tap the equity market.
But it is also significant that Greenalls had already broken with its
origins by getting out of brewing. Along with retailing, the brewing
industry is one of the last bastions of the non-voting share.
Even from a management viewpoint, non-voting equity is a two-edged
instrument. In protecting against takeover, it may perhaps allow a long-term
view of investment. The kind of company which needs protecting, though, is
likely to bear out the stock market dictum that a long-term investment is a
short-term investment gone wrong. More importantly, companies with
non-voting equity are faced with the choice of living strictly within their
means or accepting the risk of high gearing. A company such as GUS, which
has chosen the former route, has proved a correspondingly stodgy performer.
Whitbread, whose gearing is creeping upward as a result of its heavy
investment programme, may have to succumb to democracy in the long run.
Both companies might reflect on the fact that Greenalls' non-voting stock
went up yesterday by just 1p to 398p. This is partly technical, since the
exercise involves a 7 per cent dilution of the non-voting shares to
compensate the voting shares for loss of influence. That apart, the market
is partly bracing itself for a cash call to finance expansion, partly
reflecting that Greenalls is not in any case an obvious takeover candidate.
The reason is encouraging - that having freed itself from the toils of
history, Greenalls can now stand on its own feet.

FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Germany's winter of discontent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2522.0 (-21.4)
The Bundesbank's willingness to incur international unpopularity last
December by raising interest rates suggests that the looming threat of a
domestic steel strike will leave it unperturbed. Ultimately, its readiness
to take its foot off the monetary brake will depend on the outcome of the
wage round, not on the degree to which economic activity is disrupted in the
meantime. From that perspective, the breakdown in the steel talks has a
positive element which may explain the calm response of German financial
markets yesterday. It at least means the employers are not prepared to cave
in.
The steel workers are in a relatively weak situation, since over-supply and
depressed prices in Europe make their claim hard to press. A strike which
the unions lost would set a tough precedent for the much more important
engineering industry talks which have yet to start. Thus, even as the
industrial situation hots up, it is becoming possible to perceive an outcome
which would enable the Bundesbank to start cutting rates.
The problem is one of timing, as it looks as though the wage round will be
lengthy. The steel workers' contract actually expired last October. That of
the engineering workers does not expire until the end of March. If their
negotiations work to the same timetable, it could be well into the third
quarter before German rates fall. That would be far too late to influence
the timing of the UK election and so distant as to render forlorn any hope
of Germany agreeing to participate in concerted monetary easing at this
weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Don't jettison the fiscal autopilot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question. Does the Treasury want to see the savings ratio go up or down?
Alan Budd (Chief Economic Adviser to the Treasury): The question is what is
meant by 'want'? Our forecasts are based on the view that the savings ratio
will fall. In that sense, for our forecast to be correct, this does imply
that the savings ratio will fall, though it is currently at a very high
level. If one wants to talk about broader, longer-term issues, about what is
a desirable savings ratio, one might expect that a sustained higher savings
ratio would be desirable for this economy. So we are distinguishing between
whether a fall in the savings ratio might help the recovery, and where we
want that ratio to settle in the longer term.
Nicholas Budgen, MP. Is this not very confusing, because Mr Major's last
Budget as chancellor was designed to be a Budget for savings?
(Proceedings of Commons Treasury Committee, November 20 1991)
Fiscal policy is back in fashion. President Bush is planning to ask a
willing Congress for a stimulus despite the large amount of red ink in the
US Budget. If the British chancellor, Norman Lamont, cuts taxes and adds to
public spending in the next Budget, cynics will ascribe it to the
forthcoming election. Insiders will know that - so long as the headline size
is not too grotesque - the boost will have some official support. In any
case, any stimulus will take effect much too late to affect the election,
and can therefore only be justifiable on its merits.
The special reason that will be given for departing from the medium-term
approach to fiscal policy of the 1980s is that discretionary moves in
monetary policy are blocked by the European exchange rate mechanism.
The government may well say that the unexpectedly high German interest rates
following unification created a special situation for the UK, which
justifies the departure from the medium-term guideline of balancing the
budget over the business cycle. Under this guideline, which was adopted in
the 1980s, both deficits and surpluses are meant to be limited to the
automatic effects of recession and boom - the so-called built-in
stabilisers.
We should now pause for breath. After all the efforts to persuade people to
save, are policymakers now to stand on their heads and try to find
inducements to make consumers spend more, and move more slowly out of debt?
Contrary to what many suppose, this was not the view that John Maynard
Keynes usually espoused.
The real-life Lord Keynes was not happy with budget deficits on current
account. In the 1930s, he went around talking about the immense
opportunities for improving the public capital stock, including the visual
improvement of cities and the construction of buildings such as concert
halls and art galleries, while at the same time reducing unemployment. What
he wanted to see was a public-sector capital account split from the current
account and which would be used to finance investment projects.
It was only when Keynesianism took over from Keynes that the budget balance
was set aside and that tax cuts came to be regarded as even better demand
stimuli than public capital works. This was due not so much to pure theory,
as to Treasury convenience. While public spending projects take months or
years to come on stream, taxes can be changed on Budget day.
A genuine problem is how to distinguish capital from current public
spending. The old 'line' with which Keynes was familiar was a legislative
accident. If one looks at the more modern national income accounts, not
everything that is called capital expenditure is true investment. For
instance, the building of extra school lavatories counts as capital
expenditure, whereas paying more for science teachers would add to the
current deficit. The absence of a profit test makes assessment difficult.
There are many reasons why discretionary fiscal adjustments of all kinds - a
better term than 'fine tuning' - were abandoned in the 1980s. One standard
objection was to do with lags. By the time the diagnosis had been made, the
government acted and its measures took effect, the economy would already be
on the upturn.
A more profound caution is that demand management of any kind can only be
safely used to achieve nominal objectives - that is, a reasonable growth of
demand in money terms. Too many pronouncements, especially in the US, give
the impression that the president and the Fed have the power to determine
the economy's real rate of growth by injecting more spending power,
irrespective of inflation. There is less of this growthmanship in the
British Treasury, but there is still a danger of its re-emerging in the UK
in an election year.
Another objection used to be that if the money supply is kept to an
unchanged target path, a fiscal stimulus would be ineffective and simply
raise interest rates. As a result, private investment would be 'crowded
out'. This formulation is out of date at a time when an exchange rate
commitment has replaced the money supply objective, and when free capital
movements mean that government can borrow more in world capital markets
without bidding up local rates of interest.
There is still, however, a constraint at the international level. If several
governments start borrowing more, interest rates will rise in the face of a
money supply which in the EC at least is ultimately determined by the
Bundesbank. A fiscal stimulus in the ERM would be like the US states
borrowing more without any support from a Fed relaxation. They can try (if
their local constitutions permit); but I would not place too much hope on
it.
The one incontrovertible effect of budget deficits is the tax burden they
will represent in future years. The higher the present deficits, the higher
will be the future tax rate to service the national debt.
A further reason for caution is that the underlying British fiscal position
is not nearly as sound as it looks. In the Autumn Statement, the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement of 3 per cent of gross domestic product was
projected for the coming financial year. The Treasury Committee estimates
that this becomes 5 per cent if privatisation receipts, council house sales
and the like are added back. A thorough separation of capital from current
items might trim this total back to some 3 per cent of GDP - which is
already up against the presumptive limits agreed at Maastricht.
If we add together these underlying fiscal worries, the inconclusive nature
of the evidence for a prolonged recession stretching for years ahead, and
the fact that inflationary psychology is far from dead in the UK (as small
businessmen who receive rent review demands all tell me), the argument for
caution about a discretionary stimulus is overwhelming.
If something has to be done, my top priority would be to add to the capital
stock. If anything is done on the personal tax side, it should be
automatically reversible. The reason is not only to safeguard the fiscal
position, but also because people - and especially if they are in a careful
mood - will be more likely to respond to tax incentives which will run out
by a named date.
Thus the first candidate should be some improvement in business capital
allowances, which would run out within two years, and would not interfere
with the structural reforms of corporation tax in the 1983 Budget.
My second priority would be an increase in public capital spending - despite
all the difficulties and problems of abuse. For even if a conjunctual
mistake were made, we would still be left with some structures of lasting
value.
My third priority would be temporary reductions in indirect taxes. But in
contrast to past use of consumer tax as a regulator there would be an
announced date of when they could go into reverse.
The very last relief on my list - I am sorry - would be an income tax
reduction. No-one would believe that this would be temporary if the
Conservatives were returned; and public spending trends leave no scope for a
permanent reduction.
Thus I am still for limiting government discretion and for tying the hands
of the present and future ministers. This, after all, is one of the many
arguments for the ERM and an independent central bank.

need not look far for a company song now its name has been changed under
Boris Yeltsin's latest bit of organisational retuning.
'Tass' stood for (in translation) Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union. In

The odd thing about Peter Greenall, 38-year-old new managing director of
Warrington's Greenalls, is that he seems so keen to be seen as nothing more
than a regular business man.
He has plenty of perks not available to the ordinary executive. He lives in
the family village of Daresbury, four miles south of Warrington, and will
inherit the baronetcy when his father dies. Like his legendary grandfather,
he is a great fox-hunter, chairs Aintree racecourse, and reputedly enjoys
entertaining royals with his substantial fortune.
So why put up with the humdrum world of business?
The correlation between net worth and motivation is not very direct, he
says, citing Edgar Bronfman of Seagram as an example of a much wealthier
drinks merchant who works just as hard. Perhaps so, but it's rare indeed to
find the seventh generation of a firm-owning family prepared to work as hard
as the first.

It seems only yesterday that young Treasury economists were regularly
deserting to the City, doubling their salaries as they went. But now I hear
that Donald Franklin, Schroders' chief economist, has voluntarily moved the
other way to become a mere Treasury indian, or economic adviser, salary
range Pounds 24-37K.
Why? Boredom, he says; after nine years of churning out forecasts (a
Nintendo-like activity these days) he hungers for the red meat of policy.
Well, maybe; but real-life markets take little notice of economic forecasts
these days. As David Morrison of Goldman Sachs sourly remarked this week:
'It seems like an inefficient use of time to try to assess 'economic
pressures'.' Perhaps soon redundant, too.

A missed introduction has turned into a golden handshake for one Andre
Verbruggen. As sales director of the French office equipment firm ATAL, he
was manning his company's stand at a Brussels exhibition when up for a chat
rolled King Baudouin of the Belgians.
Alas Verbruggen neglected to introduce the king to his boss, who was so put
out that he fired the sales director for a 'serious misdemeanour'. Whereupon
Verbruggen appealed, and in his case before an employment tribunal received
supporting evidence from the king, to whom he had written.
Baudouin's testimony, sent through the Grand Marshal of the Belgian court,
pointed out that protocol forbade a lowly subject to take the initiative in
introducing royalty. Indeed, by imposing on the king the necessity of
shaking hands with the boss, the sales director would have shown disrespect
for the sovereign.
The tribunal handed down the judgment that there was no 'real and serious'
case for the dismissal, and awarded Verbruggen Pounds 20,000-plus in damages
and back-pay.

There could hardly be a sharper image of New York's ills. 47th Street Photo,
the eccentric Manhattan electronics retailer known to bargain-hunters the
world over, has hit bankruptcy.
Irving Goldstein, a Hungarian refugee, opened his first store in 1965 in the
heart of the city's diamond district. It was staffed largely by Brooklyn's
Hasidic jews and was quintessential New York. Service was fast and feisty,
customers pushy and plentiful, and price counted above all. By the 1980s,
47th Street Photo had expanded to a five-outlet chain.
But those were the good old days. More recently, a vicious legal battle
erupted between Goldstein and Joseph Fischer, a one-time consultant of his.
Investments in real estate went sour, and price wars engulfed the
electronics retailing sector generally. The last straw was when Transamerica
froze bank accounts - prompting 47th Street Photo to seek refuge under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Ironically, the largest creditor is New
York State, which claims to be owned Dollars 10.8m in back taxes.

As always, Rabbie Burns had a phrase for it: 'The De'il's awa wi'
th'Exciseman'. But prime haggis-exporter John MacSween didn't pause to quote
the bard, an exciseman himself, on hearing that US customs had blacked a
consignment of best sheep's stomach stuffed with offal and oatmeal, as unfit
for human consumption.
'I think it's damn ignorance,' growled the managing director of Charles
MacSween and Son, of Edinburgh.
Alas, it is not only in the US that officialdom is denying expatriate Scots
their authentic haggis for Burns Night on Saturday. A consignment to Tokyo
was even seized and burnt.
While MacSween sees that as political - reflecting Japanese distaste for
imports generally, rather than for the great chieftain o' the puddin' race
in particular - food regulations specifically exclude it from Australia and
New Zealand. And while Switzerland will admit portions of up to 2 kilos,
Italy won't bite at all.
It is the transatlantic ban, however, that most irks the Edinburgh exporter,
who claims US policy is inconsistent. Packages air-freighted to Boston have
been let in without a glance; so was 20 kilos taken to New York as
hand-baggage, passing through not only customs but the airport X-ray machine
without a hiccup.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Many options, no favours: Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader,
spells out his plans for government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT, JOE ROGALY and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Striving for office has matured Mr Neil Kinnock. The leader of the Labour
party has spent eight years preparing for the forthcoming general election,
and it shows.
When we went to interview him in his office at the House of Commons
yesterday we found him in good humour, confident, in control of his
responses. His many detractors will regard this as a revelation. This is
understandable. The Labour leader will never be accused of pithiness. He is
by nature loquacious. Yet he seems to be aware of the huge effort of
self-mastery that he must undertake if he is to stand a chance of winning.
Yesterday he gave full answers, but he did not ramble. He avoided more than
a modicum of sub-clauses and dialectical by-ways. His language was in better
focus than on many past occasions, public or private. He is still quite
capable of living down to his poor image. But equally, if he performs on TV
as he has demonstrated he can do in small gatherings - and sporadically in
the Commons - he will be no easy mark for the Conservatives. To the extent
that they are banking on the windbag image to see them through the campaign
they may be in for a surprise.
What, we asked as a starter, are the positive reasons for supporting the
Labour party? Mr Kinnock loved that question.
'We alone among the parties have a strong commitment to the development of
the supply side of the economy,' he replied. Britain had to match its major
competitors in this area. He cited Labour's oft-promoted policies on
training and education. 'The major determinant of investment decisions and
industrial location is the skills and potential capacities of the workforce,
at every level.' Labour would provide 'a national framework that can be
delivered locally in a partnership between training and educational elements
and those who employ and will employ people'.
Sounding a bit like the Labour leader of 1964, he alluded to the promotion
of 'discovering and innovating' - to be achieved through direct inducements
for research and development. Tax incentives would be introduced to bring
forward new investment, 'so that the recovery is investment-led'. The
improvement of the 'commercial and social infrastructure, particularly
transport' had long been needed. This would include bringing private
financing in to the railways.
But given Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism and Labour's
promise not to go on a spending spree, how would Mr Kinnock's economic
management differ from Mr Major's over, say, the next two years?
'People are regarding the participation in the ERM as a curtain drawn down
on all options - and it isn't,' replied Mr Kinnock. He sat forward and used
his hands for emphasis. 'The argument we made for going in and the argument
that we make for staying in is that it is the real world. It's the place
where we have to trade, make a living, win new markets, be successful.' The
question was not whether the ERM forbade action, but what action was
necessary to make a success of the economy within the ERM.
The government was using membership of the ERM as one of its reasons for not
doing anything but hanging around and hoping. The arguments for Labour's
supply-side measures to facilitate greater convergence with Europe's
stronger economies were even more powerful as a result of participation in
the ERM. Ever the practised salesman of his party's policies, Mr Kinnock
once again chanted the training-education-investment mantra quoted above,
with a few additional items, such as technology trusts, thrown in.
But would anything much change in the short term? 'By doing the things that
will combat recession in the short term, especially in the construction and
manufacturing industries, we build the basis for future economic success.'
As to the rapidity of recovery, 'is anybody going to try to tell me that
recovery dependent upon a rising tide of consumption, which is what the
government hopes for, is going to be a quick way out of recession?'
Nobody could argue that consumption-led recovery would be any quicker than
investment-led recovery. The contrary was the case, Mr Kinnock said. Relying
on consumption would mean a rerun of the two circuits of boom and slump
experienced in the 1980s, with the net result in the end of a weaker
economy.
We moved to expenditure and taxation. Here an effort was made to pin Mr
Kinnock down. It was not wholly successful.
'No opposition in history has ever been as candid as we are,' he said.
Pensions and child benefit would be raised, he affirmed. This would be done
at once, in Labour's first Budget. Those on the very highest incomes were
going to have to meet the bill for this. Mr Kinnock assured us that Labour's
income tax changes would only apply to people earning 'well in excess of
Pounds 30,000'.
Labour had taken the precaution of saying in successive policy documents
that it had to retain the option - if it proved to be possible when the
party had full access to the details of the exchequer  - to introduce the
changes in a way that would minimise the impact on personal and business
budgets. Pressed for details, Mr Kinnock insisted that the final decisions
would have to be made by Mr John Smith when in office as chancellor. Further
pressed, he agreed that phasing-in of the proposed 50 per cent top rate tax
was an 'option'.
It turned out that 'option' is a useful little word. It was also applicable
to phasing-in of the plan to lift the ceiling on liability for national
insurance contributions. The ceiling would certainly be lifted, but not
necessarily all at once. 'We're only going to open the door,' said Mr
Kinnock, apologising for his mixed metaphor, 'but there will be a choice, as
to whether we open the door wide, or we open the door a little'. The matter
would be settled when Labour had the full access to complete information -
ie when it was in government. Phasing-in the limitation of tax allowances to
the basic rate, also a Labour policy, seemed also to be in the area of
options, although on this Mr Kinnock appeared to be less at ease, or perhaps
less rehearsed, than on the other tax questions.
Overall he spoke as would any shadow chancellor or opposition leader. It was
unrealistic 'to assume that I can be explicit in all detail when we're not
yet in government, we haven't yet seen the 1992 Budget, and there are
substantial areas in which we could at best be guessing'.
As to the government's forthcoming Budget, 'we do not believe that the
standard rate should be either increased or decreased. The consequence is
that if the standard rate was in this Budget . . . to be cut by 1p we would
reverse that.' The resources were necessary for the improvement of the
public services. But what if the same amount of public money was used to
lower tax thresholds? It could not be said that it was policy to reverse
such a change. As to what Labour would in fact do, we had to wait for the
information in the forthcoming Budget. 'All else would be speculation.'
A little more pressure on expenditure was applied. Training would be
allocated an extra Pounds 800m of public expenditure. A total anti-recession
package including training support, investment support and the like would
cost at a round figure Pounds 1bn. 'We're also talking about drawing down
the capital assets held by local authorities in order to stimulate the
construction industry and get some homes built and improved,' said Mr
Kinnock. He acknowledged that the size of this injection of expenditure
could be enormous, but it would be phased in line with the capacity of the
industry to respond. The skill shortage was one constraint.
We turned to the unions. Would the public sector unions not expect a Labour
government to reward them for their good behaviour while the party was in
opposition during the past few years?
'I've been saying . . . since early 1984 . . . that a Labour government
would not be offering favours to anybody, on any side.' Second, the unions
'don't expect to get what they know they're not going to get'. Third,
'everybody understands that it's not possible for a government, or anyone
else, to provide out of both pockets'. People had to take account of the way
in which the trade unions now approached the basic economic questions. The
constantly repeated and strong emphasis was on investment, not consumption.
This, he said, was a recognition of where the emphasis must be in pursuit of
the welfare of working people generally. It was understood that without
strong economic performance there would not be significant rises in the
standard of living. But what about Mr Kinnock's many complaints of
'underfunding'? Would not the public sector unions quote these at him?
Naturally incomes would be a part of the improvement of these services, he
replied, but the unions faced the choice between a government that would
maintain the underfunding and one that would constantly reduce it 'by the
proper use of resources'.
But what if some unions nevertheless failed to be reasonable? Would a Labour
government face down industrial action? 'You're asking me to plan for next
Christmas on the basis . . . that our water tank is going to burst.' Yes,
that had been the experience of previous Labour governments. 'The plumbing
that we've got is superior to anything that anybody has had before,'
responded the Labour leader.
We tried another tack. Mr Kinnock, we said, you don't believe in
competition, you believe in intervention. 'I look at the most competitive
economies in the world and I see that competition or competitiveness is not
contradicted by intervention.' The basic question was not whether to
intervene or when to intervene but to what degree, and to what purpose. As
among EC competitors, the purpose was to create an environment for
productive business to flourish.
'We are introducing policies which enable, not control; policies which
facilitate and not prescribe.' Labour put forward this view 'because it
works'. This was evident elsewhere. It appeared that Mr Kinnock had Germany
much in mind, although he did not specify which competitor countries
inspired Labour policies.
Asked about sectoral intervention, taking steel as an example, Mr Kinnock
replied 'it isn't intervention that the steel industry needs. What the steel
industry needs is a more vibrant domestic market, specially in the
manufacturing sector and a chance therefore to make even further increases
in their productivity and be more competitive in difficult international
markets.' The industry did not need 'some civil servant or minister sitting
on their shoulder saying to them well, strategically this is what we think
you should do, or in the micro economy, you'd better use this spanner
instead of that spanner'. That would be 'absolutely ridiculous'.
Finally, constitutional change. Labour would introduce a Scottish parliament
at once. Wales, whose assembly was based on local government change, could
probably be tackled within the lifetime of a full parliament. English
regions, it appeared from Mr Kinnock's replies, would take somewhat longer.
Pressed on House of Lords reform, Mr Kinnock said that in terms of time
scale we would have to say unknown. As to electoral system changes, he spoke
confidently of Labour's preparation of the analytical ground for an in-party
and a national debate. Was all this not just a ruse to con the Liberals into
voting Labour? Ho ho ho said Mr Kinnock. He had stimulated what had been a
formless debate, 'completely apart from any consideration of the Liberals
whatsoever.' Since his parting shot was a prediction of a Labour overall
majority of 20, this was hardly surprising.

The question used to be 'Who shot John F Kennedy?' The question left in

F Kennedy?'
Writer-director Stone, along with Kevin Costner as his truth-based hero Jim

broadly speaking, everyone did it. The CIA was involved. So was the US
military. So were the arms industry, the FBI, the Mafia, Lyndon Johnson and
the anti-Castro Cuban community. This last, according to the film, consisted
of assorted crazies with Spanish accents teamed up with a group of
white-Anglo homosexuals specialising in wacky wigs (Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee
Jones).
Ever since America lost its hero-President to an assassin's bullet in
November 1963, Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, has been combed in public by
more amateur sleuths than any spot on earth. We know the grassy knoll better
than our own back garden. We are asked to see masked gunmen in every shadow
of every blown-up photograph. We are told to sense the country's scheming
power brokers behind the horror of a sunlit day. And we see over and over,
not least in Stone's film, that amateur footage of Kennedy's head pitched
forward and then rocked back by bullets that seem to come from opposite
directions.
But a licence to reject the Warren Report, with its implausible conclusion
that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin and lone plotter, is no licence
to incriminate almost everyone else who wielded power in America during the
early 1960s. As in Born On The Fourth Of July, Oliver Stone treats the
riddles of history not as a jigsaw to be pieced together in a spirit of
honest inquiry but as a rag-bag of surmises to be forced into rhetorical
harmony.
The real Jim Garrison, here played by Kevin Costner with the homespun,
dogged decency of a Capra hero, was an excitable conspiracy theorist who was
once diagnosed as being in need of long-term psychotherapy. He was also
accused of using bribery, hypnosis and truth serums in dealing with
witnesses. And the man he put on trial for conspiracy in Kennedy's murder,
the wealthy businessman and alleged CIA agent Clay Shaw, was found not
guilty after less than an hour of jury deliberation.
But this acquittal becomes the I-told-you-so climax to Stone's film. After
190 minutes of battering us with the unproven iniquities of America's ruling
class, Stone holds up the legal travesty of Shaw's 'innocence' as proof that
we are all guilty. Mr Costner dries his eyes long enough at the end of his
I-love-America summing-up to stare straight at the camera and tell us 'It's
up to you'.
If it is up to us, how is it we have felt so helpless in the movie to this
point? We have been dragged through cataracts of dialogue, swamps of
exposition and thickets of guest appearances from stars like Jack Lemmon,
Walter Matthau and John Candy. Even Jim Garrison pops up, mischievously cast
as Earl Warren. The movie, aided by gymnastic editing, never stops moving.
Stone and co-screenwriter Zachary Sklar travel so fast to cover their
factual - or factitious - territory that Costner barely has time to dash
home each half-hour to allow Sissy Spacek to do her domestic-reproach
routine.' I think you care more about John Kennedy than your own family]',
'I want my life back' etc.
The film's speed is awesome, but still it never catches up with the required
work-load of information. We know what the 'Y' side of Oliver Stone's X=Y
equation will be: All people in power are guilty. But the facts and figures
of the 'X' side, culled from both Garrison's book and Jim Marr's Crossfire,
cannot be gathered together in the time required.
Realising this, Stone eventually brings in a composite figure called, aptly,
Mr X. This is Donald Sutherland looking mysterious by the Potomac. His job
is to run very fast through all the high-level conspiracy data, based mainly
on revelations about top-brass hostility to Kennedy's decision to
de-escalate the Vietnam War: revelations vouchsafed by L. Fletcher Prouty, a
one time aide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who became technical adviser on
JFK.
After implicating LBJ, the arms industry and everyone else you can think of,
Sutherland allows himself a few moments of post-assassination musing - 'I
never thought things were the same after that' - and this sudden down-change
into conversational ordinariness makes us giggle. It is too much of a shock:
too much like the human reality that has been missing from every frame so
far.
The film quickly, embarrassedly picks itself up and returns to its normal
speed, which is that of an epic edition of the radio programme Just A
Minute. One moment of hesitation or deviation and one feels that a buzzer
will sound announcing the collapse of logical momentum.
JFK tries to demonstrate that 'They' killed Kennedy and that 'We' are the
only ones who can fight back. But all it demonstrates is that them-and-us
moral generalities now seem as distant and obsolete as the 1960s themselves.
By blaming virtually everyone who held office back then, the film allows
JFK's assassin to escape once more into the crowd: as safe in the sanctuary
of numbers as he had ever been when shielded by the 'lone assassin' theory
Stone so virulently derides.

Since making Coupe De Ville, a 1960s-set tale of three quarrelsome brothers
driving a blue Cadillac to Florida to hand it to Mum as a birthday present
from Dad, Joe Roth has become chairman of 20th Century Fox. But the two
events are unconnected. Coupe De Ville, a subtle and delightful comedy of
character, picked up a few dollars at the American box office and Roth won
his ticket to power by founding Morgan Creek Productions, which became the
career home of Kevin Costner.
Today Roth says he doubts that he would give a film like Coupe De Ville the
go-ahead at Fox since it has no stars, no 'high-concept' storyline and no
previous success on page or on stage. You see the world we live in? Even
studio bosses cannot follow the quality.
Coupe De Ville is too good to be made except with the tiny budget Roth
required two years ago to assemble Daniel Stern, Patrick Dempsey and Arye
Gross as the brothers - the long, the short and the barrel-shaped  - and to
escort them across America in the blue-finned gas-guzzler of the title,
occasionally cutting to Alan Arkin as Dad fishing in Florida.
The script by Mike Binder is a gem. Sibling rivalry wreaks chaos on the road
and roadside, as old grudges fly up like pebbles from the tarmac and new
quarrels rain down from a clear Southern sky. Meanwhile the car, which Dad
has demanded be delivered without a scratch, develops the inevitable habit
of crashing into anything that stands still.
Once in Florida the happy ending arrives: but even this has a surprise twist
and a power to tug the heart. I floated out of the Cannon Fulham Road
mopping my eyes and wondering how 20th Century Fox under Joe Roth became the
most successful studio in Hollywood last year without producing a single
film as good as this.
It certainly beats Blame It On The Bellboy, a writing-directing debut by
British National Film School graduate Mark Herman. This Venice-set comedy
sinks slowly into its own lagoon. When three English-speaking tourists
called Orton, Horton and Lawton - alias office clerk Dudley Moore,
sex-seeking businessman Richard Griffiths and Mafia hit man Bryan Brown -
get their messages mixed up at their hotel, you can imagine the chaos that
results.
Indeed you should imagine it. Your own scenario is bound to be funnier than
Herman's. Dudley is tortured by the mob who think he is Brown, Brown bumps
into the Miss Right intended for Griffiths and Griffiths - well, you get the
idea. The filmgoer's comic nerve needs to be pinched hard and early in a
film like this, but we are still waiting for happy pain at the end of the
movie's modest 73 minutes.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: Painting Churches - The Playhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems to be America week in the London theatre. After the revival of
Arthur Miller's All My Sons at the Young Vic now comes Tina Howe's Painting
Churches at the Playhouse.
Ms Howe is a playwright who specialises in extravagant settings. One of her
plays which I like is set in a major American museum of modern art and is
duly called Museum. Another, The Art of Dining, is set in a restaurant while
her Coastal Disturbances takes place on a beach with the ocean heaving in
the background.
Painting Churches is thus a deliberately teasing title, given Ms Howe's
other works. The Churches are a Boston family, not ecclesiastical buildings.
The painting is a portrait of her parents, done by their daughter, Margaret.
The author admits in a programme note that the piece is ever so slightly
autobiographical.
It is certainly sentimental, but that is a characteristic of so much
American theatre and not even All My Sons, for all its other virtues, is
entirely free of it. Gardner Church is a poet who knew Pound and Frost and
Andre Malraux. He has now run dry and gone slightly gaga. He is married to a
rich Bostonian, but believing that you should never dip into capital, the
couple are preparing to move to their Cape Cod house for good. The daughter
turns up to help on condition that she can paint them for her New York
exhibition.
The dialogue between the parents recalls for me a famous New Yorker cartoon
of an elderly couple sitting in a restaurant looking at the menu and one of
them saying to the other: 'Darling, remind me, which one of us doesn't like
caviar?'
That remark is not without affection or style and is broadly how the
Churches talk to each other. Fanny is trying, in her own words, to 'exit
with a little flourish' while still looking after her husband.
Clearly the couple had great style once. When asked to sit for the portrait,
they pose successively as Grant Wood's American Gothic and Michelangelo's
Pieta and The Creation. (Ms Howe is very good in dealing with art, as Museum
showed.) Finally they sit in black tie and the female equivalent.
At the end the portrait is never shown to the audience. Instead we see the
couple watching its unveiling, Fanny hostile at first, then beginning to
like it. 'You know what it is?' she says. 'The wispy brush strokes make us
look like a couple in a French Impressionist painting.' They begin slowly to
waltz. Margaret is pleased that she has impressed her parents at last.
There is also a parakeet who recites bits from Gray's Elegy, apparently a
genuine bit of autobiography. I rather liked the mild mixture of wit and
poignancy, but have to admit that many people will find the New England
style rather slow.
There is not much that the director, Patrick Sandford of the Nuffield
Theatre, Southampton, nor the cast of Leslie and Sian Phillips and Joise
Lawrence can do to speed it up. It is like the Elegy with a touch of the New
Yorker thrown in.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Recovering well after surgery
 -Continuing a series on getting the most out of software, Claire Gooding
visits Glan Clwyd Hospital to see IT under medical supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING and KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Innovation in information technology is not often associated with Britain's
National Health Service. Yet the NHS is Europe's largest employer and a good
deal more complex than any commercial business.
Despite the undoubted quality of its IT staff, computerisation has an
unhappy history in the NHS. Since the late 1960s healthcare professionals
have had to submit data to centralised systems. They resent the paperwork,
see no benefits from their toil and distrust the statistics that result.
In January 1989 the government's Working for Patients white paper focused
attention on the cost and efficiency of health services, posing questions
that had never been raised before. It also put aside a large budget for
information systems to support the changes.
Glan Clwyd Hospital, on the North Wales coast not far from Rhyl, is the
Welsh 'pilot site' for implementing this change of culture. It is a pioneer
in the field of information systems and what, in the commercial world, would
be termed 'change management'.
Clwyd was one of six early sites designated to develop its own systems for
Resource Management (RM), an experiment now extended to 50 more UK sites.
The aim of RM is to improve the organisation, as explained by Roger Dunshea,
Clwyd's general manager of surgery, an ex-nurse and self-confessed 'IT
ignoramus', who was involved in the project from the start.
'RM is about working with consultants to bring them into the management
process, from procurement onwards. It must involve them. I have to encourage
them to focus their thinking on non-clinical matters such as cost and
planning.'
Newly-developed Hospital Information Systems and RM systems emphasise
measurement: it is not possible to deliver efficiency, increase throughput
or adjust budgets without first being able to measure all those elements.
Gren Kershaw, the unit general manager, says Clwyd made a strong bid to the
Welsh Office to become the one RM pilot site allotted to Wales. 'They chose
us because we demonstrated a deep interest in using information to improve
patient care and the way we manage hospital services.'
David Thomas, a consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician, is also the Clwyd
project leader. Long interested in management issues, he has given up some
clinical time to the project but still keeps all his operating and on-call
commitments. 'We were able to demonstrate a close relationship between staff
and management' he says. 'And we had enough committed clinicians to make it
work.' No decisions will be made on the experiment until the end of 1992,
but if it is accounted a success Clwyd's work solution is likely to be
adopted elsewhere.
Thomas is concerned that healthcare professionals and others often
misunderstand both the motives for collecting information, and the data
itself. 'A good example is beds. We had 930 beds in 1983 and we now have
700, but there's been a huge increase in patients treated each year, partly
because the length of stay has gone down, from eight days to
five-and-a-half,' he says.
'In the past, we haven't known what the costs are, or what the implications
are of using one treatment rather than another. Some healthcare
professionals worry about a hidden agenda, even feel it's an attack on their
professionalism. But information is for identifying good clinical practice,
not for undermining health services or attacking doctors.'
Kershaw claims his team has achieved some quantifiable results in 18 months,
delivering useful information for clinicians and managers.
Clwyd's approach has been pragmatic. First, it has concentrated on creating
operational systems which would be useful to the end-users in such tasks as,
for example, delivering the results of blood tests.
The management information has been derived merely as a by-product of
day-to-day activities, a point stressed by everyone involved.
Second, it has bought in packaged solutions, and made them work with a
variety of existing systems, aiming for 'interoperability' of disparate
systems. Open systems, under which all new systems would run under a common
operating system such as Unix, has arrived too late for the NHS. A couple of
Clwyd systems are Unix-based: communications experts are still linking the
older proprietary systems into the patchwork.
Last, but most important, was the effort Clwyd put into involving the staff.
A total of 11 'task teams' were set up to consult colleagues. Nurses,
consultants and secretaries were among those who contributed ideas to the
Patient Administration System (PAS). 'We had to proselytize, inform and
educate,' explains Dunshea. 'The fear of IT had to be removed.'
There were meetings with hundreds of staff, many of whom had never used a
keyboard, and needed reassurance that their lack of expertise could not ruin
the system. Newsletters, site visits and demonstrations were all part of the
effort.
Four IT providers were invited to tender in September 1989, all according to
strict procurement rules. Some of the offerings were too oriented to the US,
where the emphasis is on billing and profit, not care and efficiency.
McDonnell Douglas won the deal on Clwyd's 'scoring system', and supplied
several new systems, including PAS and the Order Communication System (OCS),
plus 24-hour facilities management. These also had to be linked with other
systems such as office automation.
Systems manager Joyce Hall, a former ward sister, took charge of the OCS.
She set out to test the viability of the system as a key element in Clwyd's
'operational' strategy, describing OCS as the 'glue' for all other systems.
'The exercise forced us to look at current working practices. It's not about
computers, it's about managing resources based on proper information,' she
states. Now, transactions - for instance, orders for blood tests - are keyed
in by the people concerned at source, and results are instantly available
from any terminal, cutting down on paperwork. The OCS extends beyond the
hospital itself to family doctors, who have access to test results and
similar information via PCs linked into the hospital.
'A by-product of the OCS is that the information gained can be used to build
up patient profiles, and compare that information across different
specialities. Any shop or manufacturer can tell you the cost of any product
and its components. To my knowledge no one in the NHS can do that as yet:
that's what we'll be able to do.'
Mick Webb, the director of information services, agrees that the primary aim
of RM is to support the operational processes, benefiting the clinicians in
their day-to-day tasks. He sees the information coming full circle, from
operational to management information, feeding back, eventually, into
operational and clinical practice.
'Because it is recording day-to-day activities we can react more quickly,
plan for the future, and see trends. In the past it would have taken two or
three months: now we can see at the end of the week what resources a
patient, or specific group of patients, consumes,' says Webb.
'We think we're at the leading edge in operational terms, even if we're
using long-established systems. We firmly believe what we're doing here will
be of direct benefit to the patients, the care providers and the management:
that's putting things in the right order,' he adds.
Thomas already finds the new systems valuable, and wants others to see the
benefits. 'What I can do now is to get a good idea of the resources I need
for a particular treatment at patient level. The hospital is using
Diagnostic Related Groups with the aim of comparing costs with other
hospitals in other parts of the country. We can find out what works; see how
one consultant manages hysterectomies more effectively than others, and put
those techniques to work.'
Kershaw concludes: 'We still have a long way to go to involve everybody, and
we're not there yet. It's relatively new in a complex world. What we've done
so far is successful, but we must continue driving it hard to get the
benefits.'
The series will continue on the Technology page next month. The Quarterly
Review of Software at Work will appear on March 19.
BUZZWORDS
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT involves healthcare professionals in management
decision making.
PATIENT ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS record patient andtreatment details.
HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS provide management information.
DIAGNOSTIC RELATED GROUPS are 'patient care profiles' for specific
treatments, for example, for a broken leg.
CONSULTANT'S CRITIQUE
THE CHANGES in the NHS have struck deep into the corporate culture. New
techniques and treatments mean that the expectations of patients have been
raised. Heart transplants, for example, have moved from the pages of science
fiction to those of local newspapers.
With finite financial resources the NHS has had to look at efficiency. It
now matters how much treatments cost and whether they are effective. But the
infrastructure does not yet exist and there are decades of established
practice to be overcome. In most cases, there is no means of assessing the
problem, let alone producing solutions.
It is in this context that we need to examine the Clwyd study. The issue is
not so much a computer system as a revolution in working methods. Happily,
Clwyd Hospital has avoided many of the pitfalls of earlier systems. The team
has recognised the need to involve all levels of people in the
implementation.
It has wisely gone for a set of small solutions rather than a grand design.
This has introduced a number of interoperability problems but these are
easier to overcome then the difficulties which accompany the
all-encompassing systems. Grand systems have a habit of becoming
over-complex and never working at all. It is much easier to steer a moving
Lada than a pile of Rolls-Royce parts.
I liked the focus on getting the most useful things working first. Too
often, the order of implementation is left to the programmers who implement
the areas which interest them most.
The Clwyd approach ensures that users get value from the system early on.
This generates goodwill for the inevitable snags.
It has also allowed the team to draw in outsiders such as family doctors who
are an essential part of the referral mechanisms. They too are more likely
to co-operate with form filling if they can see improvements in their own
practices.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Protection racket
targets good guys - The fight against Aids / Campaigns to promote condoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REX WINSBURY

<TEXT>
Can Madison Avenue come to the rescue of what one health expert graphically
calls 'the slippage between the boardroom and the bedroom'?
In a world that has to live with Aids, and where, says the World Health
Organisation (WHO), there may be up to 40m HIV infections by the year 2000,
the marketing of the once-humble condom has become both vital and
fashionable.
The new approaches to mass-marketing what the French so meaningfully call a
preservatif, range from the condom boutique, like the new Condomania shops
opening in Britain, to the concept of 'social marketing' being tried by the
Americans in the Third World.
With no vaccine against HIV likely to be available soon, the implied demand
for condoms is awesome, if sex is to be made 'safe'.
Recent US studies suggest that present world demand for condoms is running
at about 5bn-6bn a year.
But the forecast demand, as anti-Aids campaigns intensify around the world
and emphasise that condoms are the only reliable protection, is two to three
times that total, anything between 12bn and 17bn a year.
The WHO has what it calls 'a tentative priority prevention target' - that by
2000 the whole population of high-risk areas in Africa and Asia should live
in communities where condoms are available both readily and at an affordable
cost.
The problem, say the researchers, is not manufacturing capacity. Enough of
that exists. The problems will lie, first, in 'logistics management,' that
is, physical distribution from manufacturer to user - 'the slippage between
boardroom and bedroom'.
This is particularly the case in the poorer countries that are hardest hit
by Aids but do not have an efficient wholesale-retail infrastructure.
In these countries there is a second problem, that of selling at a price
people can afford.
At one extreme of the marketing effort are shops like the franchised
Condomania boutiques in London, Liverpool and Leeds, all opened within the
last five months, where the emphasis is on variety of choice, fashion,
packaging and friendly advice.
Martin Foreman, founder of the enterprise, says that in the London shop, to
his surprise, 60 per cent of customers are women, 30 per cent heterosexual
men, and the balance homosexual men.
'In our catalogue, we say that if you think that a condom is a killjoy,
you're not experienced.'
At the other extreme are the big international organisations that control
the condom trade to the areas of high potential demand in Africa and Asia,
which have come up with the concept of 'social marketing'.
What social marketing means is using normal commercial distribution outlets
such as chemists' shops and health centres, but adding to them
non-traditional outlets such as market traders, itinerant and 'table-top'
hawkers, bars, hotels, local housewives and corner shops, in order to sell
condoms that are fed into this enlarged distribution system at a subsidised
price.
Subsidised, that is, by the international donor community, in particular by
USAID, the American government's foreign aid organisation.
This approach is then supported by 'Madison Avenue' marketing and promotion
techniques.
Statistics show that by 1990, of the 264m condoms shipped to Africa, 175m
originated with USAID.
But now USAID is trying to pull back from this role as Africa's main
wholesaler of condoms, and has cut its orders by 20 per cent.
One reason is that US-made condoms, which USAID is bound to order under its
procurement rules, are three times as expensive as those bought on the open
world market by other organisations.
So the policy of affordable condoms means getting others to foot more of the
bill. But what is an affordable condom? Again, the indefatigable US
researchers have been at work, and suggest that a Third World family ought
not to have to spend more than 1 per cent of its income on condoms, or else
that family will become resistant to the whole idea.
In poor countries, that means a very cheap price indeed. In 10 of 29 African
countries surveyed, the cost of commercially supplied condoms worked out at
10 per cent of income.
That is where 'social marketing' comes in. In Zaire, for example, which had
been the shining example of social marketing in practice until the riots and
looting there last autumn caused almost all foreigners to be evacuated, a
pack of three condoms had been selling for the heavily subsidised price of
10,000 Zaire (the country's unit of currency). At Zaire's inflation-ridden
currency rate of about 117,000 Zaire to Pounds 1, that is now about 9p.
An organisation called PSI, Population Services International, backed by
another government-funded US organisation, Family Health International, had
set up warehouses and a fleet of trucks to distribute US-made condoms.
The scheme was backed by Madison Avenue techniques such as branding the
condoms under the 'Prudence' label, colourful packaging, radio commercials,
posters, competitions, music tapes, popular songs, and what it fearlessly
called 'condom inflation contests', all part of 'an intensive programme of
popular and inter-personal promotion' to reach a 'broader consumer base'.
The results, in marketing terms, were impressive. Condoms were being sold at
the rate of 15m a year among a population of 33m, about 3.5m in the last
month of operation alone.
Admittedly, an unknown proportion of these were being smuggled out of Zaire
across the river for sale in neighbouring Congo.
But that is Africa; you cannot use normal commercial channels and not expect
entrepreneurs to do what entrepreneurs in Africa have always done.
Now that Zaire has been shut down, there is a new effort to turn the Ivory
Coast into the showcase for 'social marketing'.
Here again, the statistics look impressive. In March 1991, 14,624 condoms
were sold under the 'Prudence' label. By November 1991, the figure had risen
to 232,780. This compares, says PSI, with about 600,000 a year through
commercial channels.
It is not clear whether the black panther logo used on the condom packets is
a conscious reference to the US black power movement, or to some form of
prowess. The condoms sell for the equivalent of 5p each - more than in
Zaire, but still cheap.
So far, so good. As Martin Foreman says, this is all a lot more imaginative
than lining up the condoms beside the cough mixtures and enemas.

On July 5 1981, British police first used CS gas against rioters on the
streets of Toxteth in Liverpool. But while the city's riots might have
seared into the British collective memory, they caused barely a blink in the
US, which is about to become the focus for a promotional push by the
Merseyside Development Corporation.
The MDC, a government-funded organisation set up in 1981, is about to ride a
PR-marketing caravan into the US east coast, where public awareness of
north-west England's problems is low.
Just before Christmas, Liverpool City Council was owed nearly Pounds 200m in
unpaid taxes, costing Pounds 15,000 a day in interest charges.
In October, Derek Hatton, former deputy leader of the left-wing City
Council, was arrested by police investigating allegations of corruption.
Hattonism - a blend of jocular toughness and ultra-leftist agit-prop - still
has a healthy grass-roots presence in Liverpool. The MDC is presumably
hoping that some ignorance - in the US - is bliss.
MDC's original aim was to regenerate some 800 acres - now 2,372 acres - of
the Merseyside and Wirral waterfront and over the last decade, the
government has provided Pounds 250m.
On February 5, the citizens of Washington DC will be able to see where
Pounds 150,000 of that has gone, when they listen to the Royal Liverpool
Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Libor Pesek. The RLPO will be doing an
11-city tour of the eastern seaboard, sponsored by the MDC as part of a
campaign which it hopes will attract Pounds 1bn of investment from foreign
companies over the next decade.
Jean Waters, MDC's marketing manager, is frank about the reasons for the
sponsorship: 'By sponsoring the orchestra's tour, the MDC is trying to make
sure that we get onto the shopping lists of businesses on the US east
coast.' Last July the MDC sent out 5,000 mailshots targeted on high-tech,
pharmaceutical, food and motor industries in that part of the US.
Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool university, a
former member of the MDC board, resigned largely because of its 'obsession
with creating tourism, office and retail developments rather than manual
worker-oriented jobs'.
Minford emphasises that his complaints may need readjusting under the new
boss, Desmond Pitcher, group chief executive of the Littlewoods
Organisation, who took over the helm of MDC in April 1991. The US campaign
will be a litmus test.
Pitcher apparently understands the scale of the task: 'The practical reality
is that we have got to reverse 50 years of dereliction. The administration
and management of the city in the recent past has been poor.'
He also admits that there has been a reluctance by British investors to
re-locate in Liverpool. 'When I recently spoke to the key institutions with
long-standing investments in Liverpool, I expected a raspberry. But instead
they were very pleased with the high yield on their investments. It's
changing; only 3 per cent of all commercial property in the area is
currently available for renting.'
Minford wants to see the MDC attract manufacturers into the area. 'A good
example of the sort of scheme is that which attracted Nissan to Tyne and
Wear, or Japanese electronics factories to south Wales.'
Maybe the MDC is now set on a marketing course which will start that slow
process. Robert Odell, an American who handles marketing for MDC in the US,
acknowledges that Liverpool may have an image problem in Britain. 'In the US
when you say Liverpool, you get one of two responses. Either it's Paul
McCartney and the Beatles, or people have a neutral feeling.'
In any case, 374 US companies have taken up the initial mailshot, and
Desmond Pitcher has 25 meetings arranged with US companies to coincide with
the orchestral tour. If those meetings result in some lasting, job-creating
investment, the MDC's Pounds 1.2m marketing budget for this year might
itself prove to have been a clever investment.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont cornered by Commons
pragmatism - Ivo Dawnay on legislative considerations facing the chancellor
as he prepares his pre-election Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COULD Mr Norman Lamont use his Budget to present the electorate with an
appetising smorgasbord of fiscal goodies, then, just two days later, have
the prime minister call a general election and defy the Labour party to vote
them down?
Britain's electoral and legislative machinery may be brutal, but it is not
quite as barbaric as that.
Mr Lamont, as chancellor, can certainly use his Budget speech to present a
picture of what the Tories have in mind for the future. He can - and
undoubtedly will - also devote some part of it to outlining glorious
economic prospects ahead.
He can thus convey the message that voters must choose between tax-cutting
Tories and spendthrift Labourites.
But what he cannot do is table a legislative package of fiscal measures that
he has no intention of actually passing through the House.
Budgets normally need at least eight weeks to complete their parliamentary
passage and have until the beginning of the summer recess at the end of July
to do so. With an election imminent, however, the chancellor must choose
carefully among controversial items on his menu.
If, as some have suggested, Mr Major calls an election within two or three
days of the chancellor resuming his seat on the green leather front bench,
then Mr Lamont will know beforehand that there may be only at best two or
three days of parliamentary time to get a tiny bill through the House.
Under normal procedures, temporary budget 'resolutions' are enforced as soon
as the chancellor has spoken on the Tuesday. Those allow only normal revenue
activities - the collection of income taxes or Customs and Excise-supervised
changes in, for example, cigarette duties - to come into force for a limited
period.
On the following Monday - after three days of debate - two sample
resolutions are presented, debated and passed; immediately prompting the
full Finance Bill to be tabled. Some two to five weeks later (after the
Easter recess) the bill then comes to its formal second reading before
passing the usual committee stage, navigating the Lords and returning for
final Commons ratification.
If an election is to interrupt that process, the chancellor must table only
what he knows he can get through in a few hours of Commons time. That
process means that the reach of the budget must inevitably be heavily
curtailed.
The chancellor is not entirely hedged in. He can use the 'usual channels' -
Commons-speak for informal negotiations with Labour's business managers - to
compromise on the easier parts of the package like the simple annual
uprating of inflation-indexed taxes or allowances.
For the contentious, headline-grabbing items - above all a possible cut in
the standard rate of income tax - he must choose what is feasible and what
is not.
If by the Monday after Budget Day an election has already been called, there
may be only two or three days of business before a formal dissolution must
take place. While any new government can table another Budget after the
election is over, Britain cannot be without any Finance Bill in the interim.
What is now fascinating connoisseurs of procedure is whether a skilled
reading of the Budget speech and its legislative proposals will prove
sufficiently explicit to predict the election date accurately - even before
the prime minister officially announces it.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor says recovery 'not yet
established' - Autumn Statement Debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons last night that recovery
from the recession 'had not yet become firmly established'.
His insistence that foundations for recovery 'are in place' and that
consumer spending was set to increase, was cheered by government supporters
but derided by the opposition in another pre-election slanging match.
Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, condemned 'bogus forecasts' made by Mr
Lamont in his autumn statement, and again called for enhanced capital
allowances to be included in the Budget on March 10 to 'move out of
recession to investment-led recovery'.
The autumn statement - approved by a government majority of 90 (317-227) -
was said by Mr Smith to have contained 'rubbish' forecasts drawn up as part
of a mythical economic scenario designed for a November general election
which failed to materialise.
He insisted: 'The fact is that the economy is stagnant and, at the very
best, is bumping along the bottom'.
Mr Lamont underlined his disappointment that the signs of recovery which he
highlighted last summer had not been sustained.
'There remain good grounds for believing that recovery will become firmly
established in the course of 1992,' he said.
The chancellor said the rapid fall in inflation and the consequent increase
in real incomes for those in work meant there was 'very considerable pent-up
demand in the economy'.
He emphasised the significance of the response being made by manufacturers
and retailers to weak demand - cuts in prices and costs.
Mr Nick Budgen (C Wolverhampton South West) and Mr Tony Favell (C Stockport)
criticised the decision to include sterling in the exchange rate mechanism
of the European Monetary System.
Mr Budgen contended that if the Conservative party lost the general election
it would be because of policies initiated by Mr Nigel Lawson, the former
chancellor, in 1985 and which culminated in the decision to join the ERM.
Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield and one of 25 Labour backbenchers who
backed a parliamentary motion (not debated) which attributed the recession
to 'the uncontrolled operation of market forces', feared a slump comparable
to that experienced in the 1930s.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed that
96 per cent of families would be better off as a result of the overall
effect of Labour's commitment to extend the coverage of national insurance
contributions and increase the top rate of income tax.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, questioned whether
autumn statements represented a serious attempt to forecast future economic
trends and said that they usually appeared to have been massaged in a bid to
instil the economic confidence ministers understandably sought.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MoD failed to link orders with
supergun - Trade and Industry Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR officials from the Ministry of Defence yesterday claimed that lack of
communication between government departments and within the MoD itself led
to a failure to link British manufacturing contracts with the Iraqi
'supergun' project.
The result was that British companies supplied components for Project
Babylon, an Iraqi attempt to build several giant guns, even the smallest of
which, the officials said, could have hit targets throughout Iran, Kuwait,
and the oilfields of the Persian Gulf.
Mr Nicholas Bevan, an assistant under-secretary at the MoD, told the
committee that the 'compartmentalisation' of the MoD meant that an expert
who examined an Iraqi order for steel tubes from Walter Somers, the
Halesowen company, and decided they had no military use did not see a report
a year later warning that Iraq was attempting to build a high-velocity gun.
Mr Stan Crowther (Lab) said he found it 'astonishing' that no connection had
been made.
At the insistence of the MoD, the official who examined the contract, Mr
Bill Weir, was allowed to give evidence to the committee behind closed
doors.
It remains unclear, however, why Mr Weir, given his apparent links with the
security services, was unaware of the Iraqi project.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine hints at legislation -
Poll Tax Non-payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were signs last night that the government was ready to take urgent
action to legislate in response to pressure to ease confusion surrounding
the use of computer evidence in poll tax cases.
The uncertainty threatens to deprive local authorities of any realistic
possibility of recovering outstanding poll tax.
The increasing difficulties about computer evidence come as the poll tax is
emerging as a critical election issue. Its political profile is likely to
raise even higher in the coming weeks, as more local authorities set their
budgets for the coming year.
Camden Council in north London called on the government to 'act now to end
the poll tax chaos', after a decision yesterday by the Clerkenwell
stipendiary magistrate that the council was not allowed to rely on computer
records as evidence of non-payment in default actions against 12 Camden
residents.
'We shall review the situation most urgently and come forward with the
answers very shortly. Obviously it requires a legislative decision. The
government has to decide how to act in the circumstances,' Mr Michael
Heseltine, the environment secretary, said last night on Channel Four news.
Ministers are aware, however, that if they legislate to close the loophole
in the law, they will effectively admit that it exists, casting doubt on the
validity of 5m poll tax cases dealt with since April 1990.
Meanwhile, Labour highlighted the continuing sensitivity of the Poll Tax by
stepping up claims that ministers were considering delaying sending out
bills.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, challenged ministers to say
whether the requirement for those on low incomes to pay a minimum 20 per
cent contribution to the poll tax would be removed in the Budget.
Ministers, who attacked opposition MPs for involvement in non-payment
campaigns, have ruled out fundamental changes to the poll tax, and the
government emphasised yesterday that those required to pay the minimun
contribution were given the money to do so through social security benefits.
Labour, however, remain convinced that the government intends in some way to
soften the impact of the tax in its final year.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bank codes of practice criticised -
News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANKING codes for personal and business customers announced by the banks
in recent weeks were criticised as being inadequate by consumer and business
groups at a Commons Treasury committee hearing yesterday, Charles Batchelor
writes.
The Consumers' Association described the personal code as 'lacking the
features you would normally expect to see from progressive organisations in
today's marketplace'. The Confederation of British Industry said the
business codes were 'not the final word'.
The British Bankers' Association last month announced details of a common
code of practice for dealing with personal customers for the UK banks and
building societies which will come into effect on March 16. Individual
business banking codes have been introduced by the main UK banks in recent
weeks in response to government pressure.
*****
EDUCATION: Student indebtedness is increasing, with the lack of vacation
jobs and the government's withdrawal of welfare benefits the main causes,
the committee of vice-chancellors (CVCP) told the Commons education
committee yesterday.
The CVCP said there was no evidence of any increase in drop-out rates as a
result. There has been a slight decrease - although not for long enough to
signify a trend.
Sir Gordon Higginson, vice-chancellor of Southampton University, told the
committee: 'Some of our students are having a desperate time. We need a
better system (of student financial support) and a safety net.'
*****
HOUSING: Mortgage lenders are expected to announce within the next few weeks
measures to counter home repossessions, Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, said. He told MPs he had spoken yesterday morning to
Mr Mark Boleat, the director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, and
expected the lending institutions to make announcements within the next two
to three weeks.
Recent discussions with building societies, banks and housing associations
led to a commitment to measures aimed at aiding homeowners.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Militant takes lesson from Labour -
Expulsions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILITANT, the far-left grouping, has expelled two longstanding members,
including Mr Ted Grant, its founding theoretician, in a move ironically
echoing Labour's purge of Militant supporters.
The body accused Mr Grant and Mr Alan Woods of setting up a rival
organisation. 'This is a clear split from Militant,' it said.
The expulsions stem from Mr Grant's opposition to Militant's plans to
abandon Labour entryism and work outside the party.
Militant supporters recently launched Scottish Militant Labour - described
as a campaigning socialist organisation. An SML candidate, Mr Tommy
Sheridan, will contest the Glasgow Pollok seat held by Labour's Mr Jimmy
Dunnachie in the general election.
Militant will also advocate support for Mr Terry Fields, the Liverpool Broad
Green MP recently expelled by Labour, in his attempts to retain the seat on
an independent ticket.
Militant was at pains yesterday to emphasise that its two rebels had
effectively 'excluded themselves'. Their expulsion decision was made at an
editorial board meeting.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Public defender office urged by Bar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STATE-FUNDED public defender office to help defendants prepare for trial
was called for yesterday by the Bar Council, which represents barristers.
The office would help the defence in its search for witnesses, collate
information on the state of scientific research and the quality of experts,
and facilitate access to forensic science laboratories.
The proposal is one of a number of suggestions made by the Bar in its
submission to the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice set up last year
after the release of the Birmingham Six.
The Bar calls for changes in the rules on confession evidence but stops
short of suggesting that confessions should not be admissible in court
unless corroborated by independent evidence. A confession should be
admissible provided it is made in the presence of the defendant's solicitor,
or is tape-recorded, or is put to the defendant and accepted by him in front
of a judicial officer, or is corroborated.
'We have regretfully reached the conclusion that the danger that police
officers may tell lies is such that special rules are required,' the
submission says.
The Bar also wants the role of the Crown Prosecution Service extended to
give greater supervision over police investigations. It would like to see
the appointment of a French-style examining magistrate to conduct an
independent investigation in serious cases such as the Lockerbie bombing.
It rejects the introduction of examining magistrates in most cases because
it says this would result in unnecessary delay and expenditure.
The Bar also calls for the abolition of the dock, allowing defendants to
stand next to their lawyers as in the US. Its abolition would reflect the
presumption of innocence, it said.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Elections introduced for accountancy post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTION for vice-president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales is be contested for the first time, with three candidates
standing for the post.
Mr Patrick Brenan, a director of Minories Finance; Mr Chris Swinson,
national managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the seventh-largest
accountancy firm by fee income last year; and Mr Roger Lawson, a director of
3i, the venture capital group, have all been nominated.
The position of vice-president has traditionally been nominated by the
president's advisory committee, which at present has just eight senior
members, and rubber-stamped at a meeting of the council in June.
Only a handful have ever been non-practising members.
The contest is only a partial movement towards democracy. The vice-president
takes office in June and normally automatically becomes deputy president the
following year and president the year after. In addition, only the 78
elected members of the council of the institute can vote, a process that
will take place early next month.
Mr Brenan has already issued a short manifesto saying the council has failed
to act in the public interest against 'indefensible practices' and has not
put forward policies in a sufficiently vigorous way.
Mr Lawson is still preparing a statement but said yesterday that his main
hope was to ensure that the institute resisted pressures that might cause it
to split in two, between auditors and other accountants.
Commenting on the introduction of elections, he said: 'It's a major move
forward. I think we're finally moving into the twentieth century.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Channel tunnel builders win right to halt work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and French contractors building the Channel tunnel were yesterday
given permission by the British Court of Appeal to renew their threat to
stop work on part of the Pounds 8bn project unless they are paid more money.
Lord Justices Neill, Woolf and Staughton said they would not grant an
injunction preventing the contractors from halting work on installing a
cooling system in the twin rail tunnels.
They also released the construction companies from a High Court undertaking
not to halt work without giving 14 days' warning to Eurotunnel, the Channel
tunnel operator.
Eurotunnel said last night it was considering seeking leave to appeal to the
Lords.
Transmanche, a consortium of five British and five French construction
groups, issued its threat to stop work last October after a disagreement
with Eurotunnel over who should pay for a huge increase in the cost of the
project. Costs had risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to Pounds 8.05bn.
The two sides are at present involved in negotiations to resolve the
dispute. A stoppage is unlikely while talks continue.
Members of the consortium have indicated that discussions have been going
well, although a gap still exists between the two sides.
Lord Staughton said an English court should not grant an interim injunction
in a disagreement that all the parties had agreed ought to go to arbitration
abroad.
The Channel tunnel contract, which is subject to both British and French
law, provides for disputes to be referred first to a panel of three
independent experts and then to arbitration in Brussels.
Any application for an injunction, therefore, should be made to Brussels,
Lord Staughton said.
Transmanche had told the court it was entitled to suspend work because of
alleged breaches of contract by Eurotunnel in funding the installation of
the cooling system. Lord Staughton said that if the contract had been
subject simply to English law, that argument would have faced some
difficulty.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL computer production at the Apricot Computer plant in Glenrothes,
Scotland, is likely to treble next year after completion of a 3,000 sq metre
extension.
It will mean a further 25 jobs, a 10 per cent increase in Apricot's
workforce.
The company, formerly the hardware arm of ACT Group of Birmingham, is now
wholly owned by Mitsubishi Electric of Japan. Last year, as part of the
expansion plan, Mitsubishi increased Apricot's paid-up capital from Pounds
3.2m to Pounds 12.6m.
The extension is expected to cost about Y1.5bn (Pounds 6.55m).
Mr Peter Horne, Apricot managing director, said using new technology would
cut costs and improve efficiency to the point where manufacturing costs in
Scotland were lower than at Mitsubishi's plants in either Singapore or
Japan.
He said the extension would house a clean room for surface mount technology,
an advanced semiconductor technique in which microchips are bonded directly
to both sides of printed circuit boards.
At present Apricot buys some of its printed circuit boards from
subcontractors.
Apricot is Mitsubishi's world centre for workstations and open systems -
compatible with industry standard - technology.
The plan is to increase production from 38,000 to 100,000 units a year and
increase exports from 10 per cent of capacity to 25 per cent. About half the
exported systems are expected to be shipped to Japan.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Fifth TV network terms modified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission yesterday radically modified the terms
on which the franchise for the new national fifth television channel is to
be awarded.
The ITC has dropped requirements on everything from the amounts of money to
be paid to the Treasury to the level of original programming, in what is a
clearly a response to fears that Channel 5 would be stillborn.
After listening to representations from potential bidders the ITC has
scrapped a requirement that the channel operator would have to pay 5 per
cent of net advertising revenue to the Treasury as well as the annual sum
bid for the franchise.
The ITC has now decided that 'zero' is the appropriate level to set the
percentage of qualifying revenue for each of the 10 years of the franchise.
The commission has also modified its original plans on how quickly an
operator has to build the channel network. The draft proposals suggested
that the channel had to begin broadcasting by the end of 1994 at the latest
and that it should reach a minimum of 40 per cent of the UK population.
Now the ITC prefers a more gradual approach. The requirement will be for
coverage of 30 per cent of the population within a year of the start of the
service or the end of 1994, whichever is later. The ITC has also reduced its
targets for originally produced programmes. Originally they were 40 per cent
at the start of the service rising to 65 per cent by the end of year five.
The new figures are 30 per cent at the outset rising to 55 per cent.
In the Appeal Court yesterday Mr Patrick Elias QC, for the ITC, rejected
Television South West's claim that the commission had made an irrational
decision in awarding the franchise for south-west England to Westcountry TV.
He said parliament had conferred the decision-making role on the ITC, yet
TSW seemed to be saying the court should substitute its own view for that of
the ITC.
The hearing continues today.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Rules on developing farm land relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNING guidelines that will allow greater opportunity for the development
of new businesses on two thirds of Britain's agricultural land - about 15m
acres - were announced by the government yesterday.
The guidelines will make it much easier to establish businesses such as
high-technology companies, electronics and printing on agricultural land of
moderate or poor quality.
Those categories form the bulk of Britain's farm land, much of it given over
to grass in areas such as Kent, Sussex, Norfolk and the Cotswolds.
The proposal brought an angry reaction from conservationists. Mr Andrew
Wilson, senior policy officer at the Council for the Protection of Rural
England, said: 'We are very concerned about it. The policy puts a big
question mark over the government's green credentials.'
The new guidance on the countryside and the rural economy, which goes out to
local planning authorities, says 'little weight need normally be given' to
the loss of farm land of moderate or poor quality when drawing up
development plans. It does add that the best and most versatile agricultural
land, which makes up the remaining third, is a national resource for the
future.
'Considerable weight should be given to protecting such land against
development because of its special importance,' the guidance says.
Mr Tim Yeo, junior planning minister, said the government had a balanced
approach to the question of developing agricultural land. He saw no
justification for believing the rural environment was improved by freezing
development and making it harder for businesses to flourish.
It was still open for local authorities to attach conditions to planning
permissions on farm land development.
The guidance also says there should be no reason to prevent the adaptation
of rural buildings to business use provided the development is in keeping
with its surroundings.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Cohse plans database for local NHS
bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COHSE, the health service union, said yesterday it was going to give its
branches access to a comprehensive pay database to help them deal with local
bargaining in the National Health Service.
NHS bargaining has traditionally been highly centralised but, with the
growth of self-governing trusts, unions are resigned to a fragmentation of
bargaining.
Few trusts have so far broken away from NHS pay rates and industrial
relations structures. The best-known exceptions are Northumbria Ambulance
Service and Guy's Hospital, in London.
One health union official said yesterday: 'If the Tories win the election
most of the trust personnel directors will dust off their plans for radical
changes.'
Trusts, especially in south-east England, are expected in many cases to want
to pay above existing NHS rates and increase differentials in order to
attract staff.
In some areas, however, they are expected to seek to cut pay. A trust in
Dorset recently tried to employ a radiographer on less favourable terms and
conditions than current NHS rates, but the unions ensured that nobody
applied for the job.
Nupe, the public-service union, said it had won six race-discrimination
cases in the past month.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Main supporters of British athletics withdraw sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A run for their money: Dairy Crest and McVities, two of the main supporters
of British athletics, have withdrawn from sponsorship within weeks of each
other, Bethan Hutton writes.
Dairy Crest said it was delighted with the increase in public awareness it
had achieved through athletics sponsorship - with its name appearing on such
famous chests as that of sprinter Linford Christie, above. The decision was
made because of the recession and a change in marketing objectives.
McVities cited the same reasons for its withdrawal. A third big sponsor,
ParcelForce, withdrew last year.
Tony Ward, an official of the British Athletic Federation, said: 'The
recession has finally caught up with us.' However, he added that a new
three-year sponsorship package with TSB, the banking group, had recently
been agreed while others were due to be announced soon.
Mr Ian Muir, Institute of Sports Sponsorship chairman, said companies were
becoming more professional about sponsorship and seeking to meet specific
marketing objectives.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): EETPU's return to TUC eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN WILLIS, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, gave a
strong indication yesterday that he did not expect the EETPU electricians'
union to face stiff financial penalties if it reaffiliated to the TUC.
The EETPU was expelled from the TUC three years ago amid warnings that if it
rejoined it would have to pay affiliation fees for all the time it was
outside the organisation. The total already amounts to more than Pounds 1m.
Mr Willis told the TUC general council yesterday that a merger between the
EETPU and the AEU engineering union, which is likely in March and has
prompted the reaffiliation discussion, was to be welcomed.
The possible return of the EETPU has prompted letters of concern from eight
unions: the probation officers' union Napo, the National Union of
Journalists, the Prison Officers Association, the Civil Service union NUCPS,
the construction union Ucatt, the general technical union MSF, the Fire
Brigades Union and the breakaway electricians' union EPIU.
The primary concern is not money, although some unions are likely to press
for the full back-affiliation fees to be paid, but rather the existence
within the EETPU of several organisations that have broken away from
TUC-affiliated unions.
Union leaders are also seeking guarantees that the EETPU in the merged union
would abandon what they see as membership poaching.
The EETPU was expelled after failing to obey a TUC ruling to withdraw from
two single-union deals.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tecs to confront Howard over planned
training cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF executives from more than half of the 82 Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs) took the unprecedented step yesterday of asking their
chairmen to take concerns over proposed cuts in training funds directly to
the government.
G10, the group of 10 chairmen that presents the views of Tecs to Mr Michael
Howard, employment secretary, meets on Monday to discuss the present round
of negotiations over this year's Tec budgets.
It is understood that most of the 82 chief executives in England and Wales
broadly support the concerns of the 42 who met yesterday in Derby.
The Department of Employment plans a 'substantial reduction' in the weekly
contributions for Youth Training, its main scheme for people aged 16 to 18,
and for Employment Training, the scheme for long-unemployed adults.
The department, under pressure from the Treasury, wants increased volumes of
training in 1992-93 for roughly the same amount of money as in 1991-92.
The chief executives said yesterday that although it was up to Tecs to
negotiate individually with the government there was also room for a common
approach. They feared that if cuts were made they would not be able to
guarantee training places to all young people who wanted them. They also
worry that quality of training may deteriorate.
One chief executive said: 'We are concerned that we might not be able to
deliver high-quality qualifications.'
The chief executives said they thought the Treasury saw Tecs as deliverers
of the two main training programmes and had little understanding of their
wider role, such as prompting employers to improve their own training.
Apex Trust, the charity that provides training and job help for
ex-offenders, was placed in administration by the High Court today.
The court-appointed administrators have about four weeks to try to bring off
a rescue operation for the financially troubled trust.

BALPA, the British Air Line Pilots' Association, has appointed a head-hunter
to help it find a general secretary.
The move is highly unusual among British unions - most elect leaders from
their own members or officers.
The Balpa post has been vacant since the death in August of Mr Mark Young,
who had held the post since 1974.
Mr David Sears of St James's Management Recruitment, the agency appointed by
Balpa, said the salary was Pounds 45,000. It was seeking candidates with
negotiating ability - gained either as a union official or in industrial

FT  23 JAN 92 / Agents report house sales still flagging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to remove stamp duty on most house sales for eight months has
so far failed to provoke a revival in the housing market, according to a
national survey of estate agents published today, Andrew Taylor writes.
The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors shows house
prices continuing to fall in many parts of the country in the last quarter
of last year.
A high proportion of agents remains concerned about prospects for this year,
saying the housing market is as deeply depressed as ever. Most expect no
recovery until after the general election.
They say cut-price sales of thousands of properties repossessed by mortgage
lenders have continued to drive down prices, particularly in London and
south-east England, where recession has been worst.
Just over half of the 114 agents questioned said house prices continued to
fall in the three months to the end of December. More than two thirds of
agents in London said prices had fallen. Virtually no agents reported an
increase in average prices during the three months.
There were mixed views about the effects on the market of the temporary
partial abolition of stamp duty. Some agents reported a slight increase in
prospective buyers. Others said the rescue measures, promoted by the
government and the Council of Mortgage Lenders, were unlikely to have any
significant impact.
Agents Copping Joyce in Islington, London, said: 'We are hoping the latest
government measures will have some effect in the new year but are dubious
that a dead battery can be quick-started.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Sharp decline in venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENTURE capital industry contracted sharply in the second half of last
year, according to Levy Gee, the accountants.
UK Venture Capital Database, the firm's computerised directory of venture
funds, showed that 17 funds ran out of cash to invest and one new fund was
set up.
That represented a decline of about 10 per cent in the number of funds still
active. A total of 146 funds responded to the latest six-monthly update of
the database.
The figures reflect a marked acceleration in the decline of the venture
capital industry.

ANOTHER round of job cuts is likely at the military aircraft division of
British Aerospace, which has already announced significant closures and job
cuts.
BAe confirmed yesterday that a further review of its Warton unit in
Lancashire - encompassing sites at Warton, Preston and Samlesbury - is under
way as 'part of the continuing review of the business situation'.
The company was responding to a press report that the loss of 2,500 design
and development jobs at the unit would be announced today. The Warton unit
is working on the Tornado, Hawk and European Fighter Aircraft (EFA)
programmes.
BAe announced more than a year ago that it was to cut 3,000 manufacturing

site, reducing employment at the unit to 11,000. Preston will close early
next year.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders failed yesterday to agree a time and
venue for a 'round-table' meeting to discuss how obstacles to formal
negotiations on the province's future could be overcome, Ralph Atkins
writes.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, was engaged in careful
diplomacy to arrange the meeting in order to revive his attempts to resume
formal negotiations which ended last July.
Three out of the four leaders gave Mr Brooke positive indications that they
would take part after he wrote to them late on Tuesday. The exception was
Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party.
Mr Brooke's original hope of a meeting of political leaders today has been
abandoned. His invitation appeared designed to increase the pressure on
political leaders to come to the negotiating table in spite of the proximity
of the general election.
Ministers believe that, although there are technical agreements to be
resolved, the biggest obstacle is a show of political will by the
participants.

FT  23 JAN 92 / 3,000 Lloyd's Names face Pounds 100m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 3,000 Lloyd's Names are to be asked this week to meet a cash call
for over Pounds 100m as a result of losses incurred in 1989 and 1990 by
insurance syndicates formerly run by Gooda Walker, the managing agency that
went into liquidation last September.
Four Gooda Walker syndicates, numbers 164, 290, 298 and 299, which
specialised in catastrophe reinsurance, are affected.
The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting on the Lloyd's
market - were asked to pay Pounds 137m in a cash call last June but did not
expect that further money would be needed until their syndicates announced
final results for 1989 this June.
The losses are among the worst faced by any of the 400 Lloyd's syndicates
trading in 1989, during which the market's overall losses will be at least
Pounds 1bn.
According to Mr Ralph Sharp of GW Run-Off, a privately owned company
managing the syndicates' affairs on behalf of affected Names, the cash call
arose out of the decision by two UK banks that had supported the syndicates
to call in outstanding loans.
Mr Sharp said last year's estimates of losses by Gooda Walker understated
the syndicates' difficulties. The Names were told last year that losses
might total Pounds 238m for 1989 and Pounds 58m for 1990.
'We know that having looked at the cash flow it is going to get worse,' Mr
Sharp said. Claims from disasters such as hurricane Hugo in September 1989,
the European storms of January 1990 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March
1989 had been arriving faster than expected, he said. 'The losses especially
for syndicate 290 are unacceptable and well beyond bad luck.'
The cash call will exacerbate the difficulties of the Gooda Walker Names,
many of whom have been unable to pay last year's cash call. Mr Sharp said
Pounds 21m of last year's Pounds 137m call had still not been collected.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, of the Gooda Walker Names Association, said many
of his association's members 'cannot afford to pay' and will need to appeal
for help from the Lloyd's hardship committee.
He added that other Names 'don't want to pay on principle. We are not sure
that these calls are kosher and the result of properly conducted insurance
business.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Scottish optimism declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES in Scotland see no sign of an economic upturn and are less
optimistic than they were three months ago, according to the latest Scottish
Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey, James Buxton writes.
The recession has affected Scotland less severely than some other parts of
Britain, but demand remains stagnant or contracting in all main sectors,
while manufacturers' stocks continue to run down.
All told, 1,229 companies responded to the survey. In manufacturing, only 2
per cent of respondents were more optimistic than they were three months
ago, when the balance was 12 per cent. In retailing, only 2 per cent
reported greater optimism, compared with 18 per cent in the previous
quarter, and in wholesaling a net balance of 4 per cent was less confident.
In the tourist industry, a balance of 24 per cent showed more optimism than
three months previously. Confidence in the construction industry
deteriorated.
Investment is falling and where it exists is mainly devoted to replacing or
improving existing plant rather than gearing up for expansion.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Loss of 1,105 mine jobs is confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday confirmed that it would cut 1,105 jobs at four pits
in its Selby group of mines in the Yorkshire area, including its flagship
Selby complex, a costly development the size of the Isle of Wight.
More than 200 jobs are to go at Whitemoor, one of seven pits in the Selby
complex itself. Another 150 will be eliminated at Sharlston, near Wakefield,
while 410 and 350 redundancies, respectively, are earmarked at Kellingley
and Prince of Wales, both near Pontefract.
Confirmation of the cuts came as British Coal announced a further 30 to 40
job losses at Kiveton Colliery in its South Yorkshire group.
The announcement fuelled speculation that the company may be attempting to
reduce manpower and improve productivity in readiness for privatisation if
the Conservatives win the next election.
British Coal said the cuts were necessary if the mines were to bring down
costs sufficiently to sell to the newly privatised electricity industry at
competitive prices after March 1993, when government-backed contracts run
out.
According to the newsletter Coal UK, the company may also be trying to cut
the volume of output. The company still has more coal than it can sell to
the generators, the newsletter says, some through productivity improvements.
Mr Alan Houghton, Selby group director, said the job losses would not result
in output reductions. He said they were aimed at ensuring that the pits were
'physically and financially strong'.
There is no sign so far that the four Selby pits affected by the job cuts
face closure.
Kellingley was picked as one of 14 mines profitable enough for a sell-off,
according to NM Rothschild, the government advisers on coal privatisation,
in its controversial report leaked last year.
The other three mines, that were not chosen by Rothschild, are believed by
industry observers to be either losing money or near break-even.
Three of the pits in the Selby group - Riccall, Wistow, and Stillingfleet -
have frequently broken productivity records, but both Whitemoor and North
Selby, the most recent mine to open, have met geological obstacles that have
sometimes halted production.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Rich and poor grow further apart as consumerism soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTION-YEAR Britain is united around consumerism but divided by growing
disparities of income and wealth, according to Social Trends, the Central
Statistical Office's annual state-of-the-nation publication.
It provides a one-volume guide to the lives of the people whose votes the
political parties will be seeking in coming months.
Social Trends contains information to support the policies and prejudices of
candidates of all political persuasions. For example:
Home ownership has grown - with more than two thirds of dwellings now
owner-occupied - but so has homelessness. The number of families in
temporary bed-and-breakfast accommodation more than doubled to 48,000
between 1986 and 1990.
The UK has a higher proportion of people in prison than any other EC
country, but that has not stopped recorded crimes soaring from 2.5m in 1980
to 4.4m in 1990.
By 1990, one in four of the adult population were shareholders, compared
with only one in 13 in 1981 - but more than half own shares in only one
company and the proportion of shares in private rather than institutional
hands has declined.
Total consumer expenditure rose by almost 70 per cent between 1971 and 1990,
with spending on consumer durables increasing at double the overall level,
although the rate of growth has slowed sharply since 1989.
The amount of outstanding consumer debt more than doubled in real terms
between 1981 and 1990. Savings as a percentage of household disposable
income have been negative since 1986.
The most classless consumer purchase is the television set - almost every
home has at least one, with little variation across occupational groups.
Vote-seeking politicians will be gratified to learn that television remains
one of the leading influences in national life - time spent viewing has
declined slightly since the mid 1980s but people still devoted an average 23
1/2 hours a week to the pursuit in 1990.
More seriously, Social Trends points to continuing social class divisions in
matters of life and death. In spite of an overall improvement in infant
mortality, death rates are still three quarters higher for babies whose
fathers are unskilled than for those born into professional families. Many
long-standing illnesses and disabilities are similarly less common among the
professional and managerial groups than among manual workers.
Social Trends presents an image of a nation becoming better off - average
real disposable income grew by nearly three quarters between 1971 and 1990 -
but not all benefited to the same extent.
The gap between the top 10 per cent of wage earners and the bottom 10 per
cent is widening and the share of income going to the top 20 per cent of
households has increased. By 1988, the top 20 per cent received 44 per cent
of post-tax income, compared with 37 per cent in 1977.
The share of marketable wealth in the hands of the richest 1 per cent of the
population fell from 21 per cent in 1976 to 18 per cent in 1981 - and has
remained at 18 per cent since.
That apparent shift towards a more egalitarian distribution of wealth has
not travelled any further down the social scale. The most wealthy 5 per cent
of the population increased its share of marketable wealth from 36 per cent
to 38 per cent between 1986 and 1989. More than half the nation's total
marketable wealth - 53 per cent - was owned by 10 per cent of the population
in 1989.
Social Trends cannot predict the outcome of this year's election but it does
provide a reminder that, on the basis of other recent general elections,
about a quarter of the electorate will not bother to vote.
In EC elections, apathy is far worse. Although 14m British holidaymakers
visited other EC countries in 1990, only 36 per cent of the electorate took
part in the last European parliament elections.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Sir Charles Villiers, chairman of BSC: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Charles Villiers, who was chairman of the British Steel Corporation
between 1976 and 1980, one of its most traumatic periods, died yesterday
aged 79.
Sir Charles, a well-intentioned, kind and thoughtful man, was one of the
most beleaguered BSC chairmen. The closure programme he enacted - the
workforce was reduced from 208,000 to 166,000 - provoked a bitter strike
during which he lost the support of his political masters.
In spite of the criticisms of his performance, his time as chairman was
pivotal in the corporation's development, marking the end of the
over-ambitious expansion plans drawn up in the early 1970s and the start of
the cost-cutting that turned British Steel into one of the most profitable
steelmakers in Europe by the end of the 1980s.
Sir Charles was groomed for a career in the City by his education at Eton
and New College, Oxford. He served in the Grenadier Guards during the Second
World War, winning the Military Cross in 1945 after parachuting into
Yugoslavia to fight alongside Tito's partisans.
After the war he moved briskly into a string of banking jobs, eventually
becoming managing director of J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank.
In 1968 he was appointed chairman of the Industrial Reorganisation
Corporation, where he recruited a team of ambitious young people who went on
to senior posts in British industry - including Sir Christopher Hogg,
chairman of Courtaulds, and Sir Alastair Morton, the deputy chairman of
Eurotunnel.
After leaving British Steel, his main achievement was a book on British
industry entitled Start Again Britain, in which he wrote of the downward
spiral in which the country was caught. It would not escape 'unless we make
a drastic effort to break out of it on a scale so far not contemplated'.
Sir Charles leaves a wife, two daughters and a son.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Businesses expect delay in recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC recovery is likely to be postponed from the second to the third
quarter of this year, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce said
yesterday.
That assessment emerged from the association's latest quarterly survey of
business opinion, which reported a decline in confidence compared with the
third quarter of last year. It also found a poorer outlook for investment
and employment.
The survey was based on questions last month to nearly 7,500 manufacturing
and service companies. One finding was that unemployment will continue to
rise, a factor likely to damp consumer confidence and hold back demand for
credit.
The association warned that with base rates stuck at 10.5 per cent and a
weak pound preventing the government from cutting the cost of borrowing,
real interest rates were rising as inflation fell. High real rates 'may act
as a depressant to economic performance'.
Another factor delaying recovery was uncertainty about the election.
Better news for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, came with signs of a rise
in exports. The association warned, however, that a slowdown in big overseas
markets such as the US and Germany raised questions about the strength of an
export-led upturn.
The balance of manufacturers expecting sales to increase over the next year
was 38 per cent in the fourth quarter last year, compared with 47 per cent
in the third quarter. The balance is calculated by subtracting the
percentage of companies thinking sales will decline from the percentage
expecting a rise.
Similarly, the confidence balance for service companies declined to 38 per
cent in the fourth quarter last year from 42 per cent in the previous
quarter. Business confidence has, however, climbed significantly from the
first half of last year, when the recession was at an early stage.
Another brighter sign outlook emerged from the balance of 5 per cent of
manufacturers reporting increased orders for exports in the fourth quarter,
the first time since early 1990 that manufacturers seeing a rise in export
orders outnumbered those seeing a decline.
There were 'plenty of grounds for optimism' about a recovery, Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said last night in a
speech at Manchester Business School.
He said the stability given to sterling by the European exchange rate
mechanism should provide a platform for sustained growth in a
non-inflationary environment.

FT  23 JAN 92 / TSB tests photo credit-cards
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB, the sixth-largest UK banking group, is breaking ranks with the other
big lenders and introducing a trial scheme of putting photographs on credit
cards.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, is leading government pressure on the
clearing banks to put photographs on credit cards to help combat fraud.
TSB will offer the chance of full-colour photographs to some of its
credit-card customers.
The big four clearers - Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds and Midland - say they are
not convinced that putting photographs on plastic payment cards would help
to reduce fraud. In private they claim that the government is trying to push
the banks to put photographs on cards as a substitute for a formal
identity-card scheme.
Royal Bank of Scotland has operated a trial scheme with black-and-white
photographs on cheque guarantee cards for nearly three months.
Selected customers holding the TSB Trustcard Visa card will be invited to
submit photographs for the trial, which will last a year.
About 15,000 card holders in the Brighton area will be included.
Photographs on credit cards have proved unexpectedly popular with customers.
Earlier this week Royal Bank said it was extending its trial scheme to
77,000 customers because of high demand from card holders.
The large banks are sceptical of the usefulness of photographs on cards,
saying they will not be more effective than existing security controls.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Tepid US recovery expected in first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE economy should begin to gather momentum in the spring, with a tepid
recovery taking hold in the second half of the year, Mr Robert Reischauer,
director of the Congressional Budget Office, predicted yesterday in a report
to Congress.
The report says a moderate recovery is more likely than a 'double dip'
recession, despite signs of a mild contraction of output in the fourth
quarter of last year.
CBO projections indicate growth at an annual rate of 0.9 per cent in the
current quarter, rising to 2.9 per cent in the second quarter and more than
3 per cent in the third and fourth quarters.
The projections were roughly in line with recent private-sector forecasts,
which mostly predict a weak economic recovery in the second half of the
year. The CBO, which is a non-partisan adviser to Congress, publishes
semi-annual economic forecasts.
The latest report says federal spending will account for nearly 25 per cent
of gross national product this year - the highest share since 1945. The
federal budget deficit is forecast to reach Dollars 352bn, or 6 per cent of
GNP, in the current fiscal year. This compares with a deficit of Dollars
298bn, or 4.8 per cent of GNP, last year.
The CBO is pessimistic about the prospects of reducing the deficit in the
medium term. Its forecasts show the deficit falling slowly - from Dollars
325bn in fiscal 1993 to just under Dollars 200bn in fiscal 1996, before
rising again.
Over the next six years, it expects the federal debt to rise by a total of
about Dollars 1,500bn to Dollars 4,200bn.
The report says there is a significant risk that the economy could be weaker
than forecast early this year, but it says a sharp decline is unlikely. This
time last year, the CBO, like most private forecasters, wrongly predicted
the recession would end last summer.
The study warns that the tepid recovery will reduce economic hardship no
more than gradually in much of the country, putting pressure on the
administration.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Mexico gambles on parity with dollar: Some fear Aspe is
courting disaster with his exchange rate policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE finance ministers of Chile and Mexico, the countries that have pioneered
Latin America's free market reforms, agree on much when they meet. But
Chile's Alejandro Foxley thinks Pedro Aspe is courting disaster with his
exchange rate policy.
If the Chilean is right, and the Mexican is wrong, there will be important
consequences not only for Mexico's economy but also for Mr Aspe's political
future. For the 41-year-old minister is viewed as one of the men most likely
to succeed Mexican President Carlos Salinas in 1994.
Mr Aspe wants to move the Mexican peso to parity with the US dollar, perhaps
within a year. At the end of 1991, he halved the rate of devaluation of the
peso to a nominal 2.4 per cent a year. With Mexican inflation last year of
18 per cent, against 4 per cent and falling in the US, that appears to
translate into a damaging loss of competitiveness for Mexico's exports.
The current account numbers may also suggest caution for a policy that
implies real appreciation of the Mexican currency. The deficit rose to more
than Dollars 11bn last year from just over Dollars 5bn in 1990, and will
rise further this year, some forecasts suggest to Dollars 15bn.
Yet Mr Aspe, interviewed yesterday in London, appeared as sure as ever.
Reducing peso depreciation bears down on inflation, the reduction of which
is a top priority, and enhances investor confidence.
He says the growing current account deficit causes him no undue stress.
Non-oil exports continue to grow at a healthy three or four times the rate
of growth of the economy, which last year was 4.5 per cent.
Meanwhile, consumption has not played a large part in growth of imports,
thanks in part to falls in food purchases from abroad. This has been due
more to three years of good rain than any improvement in Mexico's low farm
productivity, for which problem the administration has a longer-term plan
including a dramatic constitutional reform.
Mr Aspe says the current account gap is largely because heavy investment has
led to a sharp expansion of capital goods imports. As Volkswagen,
Mercedes-Benz and Nissan tool up to produce cars in Mexico, they initially
import machine tools. The current account thus deteriorates, before it
improves as exports begin.
The corollary of the current account deficit is large inflows of capital.
There is no government financing need, because it is running a budget
surplus equivalent to 0.8 per cent of GDP, even before substantial
privatisation receipts have been taken into account. (Privatisation receipts
are used to cancel its domestic debt.)
The capital inflows are thus entirely a private sector phenomenon which  -
unlike in Britain in the mid-1980s, when a similar claim was made - are
going mainly to finance increases in investment, rather than increases in
consumption or purchases of assets at inflated prices.
Because the inflows inflate the money supply, they have been offset by the
central bank's open market operations (the sale of securities to soak up
money) and by selling state assets. If Mr Aspe's privatisations go according
to schedule, 'in 1993, I'll not have enough assets to sell,' he says.
If the minister's forecast for inflation is correct - he expects it to drop
just below 10 per cent this year - then his policy also implies a negligible
loss of competitiveness. The inflation differential between the US and
Mexico will be about 7 percentage points, of which 3 per cent will be offset
by the peso devaluation, and a further 3 per cent by Mexican productivity
growth - if, as expected, it follows the pattern of the last two years.
The big problems arise if Mr Aspe is too sanguine about inflation, and the
key to that is the level of wage settlements in the Mexican economy. The
government has, of course, significant influence over public sector wage
settlements, which have started the year at around 15 per cent. He expects
they will be down to 12 per cent by March and on track for his inflation
target.
But he has little power to guide the fast-growing private sector. He says
the first indications this year from the private sector are positive,
suggesting settlements averaging 12 per cent. But it is early days.
In his doctoral thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr Aspe
wrote that it was tougher to get inflation down from 20 per cent to 5 per
cent, than from 1,000 per cent to 20 per cent. 'I still think it's true,' he
said yesterday. He is about to find out how tough.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Russian arms spending cuts 'almost end threat to US'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA is drastically reducing military spending and poses virtually no
threat to the US, two top US intelligence officials told Congress yesterday.
The assessment by Mr Robert Gates, the new Central Intelligence Agency, and
General James Clapper, director of the Defence Intelligence Agency, could
stoke congressional pressure for even steeper cuts in the US defence budget.
President George Bush is expected - in his State of the Union address to
Congress next week - to propose cuts of up to Dollars 50bn in defence. These
would go well beyond current plans to reduce the US armed forces by 25 per
cent by 1994, though Democrats are calling for up to Dollars 100bn in
further reductions.
Gen Clapper told the Senate Armed Services committee that the Russian
republic appeared to have cut its military procurement in the first quarter
of this year by about 80 per cent, compared to past years.
Mr Gates noted the elimination of the SS-11 and SS-17 missiles, and of a
class of submarines, as well as the winding-down of the Blackjack strategic
bomber programme. For the first time in years, there was no new ballistic
missile programme under way.
The general said military procurement had affected 'virtually all categories
of equipment', with the former Soviet republics diverting resources to feed
and house troops. The military capabilities of Russia and the other
ex-Soviet successor states were in profound decline, he said.
However, the administration remains concerned about other threats posed by
the risk of nuclear proliferation and the abrasion between Russia and
Ukraine over control of the Red Army and the Black Sea fleet. Last year, Mr
Gates also referred to the threat of civil disorder caused by economic
reforms.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday named Mr Andrew Card, deputy White House
chief of staff, as Transportation Secretary.
If confirmed by the Senate, he will succeed Mr Samuel Skinner, the new White
House chief of staff.
The departure of Mr Card opens the way for a shake-up of White House staff,
after a management review by a senior RJR Nabisco executive and friend of Mr
Skinner.
The new chief of staff blames Mr Bush's recent slide in the opinion polls on
poor communications and a staff structure which left the president
over-reliant on advice from Mr Sununu and Mr Richard Darman, the budget
director.
Recent reports suggest a chill between Mr Skinner and Mr Darman, with the
chief seeking ways to break the director's near stranglehold on domestic
policy.
Mr Card, a Massachusetts state legislator in 1974-1983, ran unsuccessfully
for the governorship of the New England state in 1982. He served in the
White House under President Reagan, and stepped up to the post of deputy
chief of staff in 1989.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Mieno detects rise in Japanese confidence
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YASUSHI MIENO, the governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday said he
detected a slight up-turn in business confidence, in a comment designed to
dispel the general gloom about the state of the national economy.
At a news conference after a meeting of the central bank's branch managers,
Mr Mieno acknowledged the economy was in fact slowing at a greater pace than
before. But the current downturn should be mild because of the growing
impact of recent declines in interest rates, he said.
Bankers said Mr Mieno's remarks seemed aimed at influencing businessmen
while they were preparing investment plans for the new financial year
starting in April.
He has specifically expressed concern, in his recent public comments, about
the weakness of business sentiment, including the statement he issued when
he last cut the official discount rate on December 30.
He now believes the reductions in interest rates could be bearing fruit. His
branch managers reported at their meeting this week that, since the last
meeting in October, business confidence had stopped declining.
Nevertheless, Mr Mieno carefully hedged his remarks, saying that it would be
an exaggeration to say that the decline in business confidence, which began
in earnest last autumn, had definitely come to an end.
He acknowledged that the weakness in the stock market could affect business
confidence and economic activity. But it was unlikely to be a serious drag
on growth.
A Bank of Japan official said Mr Mieno's comments were consistent with his
previous views but did contain a significant change in emphasis.
Mr Mieno also welcomed the recent strengthening in the yen on currency
markets, saying that in view of Japan's current account surplus it was
desirable for the yen to be stable and firm.
The yen closed unchanged in Tokyo at Y123.34 to the US dollar, keeping the
gain of about Y4 it had registered since last week.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Algeria wins a breathing space: Islamic party leader
arrested - Authorities maintain tight control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK after returning from 28 years' exile to run Algeria's emergency
council of state, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf has for the moment headed off a threat
of serious civil strife.
By a skilful mix of concession and repression, and exploiting his untainted
political credentials, this 71-year-old veteran independence leader has won
an important breathing space. He has successfully countered the pressure
from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which was denied certain victory in
the second round of the country's first multi-party elections that should
have been held on January 16.
Security forces last night arrested Mr Abdel Kader Hachani, the acting
leader of the FIS for inciting soldiers to desert the army.
The arrest was on the orders of Gen Khaled Nazzer, the minister of defence
and Algeria's military strong-man. Also detained for questioning were the
editor and deputy editor of Khabbar, the Arabic language newspaper
sympathetic to the FIS and the only one to have published the Front's
political statements.
The call to desert was issued over the weekend by the FIS ruling council,
the Majlis-es-Shura, which was addressed by Mr Hachani. Mr Hachani's arrest
was widely predicted and he had been telling colleagues he expected such a
reaction from the authorities.
The authorities this week again refused to release from jail Mr Abassi
Madani and Mr Ali ben Hadj, the two senior FIS leaders imprisoned since
June. The military-backed government has also continued to round up FIS
supporters. The FIS claims more than 500 have been arrested since the
military clampdown last week.
There have also been two reported instances of members of the security
forces being killed outside Algiers.
But the FIS has been careful to avoid a confrontation either by calling a
strike or by bringing its people on to the streets.
Within the past few days the army has returned to barracks, leaving only a
discreet presence of tanks outside key buildings. But it has retained a
tight cordon on roads leading to the capital at night.
The authorities have kept the FIS guessing whether or not the organisation
would be banned. They have also been careful to allow the press to speak
freely: however the bulk of the press has been inimical to the FIS's
declared aim of establishing an Islamic society.
Mr Boudiaf's return from exile in Morocco was negotiated by the six members
of the Higher Executive Committee. The latter was formed in the wake of
President Chadli Bendjedid's resignation on January 12 and is the real
decision-maker.
Before agreeing to lead Algeria in such dramatic circumstances after being
so long opposed to what he described as a military dictatorship, Mr Boudiaf
secretly visited Algiers. The conditions he set for his return remain
undisclosed. But it has been clear from the outset he intends to be more
than a mere puppet.
At the same time, the formation of the Council of State as a consultative
body composed of an astute mix of respected public figures unifying the
country's complex regional and religious activities, has signalled the
authorities' desire to operate by consensus.
In his only public statement, Mr Boudiaf warned the FIS that in a country
where Islam was the state religion no single group could claim it had a
monopoly. Equally significant, he was withering about the national
liberation front (FLN), which has dominated Algerian political life since
independence.
The other main lay party, the Social Front (FFS) headed by Mr Hocine Ait
Ahmed, the veteran Kabyle leader, has also sought dialogue with the FIS and
protested against the annulment. But Mr Ait Ahmed's opposition remains token
since he is opposed to imposition of full Islamic rule.
The FIS appears unable to decide whether to play for time and accept it must
operate under new rules or go underground. Against this background,
Algeria's new rulers believe they can count on a significant element in the
FIS vote having been a protest against corruption and the FLN's abuse of
power rather than a conviction to install Islamic fundamentalism. But this
protest vote, if that is what it was, will only be weaned from the FIS by
quick measures which address popular grievances of housing and employment.

FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Trade burns bright on US presidential
trail - Bush's ill-conceived Tokyo trip has exposed underlying tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush's ill-conceived trade mission to Tokyo exposed underlying
tensions in the US-Japan relationship at a time when the presidential
campaign already under way has made trade issues more prominent than ever.
The aftershocks of Mr Bush's visit are still being felt. In Tokyo, Mr Yoshio
Sakaurauchi, the House speaker, issued a pro forma apology for suggesting
that American workers are lazy and illiterate, but no amount of contrition
will obliterate his boast that the US has become 'Japan's subcontractor'. It
plays directly into fears in the American electorate, which has never quite
accepted the contention that foreign-owned factories bring only 'jobs, jobs,
jobs'.
In New Hampshire, on Sunday night, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democrat's
early frontrunner, tapped deep into the vein of American resentment, calling
it 'one of the darkest days in my adult lifetime when a Japanese prime
minister said he had sympathy for the American people'.
In Washington, the Democrats have virtually been free to criticise the
president's trip, because Republican defenders are few. Reports are
circulating that the car executives in Mr Bush's entourage only learned they
were to make the trip after reading it in the press.
In the past they have sought new voluntary import restraints, but this time
they were told the policy was to break into the Japanese market, whether or
not they had a marketable car to sell.
Around the country, newspaper headlines have been thundering about Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's contention that pledges to double purchases of US
cars by 1995 were 'only a target ..a kind of forecast.'
It has been noted that President Bush's deal is the kind of 'managed trade'
he has always opposed.
Worry about the economy has been dominating the New Hampshire primary, and
Japan provides an incendiary focal point. Sen Bob Kerrey is playing the
Japan card to the hilt in one of his television commercials, vowing to 'tell
the Japanese if we can't sell in your markets, they can't sell in ours.'
Neither Gov Clinton nor SenKerrey are protectionists. Both see the US
troubles with Japan as rooted in the failure of the Reagan and Bush
administrations to apply consistent pressure on Japan under the US trade
laws on the books.
Sen Kerrey refuses to support the latest proposal by Congressman Richard
Gephardt, the House majority leader, which would force Japan to reduce its
trade deficit by 20 per cent a year over the next five years. That would be
necessary 'only if George Bush is re-elected,' Sen Kerrey said.
Mrs Paula Stern, former chairman of the International Trade Commission and
one of Gov Clinton's advisers, says he is a committed multinationalist who
wants greater co-operation among the big three economic powers.
There are two protectionists in the presidential race - SenTom Harkin, the
Democratic populist, and Mr Pat Buchanan, the president's Republican
challenger, who vows, as 'an America First president,' to stand up to the
'tough-minded nationalists' in Japan.
Sen Harkin is promising to 'bash' President Bush instead of Japan. 'He's
doing what's in Japan's best interest, and we need a president who will do
what's in our best interest.'
Sen Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee, took to
the Senate floor on Monday, its first day in session, to contend that the
trip 'smacks of a political quick-fix to the Japanese trade problem.'
If the president really wanted to solve US trade problems with Japan, he
would have worked with Congress 'to fashion comprehensive trade and
competitiveness policy,' Sen Baucus said. 'Such a policy could make a real
difference. Unfortunately, it could not be completed in time for the primary
season.'
It took the Wall Street Journal, that unremitting enemy of managed trade, to
come to the president's defence, noting that the car parts deal could serve
'a useful purpose' in changing Japanese behavior. 'If the auto parts
agreement leads Japanese multinationals to become more open to the rest of
the world, then the end result of this flirtation with managed trade could
be a freer world trading system,' it said.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Voting unlikely to settle problems of the Punjab / A look at
prospects for next month's poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By K K SHARMA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POWERFUL group of people in India argues that the Punjab elections, set
for February 19, are not an answer to the troubled state's problems. This
opinion is strengthened by the fact that the dominant factions of Akali Dal,
the Sikhs' main political party, have decided to boycott the poll. Without
the Akalis, elections will be a farce.
The Akalis want to be a part of the political process: all their factions
have long demanded that democracy should be restored. But fear of the Sikh
militants demanding full independence for the state forced the boycott.
This month, the militants' underground committee let it be known that it did
not recognise the Akalis in the affairs of the religious community and
directed them to boycott the poll. Its warning of 'dire consequences' might
have amounted to a death sentence. The boycott was promptly announced.
Many political parties - with elections at last scheduled after 56 troubled
months, to elect 13 members to the New Delhi parliament as well as the state
legislature - had wanted to field common candidates in recognition of the
impossibility of campaigning freely, intimidation of candidates being a fact
of life.
This may have been proposed originally by the Congress party in Delhi. But
the policy was reversed when the party found itself needing Punjab's 13 MPs
to help secure a majority at national level. With the main national parties
now fighting each other, a clear outcome appears to be impossible.
The political package that the Indian government has in mind for Punjab,
therefore, has an uncertain future, at best. It contains the transfer of
Chandigarh, the common capital of Punjab and the state of Haryana, to
Punjab, and a greater sharing of river waters.
However, this over-simplifies the problem by suggesting that the Sikhs will
be satisfied with concessions they have long rejected as peripheral.
There seems to be no attempt to tackle questions even Sikh moderates
consider central, such as an apology for the central government's 1984
storming of the Sikhs' Golden Temple and the prosecution of people involved
in the riots that year in which thousands of Sikhs were killed. Moreover,
other demands have since emerged, involving security-force excesses and
civil-rights abuses.
These grievances have been ignored for so long that even moderate Sikhs feel
there is something to be said for an independent state. But this, says the
national government, cannot be considered. However, nine years of violence
cannot be wished away by holding an election.
If there were a clear choice between the democratic process and violence -
which there is not, since the militants have excluded themselves - the
elections would mean something. As it is, the poll is to be held because the
national government, after maintaining for 56 months that free and fair
elections could not be held, has nothing else to offer. There is no real
Punjab policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan signed an agreement yesterday allowing US computer
companies to bid for lucrative Japanese government contracts, AP reports
from Washington.
With President George Bush looking on, Ms Carla Hills, the US trade
representative, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister,
signed an accord that allows the US industry to break into the Dollars 9bn
(Pounds 5bn) computer market controlled by Japan's government.
Unlike voluntary targets the two governments announced on Japanese purchases
of US cars and car parts, the computer agreement is binding, Ms Hills said.
Still, she said, if US officials found Japan was maintaining trade barriers
to either computers or cars, 'there are actions we can take' to restrict
Japanese imports.
Mr Bush predicted the pact would mean 'dramatic gains in exports and
therefore in quality American jobs' in the US electronics industry.
Under the deal, the Tokyo government, which now buys Japanese computer
products almost exclusively, will open up its bidding process, allowing
foreign manufacturers the same data and timetables it provides domestic
producers.
The US computer industry estimates it can increase exports to Tokyo from
Dollars 500m to between Dollars 3.5bn and Dollars 5.5bn.
That would be in addition to the Japanese private-sector business conducted
by US computer companies. They enjoy a 41 per cent share of Japan's private
mainframe computer market, but have only 0.4 per cent of the government's
computer purchasing market.
Ms Hills said the US and Japanese governments would also be working out
similar agreements to open the paper and glass markets.
'These are the sorts of things that came out of the trip that didn't get
anywhere near as much coverage as I think they deserved,' Ms Hills said.

ZAIRE'S national radio station in the capital Kinshasa was believed to be
back in government hands early this morning after rebel soldiers had seized
it and called on President Mobutu Sese Seko to resign, Reuter reports from
Kinshasa.
Ealier, gunfire had echoed through Kinshasa, witnesses said, as the mutinous
troops broadcast a call for the government of Prime Minister Nguza
Karl-i-Bond to step down.
Also yesterday, the European Community suspended all non-humanitarian aid to
Zaire in protest at the failure of the government to move towards a more
democratic system.
The soldiers, who seized the radio station at midnight, called on their
colleagues to stay in barracks and told the people not to riot.
The rebels appealed to the embassies of the US ,Belgium and France for
military help andsaid their action was due to the 'poverty and famine' in
the vast central African country.
Earlier in the day the main opposition party, Union for Democracy and Social
Progress said its co-chairmen, Mr Etienne Tshisekedi and Mr Frederic Kibassa
had been injured when presidential guards drove into a protest march in the
capital.
Supporters of the opposition alliance, Sacred Union, had clashed with troops
on Monday and Tuesday in protest at the suspension of a national conference
last Sunday aimed at guiding the country towards democracy.
The Sacred Union called a general strike starting today if the government
failed to revoke the suspension.
Kinshasa and other major cities were devastated by a wave of looting and
riots last September, triggered by unpaid troops. At least 250 people were
killed and some 20,000 expatriate workers were evacuated by French and
Belgian troops.
Earlier yesterday both Washington and Paris condemned Zaire for suspending
the national conference aimed at moving the country towards democracy.

GEORGIAN government troops last night attacked the Black Sea port of Poti,
breaking a ceasefire agreed with supporters of ousted President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, Reuter reports.
Troops loyal to the military council now ruling Georgia opened fire shortly
after the 5pm GMT expiry of a deadline for Poti to surrender.
The troops had advanced to within 400 metres of the pro-Gamsakhurdia forces.
But a further advance had been made difficult because the city's defenders
had bombed one of two bridges providing access to Poti. The other bridge was
barricaded off with concrete blocks.
Poti is one of the few remaining towns controlled by Mr Gamsakhurdia's
supporters in west Georgia, his home region where he has launched an attempt
to regain power from the military alliance that drove him from the capital
Tbilisi three weeks ago.
Mr Jaba Ioseliani, co-chairman of the military council, said peace talks
that had been going on throughout the day had failed. 'War is inevitable.
There is no other way.'
There was uncertainty about the fate of the other main redoubt of
Gamsakhurdia support, Zugdidi to the north. Its inhabitants had spent the
day in fear of an attack from government troops about 25km away after
failing to meet a deadline to surrender.
Mr Gamsakhurdia's representative there, Mr Volter Shurgaya, told reporters
earlier that Mr Ioseliani had threatened to attack unless the town's railway
station was unblocked.
Inside his local government headquarters overlooking the town square, there
had been bedlam as panic-stricken citizens thronged corridors and banged on
his door in search of news. But by late evening a crowd of several hundred,
huddling around bonfires in the square in heavy snow, had dwindled to about
a dozen.
There was no sign of preparations for armed resistance although the military
council said around 800 armed men had taken refuge in Zugdidi.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Hong Kong 'kingpin of rapid growth' in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG is set for strong growth through the 1990s, propelled by its role
at the heart of south China's economy, and as a driving force behind
fast-growing intra-Asian trade and investment, according to a leading Hong
Kong economist.
Professor Edward Chen, head of the Centre for Asian Studies and a member of
the territory's Legislative Council, told a conference in London that China
'could not possibly revoke' its commitment to economic reform. He said the
Chinese economy 'already has a high degree of openness', with 20 per cent of
its GNP accounted for by exports, and 16 per cent by imports - a development
over the past decade that has made it the world's 15th largest exporter.
Prof Chen challenged rather simplistic models for the creation of an Asian
trading bloc focused on Japan by foreseeing Hong Kong as the driving force
within one of four interlocked economic zones in Asia, all of which can
expect dynamic growth. These are:
'Greater Hong Kong', or the South China Zone, comprising Guangdong and
Fujian provinces in China, as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Yellow Sea zone, focused on north-east China around Dalian, including
Shandong province, and driven by investment from South Korea.
Greater Indochina economic zone, driven by Thailand, and including Vietnam,
Laos, Kampuchea and Burma.
A zone focused on Singapore, including Indonesia and the southern part of
peninsular Malaysia.
The increasing interdependence of these regions was underscored by the
rising volume of intra-regional trade.
Hong Kong's pivotal role was highlighted by the fact that it was the world's
leading investor in China.

FT  23 JAN 92 / EC food aid to 'pull down' Russian prices

<TEXT>
EC FOOD aid went on sale in Moscow and St Petersburg this week in an attempt
to bring down soaring prices in markets and state shops.
Some 8,500 tonnes of meat, skimmed milk and butter have been delivered to
the two cities this month, with supplies coming
in at the rate of 400 tonnes a day, building up to 2,000 tonnes a day over
the next few weeks.
Mr Michael Emerson, head of the EC delegation in Moscow, said prices had
reached 'exotic' levels, but were bound to come down as it became clear that
average households could not afford them. He said prices being set for EC
food would 'probably' pull down the higher prices.
The price agreed between the EC and the Moscow city government for a kilo of
butter - Rbs56 - represents a hefty rise on pre-liberalisation levels. The
price in peasant markets and some shops is around Rbs130 per kilo.
Senior officials of the International Monetary Fund in Moscow yesterday
warned that measures to privatise enterprises and shops must be taken
quickly if the government is to reap real gains from liberalisation of
prices.
The officials said that while the Russian government programme was
proceeding 'very much in the right direction, we would like to see action
taken on budgetary and monetary policy, in view of the magnitude of the
imbalances to be corrected'
Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent, adds: Finance ministers from the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries will try to agree how to admit
the republics of the former Soviet Union to membership of the IMF at their
meeting this weekend.
G7 officials say there is broad agreement the republics should become IMF
members as soon as possible. But difficulties concerning the size of their
quotas, or membership subscriptions, to the fund and the representation of
the republics on the IMF's executive board could cause delay.

HONG KONG politicians yesterday attacked Britain over the way it is handling
the replacement of Sir David Wilson, the colony's governor.
In a debate in the Legislative Council about Hong Kong's requirements of a
new governor, many members criticised 'the thoughtless and cavalier way' in
which the British government announced his retirement, and the failure to
name his successor. London announced in December that Sir David would leave
some time this year.
The debate reflected the life breathed into local politics by the direct
elections to some seats last September.
Mixed feelings in Hong Kong about the advent of this limited democracy were
underlined, however, by speakers to a conference on Hong Kong's future in
London yesterday.
Mr Stephen Cheong, a member of the Legislative Council, sharply criticised
the United Democrats, who won a majority of the directly-elected seats. He
said they insisted on interfering in Chinese political affairs and were
undermining the Hong Kong government through their opposition to its
policies. Mr Cheong said their 'welfarist' approach could dampen the
territory's laissez-faire atmosphere.
'Political agitations which threaten to destroy the fabric of our society,
no matter how idealistic they sound, can only be detrimental to the
long-term interest of the people of Hong Kong,' Mr Cheong said.
Another senior member, Mr Allen Lee, was also unwilling to upset Beijing
when asked about speeding up the democratic process. Although he noted that
Hong Kong had originally sought a faster pace than was agreed between
Britain and China, and that Britain planned to raise the issue again, he
said there was little hope of fighting China on the issue and that
confrontation should be avoided.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Commission unleashes powerful forces: Big energy suppliers
will fight to keep their monopolies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS' first faltering steps towards opening up the European Community
energy market still face fierce opposition from established power suppliers
reluctant to relinquish their monopoly clout. Many state utilities have
great influence over their respective governments and could delay the
approval of the Commission's draft directive on energy liberalisation.
'I'm not against competition, but it's clear to me that if you change the
system in this way, you run the risk of disturbing the security of supply,'
said Mr Robert Grosman at Electrabel, Belgium's main electricity supplier.
In order to combat some of this opposition, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha has
sidestepped the issue of central regulation for the emerging market and is
leaving it up to the individual EC states. The Commission will review the
situation in 1995 to check whether competition is going ahead as planned.
Said Mr Jonathan Stern, energy expert at the Royal Institute for
International Affairs: 'It could mean that the legislation is put in place,
but nothing happens in practice, because there is no one to ensure that it
does.' He argues that those countries which face most opposition to the
plans, could just drag their feet on introducing the framework.
At the same time, some consumers are eager to push ahead more quickly with a
fully competitive market. By initially restricting competition to customers
using more than 25m cubic metres of gas or 100GW hours of electricity a
year, the Commission has ensured that only the largest users, such as
aluminium- and steel-makers, and glass and chemicals companies, will
benefit.
Companies will also have to be using that much power at an individual site
rather than on a company-wide basis, before they can canvass alternative
suppliers.
For instance, Dow Chemical has 35 sites in Europe, but only five or six
would qualify for the high energy consumption required. 'This means the
Commission is only scratching the surface on competition,' said Mr Francesco
Balocco, European energy supply manager at Dow.
'We want a lot of new players to come into the market, but the only way that
will happen is if there is a large enough slice of the market to warrant
their participation.'
Nevertheless, Brussels has had to tread carefully in order to deal with the
sensibilities of most member countries. Even consumers are not united in
wanting a swift approach to competition.
In Germany, where the Vereinigung Industrieller Kraftwirtschaft represents
the interests of large and small power users, customers favour a slower
pace. One consumer argues that if the whole market is thrown open to
competition, the results could be so chaotic that it would justify the
opposition of the country's large regional monopoly power groups.
Regional power monopolies in Germany are entrenched in law and consumers are
calling for a strong legislative framework to overcome the current system.
Domestic consumers are unlikely to feel any benefits of a more open market
before the end of the decade. In fact, many large electricity suppliers
argue that the household customer could initially be paying higher prices
for his power to compensate for the increased investment companies will make
in competing for large industrial clients.
One area where the Commission hopes that competitive advantages may filter
down to households is through large energy distributors buying power outside
their home country.
For example, in France where 22 municipalities account for 4 per cent of gas
sales, the largest distributors could band together to ensure their needs
are greater than the 25m threshold and buy cheaper gas from, say, the
Netherlands.
The UK has been most enthusiastic about greater competition in the power
market since the main suppliers have been privatised over the past decade.
British energy companies are keen to expand on the continent and National
Power and PowerGen, the two generating companies, refused to sign a paper
put out by Eurelectric, the Brussels electricity lobby group, which opposed
the Commission's plans.
'We argued against more competition here (in the UK) when it was first
mooted in 1987,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power. 'We
said it would not work and that security of supply would be endangered, but
we've been proved wrong.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Airline pilots defend safety record of A320
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRLINE PILOTS and industry observers yesterday defended the safety record
of the Airbus A320, the type of aircraft which crashed into a French
hillside on Monday night, killing 87 people.
Pilots' organisations said that computerised controls, which have been at
the heart of speculation over the safety of the A320, had been in service in
other aircraft for 20 years and added to aircraft safety.
Concern has arisen because the A320 is regarded as the most technically
advanced passenger aircraft flying, but there have been two other A320
crashes since the model was launched four years ago. Subsequent
investigations blamed pilot error for both accidents.
The Airline Users Committee (AUC), established by the US Civil Aviation
Authority, said it was 'concerned but not worried' about the record of the
A320. 'The three Airbus crashes are so dissimilar that it would be wrong to
jump to the conclusion that there is anything wrong with the technology,'
said Mr John Parr of the AUC.
International airline organisations were more reluctant to comment on the
A320 so soon after a crash. A senior executive at one of them said: 'the
aircraft's technology was the last thing that came to mind when I heard the
news'.
Statistics seem to support such a view. There were 10 air crashes into
hillsides in 1991, according to unpublished figures from Flight
International, the trade magazine. None of them was an A320.
Some of the most vocal criticisms of the A320 have come from pilots' unions,
especially in France, where the Airbus is assembled. The unions have
criticised the aircraft for using a small crew, two instead of the
traditional three, and its computers, which can prevent extreme manoeuvres
unless the pilot first switches them off.
The British Airline Pilots Association acknowledged that some pilots fear
that controlling the aircraft in a crisis 'could be complicated'. It argued,
however, that the technology used 'has been accepted worldwide by pilots. It
is very safe because computers are faster on the uptake than people'.

FT  23 JAN 92 / EC energy plan 'could save millions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC ENERGY users could save 'tens of millions of ecus' on their annual gas
and electricity bills, the European Commission said yesterday, if member
states approve its plans to introduce a genuine internal market in energy.
The draft directives, which Brussels agreed on yesterday, aim to open up the
gas and electricity networks to greater competition from the beginning of
next year. They would enable the largest energy users - steel and aluminium
plants, large construction sites, chemical, glass and fertiliser factories -
to buy their gas and electricity from suppliers anywhere in the Community
from January 1, 1993. At the same time, energy distributors would be able to
club together to gain access to the whole network, passing on the savings to
smaller consumers.
Assuming the legislation is successful, the same principles will be extended
to smaller users from January 1, 1996, but before then these directives will
have to overcome fierce opposition from most EC gas and energy producers and
a number of member states.
Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, said yesterday
that in some cases the infrastructure needed for the cross-border transport
of energy was not in place, but the directives would allow new companies to
build gas and electricity lines.
Access to the network would be available to some 400-500 large industrial
users of electricity, each of which consumes more than 100GW hours of
electricity annually, and to consumers of more than 25m cubic metres of gas
a year. Distributors which account for 3 per cent or more of electricity, or
1 per cent of gas consumption in an individual member state, would also be
entitled to shop around for better prices.
Last October, Mr Cardoso e Cunha dropped more aggressive plans to break up
energy monopolies using the Commission's special legal powers, when it
became clear that some member states - in particular the Netherlands,
Germany and France - would block such an approach. The Commission has not
abandoned those powers, but Mr Cardoso e Cunha hopes the gradual approach
will prove more acceptable to member states.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Haughey denies phone-tap roleas coalition crisis deepens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Charles Haughey's position as Irish prime minister, and the future of his
coalition government, was left hanging in doubt last night after allegations
that he was fully aware in 1982 of an illegal telephone tapping operation.
Mr Haughey yesterday denounced the allegations as 'monstrous and unfounded'.
The tiny Progressive Democrat (PD) party, whose six parliamentary seats have
kept Mr Haughey's government in power since 1989, last night refrained from
the feared move of immediately withdrawing from the coalition.
But it issued a serious warning and hinted it might still pull out if Mr
Haughey were not able to restore quickly the 'credibility and stability of
the government'.
The PD statement, issued by Mr Des O'Malley, the party leader, is being
interpreted as a veiled invitation to the leaders of a growing wave of
dissent within Fianna Fail to oust Mr Haughey as leader.
If instability in the government continues, the PD party may withdraw from
the government after the 1992 budget is passed this month.
The phone-tapping accusations were made by Mr Haughey's former justice
minister, Mr Sean Doherty, who said on Tuesday night that over several
months in 1982 he had personally given Mr Haughey transcripts of the taped
conversations of two journalists who were being investigated over cabinet
leaks.
'At no stage did (Mr Haughey) indicate disapproval of the action which had
been taken,' said Mr Doherty, who resigned yesterday as chairman of the
Irish Senate.
Opposition leaders yesterday called for Mr Haughey's resignation. Mr Dick
Spring, leader of the Labour party, said: 'If Mr Sean Doherty is being
truthful, then the prime minister has lied consistently for nine years, to
his own cabinet, to his party, to the Dail (parliament) and to the country .
. . for the sake of his party and the country, he must be got rid of now.'
Mr Haughey said yesterday: 'I wish to categorically state that I was not
aware at the time of the tapping of these telephones, and that I was not
given and did not see any transcripts of the conversations.'
He asked: 'Why should I resign for something someone else has done?'
Mr Padraig Flynn, a former environment minister who was sacked by Mr Haughey
last November for supporting a backbench leadership putsch against him, said
yesterday: 'Fianna Fail cannot hope to improve its position under Mr
Haughey's leadership. The issue now is to restore the party's political
integ-rity.'
Mr Haughey claimed yesterday that Mr Doherty, who lost his cabinet post over
the bugging affair, was 'part of a campaign designed to replace me as leader
of the Fianna Fail party and (as) prime minister'. He pointed the finger at
dissidents within his party who led last November's challenge.
Mr Haughey comfortably survived a no-confidence motion at the time, but
according to Mr Flynn this was because he had indicated he would withdraw
from the leadership once he had completed an immediate work schedule.
Yesterday, Mr Haughey said there was 'no time-frame' for his departure. Mr
Flynn said 'that statement must be exercising a lot of minds at the moment'.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Lloyd's U-turn on running of market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE governing Council of Lloyd's yesterday backed down from its rejection of
a proposed reform in the way the insurance market is run, in the face of
widespread opposition.
The council last week accepted most of the 65 recommended reforms put
forward in a detailed report on Lloyd's future but rejected the proposed
separation of its regulatory and business development functions.
Yesterday, however, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said the
council would now review the recommendations on governance in the task force
report 'in the same manner as the report's other recommendations'.
The council is to create a 'working group' headed by Sir Jeremy Morse,
chairman of Lloyds Bank, to 'examine further' the governance proposals. Mr
David Rowland, the insurance broker who chaired the task force, will also be
a member of the team and regards the proposals on governance as among the
most important put forward by the task force.
The working group will consider in detail the task force's proposed creation
of a board to run the market mainly made up of representatives of Lloyd's
underwriting businesses - a framework which would leave the council free to
focus on its regulatory role.
Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's, is understood to back the change
of stance despite the fact that on Monday he said that he might have had to
quit if the governance proposal had been accepted by the council.
He had said the model proposed by the task force was unworkable and would
have delayed the implementation of other changes suggested by the report.
Mr Lord's position, however, appears to have been opposed by the majority of
the agencies which manage Lloyd's syndicates and by the Association of
Lloyd's Members, which represents the interests of more than 9,000 Names -
the individuals whose capital supports underwriting in the market.
Mr Val Powell, ALM chief executive, said: 'It's a sensible way to go. The
working group will give these recommendations the serious consideration that
they deserve.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Weak output points to prolonged recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK INDUSTRIAL output figures released yesterday raised fears that Britain
was heading for its longest recession since the Second World War.
Manufacturing output fell by 1.2 per cent in the three months to November
compared with the previous three months. This points towards flat or
negative output, excluding oil and gas, in the fourth quarter of 1991 - the
sixth successive quarterly decline of such output.
More bleak news came from a survey by the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce. It reported a decline in business confidence in the final quarter
of last year and said recovery was likely to be postponed from the second to
the third quarter of this year.
Factors holding back an upturn included low levels of manufacturing
investment and the prospect of further rises in unemployment, which would
damage consumer confidence.
The signs are that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will present his second
Budget on March 10 against the background of depressed activity in the
economy. Provisional figures for fourth-quarter gross domestic product will
be released on February 20. These are now expected to show that the economy
resumed its downward path towards the end of last year after a minimal
recovery in the third quarter on the strength of increased North Sea oil
output.
This would mean that the recession had run for six quarters compared with
five quarters for the previous longest post-war recession which lasted from
the end of 1979 to spring 1981.
According to figures from the Central Statistical Office, manufacturing
output in November rose 0.1 per cent compared with October, but remained 4
per cent down on the year. The index for November stood at 111.2 compared
with a peak of 120.5 in the second quarter of 1990.
Energy output, mostly North Sea oil production, fell by 2.4 per cent on the
month, but was 0.9 per cent up in the three months to November compared with
the June to August figure.
The Treasury said the figures confirmed that economic activity had been flat
since the middle of 1991.
'It is too early to say what the fourth quarter will be, but it is clearly
not going to be the 1.5 per cent growth predicted in the Autumn Statement,'
said the Treasury.
The weakest area in manufacturing continued to be engineering. Output fell
by 2.6 per cent in the three months to November compared with the previous
three and stood 7.1 per cent down on the year.
Output of metals, minerals, investment goods, food, textiles, clothing and
aerospace products fell.
Only output in the chemicals sector continued to rise, registering a 2.3 per
cent increase in the three months to November compared with the three months
to August.
There was some comfort for the government on inflation prospects with a
slowdown in the growth of manufacturers' unit wage costs.
Wage costs in the three months to November rose 5 per cent compared with the
same period a year ago and by 1.7 per cent compared with the previous three
months. In the third quarter of 1991 they rose by 0.9 per cent compared with
a rise of 7 per cent in the same quarter of 1990.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Kinnock vows to reverse pre-poll basic rate tax cut:
Decision to hold Budget on March 10 fuels election fever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK gave an unequivocal pledge yesterday that an incoming Labour
government would reverse any pre-election cut in the basic rate of income
tax as the government fuelled election fever by setting the Budget for March
10.
But in a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times - in which he
predicted a Labour majority at Westminster of 20 seats - Mr Kinnock hinted
he would be loath to campaign on a promise to overturn a Budget move to
raise tax thresholds.
In confident mood, the Labour leader said he would continue to encourage
'constructive debate' on constitutional reform - including the introduction
of a proportional voting system for Westminster. But he dismissed
suggestions that such a change might be part of a deal with the Liberal
Democrats if the election result left a hung parliament.
The announcement by the government of a relatively early Budget date
confirmed that Mr John Major wants, if possible, to call a general election
for April 9. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, signalled that
the government should keep its options open by confirming a personal
preference for May 7 or, possibly, late June.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, accepted in the Commons yesterday that the
promised economic recovery had not yet materialised. He insisted, however,
it would become 'firmly established' in the course of the year.
Facing a continuing Conservative onslaught on his tax and spending
proposals, Mr Kinnock sought in his FT interview to dismiss recent confusion
over the timing of proposals to abolish the present Pounds 20,280 salary
ceiling on National Insurance contributions.
Confirming also that Labour policy eventually will limit tax allowances to
the basic rate of income tax - in line with the present treatment of
mortgage interest relief - Mr Kinnock said the aim always had been to
minimise the disruption of family budgets by seeking to phase all changes.
He said: 'No opposition in history has ever been as candid as we are . . .
What is certain is that we will raise pensions and child benefit, we will
remove the ceiling on National Insurance contributions. There will be a 50
per cent top tax rate. And that tax change will apply only to those earning
well in excess of Pounds 30,000 a year.'
Beyond that, the timing of both the tax and NI contributions increases
needed to pay for the higher child benefit and pensions would depend on the
'the details available to us in government'.
Mr Kinnock added, with specific reference to NI contributions: 'We're only
going to open the door . . . but there will be a choice, as to whether we
open the door wide, or we open the door a little.'
If Mr Lamont used his Budget to cut the basic rate of income tax by 1p to
24p in the pound, Mr Kinnock had no doubt Labour would fight the election on
a policy of reversing it. The party's long-established policy had been that
it should neither be increased nor decreased, he said.
But he was equivocal about the response if the same Pounds 2bn was used to
raise tax thresholds: 'You are giving me an invitation which I can't take
up. We could not have a policy relating to thresholds - or a variety of
other options open to the chancellor - unless and until we know what he is
going to do in terms of the resources available'.
That response is likely to intensify the pressure on Mr Lamont from a
growing number of Tory MPs to launch the election campaign with a 1p cut in
the basic rate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Michael Cleary and Bob Burns, managers of and shareholders in Kembrey,
a Swindon-based electrical components manufacturer, promised institutional
investors an exciting time as they introduced the company for a full stock
exchange listing in 1990, they had hardly bargained for the excitement they
delivered.
In a deal completed at 2.30 am yesterday morning, Cleary, ousted as chief
executive in an apparent boardroom coup at the beginning of December, and
Burns, who resigned as chairman earlier in the year over strategy
differences, clawed their way back into the driving seat of the company the
two had originally secured in a management buy-in during 1986. Each had held
onto their respective 13 per cent stakes in Kembrey during the upheaval in
the hope of making a comeback.
While Cleary is once again chief executive, Burns returns as a director, and
a new non-executive chairman will be found shortly.
The seeds of discord had been sown following the reversal of Kembrey at the
end of 1989 into Coated Electrodes, then a struggling USM-quoted company.
Alan Hinchcliffe, who was operations director of Kembrey but had previously
been chief executive of Coated Electrodes in Sheffield, and Robert Jakeways,
previously a Coated Electrodes director who had been acting chairman for
some months after Burns' departure, resigned yesterday from the Kembrey
board. So did David Frith, who had been chairman for exactly seven weeks.
Frith has a Sheffield business in the unrelated field of scientific ovens.
While cagey as to the precise details of the upheaval, Cleary acknowledged a
'clash of personalities'.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Appointments: Kicking the habit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Dunstan, who has spent 23 years at Abbey National, is kicking the habit
to join management consultants Oasis as head of the marketing and sales
management division.
Dunstan, who is 43, was sales director at Abbey for the last year, and
marketing director for the previous seven. He says that while the building
society had been through a vast upheaval during its metamorphosis into a
public company, he was worried that it was now entering a period of
stagnation - or worse. 'People were genuinely concerned about it becoming
another TSB.'
Unwilling to hang on for several years of potential frustration, he decided
to accept the approach from Oasis, an outfit which had impressed him three
years ago when he employed it to help Abbey develop its data base. He
reckons his experience with Abbey's shift from a product-to a
customer-driven business will have all sorts of applications among Oasis'
clients, which include other building societies as well as insurance
companies.

The Council was set up last year to help implement a strategy for
strengthening Britain's manufacturing base, following criticism of the CBI
for neglecting the needs of the manufacturing sector.
Sir Alistair, who is non-executive chairman of Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals

<TEXT>
Jim Maxmin, the energetic American chief executive of Laura Ashley, is
continuing to make rapid headway in reshaping the company's image.
Yesterday he announced the appointment of Denise Lincoln, 40, as global
human resources director with effect from February 3. She becomes the first
woman since the late Laura Ashley to sit on the board of the fabrics and
fashion group. About 80 per cent of the company's staff are female.
Her brief will be to help co-ordinate company training initiatives in the 27
countries where Laura Ashley trades. Maxmin said: 'I think in today's world
no company can realise its potential unless its people do. Education and
personal development will become one of our competitive weapons for the
future.'
Resources permitting, Laura Ashley is planning to establish an international
training centre at Carno, in Wales, where the company was founded.
Lincoln is currently group management development director at Grand
Metropolitan and has had previous management experience in the US.

FT  23 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil is ready to perform in glare of
the spotlight - Economic measures have now begun to stimulate overseas
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After star performances by other Latin American stock markets over the last
few years, Brazil is finally getting its turn in the spotlight. Share prices
surged 44.9 per cent in dollar terms in December and 29 per cent this month,
catapulting Brazil into first place among emerging markets.
Some observers predict that the country will end 1992 as the world's best
performer. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, says: 'I think
Brazil will take over from Argentina as the top-performing stock market in
1992.'
Buenos Aires chalked up the best result last year, rising 392.5 per cent in
dollar terms, followed by Colombia, Pakistan and Brazil. Mr Alvaro Vidigal,
president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange, agrees: 'Brazil is on the right
track economically. At least Dollars 1bn will enter the stock market from
abroad this year, which will push up prices tremendously.'
Brazil drew in some Dollars 450m in overseas funds in 1991, after opening
its stock market in mid-year for the first time to direct investment by
foreigners. Initially, investment was restricted to institutions and 77
entered the market last year. But this month, the CVM, Brazil's stock market
watchdog, loosened the rules further. Now, non-profit-making bodies, global
managers of holdings of high net-worth individuals and other financial
entities recognised by the CVM can buy Brazilian equities.
Mr Vidigal's Dollars 1bn estimate is conservative, according to some. 'Banks
are telling me that up to Dollars 2bn will enter the country this year,'
says Mr Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho, president of the CVM. 'And I think their
assessment is reasonable.'
The opening of the stock market to foreigners is just half of the equation;
investors also need a reason to invest. In December, that reason appeared in
the form of a standby facility with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
) Other positive steps, such as tax reform and privatisation, have also
pleased investors. 'There is a real change in perception about Brazil,' says
Roger Wright, head of the foreign investment fund at Banco de Investimentos
Garantia. 'Investors believe that congress will back the president in
economic reforms. The rise in prices reflects a belief that things are
finally going to get done.'
He warns, however, that the equity market is unlikely to rise steadily.
'This year will be a roller-coaster ride, although the trend will certainly
be up,' he says. 'We will be getting a lot of bad news this year along with
the good news.'
Last week, some bad news caused a dip in the index when the IMF voiced its
concern over plans to offer pensioners a 147 per cent rise in social
security payments. The IMF is worried that the extra cost, which could run
into billions of dollars, will prevent Brazil from balancing its budget this
year.
To placate the IMF, President Fernando Collor de Mello decreed that the
adjustment be paid only in 1993. However, the Attorney General, Aristides
Junqueira, declared the move unconstitutional. President Collor has said
that if he loses the battle, he will boost income taxes to foot the bill.
Yesterday the stock market was steady, after closing at 9,036 on Tuesday, as
investors waited for further developments.
Another danger is the formation of an investment bubble, a quick rise in
prices followed by a crash. According to Mr Mattos Filho, this would occur
if demand for Brazilian equities failed to be accompanied by a rise in
supply. 'New stock issues are necessary to prevent this from happening,' he
says. Mr Vidigal believes the exchanges will see a spate of new issues in
1992: 'We will see a lot of new paper on the market.'
Brazil's performance this year will depend on several factors, most
importantly the government's ability to control inflation. Price rises are
running at about 25 per cent a month, and many economists expect inflation
to stay high for much of the year. Investors will also keep an eye on the
privatisation programme, which is an essential part in reducing the federal
deficit.
Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the National Development Bank, which is in
charge of privatisation, expects to raise over Dollars 3bn this year from
selling off state companies.
If Brazil pushes through the economic reforms it has begun, it seems likely
that foreign money will keep pouring in. 'As the foreigners enter,
Brazilians become more interested in the market, and that helps fuel price
rises,' says Mr Vidigal.

FT  23 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on hopes of
discount rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF a cut in the official discount rate and bargain hunting by
institutional investors lifted share prices, and the Nikkei average jumped
3.2 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 675.82 up at the day's high of 21,534.12 after
falling for four consecutive trading days. The index opened at 20,851.29 and
briefly declined to the day's low of 20,702.98.
Volume rose marginally to 270m shares from 230m as trading remained
dealer-led. Share prices surged across the board, with rises finally
outnumbering falls by 868 to 179, and 114 issues remaining unchanged. All 36
sectors advanced on the TSE first section. The Topix index of all first
section stocks gained 34.38 to 1,603.81, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index added 1.70 at 1,238.42.
The market lost ground at the opening on futures-related selling, but later
firmed as foreign securities houses were seen short-covering in the futures
market, which prompted arbitrage buying.
The sharp fall in short-term interest rates triggered speculation that the
Bank of Japan was ready to cut the official discount rate. Yields on the
three months certificates of deposit plunged below 5 per cent for the first
time in two years and eight months, and the No 129 10-year benchmark bond
closed at a record low of 5.195 per cent.
Bargain hunting by domestic institutions was noted, and pension funds and
insurance companies were seen buying just before the close. Mr Shin Tokoi at
County NatWest commented: 'The mood has improved and it seems that the
market has seen the bottom.'
However, some investors were still cautious. A fund manager at Dai-Ichi
Mutual Life said there could be investors wanting to sell at higher levels.
Purchases by foreign investors lifted international blue chips. Hitachi
climbed Y19 to Y939 and Fujitsu added Y11 at Y820. Interest rate-sensitive,
large-capital issues were picked up by domestic investors, with Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries firming Y3 to Y643 and Nippon Steel Y3 to Y356.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y4,000 to Y702,000, recovering the
Y700,000 level for the first time in three days. Financials were also
higher, Fuji Bank gaining Y120 to Y2,260 and Nomura Securities Y40 to
Y1,530. Oji Paper put on Y11 to Y881 in active trading on expectations that
the paper industry will recover at the end of this year.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 528.55 to 22,723.48 in volume of 131.5m
shares. Investors sought high-priced issues, with Nintendo advancing Y550 to
Y10,500 and Ono Pharmaceutical Y500 to Y4,870.
Roundup
RISES and falls were almost equally balanced in the region's markets
yesterday.
HONG KONG set its seventh consecutive record as the Hang Seng index
appreciated 28.51 to 4,550.72 in turnover up from HKDollars 2.11bn to
HKDollars 2.31bn. Properties and banks led, conglomerates registered small
advances and utilities were slightly lower.
After an early index retreat of 20 points, shares climbed steadily to an
intraday peak of up 40 points before easing after the lunch break.
SEOUL rallied on expectations of lower interest rates, the composite index
rising 16.28 to 646.28 in turnover up from Won416.4bn to Won461.9bn. Shares
priced below Won10,000, and those with low price/earnings ratios, led the
market up, the first category because they tend to belong to smaller
companies which are interest rate-sensitive, and the second, seen as
undervalued, following a fashion of recent days.
AUSTRALIA weakened on economic worries. The All Ordinaries index closed 15.4
lower at 1,631.5.
BHP fell 14 cents to ADollars 13.74. The company reported that domestic
steel sales rose 6 per cent to 186,000 metric tons in December but that
steel sales for the seven months to December dropped 14 per cent to 1.8m
metric tons.
NEW ZEALAND came under pressure from foreign selling. The NZSE-40 index
ended 11.84 down at 1,472.58. Turnover rose to NZDollars 34.2m from
NZDollars 23.5m.
Telecom was steady at NZDollars 2.39 on the day's heaviest market volume of
4.4m shares. Fletcher Challenge initially fell to NZDollars 2.38 before
ending a net 2 cents up at NZDollars 2.45 on the next biggest volume of 3.1m
shares. The turnround was triggered by news that the company has signed a
lucrative 10-year contract to supply methanol to Japan.
MANILA continued to consolidate last week's gains. The composite index lost
19.69 to 1,281.31 in turnover of 149m pesos, after 163m. Meralco further
strengthened, the 'A' shares climbing 21 pesos to 162.
BANGKOK balanced profit-taking with heavy buying in two finance issues, and
the SET index ended 3.30 off at 772.71 in turnover down from Bt12.5bn to
Bt8.49bn.
BOMBAY reached a new closing high of 2,132.82, up 17.11, on reports that the
government might allow multinationals to increase their minority stakes to
51 per cent.

FT  23 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt falls after steel
talks break down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-taking, a weak Wall Street overnight and consolidation were the
watchwords in bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT tried to go higher again, but slipped on a combination of the
breakdown of the steel wage talks, and technical factors. The DAX index
closed 5.19 lower at 1,680.10 against an intraday high of 1,688.23 and after
a fall of 2.08 to 685.12 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume fell from DM9.5bn
to DM7.4bn.
Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that the bond market had
been strong for several hours but eventually weakened in the afternoon. As
for equities, he said, their relative strength indicator had been saying for
several days that the market was overbought.
Among blue chips, the gold refiner, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group,
Degussa, rose DM6.40 or 2 per cent to DM332.40 after DM339.90, reflecting
the move from defensive to cyclical stocks in brokers' buy lists. Thyssen
fell DM3 to DM218.30 on the steel talks breakdown.
Deutsche Bank rose early on hopes of a rise in its 1991 dividend, peaking at
DM711 but then easing back to close unchanged at DM706.50. It said that a
final decision on the dividend would be taken in March; last year, the bank
gave an early indication of the 1990 payout in late January.
PARIS was hit by a wave of selling in the afternoon, which some dealers
suspected might be linked to futures arbitrage. The CAC 40 index dropped
26.59 to 1,841.32 in turnover of FFr2.3bn after FFr2.9bn.
Leading blue-chips bore the brunt of the day's fall, with BSN losing FFr14
to FFr1,095, Peugeot dropping FFr23 to FFr685 and Total falling FFr45 or 4.1
per cent to FFr1,059.
Eurotunnel fell as low as FFr42.70 before recovering to close FFr1.10 lower
at FFr44.15 with a hefty 3.2m shares traded after a UK appeals court ruled
in favour of Trans-Manche Link, the Anglo-French building consortium in
dispute with Eurotunnel on cost overruns.
Alcatel Alsthom fell FFr7 to FFr584 as the market gave a thumbs-down to
reports in the French press that it was going to take a stake in
SGS-Thomson. The company later denied the reports.
ZURICH closed mixed in active trade, with banks and some insurers attracting
buying interest, while industrials and chemicals consolidated recent gains.
The all-share SPI index closed 0.8 higher at 1,111.2 but Union Bank and CS
Holding bearers each put on SFr30, to SFr3,810 and SFr1,950.
There was some speculation about whether the rating agency, Moody's, would
downgrade Credit Suisse, CS Holding's major asset. The decision was expected
this week, but Moody's said yesterday that it had not been taken yet.
MILAN saw some interest in the insurer Generali, in view of the industry
reforms currently going through parliament, but trading was thin. The Comit
index fell 1.99 to 537.97 in turnover estimated at L100bn after Tuesday's
L103.6bn.
Generali was initially weak, falling L105 to an official close of L30,390
but it later rose as high as L30,550 on the kerb.
Among industrials, Olivetti added L44 to L2,709 while Fiat shed L95 to
L5,080 but recovered to L5,150 after hours.
AMSTERDAM ended a quiet session with the CBS Tendency Index closing a
fraction higher at 121.2. Selling pressure from Germany caused DAF to fall
4.4 per cent, losing Fl 1.10 to Fl 23.70.
In a generally firmer food and drinks sector, brewer Heineken closed up Fl
0.90 at Fl 168.20 after a new 12-month high of Fl 169.40. DSM, the chemicals
group, closed up Fl 0.60 at Fl 103.00, although off its day's high of Fl
104.00. Dealers said DSM was still attracting foreign demand in anticipation
of an earnings recovery later in the year. Royal Dutch fell Fl 1.10 to Fl
150.40, and Unilever Fl 0.30 to Fl 180.90.
MADRID, described by one analyst as apathetic, saw the general index closing
down 1.26 at 251.36. Block trades were the only feature to liven the market,
and turnover was strong at some Pta18bn.
STOCKHOLM closed lower for the second consecutive day due to profit-taking
after strong advances and reaction to declines on Wall Street. The
Affarsvarlden General index closed down 3.89 at 966.52. Volume remained
heavy at SKr456m, down from SKr498m.
Astra restricted A shares, open only to Swedish residents, were down SKr3 to
SKr512, while the pharmaceutical group's unrestricted A dropped SKr18 to
Skr542. Analysts reported that the fall was fuelled by a government
statement setting January 1 1993 as the date for the abolition of restricted
shares.
COPENHAGEN fell with recent buyers taking to the sidelines. Novo Nordisk
fell DKr6 to DKr523 on technical selling, and uncertainty about US senate
committee hearings which could affect its American sales. The all-share
index fell 1.46 to 359.37.

THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation yesterday ended its two-day
special council session without a repeat of the bad tempered scenes that
marred its meeting last October but also without making much progress on
updating the market-stabilising International Rubber Agreement.
The most significant decision to have emerged concerns the establishment
over the next few weeks of an ad-hoc group of rubber market experts to
provide an independent view on the state of the market over the past two
years. But the group is expected merely to 'supplement' the work of the
existing buffer stock committee, made up of civil servants.
Producer and consumer groups are each to nominate three members members of
group, whose report to the Inro council is expected at its next meeting in
May. Producers are then expected to resurrect the issue of early
renegotiations to reform the rubber agreement.
By May delegates representing the largest consumer members, the European
Community and the US, are expected to have received their governments'
decisions on the time-table for renegotiation.
At this week's meeting a suggestion by one consumer for the lowering
organisation's reference price, thereby lessening its obligations to enter
the market, attracted no backing. And the producers refrained from
suggesting any upward revision of support prices. Such a move would cost the
membership between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m, the price for stockpiling
400,000 tonnes or more.

The United Arab Emirates and Indonesia announced yesterday that they were
cutting oil production by 50,000 and 25,000 barrels a day respectively with
immediate effect, reports Reuter.
The moves follow recent pledges to cut production by seven other members of
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, notably Saudi Arabia, in
an effort to boost prices. Yesterday's announcements bring the total of
these cuts to about 375,000 b/d.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chorus of disbelief greets
Mexican oil reserves claim - Industry experts agree the official figure is
twice as high as it should be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEMEX, MEXICO'S giant oil monopoly, is no stranger to criticism. But rarely
can it have been as hard to take as when the company's former vice-president
for exploration and production accused the company late last year of
'perfectly consciously' lying about it reserves, recording them at above
double actual levels.
Mr Francisco Inguanzo, who had been vice-president of Pemex's exploration
and production from 1964 to 1976, claimed in an interview with the news
magazine Proceso to have been commissioned in 1988 by the director of Pemex
to write a report on Mexico's reserves. After eight-month of study he put
Mexico's reserves at just 33.1bn barrels, subsequently reduced to 29.9bn
barrels for December 1991, compared with the official estimate of current
reserves of 65.5bn barrels.
Mr Inguanzo's findings, while denied strenuously by Pemex, are supported by
almost all other independent studies. As is shown in the accompanying table,
drawn up by Mr George Baker of the University of California, Los Angeles,
all but one study reckons Pemex's crude reserves are between 20bn and 30bn
barrels.
Pemex's figure of 65.5bn barrels includes the crude equivalent of natural
gas and condensates reserves. The figure that appears to support Pemex, by
the US Geological Survey refers to 'identified reserves'. This includes
undiscovered reserves - which are not proven.
The differences between the Pemex estimates and all the others depend in
part on the classification of the huge Chicontepec field. According to
official Pemex figures, the field holds 10.9bn barrels of crude oil and
6.7bn of oil equilavent, or 25 per cent of proven reserves. Pemex is not
producing oil from this area, never has, and has no plans to do so in the
future - and thus, according to Dr Charles Masters of the Geological Survey,
Chicontepec should not count it as a proven reserve under internationally
accepted standards.
Pemex says it is sufficient that Chicontepec could in theory be profitably
exploited. But even this is by no means certain. According to those
questioned it is extremely doubtful. Mr Inguanzo, said that if Mexico was an
honest country even the most unqualified engineer in Pemex would conclude
that the figures for Chicontepec were 'ridiculous'.
Mr Joseph Riva, a geologist at the Congressional Research Service in the US
says: 'Chicontepec may never make economic sense', because the field is not
uniform, and thus would require 20,000 small wells to extract all the oil.
Dr Masters, who after much heart-searching finally included Chicontepec as
an identifiable reserve last year, said: 'I have always had the idea that
Chicontepec never is going to be used. It is not a proven researve by any
means at all'. The field, he says, is 'very irregular' and 'will be a very
difficult thing to produce'.
The Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company, in a study commissioned by
the US Department of Energy in 1990 concluded that 'the 11 per cent recovery
factor used by Pemex (for Chicontepec) far exceeds the established practice
for that kind of geology', and assumes a recovery factor of just 5 per cent.
The difference between Pemex and independent experts does not just depend on
interpreting Chicontepec. Mr Inguanzo's estimate for Pemex's oil and
equivalent is a full 35.6bn barrels less than the company's, and only half
the difference can be explained by Chicontepec's exclusion.
Mr Inguanzo is not specific about where the other differences lie and in a
detailed analysis of the Proceso interview, Mr Baker concludes that Mr
Inguanzo may be referring to reserves that are supported by current
production, rather than future production.
Still, there is agreement among those interviewed that the number of
wildcats made by Pemex in the late 1970s is not consistent with the huge
increase in reserves at this time. Mexico's reserves figure jumped from 16bn
in December 1976 to 72.5 bn in 1982. Mr Riva, who puts Pemex's crude
reserves at 26.4bn barrels, concurs. 'I was always giving Pemex the benefit
of the doubt,' he says. 'If this engineer (Mr Inguanzo) says 21bn barrels, I
believe him'.
Furthermore, Mr Inguanzo claims that subsequent excessive drilling has lead
to a loss of water pressure in many wells, and damaged productivity. The
Petroleum Finance Corporation says independent estimates of reserves in the
off-shore Campeche zone are lower than Pemex's because of a sharp pressure
drop in wells occasioned by a lack of water injection in drilling.
None of these engineers or geologists deny that Mexico is rich in oil.
Pemex's daily production is 2.7m barrels a day, or about 1bn barrels a year.
It is thus, by the worse estimate of its reserves, operating at a production
to reserves ratio of 21 to 1, double that of the US.
Further there is a general consensus that much more oil lies undiscovered -
another 35bn to 40bn barrels, Mr Riva believes. Mr Bernie Picci, an oil
analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York says 'vast areas of Mexico have not
been touched which are thought by statistical extrapolation to have large
amounts of oil'.
But bringing these undiscovered reserves to the surface is going to require
money (and in the deep sea areas expertise) that Pemex does not have. As it
is, Pemex will probably have to spend at least Dollars 2bn a year to
maintain exports at current levels of 1.3m barrels a day. (Production is
split equally between exports and domestic use. But with domestic demand
increasing by 10 per cent a year, Mexico will become a net importer in 7
years unless production rises).
Strapped for cash, and with reserves falling, the Mexican government will
find it increasingly tempting to drop the constitutional ban on foreign
companies wild-catting for oil. Mr Inguanzo's revelations, by showing that
Mexico is not as rich in oil as many Mexicans thought, may hasten that day.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market in Australia is steady again this week, with only a very slightly
dearer tendancy affecting wools of better style. Tender and drought-affected
wools are meeting with erratic and restricted demand. The Australian Wool
Corporation's market indicator at 580 cents is slightly higher than last
week and than at the closing sales in December, before the Christmas recess.
Offerings in Australia in the next few months are well down on a year ago,
but with Soviet demand lacking and patchy erratic buying from China and
Eastern Europe the market at present only seems able to hold its own.

Zinc prices moved ahead on the LME on good buying and short covering, with
three-month metal ending just below Dollars 1,159.75 a tonne on the kerb.
Traders said the Dollars 1,160 level marked the start of an expected band of
resistance stretching up to Dollars 1,180 which could halt the uptrend
unless fresh news of consumer demand emerges to support the higher prices.
Nickel prices consolidated just below 4 1/2-month highs struck earlier on
continued investment fund buying. Dealers said the market had absorbed
Tuesday's downward reaction, as well as bouts of hedge-selling, and remained
on target to test upside objectives above Dollars 8,000 a tonne for
three-month metal. The market is waiting to see if German steelworkers go on
strike. The results of a ballot on Sunday are expected on Friday January 31.
A strike would reduce demand from nickel's key end-use sector. Gold eased on
the London bullion market. Dealers said the market was looking tired after
once again failing to make inroads into stiff resistance around Dollars 358
to Dollars 361.50 a troy ounce. It could drift back to test support at
Dollars 355. Some concern appeared to be edging into the market that the
metal might retreat to Dollars 352-Dollars 353 if a renewed rally was not
forthcoming in the short term.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker cuts estimate of 1991-92
sugar surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLS in the sugar production of the former Soviet Union and Cuba have led
ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, to cut its estimate for the world sugar
supply surplus for 1991-92 to 1.58m tonnes from a September estimate of
2.06m tonnes.
This compares with a surplus of 990,000 tonnes predicted last week by FO
Licht, the German sugar statistics agency, which stated categorically:
'There is no large surplus overhanging the market.'
Man, which now puts production at 113.05m tonnes and consumption at 111.47m
tonnes, points out that the revolutionary changes in the world political
arena have plunged the sugar market into 'the greatest period of uncertainty
over three decades'.
The immediate impact has been the forecast decline in imports to the former
Soviet Union, coupled with a fall in its trade with Cuba. 'A shift away from
agreements that by-passed the international free market is a favourable
development for the world sugar market but, coming at a time when the raw
sugar import demand of the ex-centrally planned economies of East and
Central Europe is falling, it is depressing for prices,' Man says in its
latest sugar market report.
It is assuming a 15 per cent fall in sugar consumption in the former Soviet
Union to 10.6m tonnes of whites. Raw production is put at 7.5m tonnes. The
consumption figure is conservative 'given the hoarding that has apparently
taken place over the past two years and the estimated 2m tonnes of sugar
that is used in making home-brewed alcohol'.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Portugal may resume foreign
borrowing this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL is likely to resume foreign borrowing this year, but this will be
done carefully so as not to raise the country's overall indebtedness, Mr
Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the central bank, said yesterday.
Government proposals for the 1992 budget presented earlier this week include
the possibility of raising up to Es153bn (Dollars 1.1bn) on the
international financial markets.
This includes Es63bn for debt repayments and Es90bn on new financing.
Mr Tavares Moreira said the total figure was too high and that any new
borrowing should be used to repay outstanding debt, and not to add to the
debt burden.
'Borrowing should be limited to cover the Es63bn in repayments,' he said.
Portugal has refrained from direct borrowing on the international markets
for some years and used recent capital inflows to reduce the country's
external debt which stands at about Es15bn.
Mr Tavares Moreira said that restrictions on foreign borrowing by companies
would be eased this year - companies have to deposit 40 per cent of the
value of any foreign borrowing with the central bank at no interest.
The restriction is designed to discourage companies from borrowing abroad
where they can find much more attractive interest rates, but it has been the
focus of criticisms from Portuguese businesses which say they are penalised
in the face of foreign companies investing in Portugal.
'This (compulsory) deposit could be reduced in the near future, but
gradually. A first step could be to bring the deposit down to 30 per cent,
with further reductions following later, so that by the end of the year it
could be substantially reduced,' said Mr Tavares Moreira.
Any easing of capital controls would be limited to commercial transactions
such as buying equipment abroad.
He said Portuguese interest rates could fall by about 3 percentage points
this year, though they would remain high by international standards.
Companies currently pay up to 25 per cent.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Ecu sector welcomes first 30-year
benchmark issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ecu market gave a rapturous welcome yesterday to its first 30-year
benchmark issue as the French Treasury duly launched a widely-expected
Ecu1.5bn deal. Despite a rough ride for Ecu bonds yesterday, the new French
issue was still trading at around its issue price by the close.
The pricing of the bonds guaranteed a strong take-up. In an attempt to let
the market determine the level for the long end of the yield curve, the lead
managers, Credit Lyonnais and CDC, had indicated early in the day that they
were looking for a yield of between 8.38 per cent to 8.41 per cent. However,
price indications from syndicate members suggested a tighter price could
have been achieved.
The issuers opted to keep within their original parameters, though, and the
bonds, with a coupon of 8 1/4 per cent, were eventually priced at 98.64, to
yield 8.38 per cent. In the words of one banker: 'It looked as though the
French government had given everyone a treat.'
The issue also appeared to meet the French Treasury's own funding target.
When launched at midday, the yield was almost exactly midway between the
spreads on outstanding French franc OATs maturing in 2019 and 2023.
Permission to strip the new bonds has not been given by the Treasury, in
order to encourage their take-up as a 30-year issue. However, stripping is
expected to be allowed at a later stage, probably after the issue has been
added to in the coming weeks. Stripping will not be restricted to primary
dealers in the French Treasury market.
The maturity date, April 25, 2022, has been chosen to make the bonds
fungible with the outstanding French franc 30-year OAT issue, should the EC
move to a single currency in the interim. The issue was sold almost entirely
in Europe before the New York market opened, with only a small portion going
to the Far East.
Latin America provided the other highlight yesterday as Bankers Trust
International brought US dollar issues for Bariven, which is backed by
Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, and Tubos de Acero de Mexico,
a steel manufacturer. The Dollars 200m five-year issue from Bariven was
brought at a spread of 2.58 points over five-year Treasuries. The bonds
traded slightly higher later in the day. By contrast, the Tubos de Acero
deal came at a spread of nearly 4.5 points above the three-year Treasury,
and the issue was increased from Dollars 30m to Dollars 50m due to demand.
The longer end of the sterling sector saw further supply from the water
industry, meanwhile, as South West Water issued Pounds 150m of bonds
maturing in 2012. The issue, guaranteed by South West Water Services, the
regulated utility in the group, was priced to yield 1.2 per cent over the 9
per cent UK gilt maturing 2008. In later trading it was offered at 99.875,
compared with the re-offered price of 99.554.
A shorter-dated sterling deal was launched by Samuel Montagu, which
underwrote a Pounds 100m bought deal for the European Investment Bank. The
issue, fungible with an existing Pounds 525m of bonds, created the largest
euro-sterling issue yet. Having been brought at 5 basis points over the
benchmark gilt, the spread had tightened by several basis points later in
the day.
Credit Local, the French agency, has set up an ADollars 750m registered bond
programme in the Australian domestic bond market, following changes in April
to the rules governing issuance by foreign borrowers, writes Tracy Corrigan.
The first bonds, which will have a maturity of two to 15 years, are expected
to be issued shortly. The programme was arranged by Hambros Bank.
Nomura Securities has had its long-term rating lowered from AA+ to AA by
IBCA, the European rating agency.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Bond dealers to play with
more open hand / A look at proposals to reform the world's biggest financial
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR months after they opened their joint investigation into attempts by
Salomon Brothers to rig the US government bond market, the US Treasury, the
Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have drawn
up a range of proposals for reforming the world's biggest financial market.
Until the Salomon scandal broke last August, the Dollars 2,000bn market for
US bonds and notes was lightly regulated, old fashioned and dominated by a
few big dealing firms. However, the status quo, which was often highly
profitable for the leading participants, is due for a shake-up if proposals
outlined in the joint study, published late yesterday, are adopted.
In light of Salomon's misdeeds, the study recommends that policing and
supervision of the market be tightened, and that the main regulatory role
over the primary dealers be switched from the New York Federal Reserve to
the SEC. This should please Mr Richard Breeden, the commission's ambitious
chairman, who has long been keen to extend the SEC's influence over the bond
markets.
The antiquated and closed bidding procedures of the auction system will be
replaced by a computer screen-based visible bidding process. The big dealing
firms, such as Salomon, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, will find their
valuable primary dealership franchises - which grant them exclusive rights
to trade directly with the New York Fed and bid in the auctions - opened to
other institutions.
The joint study recommends that in future the Treasury should intervene in
the bond market if squeezes develop. A squeeze occurs when a few
participants control a large portion of a new issue and use that dominance
to extract a high price for the securities from other investors, especially
those who have sold the issue short and need to cover their positions.
A squeeze occurred in May last year when Salomon gained control of more than
90 per cent of an issue of two-year notes, partly through illegal means. The
squeeze led to claims that some investors lost millions of dollars, and to
lengthy disruption of market prices.
The new policy is a reversal for the Treasury. For years it refused to
interfere with the market because of the uncertainties that would be
created. The Treasury has pledged to intervene when squeezes develop
legally, arguing that even the perception of market manipulation can
undermine the integrity of the market place and produce higher costs for the
taxpayer.
The proposed method of preventing abuses is simple. If a serious squeeze is
detected, the Treasury has a range of options. It could:
Offer an extra amount of the issue in one go to the market;
Ask the New York Fed to sell as many new securities as Ask the Fed to lend
securities to those who were victims of the squeeze.
The anti-squeeze plan will meet criticism. The long-standing argument
against intervention is that the threat of additional issues by the Treasury
creates unwelcome uncertainty in the market.
Ms Heather Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association, which
represents bond market dealers, warns that participants might bid less
aggressively at auctions because they would not want to be caught with a
large holding of bonds or notes that could lose value if the Treasury
suddenly added new supply to the market. This, she says, could lead to
higher interest costs for the taxpayer.
Defenders of the Treasury plan argue that a commitment to stamp out unruly
price movements will bring interest costs down because they would attract
more investors to the market who welcomed the protection against potentially
damaging squeezes.
Among the study's other proposals, the Treasury, the SEC and the Fed have
come up with a more open, automated alternative to the current system.
At the moment, investors submit sealed bids and the securities are awarded
first to those who bid the highest, because the Treasury is keen to sell the
securities at the lowest interest rate. The new system would involve an
ascending-price plan, a complex process which would allocate securities
based upon the lowest interest rate bidders are willing to accept.
Participants would be able to view the progress of the auction at every step
 -that is, how many investors were willing to bid at each rate - via
computer screens.
However, these changes will have to wait. First, the current automation of
the auction system has to be completed, which is not likely to be until the
end of this year. Second, the views of the market are to be canvassed before
any changes are introduced.
The primary dealers, until recently a tight-knit community of big trading
firms, face fresh competition if the study's plan for opening up the auction
system is adopted.
The authorities want to grant a wider array of financial institutions direct
access to the auction process. Until now, only the 38 primary dealers have
been able to bid competitively in auctions so they have recommended that
some of the requirements that primary dealers have to meet, such as
maintaining a minimum 1 per cent share of total customer activity in the
Treasury market, be removed, and that all government securities brokers and
dealers registered with the SEC be allowed to submit bids for customers in
auctions.
Apart from the new anti-squeeze policy, which will be introduced on the
first occasion a squeeze develops, the measures in the joint study remain
just proposals. Whether the other measures are adopted depends primarily
upon Congress, which will hold a series of hearings about the proposals over
the next few weeks.
The first opportunity to gauge how much support the joint study has comes
today when the Senate securities subcommittee hears testimony from the
regulatory authorities who drew up the proposals.
The indications are that the study has the backing of the sub-committee's
influential chairman, Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut. Earlier this week
when the study's first details were known, Senator Dodd said: 'The reforms
initiated by the Treasury and other agencies to date . . . will go a long
way toward broadening the market, restoring investor confidence and
providing for the issuance of Treasury debt at the lowest possible cost to
the US taxpayer.'

<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Banking Corporation, the US bank resulting from the merger of
Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, pushed ahead with its Dollars
1.36bn share offering yesterday, the largest international equity deal to
emerge so far this year.
The share issue was priced at Dollars 27.25 per share, representing a
discount of 2.2 per cent on Tuesday's closing price of Dollars 27.875.
The issue was for 50m shares, including 5m shares available for
international investors, and there is a 15 per cent over-allotment option.
Goldman Sachs, lead manager to the deal, said demand for the shares had been
'significant', but added it was too early to say whether the over-allotment
option would be taken up.
However, demand for the international tranche of Chemical Banking shares was
strong, particularly from Europe, with more than 5m shares placed with
international inves-tors.

SANYO Securities, the second-tier Japanese broker, announced yesterday that
one of its largest shareholders, Nitto Tochi Tatemono, will absorb Sanyo
Finance Company, a financially-troubled affiliate.
Nitto Tochi, a property management company run by the founders of the
securities house, will take over the financial company, which was hurt by
its Y25bn exposure to Yuho Chemical, a bankrupt chemicals and property
company.
After the failure of Yuho in late 1990, Japan's Ministry of Finance asked
leading brokers to report on the activities of their financial affiliates.
Later, the ministry warned the brokers to ensure that these affiliates were
prudent in their lending.
It is expected that Nitto Tochi will establish a new financial company after
absorbing Sanyo Finance, which had a change of management last year, but has
since been hampered by the weakness of Japan's stock and property markets.

INDUSTRIAL Bank of Japan (IBJ), a leading Japanese bank, and Wako
Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, agreed yesterday to merge their
asset management affiliates by the end of March this year.
The move comes at a time when Japanese investment management companies are
faced with declining profits due to the sluggish stock market and faltering
investor confidence.
Additionally, the announcement comes ahead of the deregulation of the
Japanese financial industry, where barriers between banks and securities
houses are expected to be abolished next year.
IBJ Capital Management and Wako International Capital Management will merge
to form IBJW Asset Management. The IBJ group will own a 67 per cent stake,
while Wako Securities will hold 33 per cent. The Tokyo-based company will be
capitalised at Y300m.
IBJ specialises in fund management for institutional investors, while Wako
depends largely on funds from individuals. As of September last year, IBJ
had Y823.1bn in customer assets under management, placing it sixth in the
industry, while Wako, ranking 55th, had Y128.5bn in managed assets.
The IBJ group also manages clients' assets through its overseas operations
at IBJ International based in London and IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust in New
York.
Further rationalisation in the asset management industry is expected ahead
of financial liberalisation, as most leading financial institutions in the
life assurance, banking and securities industries own asset management
affiliates.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Business Law: Computers in support of litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD SUSSKIND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to imagine a large law firm today operating without information
technology (IT). Word processing, accounting systems, electronic mail and
many more administrative and management applications are widely used.
By contrast, lawyers themselves, in their advisory capacity, are far from
dependent on technology. It requires little vision to imagine lawyering
without IT: take technology away from most lawyers and there would be no
perceptible change to their daily lives.
But lawyers - as distinct from law firms - cannot remain impervious to
technology for much longer. Litigators, in particular, are poised to undergo
their own computer revolution.
The term that is widely used here is 'litigation support', one branch of
which involves systems that help with the management and control of large
quantities of documents. The potential of this technology is particularly
clear in complex technical cases, such as construction or computer disputes,
where the party that has mastery of the documents can enjoy a clear
strategic advantage over others.
Three techniques currently dominate litigation support. One approach is to
compile a computerised index of all documents relating to a case. Each
document is represented in a database as a collection of objective features,
such as date of document, author, as well as subjective features, requiring
lawyers' classifications, such as whether a document is privileged or
prejudicial to the client's case.
Once set up, such a system can sort documents - for example, by date or by
author's name. Additionally, the system can search and produce lists of
documents sharing particular features - for instance, a list of all
privileged documents written by Company X to Mr Y between two specified
dates.
Another technique is to build an information retrieval system that holds not
an index but the full text of a collection of papers. This enables lawyers
to search quickly and easily within the entire text of documents for the
occurrence of single words (names of individuals, companies, places, or
terms such as 'warranty' or 'delay') or for words in combination (the name
of a company within a specified number of words of the name of an individual
or a phrase such as 'defective software').
A third approach to litigation support uses imaging technology. This process
can be likened to taking photographs of individual documents and can cope
well with non-textual materials such as drawings and handwriting.
Users of systems that hold images cannot search for individual words within
the imaged documents (the text is not in machine readable form). Rather,
they can view these images as if perusing microfiche on a computer screen.
A database containing only images has two main uses: first, in overcoming
problems of physical space and storage; and, second, in reducing the amount
of paperwork that needs to be handled by judges and juries.
The real benefits of litigation support will come with a combination of
these three techniques. On one particularly promising model, the lawyer's
first exposure to a set of documents will be through a litigation
workstation with a large, television-sized, monitor.
This system will contain the images of all the documents, each objectively
indexed. The lawyer will read through the images of the documents on screen,
adding subjective commentary to the index and selecting portions of text to
be converted from image into searchable form.
The result will be a sophisticated index, a database of searchable extracts,
as well as the images themselves. Such a system would be invaluable for
lawyers and clients both in preparation for trial and in the courtroom
itself.
Those who consider litigation as too confrontational, costly and time
consuming often find in litigation support the makings of a panacea, a
promising source of enhanced productivity, quality and efficiency and, in
turn, the means by which disputes might be pre-empted, settled earlier or
resolved at lower cost and greater speed.
So where's the rub? Why aren't all lawyers using litigation support
technologies?
Lawyers have a range of misgivings, most of which are rooted in their
incomplete picture of what can actually be achieved. Lawyers' preferences
for secretive exploitation of IT does not help; nor does their refusal to
work together in establishing standards and settling on compatible systems.
A further obstacle is the belief that it can rarely be cost effective for
the purposes of litigation to transfer documents from paper to machines.
Historically, this has been true, but rapid advances in optical and
intelligent character recognition technologies, together with the emergence
of service companies devoted to indexing, data entry and imaging, suggest
that it may no longer be a big problem.
Moreover, as clients increasingly use computer-based document management
systems for their own administrative purposes, it will be simpler to
transfer documents from them to litigation support systems.
Nonetheless, there is uncertainty over costs. There has been no court
decision on whether the costs of setting up and running litigation support
systems can be recovered by a successful party in litigation from the
unsuccessful party.
This matter is being pursued by the Society for Computers and Law, as it is
unacceptable for solicitors to be unsure when asked to advise their clients
on the recoverability of such costs.
A further anomaly arises from the general requirement that lawyers charge on
the basis of the hours spent on a task; a phenomenon which could, in
principle, reward the inefficient firm and penalise the well-run practice.
When litigation support systems are used, and time is saved, total time
spent becomes a less reliable indicator of the value of a service. Cynics
have suggested that lawyers will be reluctant to become too efficient with
technology until the basis of charging changes. It would be sad if lawyers'
uptake of litigation support technology was inhibited by inapposite billing
and cost-recovery practices.
Yet none of the perceived problems seems to be insurmountable, as the more
progressive litigators are showing by their successful deployment of the new
technologies.
Indeed, ignoring litigation support is fast becoming uncommercial as
barristers with positive experience come to expect solicitors to use
computers; as courts encourage and require parties to employ database
technology; and as clients realise that a higher-quality, lower-cost,
wider-ranging service is available from hi-tech solicitors, legal Luddites
will soon struggle.
For clients, these developments raise challenging questions about the
suitability of the lawyers they instruct. A further criterion in selecting
legal advisers now emerges, relating to the extent to which lawyers have
appropriate technology skills and support.
If in big cases of the future, all parties have the documents held in
litigation support systems (loaded perhaps by some external bureau), a key
point of differentiation among practices will be law firms' relative
proficiency in exploiting the data in these systems.
Are the lawyers adequately trained in advanced searching techniques? What
practical experience and record do they have with litigation support? Do
they have permanent, first-rate support staff? Are they using advanced
techniques, such as conceptual searching, intelligent 'front-ends' and
hypertext to enhance the basic systems?
Are they capable of advising proactively on versatile document management
systems? Do they understand the complex legal questions regarding issues
such as admissibility and authentication of evidence that litigation support
systems raise? These are all questions clients should be asking before long.
An immediate question for all clients is whether their lawyers are investing
sufficiently in IT in preparation for the central role it is destined to
play. The stage is set for significant change in the world of litigation. In
five years, complex, large-scale litigation in the UK will invariably be
supported by IT. By the turn of the century, litigation without IT will be
virtually unimaginable.

<TEXT>
FISCHER Gesellschaft, the family-owned Austrian sporting goods company, is
selling a 31 per cent equity stake in the company to its two Japanese
importers for Sch150m (Dollars 13.38m).
Kanematsu, the trading company, and Goldwin, the sportswear maker, are each
acquiring 15.19 per cent of Fischer, while Kanematsu's German subsidiary is
acquiring 0.62 per cent.
The acquisition continues a trend of Japanese companies buying into famous
European brand names. Fischer is the world's third largest maker of Alpine
skis and the largest supplier of cross country skis.
Kanematsu said the Fischer family, which owns the company, approached the
Japanese importers in search of an equity partner which could inject capital
to expand the business. Kanematsu has been the import agent for for 27
years, and said the equity link would lead to closer ties between the two
companies that would promote a more stable supply relationship and
strengthen sales.
Fischer has 920 employees and is expected to achieve sales of Sch780,000 in
the year to the end of February. It produces about 845,000 sets of skis a
year and 200,000 tennis rackets.
Kanematsu and Goldwin import about Y4.5bn (Dollars 36m) a year of Fischer
equipment. The total Japanese market for ski gear is about Y250bn a year, 40
per cent of which is clothing. The market is growing by about 10 per cent a
year.

BUNNINGS, the Western Australian timber group, has recommended that
shareholders reject a ADollars 163m (USDollars 122.3m) takeover bid by
Wesfarmers, an agriculture, coal and gas group, Reuter reports from Perth.
Bunnings said an independent report by Ernst and Young, the accountancy
firm, concluded the offer was not fair and reasonable.
Ernst and Young valued Bunnings' shares at between ADollars 4.30 and
ADollars 4.70 each, compared with the Wesfarmers offer of ADollars 3.55 a
share. Bunnings shares closed yesterday at ADollars 4.06, a rise of 5 cents.
Mr Dolph Zink, Bunnings' chairman, said the company expected to declare a
fully-franked dividend of at least 20 cents a share for the year to June 30
1992. Bunnings cut its annual dividend to 8 cents for 1990-91 from 20 cents
a year earlier.
Wesfarmers holds 19.9 per cent of Bunnings. BTR of the UK holds 24 per cent
of Bunnings acquired through its takeover of Hawker Siddeley.

MR Noel Gleeson, provisional liquidator of Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong
Kong (BCCHK), said the local unit of the now defunct Bank of Credit and
Commerce International hopes to reopen under another name by the end of
March, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Mr Gleeson also said a bid by Hongkong Chinese Bank, part of the Lippo
group, to take over the bank had been delayed by claims by BCCI, but none of
them had been found valid so far.
Depositors must approve any bid and they would have 25 days to consider it
before holding a vote.
Hongkong Chinese Bank, as head of a consortium, agreed in November to take
over BCCHK, which was closed in July when BCCI collapsed.
Mr Gleeson is still trying to obtain a guarantee for the bank's unrecorded
liabilities from the government of Abu Dhabi, which controlled BCCI.
Otherwise the deal could be rejected by the local High Court.

<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL cost contain-ment and productivity increases at the Randfontein
mine allowed Johannesburg Consolidated Investment's (JCI) gold mines to show
a 28.6 increase in net profits for the December quarter.
Net profits rose to R58.4m (Dollars 20.90m) from R45.4m the previous
quarter. Of this, R54.5m came from Randfontein, which recorded a 46.1 per
cent rise. A large part of Randfontein's success arose from a productivity
bonus scheme reached with workers in exchange for a low annual wage increase
last year.
The mine produced 7,821kg of gold at R26,018 per kg in the December 1991
quarter compared with 7,363kg at R27,694 per kg in the December 1990
quarter.
Mr Bill Nairn, managing director of the gold and uranium division, said that
workers had received, in terms of the productivity scheme, about 23 per cent
of the benefits from the mine's improved performance. This involved the mine
paying out about R5.2m in productivity bonuses during the quarter, which
translates to a wage rise of about 12 per cent. The interim dividend was
lifted by 25 per cent to 25 cents per share.
Less fortunate was the performance of the Western Areas mine. Serious
flooding in October resulted in gold production dropping by 5 per cent to
2,791kg.
This fed through to a 62.2 per cent decline in net profits to R2.96m. The
Joel mine, which is still undergoing development work, lifted net profits to
R890,000 from R201,000, but continued to make a loss after capital
expenditure.
Encouraging news came from the South Deep prospect, where a new mine may be
developed. Sampling in the shaft pillar area has produced considerably
better results than contained in the prospectus.

Mr Doug Whitehead, chief operating officer of Fletcher Challenge Canada,
said that both Crown Packaging and Crown Paper have been 'very successful
enterprises,' even during the current economic downturn.
'However, they have become essentially stand-alone operations. Meanwhile,
significant external economic changes have created a situation where these

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW York State insurance regulators have tentatively agreed to a deal under
which Metropolitan Life, the nation's second largest insurer, would take
over much of the business of Executive Life of New York (ELNY), writes Nikki
Tait.
ELNY was one of two operating units within the sizeable First Executive life
insurance group.
Heavy exposure to junk bonds prompted a policyholder run at Executive Life
of California, and caused California's insurance regulators to seize this
business in April. That exacerbated a similar problem at ELNY, the smaller
sister operation with 103,000 policyholders, prompting similar action by the
New York Insurance Department.
However, the two state regulators have different solutions. In California,
most of ELIC's junk bond portfolio was sold off; the cash proceeds added to
some other remaining investments and the insurance liabilities restructured.
In ELNY's case, a large portion of the liabilities and Dollars 1.46bn in the
cash and cash equivalents are being transferred to MetLife. This will leave
ELNY holding a large junk bond portfolio - with a book value of around
Dollars 1.9bn - which will fund certain remaining liabilities.
MetLife will probably pay around Dollars 60m to Dollars 70m for the single
premium deferred annuity and life insurance business it acquires, although
the figure could rise to Dollars 100m.
Policyholders can remain with ELNY and be paid the cash surrender value of
their contracts over a four-year period.
Those who choose to move will generally be offered similar MetLife
contracts.
MetLife will also administer the business which remains with ELNY - single
premium immediate annuities, such as pensions and structured settlements.
MetLife will receive an annual fee, estimated at Dollars 1/2 m, while First
Boston Asset Management will handle the investment portfolio.

GENERAL Electric, the US group with interests ranging from power systems to
financial services, reported a rise of just 2 per cent in fourth-quarter net
earnings as the US recession held back growth.
Net earnings totalled Dollars 1.26bn, or Dollars 1.46 a share, compared with
Dollars 1.24bn, or Dollars 1.42, in the final period of 1990. Consolidated
revenues rose by 2 per cent to Dollars 17.5bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said that, despite the recession, all the group's
operating segments, apart from broadcasting and materials, increased their
operating profits, demonstrating the strength and breadth of its businesses
in the face of a difficult global economy.
However, the group gave no detailed breakdown of each sector's
fourth-quarter performance.
For the full year, earnings were up 3 per cent at Dollars 4.44bn, or 5 per
cent on a per-share basis at Dollars 5.10, before the adoption of a new
accounting standard for retirees health benefits. This non-cash adjustment,
taken in the third quarter, reduced reported earnings to Dollars 2.64bn.
The group's 11.3 per cent operating margin compared with 11.6 per cent in
1990, but GE said this was more than accounted for by price declines and
lower ratings at NBC, its television network. Operating margins at the
group's other businesses grew from 11.5 per cent to 11.9 per cent.
GE's financial services operations produced a strong performance, with
earnings rising 17 per cent in the year to Dollars 1.27bn.

The company, which raised fourth-quarter net profit to Dollars 66m from
Dollars 31m, year-on-year, attributed much of the poor showing to its
decision to take Dollars 325m of restructuring charges.
Monsanto's 1991 sales were Dollars 8.9bn, down from Dollars 9bn in 1990.
Fourth-quarter sales declined from Dollars 2.2bn to Dollars 2.1bn.
The company said its agricultural division suffered a Dollars 29m operating
loss in the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonally low herbicide sales.
The chemicals unit more than doubled fourth-quarter operating income, thanks
to lower raw materials costs and other savings, but suffered a Dollars 154m
operating loss for the year, compared with a Dollars 297m profit in 1990.
The Fisher controls unit reported lower earnings for both the quarter and
the year, while the Nutrasweet artificial sweeteners business benefited from
higher sales and lower manufacturing costs in the quarter. For all of 1991,
Nutrasweet's operating income was down, however, at Dollars 173m, against
Dollars 183m in 1990.
Monsanto's expensive biotechnology research project cost Dollars 57m in
1991, up from Dollars 52m in 1990. This division has spent hundreds of
millions of dollars in recent years developing innovative products such as a
variety of synthetic hormones that induce cows to produce more milk and
seeds that produce insect-resistant cotton.
But US regulators have yet to approve the products, which may not be on the
market until the mid-1990s.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Putting Nokia back in the black
 -The company's new president has a tough job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JORMA OLLILA, the new president, chairman and chief executive of Nokia,
the European technology group and the largest of Finland's private
companies, faces a tough task.
For the first eight months of last year, Nokia made a pre-tax loss of FM205m
(Dollars 47.3m) compared with a FM425m profit last time, on sales down 31
per cent. It warned 1991 as a whole would show a substantial loss.
'My first priority in the short term will be to get the company back into
profit,' says Mr Ollila. Although he is cautious about the immediate
outlook, he hopes Nokia will be making money again by the end of this year.
Sales have fallen steeply in the important consumer electronics division,
with a big drop in colour television sales in the German market. The slump
in the Finnish construction industry hit the cables and machinery division,
while the performance of basic industry areas covering tyres, chemicals and
power was unimpressive. It is only in the mobile telephones division - under
Mr Ollila's leadership since February 1990 - that Nokia has thrived. The
division is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 30 to 40 per cent for the
rest of the decade. Nokia is the second largest maker of mobile phones,
after Motorola of the US. Mr Ollila believes Nokia will break into the
Japanese market later this year.
Nokia has already tried to divest some of its ailing activities. Last May,
it sold its loss-making data division to ICL, the UK computer group 80 per
cent-owned by Fujitsu of Japan. Nokia's important, but ailing, consumer
electronics area requires particular attention for restructuring.
Further divestments cannot be ruled out, along with additional cuts in the
group's 27,000-strong workforce, which has already been slimmed by 10 per
cent over the past two years.
Mr Ollila plans to centre on four core business areas: mobile telephones,
consumer electronics, telecommunications and cables. 'This will be our main
thrust,' he says.
Although he does not regard strategic alliances with other companies in
consumer electronics as 'a quick fix,' he does see Europe developing along
lines similar to the trends in Japan and the US.
The Nokia board hopes Mr Ollila can supply the vision, energy and business
acumen that the company enjoyed under chief executive Mr Kari Kairamo during
the 1980s. Since Mr Kairamo's suicide in 1988, Nokia has gone through a
period of consolidation.
Nokia's transformation under Mr Kairamo from a producer of basis products
such as rubber, cables and paper into one of Europe's largest consumer
electronics companies was rapid. Mr Simo Vuorilehto, Mr Kairamo's successor,
focused on internal structural changes.
Mr Vuorilehto, who retires this summer, had been Kairamo's right-hand man
and, over the past three years, has exercised a calming influence on the
company.
Although the arrival of Mr Ollila, 41, in the top spot may have brought a
change in generations, it looks as though he intends to build on the
foundation set by Kairamo and Vuorilehto, rather than turn Nokia in any new
directions.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERCONSORZI, the financially-troubled Italian farm services group, should
be able to pay creditors 73.9 per cent of what they are owed, according to
documents presented to the Rome court overseeing its affairs.
Separately, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the state-owned banking group
which owns 50 per cent of Agrifactoring, a factoring concern closely
involved with Federconsorzi and also in financial difficulties, has put
forward a plan to end its long-running differences with foreign creditor
banks.
BNL would be prepared to give priority to other bank creditors to
Agrifactoring before repayment of its own loans, provided foreign banks
restored normal commercial relations with BNL. Some foreign banks have
frozen credit lines or cut foreign exchange trading links with BNL following
its refusal to honour Agrifactoring's borrowings.
The ability of Federconsorzi to pay more than 40 per cent of its borrowings
fulfils one of the conditions required when government-appointed
commissioners turned to the courts to prevent formal bankruptcy proceedings
last year.
However, it will be up to creditors to decide at a meeting on January 29
whether they are satisfied with the repayment level, or want to trigger
bankruptcy proceedings. While most large Italian banks have expressed
willingness to back the procedure, foreign banks, which lent around L300bn
(Dollars 251.25m) to Federconsorzi, have demanded instant repayment.
The 100-page document presented to the court is limited to a detailed
valuation of Federconsorzi's assets, rather than going into the reasons for
its financial problems or identifying those responsible.
According to its findings, Federconsorzi's 13 per cent stake in Banca
Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, Italy's second-biggest private bank, is worth
L282.7bn, while its 89 per cent holding in the Credito Agrario of Ferrara is
valued at L119.9bn.

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH cabinet yesterday tabled plans to give state-owned insurance
companies greater scope to sell shares to private investors.
The proposal, foreshadowed last year, would allow the big three state
insurance groups - UAP, AGF and GAN - to sell up to 49 per cent of their
shares to the public, up from the 25 per cent fixed by special rules
applying at present.
If agreed by parliament at its spring session, this would extend to insurers
the same freedom accorded to state industrial groups late last year.
By bringing insurance group rules in line with the rest, the government
hoped to 'encourage the dynamism of the public financial sector', says the
draft law. UAP is 75.5 per cent-owned by the government and state interests,
while AGF is 72.3 per cent state-owned and the GAN is 77.6 per cent
state-held.

fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUTNAM, one of the biggest US mutual funds, has mounted a fresh campaign to
penetrate the European institutional and retail fund management industry.
The Boston-based subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan yesterday announced the
appointment of a British unit trust expert, Mr Jonathan Custance Baker, to
the new London-based post of director of European business development.
Although Putnam has maintained a London investment office for some years,
and is thought to have been an underbidder two years ago for Gartmore, the
London investment house bought by Banque Indosuez, its marketing presence in
Europe has been minimal.
However, it established a Japanese operation a year ago and, in the
meantime, its business in the US has been booming, with worldwide assets up
23 per cent to Dollars 52bn during 1991. Putnam manages investments for 1.7m
individuals and more than 200 institutional investors globally.
Mr Custance Baker, 42, ran James Capel's unit trust business until six
months ago. Previously, he was the founding president of the GT group's
mutual funds operation in San Francisco. Until recently, he was on the
executive committee of the Unit Trust Association.
'Putnam wants to make sure it is doing things in a way that will achieve
long-term success rather than instant results,' he said.

CANAL PLUS, the French pay-TV station, and the media arm of Lyonnaise des
Eaux, the water and construction company, plan to invest in MCM/Euromusique,
the French version of the MTV pop video cable channel.
The planned deal is the latest in a series to have been mooted on the French
media scene in recent days.
Earlier this week, Canal Plus announced it was joining forces with TF1 and
M6, two other French TV stations, to create a news channel - a French
counterpart to CNN, the successful US round-the-clock news service - in
place of La Cinq, the collapsed TV channel.
Meanwhile, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul and one of the main
shareholders in La Cinq, hopes later this week to announce plans to rescue
the station. Mr Berlusconi, a controversial figure whose activities in
France have been viewed sceptically by the French government, dismissed the
proposed French news channel as 'unworkable'. He claimed his proposals would
create a service with 'strong news input'.
The news of Canal Plus and Lyonnaise's investment in MCM/Euromusique comes
at a sensitive time for France's cable system, which is struggling
financially in the face of low audiences figures. Lyonnaise, one of the
heaviest investors in cable, faces losses of around FFr400m (Dollars 74.1m)
on its cable operations this year.
Lyonnaise will take 11 per cent and Canal Plus 15 per cent of
MCM/Euromusique, which forms part of the French government's attempt to
prevent France's cable networks from being dominated by foreign programming.
Existing investors include Generale des Eaux, another water company involved
with cable, and PolyGram and Sony.

FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: More bank rescue cash for former
Nobel unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S 14 commercial banks are to provide SKr2.2bn (Dollars 386m) in the
form of subordinated loans to cover losses and restore the balance sheet of
Gamlestaden, the real estate and finance company.
The banks took control of the finance company last August after its collapse
as part of Nobel Industries, the chemicals and defence group controlled by
financier Mr Eric Penser, when bad property loans exhausted its capital.
The latest rescue move, led by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, followed
Gamlestaden's startling announcement that its credit losses for 1991 were
likely to total SKr6.5bn. This is about SKr3.8bn more than originally
feared.
Last summer, the banks provided new capital of about SKr5bn to Nobel
Industries to cover the SKr5.4bn they lost through investments in
Gamlestaden. Their estimated outstanding loans to Gamlestaden are SKr14bn.
The need to provide more financial support for the rescue of the company
comes as a blow to the Swedish banks, who are already facing severe
difficulties.
The magnitude of their soaring credit losses was revealed yesterday by Mr
Gabriel Urwitz, chief executive of Gota Bank, who said they would total
around SKr25bn, or 2 per cent of all loans, for 1991.
He also warned that credit losses for the banks would remain high this year
and next. It would not be until 1995-1996 that losses would decline.
Gamlestaden blamed several factors for the dramatic deterioration in its
credit losses.
It said it had increased the quality of its risk assessment; there had been
several investment write-offs involving losses; and the impact of a weak
financial market had become more pronounced.
The SKr2.2bn loan is conditional on the banks acquiring all Gamlestaden's
remaining shares at SKr1.50. The banks already own 91 per cent of them
through Gamlestaden Interessanter.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Buying and selling for recovery - Newman
Tonks' preparations for the upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMAN TONKS is a recovery stock. The difficulty is knowing when the
recovery will take place.
In 1991 it was expected that the benefits of continuing investment,
acquisition and rationalisation would shine through in 1992. Now the
expectation of benefits is put back to 1993, or, at the most optimistic, the
last quarter of this year.
The Birmingham-based group produces, specifies and distributes architectural
products such as doors, locks and windows, to the construction industry. It
is the biggest group of its type in Europe. Where the construction industry
goes, it follows. So, at least in the UK, it is having to battle through the
doldrums. Last year, it noted yesterday, was 'one of the most difficult
years the building industry has faced since the war.'
However, when it announced a 35 per cent fall to Pounds 15.1m in annual
pre-tax profits and accompanied that with disclosure of two new acquisitions
costing Pounds 18.9m and a share placing and offer to raise Pounds 17.9m, it
pointed up some trends in Midlands manufacturing and the attitude of the
City towards industry.
Newman Tonks exemplifies the drive to diversify markets that has been marked
in Midlands engineering since the recession of the 1980s. In its financial
year to last October, 35 per cent of its turnover came from the US and
continental Europe.
Its aim to be an international group has been taken one step further by the
smaller of the two acquisitions it announced - that of Moller &amp; Auster, the
Norwegian locks cylinder maker and supplier of security systems, for Pounds
5.5m, payable in Newman Tonks shares.
This follows a string of recent continental European acquisitions like
Undall, also in Norway, Normbau in Germany and O Mustad et Fils in France.
The recession has forced manufacturing companies to concentrate on the main
lines of their business and to shed peripheral subsidiaries. Thus, in recent
months, Newman Tonks has sold a central heating company and closed down a
manufacturer and distributor of taps and showers.
Alongside this concentration, Newman Tonks has been seeking to ensure that
individual parts of its business obtain benefits from other parts. Hence, it
is engaged in the delicate task of encouraging its distribution arms, in the
Laidlaw business for example, which specify the products used in
construction projects, to specify products produced within the group.
The fall in manufacturing employment, following a sharp decline in the
Midlands during the 1980s and a slower fall during the recovery years, has
again accelerated.
Newman Tonks has been part of this trend with a continuing process of
rationalisation.
On a worldwide basis, its employment roll fell during 1990-91 by 10 per cent
to about 4,600 people. Apart from the sale and closure of peripheral
businesses, factories have been closed as the activities of different plants
have been merged in the locks, brass and doors sectors.
The other side of this is that, in addition to its acquisitions, Newman
Tonks has continued to invest. Capital spending in the last financial year
was Pounds 8m, against Pounds 11m the previous year.
Lightening the debt burden has been a preoccupation in the manufacturing
sector. Although Newman Tonks has remained acquisitive, it has managed to
maintain a strong balance sheet. Gearing at the end of last October was 27
per cent. But the effect of the share placing to finance the Moller &amp; Auster
purchase and the larger buy, for Pounds 13.4m in shares, of Shapland &amp;
Petter Holdings, the Barnstaple door manufacturer, will be to reduce gearing
to 17 per cent as net assets increase from the end-year figure of Pounds
73.3m to more than Pounds 86m.
Despite the generally poorer results from manufacturing companies, the
financial institutions have been keen to see dividend payments kept up.
Newman Tonks is keeping its 1990-91 payments at the previous level of 9.3p
despite the cost: Pounds 10.6m out of attributable profits of Pounds 11.8m.
At the same time the new shares it is placing will attract the 1990-91 final
dividend of 5.5p.
'There is a lot of talk in the press about cutting dividends, but the
institutions are saying 'pay the dividends and come back for cash if you
need it',' said Mr Cecil Buckett, the Newman Tonks finance director.
The institutions were as good as their word yesterday. The share placing,
handled by de Zoete &amp; Bevan and Albert E Sharp, was sold out by 10.30am.
The immediate future for Newman Tonks is uncertain. 'The exact timing of the
recovery in 1992 cannot be predicted with certainty, and competition within
our world markets is strong,' said Mr Douglas Rogers, the chairman.
The UK market remains depressed, but continental Europe remains steady and
the US is improving slightly. All of which suggests that 1990-91 marks the
nadir of Newman Tonks fortunes.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMAN TONKS yesterday announced that annual pre-tax profits had fallen by
more than a third. In the year to October 31 they emerged at Pounds 15.1m,
against Pounds 23.2m last time, writes Paul Cheeseright.
Earnings per share fell to 9.56p (15.35p), but the dividend is maintained. A
proposed final of 5.5p makes a total for the year of 9.3p.
The group has continued its policy of expansion. It is buying, after a
courtship of several years, Shapland &amp; Petter Holdings, the Barnstaple door
manufacturer, from the Raynsford family for Pounds 13.4m.
The payment will be in new shares and Pounds 2.33m of loan stock. The
Raynsford family will receive 4.18m shares which will be conditionally
placed and 2.89m shares which the family has agreed not to sell for a year.
Newman Tonks is also buying Moller &amp; Auster, the Norwegian locks and
security systems company, for NKr61.7m (Pounds 5.5m). Again the payment will
be in shares: this time 3.79 new shares will be issued and conditionally
placed.
In addition to these two sets of new shares, Newman Tonks is issuing a
further 5.01m shares. The placing of all the new shares will raise Pounds
17.89m after expenses. The placing price is 145p but there is a clawback
arrangement for shareholders.
They can buy one new share for every 8.5 they hold or one new share for
every 17 convertible preferences they hold.
Newman Tonks shares yesterday fell by 2p to 153p.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dissident shareholders criticise MEPC
pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATES of Mr Harry Hyams, the reclusive property developer, yesterday
challenged MEPC's decision to pay an increased final dividend at the
property company's annual meeting.
The intervention appeared to be a legacy of the acrimonious Pounds 516.4m
takeover of Mr Hyams's property company, Oldham Estate, in 1987. Mr Hyams
retained a fraction of his 28 per cent stake, apparently to express
solidarity with a handful of small shareholders who opposed the offer.
The dissidents criticised the performance of MEPC's share price and
shareholder funds. They also implied that the dividend would not be covered
if MEPC had not capitalised its interest costs.
The four shareholders associated with Mr Hyams insisted on a poll being
held, despite representing just 20.5m shares compared with MEPC's 125m proxy
votes. MEPC was proposing to increase the final dividend by 1p per share to
14.75p, making a total of 20p (19p) for the year.
The meeting, which took one hour and 40 minutes, was held at Centre Point,
the London office tower built by Mr Hyams which attracted controversy
because it stood empty for many years.
Mr Jim Beveridge, MEPC's finance director, said that Mr Hyams was noted for
his dislike of paying dividends. He said the inference that MEPC's dividend
was not adequately covered was 'completely wrong'.
He said that the shareholders had previously asked MEPC questions at an
annual meeting of Oldham Estate. 'There is a residual body of Oldham
shareholders who are angry that MEPC took Oldham over and ask embarrassing
questions at meetings,' said Mr Beveridge.
One of Mr Hyams's associates criticised MEPC for spending Pounds 6.5m on the
refurbishment of Centre Point. Sir Christopher Benson, MEPC's chairman said
it was too detailed a question to be answered during the meeting.
MEPC issued a statement to the Stock Exchange, which said that its
resolution to pay a final dividend had been passed following a poll and that
the dividend cheques were being posted. Its share price fell from 398p to
381p.
The dissidents' sharp questioning of MEPC's management was in marked
contrast to the adulatory Oldham meetings Mr Hyams held.
Although usually held at inconvenient times such as New Year's Eve, the
Oldham meetings were never dull. On one occasion in the early 1970s, the
secretive and reclusive Mr Hyams donned a Mickey Mouse mask to taunt
journalists and photographers excluded from the meeting.

SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry company, is free
to bid again for the Isle of Man Steam Packet, as the standstill agreement
concluded three months ago came to an end yesterday.
However, any bid would have to be almost double the 115p offered in its
first attempt to take the group in 1990. Steam Packet shares closed last
night at 200p, valuing the company at about Pounds 30m.
Mr Michael Stracey, Sea Containers' vice-president, said yesterday that all
options remained open. He refused to comment on whether Sea Containers
planned to bid for Steam Packet or increase its 41 per cent stake in the
Manx ferry operator.
According to Stock Exchange rules, Sea Containers can increase its holding
by 2 per cent a year, without launching a full bid.
Mr Stracey said little progress had been made in the talks, which were aimed
at strengthening the trading links between the two companies.
The main areas in the negotiations concerned: introducing Sea Containers'
high speed craft, the Sea Cat, on the Manx routes; reworking or extending
the agreement on Steam Packet's use of the Heysham port; using Steam
Packet's Lady of Mann vessel on Sea Container's Irish Sea route; and a joint
marketing agreement for ferry services. Mr Stracey said some progress had
been made in this last area.
Mr David Clague, of Baring Brothers, Steam Packet's financial advisers, said
the group was anxious that Sea Containers should clarify its position
regarding a possible bid. 'It is all a bit distracting,' he said.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ACT to announce plans for networking
services offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT, the Birmingham-based group whose fortunes recovered and flourished
after the sale two years ago of its personal computer business to Mitsubishi
of Japan, will today announce the formation of a new company to exploit a
fast growing sector of the computing services mar- ket.
To be called ACT Network Si, it will concentrate on the implementation and
management of complex data networks for large corporate clients and local
authorities.
Logsys, another member of the group, is already active in central government
networking where it has annual sales of more than Pounds 30m.
Network Si will concentrate on systems integration, putting together
networks from components supplied by a range of suppliers, and it expects to
profit from the new trend to 'outsourcing', where companies use outside
services suppliers to run their data processing and networking functions.
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said he expected Network Si to conclude deals
worth Pounds 10m in the first year of operations.
He believed the potential market for networking services was substantial.
Figures from the Yankee Group Europe, a marketing consultancy, suggest that
spending on network management is growing at 24 per cent a year compared
with only 5 per cent a year for information technology budgets as a whole.
Managing director of the new company will be Mr Chris Winn, a main board
director and managing director of ACT Computer Support. Mr Paul
Lindsey-Jones will be sales and marketing director.
The company will initially be 45 in number but will be able to call on the
expertise of the rest of the 1,800 strong group.
Data network management, essential to the effective collection and
distribution of information within an organisation, has emerged as one of
the most serious technological problems large companies face in the 1990s.
The tech- nology is complex and expensive and networking expertise is
scarce.
ACT is now one of the largest UK-owned software and services companies by
market capitalisation. It has gone through several transformations in its
26-year life, catching each succeeding wave of change in the turbulent
computer industry. It has extensive experience of networking following its
early move into personal computer local area networks.
The company's profitability improved markedly after it disposed of its
hardware business; at the halfway stage last year sales were ahead 28 per
cent at Pounds 52.6m while pre-tax profits were 22 per cent up at Pounds
6.61m.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: AIB US offshoot almost doubles to Dollars
110m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at First Maryland Bancorp, the US subsidiary of Allied Irish
Bank Group, surged to Dollars 110.1m (Pounds 61.5m) in 1991, up from Dollars
57.9m in the previous 12 months.
The result was helped by a strong performance in the last quarter when
profits rose to Dollars 23.9m (Dollars 1.5m). Total assets were up 9.4 per
cent to Dollars 8.95bn (Dollars 8.18bn), while total loans rose 13 per cent
from Dollars 4.81bn to Dollars 5.43bn. Deposits were up 17 per cent to
Dollars 6.99bn (Dollars 5.99bn).
The results did not include figures for The York Bank of Pennsylvania, which
has assets of Dollars 1.4bn, bought by AIB at the end of December.
The performance rested on a strong increase in fee income, better funding
costs, and investment securities gains, combined with much lower provisions
against bad loans and tighter control of non-interest costs.
'Since we first acquired a stake in 1983, FMB's track record has been one of
consistent profits through every quarter of every financial year, a truly
remarkable performance for any bank in the United States,' said Mr Gerald
Scanlan, AIB deputy chairman and group chief executive.
At the end of 1991, the total capital ratio of the bank was 11 per cent.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel revises timetable for
Redland bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMETABLE for Redland's hostile Pounds 630m bid for Steetley, a rival
building materials group, has been put back to give the Office of Fair
Trading further time to consider possible monopoly implications.
Under Takeover Panel rules, Steetley should publish its final defence
document by next Monday - 39 days after the bid was announced.
The Panel has now ruled that the bid clock be halted. As a result 'day 39'
will be deemed to be the second day after an announcement clarifying whether
or not the offer will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Day 46 - the last opportunity for posting a revised offer - and day 60 - the
date an offer must become unconditional - will similarly be extended.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fisons restores presentation to City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday began the process of rebuilding
bridges with City institutions when it gave its first research and
development presentation in four years.
In a speech to analysts, Mr Patrick Egan, executive chairman, denied that
the company was leaderless following the surprise resignation of Mr John
Kerridge as chairman and chief executive.
Mr Egan said he would remain involved in every aspect of the business until
a new chief executive was appointed. Thereafter, he would concentrate his
energies on the company's strategic direction and improving relations with
shareholders and the City.
An inspection by US Food and Drug Administration officials of the company's
manufacturing facilities for Opticrom and Imferon was expected shortly.
Analysts said the sites should be ready for inspection by mid-March.
However, Mr Egan refused to give a date when the two products would be
re-introduced to the US market. They were withdrawn last year from the US
following violations of FDA regulations. Fisons was forced to make a Pounds
65m provision following the ban.
Mr Peter Fothergill, research and development director, gave a presentation
on the prospects for Tipredane, a steroid asthma treatment, and Remacemide,
a potential treatment for epilepsy and stroke.
Analysts said they were impressed by the commitment of Mr Egan, but pointed
out that the two new drugs were unlikely to be on the market for at least
six years.
'This presentation was really two years too early,' said Mr Jonathan de
Pass, a pharmaceuticals analyst at BZW. 'Given the products may not be
available for some years, there seems to be a lot of wishful thinking.
Developing drugs is a risky business.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thos Robinson agrees Pounds 41m offer from
BM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS ROBINSON, the debt-laden engineering group, yesterday recommended an
all-paper offer worth Pounds 41m from BM Group, the construction equipment
distributor and manufacturer.
BM is also raising Pounds 60m in a 4-for-21 rights issue. Most of the
proceeds will be used to reduce Robinson's indebtedness, with about Pounds
15m earmarked for the acquisition of a Canadian distribution business, which
is still under negotiation.
The offer of 10 new BM shares for every 148 Robinson shares values the
latter at 25.8p, compared with the 12 1/2 p at which they were suspended
last Friday. Robinson's shares rose to 24p when trading resumed yesterday.
BM's shares also returned from suspension at 400p to close 18p lower at
382p.
BM owns 2.99 per cent of Robinson's shares and already has acceptances
representing a further 35.4 per cent of the capital.
Robinson grew rapidly by acquisition at the end of the 1980s under the
chairmanship of Mr Graham Rudd, whose brother Nigel heads Williams Holdings,
the industrial conglomerate. Mr Rudd left Robinson in July, when the company
warned that it was heading for heavy losses.
Despite Robinson's difficulties, Mr Roger Shute, chairman of BM, said the
acquisition would not dilute earnings and would enhance growth prospects.
Mr Rudd was replaced by Mr Roy Barber, the company doctor, who started
selling businesses to reduce Robinson's debt. Net debt stood at Pounds 40m
at the end of 1991, while Mr Shute said net assets had shrunk to Pounds 23m.
Mr Barber said: 'Borrowings continue to be at a high level and the outlook
for 1992 remains poor. It is unlikely shareholders will receive a dividend
before 1994.'
strongly attracted by Robinson's Wadkin business, which makes woodwork
machinery, and also its strong brands in fasteners, such as Nettlefolds and
Unifix.
The acquisition will decrease BM's reliance on distributing construction
equipment, which accounted for 70 per cent of sales last year after its
Pounds 55m acquisition of Blackwood Hodge, the ailing distributor of
earth-moving equipment, in November 1990.
Mr Shute paid tribute to Mr Barber's achievement since taking over at
Robinson, saying: 'He has done a good job in stopping the rot.' This deal
means Mr Barber will have more time to devote to Astra Holdings, the
troubled munitions and fireworks company of which he is non-executive
chairman.
Mr Shute felt that, before Mr Barber's arrival, Robinson had failed to
actively manage its rapidly acquired subsidiaries. When attempts were made
to rationalise overcapacity, they came too late and were made in a 'panicky'
fashion.
BM has been reducing its debts since that acquisition. The fund-raising
means that the enlarged group would have net assets of Pounds 200m and
gearing below 45 per cent.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Hambros Bank, BM's financial
advisers, with Kleinwort Benson Securities and Albert E Sharp as brokers to
the issue. Robinson's financial advisers are Schroders.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Inchcape pays Pounds 32m to expand
activites in the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the international services and marketing group, has expanded its
operations in the Middle East by paying Pounds 32.1m for Spinneys, a group
of marketing and retail companies.
Spinneys distributes consumer goods, foodstuffs and household products in
eight Middle East states, and owns 12 supermarkets. The group made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 5.8m last year and had net assets of Pounds 8.9m at the
year-end.
Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said the deal underlined the
group's long-term commitment to the Middle East. He believed that the
outlook for stability in the region was more positive than it had been for
many years.
Inchcape is buying Spinneys from Bricom Group, formerly part of the
collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings but now owned by a group of
investors led by Gamlestaden, a Swedish company.
This acquisition maintains the pace of activity at Inchcape since Mr Mackay
took over from Sir George Turnbull in November. Shortly afterwards, Inchcape
announced a Pounds 376m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Tozer
Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the motor distribution and retailing subsidiary of
Brierley Investments, the New Zealand trading group.
Inchcape said that following its investment in an important Bahrain
marketing operation last year, the cash acquisition of Spinneys
significantly advanced the group's strategy of becoming the leading
marketing company in each of its chosen territories.
Both Spinneys and Gray Mackenzie, Inchcape's existing Gulf operation, have
long histories in the region. To maintain their separate identities and
management, Inchcape is establishing Inchcape Middle East, which will
incorporate all of its marketing operations.
The chairman of Inchcape Middle East will be Mr David John, a director of
Inchcape, and the chief executive will be Mr Alan Davies, currently chief
executive of the group's operations in the region. Mr Michael Hemery,
managing director of Spinneys, will become Spinneys' chief executive and
will join the board of Inchcape Middle East.

FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: DTI launches investigation into
underwriting company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday launched an investigation
into CR Driver &amp; Company, a small insurance underwriting firm closely linked
with London United Investments, the insurance group which collapsed in May
1990.
The DTI said yesterday that the investigation would be carried out under
Section 432 of the 1985 Companies Act. This is the section of the act which
makes it an offence to misinform shareholders.
The inspectors for CR Driver will be Mr William Marcus QC and Mr Angus
Gilroy. They were appointed inspectors to LUI in October 1990 and the DTI
said yesterday that the new investigation arose from information uncovered
during the work on LUI.
Under the terms of their mandate, the inspectors will have very wide powers
and be able to require the produc-tion of documents and the attendance of
witnesses whom they can examine under oath.
In an affidavit sworn in May last year, the inspectors said that their
investigations showed that between 1976 and 1989, HS Weavers (Underwriting),
a wholly owned subsidiary of LUI, had made deductions totalling Dollars 46m
(Pounds 25.6m) from reinsurance premiums and paid them to companies in
Germany and Switzerland, known as the Smith companies, for reasons that were
still unclear.
CR Driver was not part of the LUI group but it shared a number of common
personnel and Mr Ronnie Driver was a former LUI director and chairman.
The two companies also had the same registered office. CR Driver went into
liquidation on December 3 last year when Mr Raymond Turner of Neville
Russell was appointed liquidator.
The collapse of LUI resulted in the largest ever levy on the 500 general
insurers in the UK: each was asked to pay 0.5 per cent of its net income for
1990 to pay for it.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORLAND International, the US personal computer software company, reported a
decline in sales and flat earnings for its third quarter, following the
completion of its acquisition of Ashton-Tate, another US software company.
Results for the third quarter were reported on a 'pooling-of-interests'
basis, in which the results of the merged company are compared to the
accumulative results of both companies last year.
Revenues were Dollars 114.6m (Pounds 64m), a 6.6 per cent decrease compared
with Dollars 122.7m for the same period a year ago, the quarter ending in
December for Borland but ending in September for Ashton-Tate. Borland noted
that in its 1990 third quarter Ashton-Tate's sales were buoyed by the
introduction of a new product.
Net income was Dollars 7.5m, or 28 cents per share, compared with Dollars
6.8m last time. Borland took a Dollars 6m charge against third quarter
earnings in connection with the merger, bringing total pre-tax transaction
and restructuring charges over the past nine months to Dollars 116m. The
company also benefited from a Dollars 7m tax credit, also related to the
Ashton-Tate acquisition.
Revenues for the nine month period were Dollars 365.7m, up some 14 per cent
from Dollars 321.4m. The company reported a net loss of Dollars 83.5m, or
Dollars 3.42 per share, including restructuring and transaction charges,
compared with a net income of Dollars 2m or 8 cents per share, for the same
period a year ago.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: Solutions to the career problems of women with
children (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms VICTORIA FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a mother in charge of two small children and my own London public
relations company, Diane Summers' article on obstacles to women's career
opportunities ('The little things that mean a lot', January 13) touched a
chord.
My own employment experience bears testament to the unimaginative rigidity
of many employers and the frustrations faced by many professional women with
a mind to combining career and motherhood.
With an Oxford university degree and 12 years' experience in PR behind me, I
tried to persuade my corporate employer to let me return to work on a
flexible basis after the birth of my first chIld. I offered to take a 50 per
cent pay cut to carry on doing the same amount of work, if they would let me
return on a three day a week basis. I even guaranteed to put in extra time
at short notice whenever required. My employer remained locked in an
established policy of only accepting post-natal women back to work on a full
time basis.
With regret, I left the company. Before long I had set up my own business,
with control over my working arrangements, and was reaping the rewards of a
considerably higher income.
I determined never to lose a valuable employee through inflexibility. I have
a good team of female PR executives, and will soon welcome back my deputy
director to a two, then three day week following the birth of her first
child.

Sir, Your articles on the state of child care coupled with your report ('Few

representation at board level in British companies suggested one obvious
solution to me.
There is one job which in terms of hours and remuneration would be eminently
suitable for most women with children - that of non-executive director.
Perhaps if more women were offered this opportunity we would also see a
change in the corporate culture in a country which makes the arrival of
children such a problem for working women.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: What the outsiders at Lloyd's would do well to
recall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM BENYON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Most correspondence on Lloyd's indicates that the greatest casualty is
that market insiders have managed to lose the trust of their employers - the
outsider Names.
Sadly, many critics are deciding that they have had enough and leaving.
Without critical Names the engine for reform at Lloyd's will stop. All the
essential changes that have taken place in past years, and those suggested
by the Rowland task force, have been wrested from the society by campaigning
outside members. Not only have none been volunteered by the society itself
but usually suggestions of change in the status quo have met strong
resistance.
It is essential that all the recommendations made by Mr David Rowland are
implemented without delay and I hope that ministerial pressure will be
applied to ensure that this is done. Judging from the speed that key
recommendations about restructuring the market governance were rejected by
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, such pressure will be needed.
But the report did not deal with problems of the past. They still remain
unresolved and it is clear that no attempt is to be made to deal with them.
Contrary to the tale sold by the Lloyd's PR machine, complaints from ruined
Names are not just moaning and whingeing about losses fairly suffered in a
well ordered market place. Outside members, trusting the reputation of
Lloyd's for fair dealing, were not told that there were insider syndicates
and as a result many never made significant profits even in the much vaunted
good years. Many of those outside members were misled by their employees -
their trusted agents. Whether these matters are resolved or not, in future,
outside members will do well to recall Emerson's comment: 'The more he
talked of his honour the faster we counted the spoons.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: The taxation factor that may be inherent in a
national lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From I R T ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I offer some points which should be considered in assessing the
role of a UK national lottery:
In North America, where state Lotteries were reintroduced in 1964, they are
often regarded in official circles as a form of 'voluntary' taxation;
There is also a view that lotteries are a regressive form of taxation (due
to the socio-economic backgrounds of the majority of ticket purchasers);
Unless reasonable value is offered, the lottery would not be successful  -
this may well mean that prizes should be 50 per cent of gross revenues.
In the current economic climate, however, perhaps a 'voluntary' tax is
preferable to other types.
Following the new Australian director of government statistics, perhaps an
American (or Canadian) lottery director would be appropriate.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Lombard: On God and democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How should a liberal democrat react to the possible election of a government
indifferent to individual human rights? Some of those who condemn the
Algerian army's decision to prevent the election to power of the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front seem unaware that this is even a
problem. But it is. The tyranny of the majority is still tyranny.
Suppose, for example, that a party dedicated to the physical extermination
of a minority were on the verge of being voted into power. Would one condemn
a force that prevented its election? The answer must be no. Nor is this an
academic question. Although Hitler's National Socialists did not obtain an
outright majority, they did obtain power through the ballot box; they did
subvert the democratic process; they did exterminate several minorities;
and, not coincidentally, they did start a war in which more than 50m people
died.
Groups which intend either to subvert democratic politics or to suppress
individual rights wholesale do not appear to be proper participants in such
politics. This is the common sense view, but it is one that can be given a
deeper justification: rights of individuals are prior to those of the state
even if the latter is in the hands of a democratically elected government.
Among the reasons for defending individuals against democratically elected
governments are the inherent defects of democratic politics. No elected
government can claim the informed consent of the electorate. Self-evidently,
it does not possess the consent of those who voted against it. But it does
not even possess the informed consent of those who voted for it. Many of the
details of its programmes are, in practice, neither widely known nor
generally understood, while many of the contingencies with which it has to
deal are, in principle, unknowable.
These points about democratic politics are at least as applicable to
governments elected under proportional representation as to those elected
under first-past-the-post electoral systems. Indeed, the programme of the
government is even more unknowable under PR, given the horse-trading
inherent in coalition politics.
Yet there is a more fundamental reason for claiming the priority of the
individual over even the democratic state. The case for democracy derives
from that for the individual's right to choose how to vote. If a government
is legitimate only if it reflects such choices, it must be because a prior
right of individuals to choose endows it with legitimacy. But that principle
cannot be restricted to politics. It derives from the inherent capacity of
adult human beings to make choices. This right must apply with greater force
where what is to be chosen is closer to the individual concerns of the
chooser than are politics.
If the case for democracy derives from that for individual freedom, the
proper domains of government are where individuals cannot choose for
themselves or where their choices will damage other individuals. A
democratically elected government dedicated to the suppression of almost all
individual freedom is a constitutional contradiction in terms.
What then should be the proper response of a liberal democrat to Islamic
fundamentalism? The question to answer, an empirical one, is whether the
election of such a government would impair fundamental individual rights,
including, not least, that to cast a vote ever again. If, as seems likely,
the impairment would be severe, then suppression of the election is not
wrong, even though a still better solution than suppression would be a
constitution that entrenches fundamental rights against the government.
Naturally, fundamentalists would see it differently. But this is because
their claim to power is a mandate from God. Since democracy's is that of a
mandate from the people, the two views are incompatible. It is doubtful
whether any country in which a majority inclines towards a theocratic view
of the state can be democratic. But this is not a problem that can be
solved. It is a tragedy that has to be endured.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: Pension funds need an effective whistle-blower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof JEFFREY RIDLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am surprised that no mention is made in the article, 'Simple duties
of trustees' (January 11), of the responsibility of pension fund trustees to
appoint auditors to audit the financial accounts and review internal control
in their pension funds. The external audit of pension funds is an important
part of the control of pension fund activities.
I believe that the current review of corporate governance and focus on the
need for audit committees in listed companies should be widened to cover
control in pension funds. There should be a link between the findings of the
review and the control requirements for pension funds, some of which are
registered companies.
In a research study conducted by the Institute of Internal Auditors in 1988,
it was evident that very few had established an audit committee or an
internal audit activity. I doubt whether this situation has changed very
much since that time.
Internal audit can be an effective control and whistle-blower in a pension
fund and if given a reporting line to an audit committee at trustee level, a
provider of independent advice and information.
Let us all hope that out of today's debate and reviews there will be a
stronger structure of audit in pension funds, both internal and external.

Sir, As a shareholder in Northern Developments, which went into receivership
18 years ago in the dark days of 1974, I have just received a second
distribution of 6p a share, seven years after payment of a first
distribution of  1/2 p a share. A further distribution is said to be likely
but the administrators are unable to indicate whether it will be in this

Is this a record or just par for the course?

FT  23 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Stuck at the airport again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TENS of thousands of airline passengers who will this summer spend hours
munching peanuts on aircraft stranded on the tarmac should reflect upon what
their disrupted journeys reveal about the state of European political and
economic integration. In all likelihood their delays will be caused by the
woeful deficiencies of Europe's patchwork air traffic control system. For
years, politicians ignored warnings that a crisis was developing. Now it has
arrived.
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, managing director of Alitalia and chairman of the
Association of European Airlines, says that as air traffic picks up from the
downturn induced by the Gulf war, the system may well buckle. Demand for air
transport in Europe could easily double by the end of the decade.
Without significant improvements to European air traffic control systems,
this growth will be funnelled into an extremely tight bottleneck. Flight
delays have increased by 50 per cent in the past four years, so that at peak
periods a quarter of flights are delayed by at least 20 minutes. The costs
of these delays could amount to almost Dollars 10bn a year, according to a
study which SRI, the Californian consultancy did in 1990 for the
International Air Transport Association. The direct costs to airlines of
having expensive capital lying idle are eventually passed onto passengers in
higher fares.
System's shortcomings
Behind these failures stand western Europe's 51 air traffic control centres,
with their 31 different operating systems, running 22 types of software on
computer hardware made by 18 different manufacturers. The European route
structure, which is cut across by military demands for airspace, was drawn
up 30 years ago, based on national boundaries which are becoming obsolete.
Crossing Europe using these traditional routes is like travelling across
London or Paris using only backstreets.
European air transport ministers have begun to tackle the system's
shortcomings. From next year a body called Eurocontrol, operating from
Brussels, will co-ordinate all civil air travel across Europe, to ease the
flow of traffic and increase utilisation of the existing system. It aims to
harmonise and integrate the computer systems used by national authorities by
1995, as well as overseeing investments in additional capacity in southern
Europe, which becomes heavily congested in the summer.
Drastic reduction
The question is whether this combination of a federal co-ordinating body,
with national authorities, will provide the integrated system which post
Maastricht Europe needs. Eurocontrol has no power over national public
procurement practices, which are a root cause of system incompatibility. Nor
is it clear that Eurocontrol can achieve the necessary drastic reduction in
the number of control centres. Most significantly, summer congestion will
only be reduced if tourists from the rich northern states help to pay,
through taxes, for the poorer southern states to buy better radar systems.
Flights leave northern airports at a rate which southern airports cannot
handle. The most sophisticated radar systems in Europe can handle aircraft
travelling just three miles apart. But in the worst areas of the
Mediterranean the gap has to be more than 30 miles. Europe is operating at
just half the capacity of the most heavily used north eastern corridor in
the US.
American superiority is partly due to better technology, partly to the
simplicity of a unified system run by the Federal Aviation Authority. When a
plane wants to fly from New York to Los Angeles, it can proceed once its
flight plan is cleared. That is what should happen in Europe. Instead just
getting from London to Milan is like flying through an electronic maze.
Europe needs a unified system, building up from a core based upon the
northern bloc, where operating systems are most compatible. That means
politicians will have to discard procurement nationalism and airspace
sovereignty in favour of the unified system European consumers deserve.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Reforming the Finanzplatz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S ECONOMY may be a powerful industrial engine, but its domestic
financial markets have always had an incongruously low-octane rating. The
twin proposals last week to reform German bourse regulations and to
introduce fully computerised share trading are much more than merely an
attempt to put a tiger in the tank of the country's sometimes
provincially-run stock exchanges. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasised in
Frankfurt this week, Germany is now committed to securing a place on
international financial markets on a par with its status as the world's
third largest economy.
More liquid, open and efficient financial markets will be of considerable
benefit in the task of rebuilding east Germany, buttressing the
time-honoured method of funding corporate investment via the banks.
Additionally, after a run of insider trading affairs, Germany needs to
improve the image of its financial sector in its political drive to bring
the planned European central bank to Frankfurt  - a goal to which Mr Kohl
ascribes highest importance.
One significant factor behind the reform plan is the fear of further
migration of share trades to London, which accounted for a sizeable chunk of
dealing in German blue chips last year. Both for this reason, and to stoke
domestic interest in Germany's equity markets, the big German banks have
given full-hearted support to the Finance Ministry's package.
Advancing integration
The aim of promoting harmonised conditions for business and investment
across Europe would be ill-served if London, Paris and Frankfurt were simply
to indulge in beggar-my-neighbour competition to boost their own market
volumes. However, the changes planned in Germany seem on the whole a
positive contribution to advancing economic integration. The absence of a
centralised securities regulatory body in Germany, and the lack of legal
redress against insider trading, have always looked like drawbacks; with the
advent of the single European market, when cross-border supervisory
co-operation will be even more necessary than it is now, such shortcomings
would appear downright antediluvian.
Central agency
Before the reform package can become law, Bonn must persuade the German
Lander to transfer their present responsibility for securities supervision
to a centralised agency. Some Lander show an almost medieval desire to cling
to regional powers, as is shown by their resistance to slimming down the
number of Land central banks which make up the Bundesbank. The ambitious
Frankfurt stock exchange plan to introduce computerised trading by the
mid-1990s may well be of benefit here in reducing obduracy. Frankfurt
already handles more than 50 per cent of business conducted by Germany's
eight stock exchanges. Setting up an efficient electronic system, capable of
being operated from computer terminals all round Germany, could do far more
to stimulate regional stock market interest than maintaining
locally-supervised trading floors around the city squares of Land capitals.
As a country which has long upheld freedom of capital movements, Germany
should ensure that the structure of the proposed computerised system is as
harmonised as possible with those elsewhere in Europe.
Technology, however, is not enough; there is also a need for further
improvement in overall trading rules. In time, both German and foreign
investors must hope that some of the less open parts of the German system of
corporate governance will be brought more into line with standards
elsewhere.
Two particular problems are the lack of clear-cut division between banks'
own-account investment activities and their dealing for clients, and
insufficient rights for smaller shareholders in company takeovers. If the
writ of Germany's mooted new securities agency were to extend into probing
more fundamental issues like these, it would be a welcome surprise; and
Corporate Germany AG might end up benefiting.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: Queen of Spades - Liceu, Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To Madrid for an important event: the first-ever staging of an English
opera, The Duenna, by a Spanish-born, English-exiled composer, Roberto
Gerhard, more than four decades after it was written. (More of that to
follow.) But first to Barcelona for a marvellous bonus - a much-loved work,
Queen of Spades, at a opera house new to me, the Gran Teatro del Liceu.
A single visit to the Liceu, a splendid theatre deceptively modest in
external aspect, grandly handsome (more seats than La Scala) yet still
intimate and acoustically lively in its interior proportions, is sufficient
to add it to one's list of favourite theatres. It seemed an ideal location
for a 'big-house' work from which most of the big houses still, regrettably,
shrink.
No less important, it was given with authority by a first-rate team - Mark
Ermler the masterly conductor; Jan Blinkhof, Leonie Rysanek and Sergey
Leiferkus among the principals of a carefully chosen cast; and the Brussels
team of Gilbert Deflo (producer) and William Orlandi (designs) in charge of
the staging. Its most rewarding aspect was the evident attempt on all sides
to 'add up' place, performers and work - to come to grips with the spectacle
as well as the late-Romantic agony of Tchaikovsky's difficult, magnificent
masterpiece.
In recent years, radical opera-producers have taken the violent passions and
spectral visions at its core as grounds for no-holds-barred Queen of Spades
psychodramas full of hallucinatory writhings. The material and, of course,
the music can be made to answer such ambitions; but the glittering outward
trappings of the work, its Sleeping Beauty sumptuousness of texture, loving
formal discursiveness and richly rococo decorative details, have tended to
get shortchanged in such treatments.
The whole of Queen of Spades is a much more peculiar, alarming and
enthralling achievement than allowed by the psychodrama-modernists. This was
the understanding of Deflo's production, which intelligently filtered 1800s
visual elegance - the Act 2 divertissement was both skilfully
'old-fashioned' and gently humorous - through late-20th-century
sensibilities. Black front screens were used to partition the large
proscenium arch, sometimes dividing the set, sometimes briefly closing out
the background to focus on the characters.
This was a 'filmic' device, employed with tact and purpose most of the time.
The Neva scene hung fire, and the time required for main set-changes was
always too long (the antiquated backstage facilities of the theatre will
next year undergo a massive programme of improvement). In general, though,
it was a modern production which in the best way threw the weight of
dramatic expressiveness on the cast - and almost all of them bore it
admirably.
The veteran Rysanek, still vocally commanding, hinting at a sensual spark
still alive beneath white wig and fearsome wrinkles, made a superlative
Countess: she was, as she should be, the heart-beat of the drama. The Czech
soprano Natalia Romanova, not quite big-voiced enough, proved nonetheless a
truthful, fresh, touching Lisa. As Polina there was Claire Powell, spirited
and rich-sounding.
Indeed, all the wonderful smaller numbers and airs came off particularly
well. Leiferkus's 'three cards' narration is, as Londoners remember from the
1987 Kirov visit, one of the most completely compelling operatic feats of
our day - it is good to know that both his Tomsky and the Yeletsky of Dmitry
Kharitonov (too mild in person but wonderfully beautiful in tone and style)
will be in the Glyndebourne Queen of Spades this summer.
The only question-mark over the performance concerned the bull-like delivery
of Blinkhof's Hermann, sombrely exciting at moments, too often merely raw,
morose and approximately tuned. I long to hear and see a Hermann who
combines dramatic-tenor vigour and musicianly suppleness, Byronic elan and
fine control. Even without that, this Barcelona Queen of Spades afforded a
notable Tchaikovsky experience.

The Queen has too few black people and women on her staff, according to This
Week (8.30 ITV). It claims that there are 891 royal employees, only nine of
whom come from 'ethnic minorities', which is presumably code for being dark
skinned. It seems unlikely that the race industry would be satisfied with a
royal household full of white Australians or New Zealanders. One critic asks
'How many people from working class backgrounds are in the royal court? It's
not just the ethnic minorities and the feminist lobby that has a case, it is
95 per cent of the country'. How long before there is a move for positive
discrimination in favour of innumerates on the staff of the Bank Of England?
Do you know how to hit the ground running as you jump off the rear platform
of a moving bus, without falling flat on your nose? You do? Odds on you're a
Londoner. Of course you cannot do it with the accursed modern double-decker
which has doors and no rear platform: you need a Routemaster. Designed in
the 40s and built in the 50s with a theoretical life of 17 years, these
splendid old liners of the London streets are now due to drive on past the
year 2000 as Perpetual Motion explains (8.30 BBC2).

FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: Holloway's 'Spacious Firmament' - Symphony Hall,
Birmingham &amp; Radio 3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony have served Robin
Holloway's music faithfully over the last decade. It was they who gave the
first performance in 1982 of the Clarissa Symphony, drawn from the opera,
long before any opera company had shown interest in taking it on, and
followed that with the first performance of a Feeney Trust orchestral
commission three years later. On Tuesday they presented the premiere of
another Feeney Trust piece, this time involving the CBSO Chorus as well -
The Spacious Firmament, originally intended to be heard at the opening of
Symphony Hall last year.
The idea of filling this wonderful auditorium with grand and thrilling
choral sounds seems to have determined the character of Holloway's piece,
which seems likes nothing less (and precious little more) than a grandiose
celebration of the Great English Choral Tradition, to the extent of evoking
many of its most sacred icons. There is an imposing opening of brass and
bells set against slabs of choral harmony, which instantly conjures memories
of Vaughan Williams's Sea Symphony; later there are brass snarls and choral
exclamations borrowed from the demons of Elgar's Gerontius. Moving on again,
there are Brittenesque tinges, in the context of which some luscious
Straussian string textures strike an alien note.
These ghostly presences become so intense that the ear is tempted to invent
more connections - might that be a touch of Walton, or that some Holst? -
where most likely none was intended. It is distressing to hear Holloway
submerging his own musical personality so effectively in such a substantial
(half-hour) piece; his personalised brand of 'Englishness' has deepened and
become ever more complex in the last decade. His reworkings of the pastoral
mode elsewhere have consistently proved tougher and more rewarding than
anything to be found here.
Holloway traces pit a sequence of seven continuous sections which fall
naturally into halves, with each culminating in an extended choral setting:
the first, 'Auguries', is based upon Blake; the second is a 'Hymn' drawn
from Tennyson. Everything is put together expertly, and scored with
unfailing imagination; the Three Choirs Festival is no doubt at this moment
pencilling in a performance. But however vividly projected (and it would
hard to imagine performers more fiercely committed than Rattle's choir and
orchestra) the ground covered in The Spacious Firmament is far too familiar,
and its gestures irredeemably second hand.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: The Philharmonia Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether intentionally or not, a superficial link brought together the two
halves of the Philharmonia's concert on Tuesday. In later life both Dvorak
and Rakhmaninov found themselves in the New World, far from the homelands
they held dear, and it was a single work from each of their American periods
that was included.
It would be fanciful to suggest that the performers had taken this chance
connection into account when they were rehearsing the programme and yet I
have not previously felt either piece speak so longingly of people and
places out of reach. The main work was Rakhmaninov's Third Symphony - a
difficult score to place geographically anyway and in this performance,
conducted by Kurt Sanderling, rendered a strangely rootless and troubling
masterpiece.
Sanderling is always a welcome guest at the Philharmonia. To my mind, now
that a generation of venerable maestros has gone, he is one of the great
conductors of the day and if he wants to conduct this symphony in so
individual a way, then it is best to respect his ideas. For there was none
of the usual Hollywood glitz in his performance. No lush Philadelphia-like
strings. Not even much Russian red-blooded excitement, if one looked to that
tradition.
Instead the whole symphony spoke of an enormous and burdensome longing. The
emphasis was on slow speeds and sombre textures, lowering deep brass in
particular. Every detail carried import and it says a lot for the work that
conductor and players must have put in that the music left such a convincing
message as one came away: that this often spurned work is a serious symphony
and Rakhmaninov meant what he wrote in every note of it.
In Dvorak's Cello Concerto a wistful longing for home is never far from the
surface. Yo-Yo Ma made much of its poetic cello writing, with some notably
exquisite soft playing in the slow movement, while Sanderling brought to the
accompaniment the same strength of purpose for which he is known in the
German classics. Again this was a performance which took nothing for granted
and the orchestra gave it playing of its best quality.
If the Philharmonia is to lift its international profile as it hopes, there
are two objectives to meet: it will have to offer unusual programmes and
make those which are usual something out of the ordinary. This concert was a
superb example of the second case and I cannot put forward a stronger
recommendation for Sanderling's other concert tonight, when he conducts
Mahler's Ninth Symphony.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: SEC newcomer takes hot seat as tempers
rise over valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HALFWAY through an interview from his Connecticut home, Walter Schuetze
breaks off to answer the door. Someone has arrived to mend the hot water,
reports the Securities and Exchange Commission's new chief accountant
gratefully, as a cold snap engulfs New England.
But if hot water has been lacking on the domestic front, Mr Schuetze is
facing a surfeit professionally. The 59-year-old accountant, a partner at
KPMG Peat Marwick, steps into his new post at the US watchdog this week -
and immediately confronts a furore over current value accounting.
For many months, the SEC, under its chairman Richard Breeden, has argued
strongly that banks and other financial institutions should carry financial
products in their books at current values - not at what they paid for them.
Such pressure is more than academic. Ever since the thrift industry debacle
triggered a political storm, supervision and regulation of financial
institutions has been a highly-charged issue. The SEC, moreover, has a
Congressional mandate to set accounting rules for US companies, although in
practice it cedes the task of drawing up standards to the Financial
Standards Accounting Board.
It is easy to see why the SEC is so concerned. Most banks, for instance,
currently split their portfolios of stocks and bonds between those held for
investment which are valued at cost, and a more limited trading account
where securities are indeed 'marked-to-market'. This presents plentiful
opportunities for the unscrupulous. Bonds within the investment portfolio
which have risen in value can be sold at year-end for a gain, for example,
while those that have fallen can be retained within the portfolio, yet
valued at cost.
The financial industry, however, has hit back with equal ferocity. The
American Bankers Association, a trade organisation encompassing many large
commercial banks, puts the argument thus: 'Our primary problem is that banks
don't use current value accounting for their own purposes, so it is hard to
see why it should improve things for investors.' Investment portfolios, it
is argued, are held for the longer-term, so short-term price movements have
little relevance.
Various supplementary salvos back up this central theme. Any meaningful
attempt at current value accounting, it is argued, should surely require
that liabilities are also marked to market - and there is little consensus
on how to do this. Second, even on the asset side, 'current value'
calculations may be extremely subjective where there is no ready market for
the security in question. Hence the reliability of accounts could diminish,
not improve. Third, banks might be obliged to cold-shoulder whole areas of
the securities market where valuation is difficult or volatility pronounced.
The debate is not confined to the banking industry. Similar controversy
rages vis-a-vis the plication that this a state-regulated business, and the
politics even more labyrinthine.
Mr Terence Lennon, chief examiner at the New York Department of Insurance,
put the regulators' case bluntly to a Congressional sub-committee. 'The
marking-to-market of the entire asset portfolio of an insurer is not a good
idea,' he suggested. 'First of all, it cannot be done without marking
liabilities to market . . . and I believe we would be losing a lot of
conservatism if we marked both sides to market. In addition, only about
one-third of the assets in most companies have a readily obtainable market
value . . . Frankly, this (marking-to-market) gives the industry more of an
opportunity for subjective analysis than they have now.'
Into this heated debate, steps Mr Schuetze. It would be amazing if the new
chief accountant was anything but supportive of the SEC stance, but just how
much weight does he attach to the issue? Does he, for example, class current
value accounting as a top priority?
'Yes, I do,' he replies, choosing his words with meticulous care. 'We need
to increase and improve the relevance and credibility of financial
accounting, and I think the use of market values, for assets and
liabilities, is very desirable. That's especially true for financial
institutions.'
Confronted with the ABA argument about aptness, Mr Schuetze reels off a list
of beneficiaries - shareholders, potential shareholders, employees,
potential employees, customers, and so on. When tackled about the potential
distortion to investment markets, his response is even simpler: 'If it
eventuates, it eventuates.'
But Mr Schuetze also knows he is dealing with the real world, and is far
from purist about the way in which changes may be effected. He has already
been quoted as saying that the profession needs to 'crawl before it can
walk, and walk before it can run' in the matter of current value accounting.
'The marking-to-market of financial assets is the crawling part,' he now
adds. 'If we have to yield on liabilities, we have to yield on liabilities.'
As for current value accounting in non-financial industries: 'I think it may
be more difficult with regard to property, plant and equipment, and
intangible assets. It is both more difficult, and more difficult to move
quickly. We will have to work on it over time. You have to get the economic
benefits into equilibrium with the relevance of the numbers. This is a first
step.'
To some observers, it appeared as Mr Schuetze's task became a mite more
difficult last week, when the FASB - which has been working for some time on
an draft accounting rule requiring investment securities to be marked to
market - delayed issuing any proposal until May at the earliest.
But the FASB's own account of the vote switch is more ambiguous. It says one
member of the six-man board - previously split 4-2 in favour of issuing a
proposal - wanted to 'revisit' two crucial aspects of the draft rule. These
were the liability valuation question, and the desirability of having
unrealised gains and losses reported outside the income statement. He was
not, stresses FASB, necessarily changing his eventual vote.
Mr Schuetze, meanwhile, notes that the board will be enlarged to seven
members in March, and will then need a 5-2 vote in favour of issuing the
draft rule. Since the new, seventh member will be critically involved with
the proposal, it made little sense to plough ahead with the preliminaries
ahead of his arrival. 'FASB did not back away,' maintains Mr Schuetze 'They
decided to delay for a while.'
That does not stop bank lobbyists from crowing. 'I'm very pleased to see
that FASB is equally concerned about this,' remarked one industry supporter,
after news of the delay spread. 'The SEC has placed FASB in an awkward
position, and it should not be influenced in this way.' One can almost feel
the steam rising.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: More invective but fewer choices -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS not taken long for Britain's leaders to demonstrate once again one of
the more unhappy truths of modern politics: the level of hyperbole and
invective in political debate rises in inverse proportion to the real
differences between those engaged in it.
Journalists who have trudged along to the morning rounds of press
conferences that since the new year have become a general election campaign
in all but name could not have been presented with an apparently starker
choice.
Mr Chris Patten offers the image of a Labour government determined to rob
the people of their incomes and hand the keys to 10 Downing Street to a few
trade union leaders before leaving it defenceless, facing the likes of
Saddam Hussein.
For Mr Jack Cunningham, the Conservatives are set on a stategy that would
cast Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the role of a moderate socialist. The health
service and welfare state would be dismantled, Britain would be detached
from Europe and the remainder of the country's manufacturing industry would
be replaced by fast-food outlets paying slave wages.
Standing for the moment on down reinforces both messages: only a vote for
the Liberal Democrats can save Britain from two equally awful fates.
Deep beneath the invective, it is possible to discern real choices for the
electorate. Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock hail from similarly humble
backgrounds. But there is little coincidence in their views on the
respective role of state help and self-help for the individual. Mr Kinnock
believes in greater equality, Mr Major that everyone should have a roughly
equal chance of becoming unequal.
The Conservatives would spend a fair proportion of the so-called growth
dividend on tax cuts, Labour would devote it to the public sector.
The redistribution of wealth towards the more affluent in the 1980s might
well be reinforced by Mr John Major's plans to whittle down inheritance and
capital taxes.
Mr Neil Kinnock's tax plans, painful though they would be for those in the
top income brackets, would involve a relatively modest reversal of the trend
in favour of those lower down the scale.
Their respective approaches to constitutional reform - the Conservatives
want none of it while Labour is committed to many of its own MPs have
realised - provide another area of less-noticed but important contrast.
There is a sense, equally, that the practice of government under Mr Major or
Mr Kinnock might well provide a much sharper divergence than their
manifestos will hint at. Both sound more convincing in their attacks on what
the other would actually do than on what they have said they will do.
Even so, neither can dispute that the essential difference between politics
at the start of the 1990s and that at the start of the 1980s is that both
the Conservatives and Labour recognise that the job of government is to
manage rather than to change the world. Mrs Thatcher's permanent revolution
is as defunct as Mr Michael Foot's Alternative Economic Strategy.
That the voters have sensed this is self-evident. A glance at the opinion
polls shows that, with occasional blips, support for the main parties has
settled at 40 per cent. The Liberal Democrats can claim about 15 per cent.
The reality is that both Mr Major and Mr Kinnock are in tune with the mood
of the country - and neither believes that the gap that will separate them
after the votes are counted will be any more than 3 points or 4 points.
So an election campaign already more frenetic and ferocious than any fought
by Mrs Thatcher is being waged to win the allegiance for a single day of a
couple of hundred thousand voters in a few dozen marginal constituencies.
There must, as one minister commented this week, be a better way.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour accuses government of
raising tax burden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday accused the government of raising the tax burden,
squandering at least Pounds 11bn on under-priced privatisation share offers,
and re-emphasised Britain's poor economic record with those of its European
competitors.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, produced figures to
show that a couple with two children on average earnings have seen their tax
rise from 35.2 per cent to 37.5 per cent in the 13 years of Tory government.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, called on the government to
end the uncertainty about the timing of the election.
'If the government can announce the Budget today, they should be prepared to
announce the general election today,' he said, warning that in failing to
end speculation, Mr John Major was putting party interests before the
interests of the country.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Pollution monitoring proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT

<TEXT>
COMPANIES should be allowed to monitor their own pollution emissions and set
their own environmental targets, the Institute of Directors said yesterday.
The institute, which has prepared a report on the environment, wants
government regulation used only as a last resort and enforced with a 'light
touch'.
It said the tax on fossil fuels being considered by the European Commission
would put European business at a disadvantage and increase distortions in
the energy market.
Mrs Janice Buck, IoD environmental research executive, said many companies
might be put out of business by UK regulations enforcing integrated
pollution control over air, land and water. She said pollution monitoring
could be carried out by private enterprise 'as in MoT testing'.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Wise men bring gifts to Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's assault on 'trendy' and 'progressive' teaching methods in
schools took the high ground yesterday when Mr Kenneth Clarke's self-styled
'three wise men' supported the education secretary's view that 'back to the
basics' is the way to counter falling standards.
If the wise men prevail, out will go general projects, child-centred
teaching and classrooms with a hubbub of noise coming from children grouped
around a dozen or more tables. In will come formal instruction, grouping of
children by ability, and sitting behind rows of tables, facing the front,
quietly taking it all down.
'At school level, teachers will need to abandon the dogma of recent
decades,' say the wise men. It is a calculated bid to subvert the 1967
Plowden report, which the right - explaining away Lady Plowden, a prominent
Tory educationalist - blame for what they see as a generation of damaging
teaching practice.
And not just the right: yesterday, only the diehard National Union of
Teachers condemned the report out of hand. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's education
spokesman, said the authors had shown 'commendable independence' in their
work.
The political motives behind Mr Clarke's determination to rush out a report
a mere seven weeks after appointing the inquiry are clear enough. Even so,
the credentials of his wise men - Professor Robin Alexander of Leeds
University, Mr Jim Rose, HMI's chief inspector of primary schools, and Mr
Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the National Curriculum Council - are
weighty, and their report will command wide respect.
How deep 'progressive dogma' actually penetrated is questionable. Pressed on
the issue yesterday, Professor Alexander backtracked on his own report and
said it was 'not as widespread as often alleged'. Mr Clarke himself
emphasised that 'there is not a single element of these proposals which is
not being practised somewhere in the country'. Spreading existing best
practice to all schools is the priority.
Moreover, beneath the headlines, the report contains far more than
Plowden-bashing. Two themes in particular may embarrass the government if
fully exploited.
First, the wise men stress the need to increase resources for primary
schools. They do so obliquely, pointing to the wide and unjustifiable
disparity between funding for the last primary and first secondary year (ie
when children are between ages 10 and 11), and urging the need for schools
to have access to specialist expertise in all nine national curriculum
subjects.
In both cases, only a significant increase in overall funding is likely to
meet their objectives. The extensive teacher retraining implicit in their
recommendations will add to the bill.
Second, the wise men note that in recent years the task of the primary
teacher has changed dramatically, with the national curriculum, in
particular, imposing greater demands than formerly. Hence, in part, their
emphasis on formal subject instruction and access to teaching expertise
across the curriculum.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Contraction seen in venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENTURE capital industry contracted sharply in the second half of last
year, according to accountant Levy Gee.
UK Venture Capital Database, the firm's computerised directory of venture
funds, showed 17 venture funds ran out of cash to invest and one new fund
was set up.
This represented a decline of about 10 per cent in the number of funds still
active. A total of 146 funds responded to the latest six-monthly update of
the database.
The figures reflect a marked acceleration in the decline of the venture
capital industry. The preceding survey, published in June last year, showed
seven companies had withdrawn from the market in the first half of last year
while four new funds had started up.
Venture capitalists have been hit by a combination of the recession and the
poor performance of many funds in the 1980s, making it difficult for fund
managers to raise new money from institutional investors.
Manufacturing and service companies remained the most favoured investments
for venture capitalists, but their relative popularity declined slightly.
Wholesale and distribution companies gained ground.
3i, the venture capital group, yesterday announced plans to promote the idea
of rights issues for unquoted businesses as a means of making venture
capital more palatable to small and medium-sized companies.
The rights issue plan would allow existing shareholders to increase their
investment in their company and to avoid the dilution of their holding which
normally accompanies the injection of venture capital into a company.
3i would underwrite an issue of new shares taking up any not bought by
existing shareholders. Its target market is private and family-owned
businesses with annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 250,000 or more. Many of
these companies have previously resisted the idea of venture capital.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Loss of 1,105 mine jobs is confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday confirmed it will cut 1,105 jobs at four pits in its
Selby group of mines in West Yorkshire including its flagship Selby complex,
a costly development the size of the Isle of Wight.
More than 200 jobs are to go at Whitemoor, one of seven pits in the Selby
complex itself. Another 150 will be eliminated at Sharlston, near Wakefield
while 410 and 350 redundancies, respectively, are earmarked at Kellingley
and Prince of Wales, both near Pontefract.
Confirmation of the cuts came as British Coal announced a further 30 to 40
job losses at Kiveton Colliery in its South Yorkshire group.
The announcement fuelled speculation that the company is attempting to
reduce manpower and improve productivity in readiness for privatisation if
the Conservatives win the next election.
British Coal said the cuts were necessary if the mines were to bring down
costs sufficiently to sell to the newly privatised electricity industry at
competitive prices after March 1993, when government-backed contracts run
out.
The company may also be trying to cut the volume of output, according to the
newsletter Coal UK, published today. In spite of 12 pit closures this year
the company still has more coal than it can sell to the generators, the
newsletter says, not the least as a result of improvements in productivity.
But Mr Alan Houghton, Selby group director, said the job losses would not
result in output reductions. He said they were aimed at ensuring that the
pits were 'physically and financially strong'.
There is no sign so far that the four Selby pits affected by the job cuts
face closure.
Kellingley is one of the 14 mines picked by NM Rothschild, the government
advisers on coal privatisation in their controversial report leaked last
year, as profitable enough for a sell-off. Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow
energy secretary, said yesterday: 'It makes phenomenal profits.'
The other three mines, which were not chosen by Rothschild, are believed by
industry observers to be either loss-making or close to breaking even.
Three of the pits in the Selby group - Riccall, Wistow, and Stillingfleet -
have frequently broken productivity records, but both Whitemoor and North
Selby, the most recent mine to open, have suffered geological problems which
have sometimes halted or seriously slowed down production.
Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the National Union of Mineworkers in
Yorkshire, said that he believed any problems the pits had were surmountable
and blamed the cuts on the government's decision that British Coal must
compete in the international market.
British Coal said all redundancies would be voluntary but Mr Dobson said the
company was able to achieve thisonly by offering miners a top-up payment of
up to Pounds 10,000 if they took redundancy before the end of March.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Ontario U-turn reins in public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DEEPENING fiscal crisis has forced Ontario's New Democratic Party
government to make a sharp U-turn in economic policy.
Canada's richest province, which less than a year ago proposed spending its
way out of recession, now proposes to limit the rise in transfers to
municipalities, schools and hospitals to 1 per cent, in the fiscal year from
April 1, followed by 2 per cent in each of the following two years.
Mr Bob Rae, provincial premier, warned that further austerity measures would
be required to rein in the galloping budget deficit. This is now projected,
for the year to March 31 1993, at CDollars 14.3bn (Pounds 6.8bn), far above
the earlier estimate of CDollars 8.9bn.
'We're facing tough choices,' Mr Rae said in a television address. 'We've
got to find that balance between the cost of the services people need and
expect, and what we can afford.' Among the likely consequences of the clamp
on transfer payments are higher university fees, longer delays in elective
surgery and cuts in refuse collection and other municipal services.
Ontario contributes about 40 per cent of Canada's gross domestic output and
is one of North America's biggest borrowers on international capital
markets. Its economy - heavily dependent on the automotive, steel and
forestry industries - shrank by an estimated 2.1 per cent last year, the
biggest fall among Canada's 10 provinces. The provincial Treasury has
revised its forecast of 1992 growth to 2.2 per cent, down from an estimate
of 3.8 per cent.
Government revenues are expected to fall by 1.5 per cent in the fiscal year
to March 31 1992, the first drop since 1945.
Mr Rae's social democratic government, in office since September 1990, drew
strong criticism last year when it raised the 1991-92 deficit to CDollars
9.7bn, three times the previous government's projection.
Pressed by a dispirited business community, the NDP recently started to
shrink from interventionism. It shelved plans for a publicly owned car
insurance scheme, delayed a proposed environmental 'bill of rights' and
softened a ban on Sunday shopping.
Business groups are fighting proposed changes to the provincial labour law,
which would include a ban on hiring replacement workers at strikebound
companies. The Big Three North American motor companies warned last week
that the changes would seriously damage Ontario's ability to attract new
investment.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA wants to attract thousands of migrants from the former Soviet
Union to populate the country's vast interior. Officials even hope that the
migrants will bring millions of dollars in investment capital with them.
'We are considering immigrants who would bring capital to dynamise the
economy. We are talking with the European Community to provide credits for
potential migrants to settle and create companies in Argentina,' said Mr
Geraldo Molnes, the interior ministry's population secretary.
Argentina is the second Latin American country to offer to take such
migrants. Venezuela said at the weekend it was seeking some with scientific
and technical skills.
Argentina covers an area the size of India but a third of the population is
in Buenos Aires, leaving most of Patagonia - the far south - sparsely
inhabited.
Populating Patagonia has obssessed Argentine officialdom since it took
control of the region early in this century, but the comforts of city life
in Buenos Aires have been generally preferred to the distant steppes. Mr
Molnes hopes any newcomers will go to Patagonia and to small cities in the
interior.
The government hopes immigrants will begin arriving at a rate of 20,000 a
year and quickly reach 100,000 a year. Mr Molnes denied that Argentina was
discriminating against dark-skinned immigrants from nearby countries in
favour of Europeans.
An EC diplomat, though, poured cold water on the notion: 'They have not made
a formal approach yet. In any case, some of us do not trust the Argentines,
who give the impression of just wanting the money. Others, especially the
Germans, say it amounts to trade in human lives. It could be done
tastefully, but I doubt anything will come of it.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ISRAELI opposition group said yesterday it estimated the government spent
at least Shk2.5bn (Pounds 600m) - about 15 per cent of the civilian budget -
on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip last year, principally
on increasing settlement housing stock by more than half.
The issue of spending in the occupied territories is central to Israel's
request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees from the US to
help finance the absorption of mass Jewish immigration from the former
Soviet Union. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, is to discuss with
Israel's ambassador in Washington today to discuss conditions for approving
the guarantees.
Peace Now, a group which advocates giving up the West Bank and Gaza, said
its study showed at least Shk1.8bn had been spent on building more than
13,000 houses in 1991, raising by 60 per cent in one year the total number
of houses in the settlements.
Calling the spending 'a financial swindle of immense proportions', the group
said the government deliberately obscured the extent of its settlement
activity to conceal from the Israeli public how much of the state's
resources it was devoting to its ideological commitment to secure perpetual
rule over the territories.
In reply, Mr Ariel Sharon, the minister of housing and construction, branded
Peace Now as 'sick informers'. He said his ministry's budget for building in
the West Bank and Gaza last year was Shk850m. He said it was necessary to
build there now because it would not be possible after Palestinian autonomy
was established, as envisaged in the current Middle East peace talks.
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy arrived in China yesterday for a
breakthrough visit to establish diplomatic ties, Reuter adds from Beijing.
Hours after his arrival, China confirmed it would take part in Middle East
peace talks due to begin next week in Russia, the first time Beijing will
participate in the US-Moscow brokered negotiations.

FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japanese sell dizzy surplus as a
short-term spectre - Figures that belie fundamental changes in trade with
the US, Europe and Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETURN of Japan's 1991 trade surplus to the dizzy levels of five years
ago gives the impression that the underlying trend remains unchanged in
spite of the appreciation of the yen, a flurry of market-opening measures
and the surge in foreign direct investment by Japanese companies.
But the daunting surplus - at Dollars 78.2bn, not far below the 1986 record
of Dollars 82.7bn and a 50 per cent increase on 1990 - reflects fundamental
changes in Japan's trading patterns. These include a decrease in the
reliance on direct exports to the US market, a fact obscured by the recent
heightening of trade tension between the two countries.
The trends of last year also highlight the potential for trade friction with
the European Community, in coming months, and the likelihood of louder
complaints from Asian trading partners, who are experiencing real rises in
their bilateral deficits far larger than those on the US deficit with Japan.
Last year's figures also reflected China's emergence as a powerful trading
economy. Sino-Japanese trade totalled a record Dollars 22.8bn, with exports
from Japan rising 40.2 per cent to Dollars 8.6bn, and imports to Japan 18
per cent higher at Dollars 14.2bn, giving China a Dollars 5.6bn bilateral
surplus.
While Japan's surplus has fallen as a share of total trade volume from 24.6
per cent to 14.2 per cent since 1986, its apparently unchanged value - in
current prices - is the most obvious target for foreign criticism and a
particularly tempting target for US Congress representatives in an election
year.
The surplus in trade with the US rose 1.3 per cent last year to Dollars
38.45bn, the first increase in four years.
However, as a percentage of bilateral trade volume the surplus has fallen
from 46.9 per cent in 1986 to 26.6 per cent last year. One problem is that
Japan's imports from the US remain weighted towards commodities, the prices
of which have been weak, while machinery of all kinds comprised only 34.2
per cent of the total last year.
Washington has sought to narrow the difference by pushing for a stronger
yen, but the short-term effect of yen appreciation will be to increase the
US dollar value of Japanese exports, widen the surplus and, perhaps, raise
trade tension. But in spite of the harsh political environment, Japan's
Ministry of Finance continues to suggest that the expansion of the surplus
is a 'misunderstanding'.
Tokyo argues that 'special factors' are responsible for the 1991 surge and
that these factors will be less influential in the coming year.
These 'special' conditions, reckoned to account for around 80 per cent of
the increase, are: currency fluctuations, the post-Gulf crisis plunge in oil
prices, 'unusually' low commodity prices, and the collapse of Japan's
financial 'bubble'.
But the Bank of Japan admits that these 'special factors' also exaggerated
the fall in the surplus from 1987 to 1990, when it bottomed at Dollars
52.1bn. For example, bank officials say luxury good imports were
artificially high in the late 1980s, when financial speculation reached a
peak.
Japanese officials hope that the taste for luxuries will return this year,
although imports of art works are likely to remain flat and imported
prestige cars now face much tougher competition from Japanese luxury models.
Slower demand for luxury goods contributed to the 48 per cent increase to
Dollars 27.37bn in the surplus with the EC.
Tokyo suggests that another special factor, the rebuilding of the former
east Germany, led to an unusual increase, 16 per cent, in exports to
Germany.
Recession did not undermine European demand for Japanese products, and the
stirrings of economic recovery are likely to produce a widening of
surpluses.
Exports to the UK last year rose 2.2 per cent to Dollars 11bn, while imports
from the UK fell 4.1 per cent to Dollars 5bn, also reflecting the weaker
demand for luxury goods and imported cars. Japan's exports to Italy rose
11.2 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn, while its imports from Italy declined 9.5
per cent to Dollars 4.5bn.
The sharp rises in Japan's exports to south-east Asia follow on from the
establishment of manufacturing bases in these countries and the shipping of
value-added components to these facilities. Exports to Malaysia rose 38.6
per cent last year, those to Singapore increased 14.1 per cent and to
Indonesia by 11.4 per cent.
Further to the north, exports to Taiwan rose 18.3 per cent and to South
Korea by 15 per cent.
Dr Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, said
that a large share of Japan's component exports to Asia are for use in
products ultimately destined for the US market.
He said Asia will again be an important source of export growth this year
and that heavy investment at home by Japanese companies has put them in a
superior position to take advantage of an upturn in the global economy.
Foreign financial houses in Tokyo and Japanese institutions generally
predict that the overall surplus will surge in the first quarter, but rise
slightly over the whole of this year.
They are agreed that the surplus is likely to surpass the 1986 record, and
that it will definitely be a source of some political embarrassment for
Japan's government.
Tokyo trade officials yesterday said they plan to monitor Japanese
carmakers' efforts to buy more US vehicles and parts and will report
progress to Washington, Reuter writes from Tokyo. Some three quarters of
Japan's trade surplus with the US is a product of the sales of Japanese cars
and car parts in America.

FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: A P Moller withdraws Danish oil fields
plan

POLITICAL interference has caused A P Moller, the shipping, oil and gas
group, to withdraw a DKr3bn (Pounds 270m) development plan for three small
oil and gas fields in the Danish sector of the North Sea.
In a statement yesterday the group said the Ministry for Industry had made
conditions which were 'entirely unacceptable'.
The group would not spell out why it was dissatisfied, but the dispute is
understood to concern the conditions for ownership and access to an 84km
pipeline, linking several fields. The pipe was an integral part of the
development plan.
In 1962, A P Moller received a 50-year exclusive concession to explore for
oil and gas in both the Danish offshore and land areas. However, in the
early 1980's a left-wing government forced the group to relinquish all but 1
per cent of the area to which the original concession applied.
Left-wing parties have now forced the non-socialist minority government to
present A P Moller with tough conditions for the new development plan.
A P Moller is the operating company for the Danish Underground Consortium,
the other members of which are Shell and Texaco.
Production from the Danish fields last year reached 7m tonnes, plus
production of 3.5bn cubic meters of gas.
The development plan would have added about 15,000 barrels a day (about
800,000 tonnes a year) to oil output.
The Finnish government yesterday agreed to supply Estonia with up to 100,000
tonnes of heavy fuel oil to help ease the acute energy shortage which is
threatening to disrupt the heating system in the recently independent
country, writes Robert Taylor from Stockholm.

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday agreed on a drastic restriction in export
credit guarantees for trade with the republics of the ex-Soviet Union,
setting a ceiling of DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for the coming year - half the
level of exports last year from east German enterprises alone.
The decision was taken in the light of Germany's soaring trade exposure with
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and a huge backlog of
applications for export insurance totalling DM70bn. The exposure of Hermes,
the German export insurance agency, to the former Soviet republics now
stands at almost DM30bn, compared with DM11.6bn at the end of 1990.
Exporters who have been given agreement in principle for insurance cover
from Hermes will not have it renewed automatically if they fail to conclude
their contracts in the coming weeks. Agreements in principle already given
total DM23bn, while applications in the pipeline total a further DM70bn,
according to the Finance Ministry.
The Cabinet also decided not to continue the special insurance regime for
east German exporters, which meant that insurance cover was given for 100
per cent of their contract value until the end of last year.
The decisions are likely to have dire consequences for east German exporters
although the chronic shortage of foreign currency in the CIS republics was
already causing a sharp drop in finalised import contracts. The curbs in
Hermes cover were demanded by Mr Theo Waigel, the Finance Minister, against
the pleading of Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the Economics Minister. They will be
reviewed in March, officials said.
For the time being, all German exports will be judged on two criteria:
whether they will help the foreign exchange earnings of the ex-Soviet
republics, and whether they mean life-or-death for an east German
enterprise, which would otherwise have to be closed or supported with state
funds.

<TEXT>
DENG XIAOPING, China's paramount leader, is visiting Shenzhen, in what
observers see as a boost for economic reformers in China.
Shenzhen, located to the north of Hong Kong, is the show case of China's
'open door' policy ushered in by Deng in 1979 when he created the special
economic zones on China's southern coast. It has the highest per capita
income in China and has been the engine for growth in Guangdong Province.
Deng, 87, who holds no formal position in the Chinese government but still
wields considerable power, is rarely seen in public and meets few foreign
leaders.
Diplomats in Beijing and Hong Kong said that Deng's visit could be a prelude
to an acceleration of economic reform in China - a topic much in discussion
among the leadership. There have been many reports in the mainland Chinese
press calling for the reform programme to be speeded up now that the central
government authorities have had some success in controlling the country's
overheated economy.
'Their visits are pretty high profile and a deliberate gesture in support of
the forces of reform,' one said. 'It suggests that the forces of reform are
fighting back but, at the same time, that they need to.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Privatisation chief takes on nomenklatura: Suspicion and
corruption lie in the path of an ambitious sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation chief, faces the awesome task of
cutting his way through layers of inept and corrupt bureaucracy to involve a
disillusioned and suspicious population in the world's most ambitious
sell-off.
'If people have no faith in the process, there can be no privatisation,' he
said yesterday. The main danger was a popular belief that privatisation was
just another means 'for bureaucrats to get bribes'.
Today, President Boris Yeltsin's government is due to present Russia's
regional governors with instructions on how to implement its privatisation
programme. The target for 1992 is to sell the trade and services sector,
agriculture, transport, construction and small-scale light industry.
One of the ten documents to be approved at a cabinet meeting today sets out
how property will be valued: nominal book-value will be the starting price
for competitive bidding. Based on his previous experience as economic reform
chief in St Petersburg, Mr Chubais has dropped as 'impractical' the
alternative of evaluating assets on the basis of estimated future profits.
The main weapon for combatting what Mr Chubais calls the 'high' level of
corruption in the state bureaucracy is to ensure that nothing can be sold
outside a transparent auction or tender system.
Mr Chubais, one of the bright young reformers swept into office last
October, said: 'My task is to produce rules which will not give local and
federal bureaucrats the right to determine who gets what. 'That's why I am
against any exemptions or benefits for this or that industry or enterprise.'
In practice, this means, for example, that Moscow city government's plans to
sell off property to staff at fixed prices - which has attracted
applications from 8,500 shops and restaurants - will have to be reversed. As
spelled out in the privatisation programme, employees get only 25 per cent
of the business free of charge; the rest has to be sold at a competitive
price.
The main target of uniform selling procedures is to stop so-called
'nomenklatura privatisation' - attempts by state managers both in government
ministries and at enterprises - to acquire or continue controlling property
for themselves.
In Moscow, for example, city officials' fondness for kickbacks and
reluctance to lose power appears to be one of the main reasons why there has
been little privatisation so far.
'That was the situation until last week,' explained one city official who
asked not to be named. 'The situation changed completely because Yeltsin
banged his fist on the table and complained that although we had price
liberalisation, we had no privatisation of shops. Now city leaders are
moving because they realise their political survival is at stake.'
Mr Andrei Vasiliev, spokesman for Moscow's State Property Agency, said that
Taxipark No. 1's 1,000 taxis will become the first business to be sold in a
closed auction to 2,000 taxi drivers. He is less optimistic about the
specific target of privatising most of the city's shops, restaurants and
small enterprises over the next year, citing continuing wrangles between
different city departments.
Along with the public discontent, Mr Chubais is also aware of a lack of
enthusiasm among potential foreign investors, though those foreigners who
are interested will only be able to take part in special investment tenders
because their hard currency buying power would give them a big advantage
over Russians.

<TEXT>
POLAND IS facing the loss of senior finance ministry officials which could
undermine economic policy planning at a crucial time for Mr Jan Olszewski's
new centre-right government.
An IMF delegation is due in Warsaw next week to discuss economic policies
being formulated by the new Polish economic team led by Mr Jerzy Eysymontt,
who heads the Central Planning Office.
Three senior officials who helped prepare the IMF-backed stabilisation
package associated with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former finance minister,
have said they want to resign while the government is still working on a
draft budget for the last nine months of this year. The budget has been
delayed for at least two weeks and will now not be be ready until the end of
February.
The three officials are Mr Stefan Kawalec, who came to the finance ministry
with Mr Balcerowicz, Mr Andrzej Podsiadlo, first deputy minister, and Mr
Wojciech Misiag, a ministry veteran who is directly responsible for putting
the budget together. All worked closely with Mr Balcerowicz, who was dropped
from the government and replaced as finance minister by Mr Karol Lutkowski.
The government, meanwhile, has announced the formation of a social economic
committee, reporting to the cabinet, in an effort to streamline
decision-making. It will be chaired by Mr Eysymontt and will include the
finance and labour ministers and the central bank governor. Poland has been
without the latter since Mr Grzegorz Wojtowicz was sacked last August
following a financial scandal.
Mr Eysymontt, a critic of the previous government's tough fiscal and
monetary policies, recently admitted that his plans to halt Poland's
recession were limited by the need to guard against renewed inflation. He
has toned down optimism that the decline in state sector industrial sales -
down 40 per cent in two years - could be reversed this year. He now hopes
sales will stop falling by the end of the year, with growth resuming in
1993.

<TEXT>
SERBIA IS forging ahead with creating a rump Yugoslavia despite the appeal
from Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia for recognition as independent
republics.
Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia'a representative on the Serb-controlled state
presidency, yesterday went to the United Nations in an effort gather
international support for the new Yugoslav state.
A Serbian government statement said: 'It is in the interest of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia to remain part of
Yugoslavia, because of the high degree of integration and common interests,'
Borba, a Belgrade daily, reported yesterday.
Serbia this week announced a draft law as 'the basis for the historic
reconstruction of Yugoslavia'. The law says local elections could be held by
autumn for a provisional constitutional assembly comprised of 30
representatives from each republic.
Under President Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia has insisted that Yugoslavia
continues to exist even after the international recognition of Croatia and
Slovenia. Serbia is now stepping up pressure on Bosnia and Macedonia to
remain part of a revamped Yugoslavia.
The parliament of Bosnia is tomorrow expected to approve a referendum on
independence for the central republic's 4.4m population of Slavic Moslems,
Serbs and Croats. Even Montenegro, Serbia's closest ally, this spring plans
to hold an independence referendum. Macedonia has recalled its
representatives from the dwindling ranks of the federal parliament and
foreign ministry.
Bosnia and Macedonia have announced plans to introduce their own currencies,
following the lead of Slovenia and Croatia. This would leave Serbia and tiny
Montenegro as the only republics still using the Yugoslav dinar. Critics
dismiss Serbia's plans to resuscitate Yugoslavia as an attempt to inherit
the common property of the 73-year-old state.
The borders of the new state have yet to be determined. Tanjug said: 'The
borders would be democratically agreed by the nations which wish to remain
in Yugoslavia.'
However, the prospects for peaceful negotiations over borders remain slim.
The Serb-dominated federal army controls one third of Croatia's territory,
where local Serb leaders say they refuse to be part of an independent
Croatia. Talks between the Croatian and federal military in Pecs, southern
Hungary, late Tuesday night broke down when the two sides could not agree on
the conditions of the army withdrawal from Croatia.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Peugeot in electric car drive

<TEXT>
PEUGEOT of France forecasts a European market of 200,000 electric cars a
year by the end of the decade and is committing at least 'several hundred
million' francs to take a 25 per cent share of it.
Mr Jean Yves Helmer, Peugeot Citroen car division director, said yesterday
such a market could be achieved without Californian-style legislation
forcing makers to sell a minimum number of electric cars.
Peugeot is preparing for commercial production of electric-powered Peugeot
106 and Citroen AX models within the next three years, predicting Europe
could absorb 10,000 electric cars a year by as early as 1995. The cars are
to be built alongside 'conventional' models on existing Peugeot assembly
lines. The group has already built or taken orders for some 500 electric
Peugeot and Citroen vans.
Peugeot claims to be relatively unaffected by technical hitches which have
marked the industry's attempts to develop viable electric vehicles. It says
costs of buying and operating electric cars can compete with petrol or
diesel equivalents.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Britain to return Pounds 90m of gold to Baltic states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to return to the newly independent Baltic states gold they had on
deposit with the Bank of England in 1940 at the time of the Soviet takeover.
The gold was sold on the open market by the UK government in 1967 for Pounds
5.8m. Today it is worth about Pounds 90m.
Mr John Major said yesterday after meeting Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the
Lithuanian president, that the Baltic states could have either the gold or
the cash equivalent.
Mr Landsbergis said Lithuania would prefer gold and for the gold to be kept
in the Bank of England.
A Bank of England official said that, under the terms of yesterday's
settlement, Lithuania was entitled to Pounds 19m or 94,748 troy ounces of
gold; Estonia to Pounds 31m or 154,754 ounces and Latvia to Pounds 42m or
210,719 ounces.
Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign Office minister, said the settlement 'closes a
shameful chapter in Britain's history'. He recalled that the gold had been
sold by Mr Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1967 and this was 'a
betrayal of the people of the Baltic states' as well as 'an act of
appeasement towards Moscow'.
Most of the proceeds from the 1967 sale was paid to British citizens to
settle claims for assets lost in areas which became part of the Soviet
Union. Britain also gave the Soviet government Pounds 500,000 from the
proceeds.
The total, roughly 14 tonnes, represents about 2.5 per cent of the UK's
official gold reserves. Other bankers suggested the UK government might use
gold from the estimated 620 tonnes in its reserves or might simply buy it in
the London bullion market.
It is widely expected the other Baltic states will opt for gold to be kept
in the Bank of England to provide credibility when they launch their own
currencies. The precious metal could be used as collateral for loans or for
swaps - where gold is sold for cash but the seller also contracts to buy the
metal back at a future date.
The amount of gold is relatively small in bullion market terms and gold's
price was unaffected by the announcement. Gold closed in London last night
at Dollars 357.30 an ounce, down 70 cents.

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday approved an emergency decree forbidding the
export to Libya of a consignment of goods with a potential use in nuclear
technology.
The extraordinary measure follows the seizure of the goods last month at
Frankfurt airport, en route from the US to Libya via the Netherlands,
according to a government spokesmanMr Dieter Vogel. The German authorities
acted on a tip-off from foreign intelligence sources.
Current German export control legislation does not give the government
sufficient powers to bar the export of the goods, which Mr Vogel said 'could
be used for nuclear or other purposes.'
Coincidentally, the German government is set to present new export control
legislation in the Bundestag today and the sudden revelation of the Libyan
cargo appears to strengthen its case. The government has been attempting to
persuade the parliament of the need for tougher export controls on sensitive
technology - including the use of telephone tapping by the customs - for the
past two years.
Reuter reported yesterday that the Libyan consignment was seized on December
10, as the aircraft carrying it was already cleared for take-off. The German
authorities were asked to stop the cargo by the Dutch, who said their own
export controls were not strict enough to act.
The agency quoted government sources saying the consignment included laser
equipment and other items, ordered by a Dutch intermediary for delivery to
'a Libyan agency which is known to be a procurement institute for the Libyan
missile programme'.
Mr Vogel would not confirm where the tip-off came from, but said the German
authorities would not have acted without confirming the information
themselves.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no doubt about the destination of the European Commission's energy
policy, however slow the journey, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
'Our aim is to transform the energy market in Europe - which is
fundamentally national and based on administrative focusing of prices - and
replace it with a European unit in which cross-border trade could be
significant and prices would react according to negotiations between buyer
and seller,' Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, energy commissioner, said in an
interview last week.
Open access to gas and electricity networks is the legacy which the
Portuguese commissioner would like to leave to his successors when he gives
up the post at the end of this year, even if full third party access, as it
is known, has to wait until 1996.
Mr Cardoso e Cunha took up the quest in 1989 when the French government
complained it was being prevented from exporting electricity to Germany.
Ironically, France - together with Germany, the Netherlands and most
national energy producers - is now one of the principal opponents of the
plan.
Faced with such opposition, and the scepticism of some of his fellow
commissioners, Mr Cardoso e Cunha has toned down the original proposal to
break up energy monopolies using special legal powers. This has 'relieved
the tension", he says, but he is still a firm believer in the value of
liberalisation and increased transparency in the sector, particularly for
the largest producers. 'The unbundling concept (separating the management
and accounting of production, transmission and distribution operations)
could help the management of companies the size of Electricite de France,'
he says.
The British attempt to increase competition in the sector is one important
model for a pan-European system. However, the Commission cannot force member
states to change the ownership structure of their energy industries and is
adopting a phased approach to the problem.
'The idea is to test the system with a reduced number of actors,' says Mr
Cardoso e Cunha.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Brussels move on 'dual-use' goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is pressing for the abolition by the end of this
year of internal EC border controls on the export of goods and technologies
which could be used for military as well as civilian purposes.
Yesterday it approved a paper by Mr Martin Bangemann, internal market
commissioner, advocating the rapid removal of barriers to the free movement
of 'dual-use' goods and technologies, which can include, for example,
personal computers and high-technology machine tools.
However, certain member states - notably German and Britain - are not
convinced their EC partners will be able to bring their export controls up
to the required standard quickly enough. EC officials concede that a gradual
reduction in internal controls may prove preferable to immediate opening of
the market.
Internal EC export of dual-use goods and technologies is said to represent
between 5 and 8 per cent of total intra-Community trade, but member states
still impose on such exports a variety of controls often prepared according
to widely differing criteria. 'We want a reduction not an increase of
bureaucracy,' said one Commission official yesterday.
Having talked to all member states over the past 18 months, the Commission
is calling for:
a common list of dual-use goods and technologies subject to control;
a common list of non-EC destinations for which controls might have to be
applied;
common criteria for the issuing of licences for EC exports;
some mechanism for co-ordinating licensing and enforcement procedures;
explicit procedures for administrative co-operation between member states.
Foreign and internal market ministers will discuss the Commission paper next
month, and Brussels is expected to produce firm legislative proposals later
in the year.
Until recently, EC states excluded the Commission from any talks about
export controls. The scope of controls on dual-use exports to the old Warsaw
Pact countries is set by the Paris-based Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls (Cocom), members of which include most of Nato, Japan and
Australia.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (7): New way of training - A scheme to
replace apprenticeships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONAL apprentice- ships have been abolished in parts of Cheshire. The
move is not a retrograde step because what is being done instead looks like
becoming a model of best practice which is already spreading locally and may
well spread wider, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
It began 18 months ago as an experimental joint venture to improve the
quality and calibre of young technicians and chemical process operators. ICI
Chemicals and Polymers, Shell and Associated Octel launched a new type of
'technical studentship' for trainees aged 16 to 18.
The idea was to combine a broader range of full-time education and
industrial training than traditional apprenticeships could offer. It also
recognised that as big companies have invested in labour-saving plant and
pared payrolls to raise productivity, they have less scope to run in-house
training economically.
Although still in its early stages, the Cheshire experiment is well on its
way to getting most of its participants to the higher-level qualification of
the Business and Technical Education Council (BTEC) in four years. This is
18 months quicker than many traditional apprentices have been able to
achieve by mixing on-the-job learning with block or day release to the local
technical college and attendance at night school.
The three chemicals companies set up a new company called Technical Training
Enterprise (TTE) in 1990. It is based at West Cheshire College, Ellesmere
Port, where half of the new four-year course will be spent in full-time
education.
The companies initially planned to set up their own training school, but
were persuaded that better-rounded people would emerge if their trainees
were educated in a larger pool of young people and were able to mix with
students on other courses.
So they put up Pounds 400,000 of cash and equipment for laboratories and
workshops at the college, as well as installing their own staff to ensure
that all aspects of education and training are integrated and relevant. Some
teaching is also done by college staff.
The first intake of 90 technical students - all employed by TTE but
sponsored by one or other of the companies, came from a rush of 700
applicants from school-leavers, in spite of organisers having only a few
weeks to get their initial promotion off the ground.
Mr Peter Hyam, engineering manager of ICI in the area, is TTE's chairman. He
says that the three companies decided they had to have a long-term view of
the chemicals industry's needs.
As well as achieving economies of scale and getting trainees up to the
ever-higher standards needed by an increasingly capital-intensive industry,
the scheme has enabled the companies to get rid of things they did not like
about traditional apprenticeships, such as duplication of teaching,
irrelevance and lack of integration with the needs of the workplace.
'Other companies have now asked us to train people for them and technical
colleges have expressed interest in using the scheme as a model for their
own courses,' Mr Hyam says.
'This has encouraged us to expand the idea into other fields, for example,
into retraining and developing skills in the existing adult population.'
Strong support comes from the Chester, Ellesmere Port and Wirral Training
and Enterprise Council (Cewtec), which is chaired by Mr Nick Reilly, plant
director of Vauxhall Motors at Ellesmere Port.
'The Tec is looking to spread this as best practice into other sectors this
year. Chester's hoteliers have already started a similar scheme, involving
33 trainees each year,' Mr Reilly says.
While many of the big hotel groups have long had effective training schemes,
similar standards are more difficult to achieve for smaller, independent
establishments, for which costs - especially when compared with retention
rates - are a bigger problem.
Chester's growing hotels sector decided it was in the interests of all the
city's hotels to ensure as high a minimum training standard as possible and
create a pool of better-skilled service sector workers.
The result is a scheme where college training, as with TTE, is pooled,
creating economies of scale which make training more efficient for the big
hotels and more affordable for the small ones. Two days of each week are
spent at college, three in a hotel - and the trainees swap between hotels,
so that their practical experience is not confined to their sponsoring
employer.
'These are working examples of industry taking training seriously,' Mr
Reilly says. Vauxhall, his own company, is another: it is sharing its
engineering apprenticeship training with British Nuclear Fuels. More
importantly longer-term, half-a-dozen smaller companies will soon be joining
in.
Of three Tecs in Cheshire, Cewtec may have the most difficult job because it
operates in the west of the county, where it is affected by the ailing
Merseyside economy. 'It was originally thought there was no problem in
Cheshire when compared with Wirral, but that view is changing,' says Mr Alan
Moody, Cewtec's chief executive.
Cheshire's problem is structural change. Big business dominated Ellesmere
Port, in particular, and for decades was responsible for the bulk of craft
and technician training.
Vauxhall is a prime example of what capital-intensification does to a
company: there were 11,000 employees in 1980, but there are under 5,000 now.
This is not part of a rundown, for investment in a new engine plant and
other parts of the works is running at Pounds 350m.
'But Cheshire cannot depend on its big companies for growth in jobs,' Mr
Reilly says. 'We need more growth from smaller companies and more inward
investment. Teaching small companies to survive and grow through business
planning - and by training their supervisors and managers - is essential,
just as it is also our job to ensure that there is a trained workforce
available for incomers.'
With his Tec's board full of local chief executives from the engineering,
nuclear, electrical, shipping, food and chemicals industries, a vigorous,
self-determined approach seems assured.

has survived boundary changes

WHEN John Speed, the Tudor cartographer, published his atlas of the British
Isles in 1611, the rationale for Cheshire's existence was plain. Natural
features, rather than human diktat, defined the county, which was rich and
fertile.
Chester, an ancient Roman fortress linked to London by Watling Street, was a
thriving port with a virtual monopoly in trade with Ireland and troop
movements to garrisons there. The county was bounded by the Dee in the west,
the Mersey to the north, the Derbyshire peaks in the east and tributaries of
the Dee or Weaver to the south.
Grain, meat, butter and cheese were exported down the Dee to Ireland and
Scotland, or went by road to London - or were traded for wool from Yorkshire
to supply Cheshire's weavers in towns such as Macclesfield. Brine springs at
Northwich, Nantwich and Middlewich were the foundation of the county's
mineral industry, salt-making.
But the Dee started to silt up and new wharves had to be built downstream at
Neston in the Wyre Hall Hundred, now known as the Wirral peninsula.
The result was that the main thrust of the industrial revolution passed by
much of Cheshire as entrepreneurs and capital moved north. The wide,
fast-flowing Mersey was tamed by locks and docks in Liverpool. Birkenhead,
which does not appear on Speed's map even as a village, sprang up opposite
on the Wirral shore.
Inland, Manchester - in Speed's time a village in Lancashire's Salford
Hundred - started to grow and coalesce with similarly growing villages
around it.
Economically and geographically, Warrington became a more important
crossroads than Chester for both road and rail. Even Chester's role as the
regional economic capital of north Wales was usurped by Liverpool.
Cheshire's industry grew in such places as Wirral, in the north-east of the
county below Manchester, and in the south around the junction of the railway
lines from Scotland, Manchester and Holyhead (via Chester) at a former
village called Crewe.
The Manchester Ship Canal, built a century ago, made the ancient northern
boundary meaningless as it became the Mersey basin's main drainage channel
and turned much of the original river into little more than a stream.
Economic and political reality finally caught up with olde Cheshire with the
local government reorganisation of 1974.
Most of the Wirral was lopped off, turned into a metropolitan district to
absorb the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey, and put into the new
county of Merseyside.
On the eastern side, the new county of Greater Manchester swallowed
Altrincham, Sale, Stockport and Hyde, all of which had already coalesced
into the 2.5m-population conurbation. Cheshire managed to keep Wilmslow.
To compensate and keep Cheshire in fiscal and administrative balance, its
boundary was redrawn north of the Mersey divide to take in Warrington and
Widnes, the latter a town that had sprung up in the 1870s to move
Lancashire's chemicals industry nearer Cheshire's salt.
One of Warrington's advantages was its new town development status
corporation which in 1981 took over the neighbouring new town of Runcorn.
The other advantage was the motorway system - the latest generation of
infrastructure to use Warrington as a crossroads.
The M62 transpennine motorway crosses the M6, Britain's main north-south
link west of the Pennines, just north of Warrington. To the south of the
town, across the Manchester Ship Canal and what remains of the upper reaches
of the Mersey, the M56 links Manchester with Chester and North Wales. The
latter links to the M62 in Greater Manchester via the M63, which orbits the
western half of the conurbation. Other roads connect the M56 and M62 via a
bridge at Runcorn-Widnes.
The net result is that most of Britain can be reached from Cheshire within
four hours. And any part of Cheshire can be reached from anywhere else in
the county in less than hour - and far less if the motorways can be
exploited fully. Crucially for industrial development, Manchester Airport,
right on the county's boundary, is 20 minutes from Warrington, 30 minutes
from Chester or Ellesmere Port and 40 minutes from Crewe.
The M56, in particular, may yet have a greater influence on Chester's
development than Watling Street did in the Middle Ages: it is starting to
close an east-west divide in the county that has created social and
political tension.
The divide has been caused by the differing recent economic performances of
Greater Manchester and Merseyside.
The former's has turned the east Cheshire districts of Macclesfield and
Congleton into the north's equivalent of the Surrey stockbroker belt.
Prestbury, near Macclesfield, boasts property values comparable to some of
the best in south-east England before the recession. The market is slow now,
but it has not fallen much.
By contrast, Merseyside's professional and managerial class is getting
smaller and has had a lesser influence on the Dee coast of the Wirral and in
the countryside of west and mid-Cheshire.
However, the motorway network has now put the Wirral, Chester and much of
North Wales within 40 or 50 minutes of Manchester city centre, taking
pressure off east Cheshire.
Meanwhile, the forced growth of Warrington as a 'new' town saw its
population shoot up by nearly 11 per cent in the 1980s. Congleton, in the
south-east of the county and bordering Staffordshire, managed 8 per cent,
albeit from a smaller base.
Four of the six other Cheshire districts also grew - Vale Royal, in the
middle of the county, by 1.7 per cent, Crewe and Nantwich by 1.5 per cent,
Halton, helped by Runcorn's new town status, by 1.3 per cent, and
Macclesfield by 1.2 per cent.
These are places where people want to live. They contributed to a 2.8 per
cent population growth in Cheshire as a whole, despite Chester's population
being squeezed down by 1.8 per cent and that of Ellesmere Port and Neston by
3.9 per cent.
By the end of the 1980s, therefore, Cheshire's population had risen to
958,600 and it is expected to pass the 1m mark before the year 2000. The
county has few areas with social stress and only Halton, which is comprised
of the predominantly working-class towns of Widnes and Runcorn, has urban
programme status.
The question hanging over Cheshire, however, is whether the new Local
Government Commission will allow any of its districts to break away. In
spite of differential growth, Cheshire has largely succeeded in balancing
its development because each of its districts has fewer than 200,000 people
and none dominates.
This lack of a large focal town or city distinguishes the county greatly
from others - such as Humberside, Leicestershire or Nottinghamshire - where
those outside the local capital often see themselves as disadvantaged and
those in it feel held back and prevented from full self-determination.
The biggest case to break away and form a unitary authority on its own may
come from Warrington, which has about 190,000 people and is growing at up to
2,000 a year. But such a move would probably only make sense if Widnes were
to break off from Halton and go in with Warrington, adding another 60,000
people.
Since the government has already said it will not alter the boundaries of
the metropolitan counties - so Cheshire cannot take back places such as the
Wirral, Stockport or Altrincham - such a breakaway would reduce Cheshire's
population to the level of 30 years ago, but this would still be a viable
size with more than 750,000 people and plenty more wanting to live there,
guaranteeing taxpaying growth.
John Speed, who was born in Cheshire, and knew full well that anywhere north
of the Mersey was really in olde Lancashire, would have certainly seen a
logic in it all.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (2): Sore thumb seeks new image - Widnes
and Runcorn development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HALTON, one of the hybrid districts born during the local government
reorganisation of 1974, has not made much impact since. Indeed, a survey
carried out in south-east and north-west England last year showed that only
5 per cent of people knew where it is.
Its saving grace is that 95 per cent of the people polled knew where Widnes
and Runcorn are. They comprise Halton, albeit as two separate units
struggling to become one. The survey impelled the partnership of public and
private sector bodies trying to regenerate the area to change its name from
Halton to Widnes and Runcorn Development (WRD).
This may have improved Halton's chances of being found on the map but it has
not yet done much for the area's image. Halton is the only part of Cheshire
with enough problems to have been designated by the government as one of
Britain's 57 urban programme authorities.
It sticks out like a sore thumb, with the fourth worst male unemployment
rate - 17 per cent - in north-west England. Cheshire's comparable male rate
is 11 per cent. Within the county, the Wirral and Chester travel-to-work
area is two points worse off, but Widnes and Runcorn is wholly in Cheshire,
while the Wirral is in Merseyside.
Mr Christopher Gibaud is chief executive of WRD and an imported specialist
in economic development from Swindon via Peterborough. As he puts it:
'Halton sits very oddly with Cheshire, which has an image of being a green
and pleasant land. We are a poor relation, a Merseyside urban area, an
industrial blot on the landscape.'
Both Runcorn and Widnes are on Merseyside in the sense that they face each
other at the narrows before the Mersey widens into estuary and mudflats
between Ellesmere Port and Speke, but neither is in Merseyside in a
governmental or, increasingly, cultural sense.
Before 1974, Runcorn was in Cheshire, Widnes in Lancashire. They had been
joined by a road bridge - replacing a famous transporter bridge. And while
an even more famous rail bridge had physically linked them for more than a
century, its purpose was, and remains, the speeding of trains between
Liverpool and London.
Indeed, part of Widnes' image problem is the view from these passing trains
as they dawdle under speed restrictions along the elevated track to or from
the bridge. Widnes railway station is not even on this particular track. Its
claim to fame is as the place where Mr Paul Simon wrote 'Homeward Bound' -
an ode to misery - when still an impoverished and touring folk-club singer.
Runcorn also has an image problem. It was designated a new town and imported
thousands of Liverpudlians in the 1960s and 1970s. The were decanted from a
developing urban crisis into a planners' concrete dreamscape which was soon
christened Legoland.
This infamous housing is now well on the way to final demolition, but the
trauma was damaging. Runcorn now has very attractive areas of new housing,
but Halton has struggled for 17 years with trying to marry a working class
corner of Lancashire on one bank of the Mersey with a small town of imported
Scousers on the other.
Manufacturing industry predominates - and not for nothing is the wonderfully
successful Widnes rugby league team called the Chemics.
Widnes mushroomed 120 years ago when Lancashire canal owners hiked the tolls
for transporting Cheshire salt to chemical works in St Helens and beyond.
The chemical industry upped sticks to the river bank to cut costs.
Runcorn developed later as the Manchester Ship Canal opened it up to bulk
transportation of chemical feedstocks and finished products by sea. ICI now
employs 9,000 of its 44,000 UK workforce in Widnes or Runcorn. Chemicals
predominate, but related industries like food processing, drink, packaging,
plastics, light engineering and chemicals spin-offs are also there.
Apart from the local district council, the only large providers of
white-collar or professional jobs are ICI's offices and the Department of
Employment, which has relocated 900 jobs from the south-east. Good
communications ensure that managers and their families can live outside
Halton in Cheshire's more salubrious or bucolic districts.
This is the background against which Halton district council and WRD are
going to take on big city opponents in this year's City Challenge
competition for urban funding from the government.
The competition is open to all 57 designated authorities and Mr Richard
Stevens, the council's leg-man on the challenge, thinks Widnes is well on
the way to fulfilling the necessary criteria to win a share of the prize
money.
A solid, working partnership between public and private sectors is crucial
to making the final shortlist, and this looks well in train. WRD is chaired
by Mr Geoff Wynne, ICI's director of Merseyside operations, with active
support from British Oxygen, British Rail, British Waterways and the
Commission for the New Towns (CNT).
CNT's presence is helpful for two reasons. Not only does it own large tracts
of Halton's development land in the wake of the winding-up of
Warrington-Runcorn new town development corporation, but it is also a
government agency with a possible inside track in the competition.
What WRD wants is Pounds 5m a year for five years. The plan is to clean up
derelict or soon-to-be redundant land blighted by the chemical industry,
build new factories and offices so as to have premises ready to offer
incomers, and finish the replacement of Legoland with better housing.
Widnes' currently dreary waterfront - which could otherwise be a problem
when ICI withdraws from making Paraquat in the town as part of its
modernisation and restructuring - would figure prominently. Mr Gibaud says
it offers the opportunity to create a good quality industrial park with good
views.
'No one knows how ICI will evolve at Runcorn, where it makes chlorine and
faces problems,' he says. 'But we can't sit back and wait. We have to plan
for a post-ICI future in the next century.
'The way to overcome our poor image is not to spend money on promotion, but
to create a local climate and environment for new investment. If we can
demonstrate things are happening, we can build a new town on the back of
that.'
Ultimately, he hopes Widnes and Runcorn will become as attractive as
neighbouring Warrington was in the 1970s and 1980s. With development land at
Pounds 120,000 an acre compared with Pounds 150,000-Pounds 250,000 in
Warrington, early birds may well win some good prizes, especially if Halton
wins a City Challenge prize to make the place nicer.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (3): It's attractive, and not so far -
Why companies are relocating to the county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHESHIRE has done well in drawing in new industry because it has one of the
best combinations of the various factors involved in attracting foreign
investment and British company relocations.
Parts of the county were designated assisted areas by the British government
and qualified for aid from the European Community. Communications are
excellent. Labour is skilled and available. Land, factories and offices are
cheap, The quality of life is considered good, with nice houses in pretty
villages to live in and a lack of congestion in the main towns.
Mr David Collins, economic development officer at Cheshire County Council,
says that the county has become the fourth most popular choice of UK
locations after Scotland, Wales and the south-east, notably Kent.
In the past decade 400 companies have relocated or set up in Cheshire
including 200 foreign ones. YKK, the zip manufacturer, is thought to have
been the first major wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary when it was set up in
1972.
A more recent arrival is Sokkisha UK, which was established in 1987. A
subsidiary of Sokkisha of Japan, it manufactures high technology equipment
from builders' levels to satellite receivers and surveyors' software. It is
moving into a purpose-built 12,000 sq ft building on the 87-acre Crewe
business park. It will employ 20 people and chose the site after a long
search for an alternative to its current base in Crawley in Sussex.
For capital intensive companies the subsidy has been important. Runcorn and
Warrington were melded into one new town in 1981.
Apart from the government money poured into infrastructure, the two towns
were run by one New Town corporation with planning powers and some of
Runcorn qualified as part of the Merseyside development area and thus was
eligible for regional aid.
However, the New Town corporation came to an end in 1989, and the planning
powers were transferred to the relevant local authorities.
Chester and part of the north of the county around Halton (including
Runcorn) and Ellesmere Port still qualify for development assistance on a
reduced scale.
The other attractions have increasingly become important. Principal among
them is the good communications network. The county has the M56 and the M62
running through in a east-west direction and the M6 in a north-south one.
Around 15m people live within an hour's drive of the point where the M6
crosses the M62.
Mr Michael Aster, whose US company, Aster Publishing, set up its European
headquarters in Chester in 1984, says: 'I suppose one of the main
attractions is that you can be anywhere in three hours, in Scotland or in
London. Communications are very good. Also, you have Manchester airport just
20 minutes away.'
Manchester is now the country's third largest airport after London's
Heathrow and Gatwick airports. It has gateway status, which means over 40
airlines operate direct scheduled services to the US and Europe. There is
little of the congestion which has become a feature of both Gatwick and
Heathrow.
As well as good communications, Cheshire has factories and offices available
at competitive prices. B1 office/light industrial space typically costs
Pounds 11-13 a sq ft in Chester, although it can be as little as Pounds 8 a
sq ft. This compares with Pounds 15-18 a sq ft in Manchester. All eight
districts in the county have business parks of one kind or another, either
science parks or warehouse/distribution centres.
Warrington's marketing strategy has been based on good communications. It
claims that the motorways put it at the very centre of Britain.
In the interstices of the motorways, modern quality business space has been
built like the Birchwood science park, the Gemini science park and Winwick
Quay.
The county council and the new town corporation have made more than 500
acres available for industrial and commercial development in recent years.
The older business parks such as Birchwood and Gemini are virtually full.
One of the latest additions is the 153-acre Chester business park. This is
largely made up of B1 light industrial/office premises. The availability of
these modern quality buildings close to an attractive medieval town means
the county has been able to attract service companies and thus diversify its
economy.
Chester Park is about half full at the moment. Lettings were going well
until the recession. The county council's economic development unit says
there is a lot of interest, but it is not translating into definite lettings
in the harsh economic climate.
Probably the best-known financial service company to establish itself in the
county is Marks and Spencer Financial Services, which used to be called St
Michael Financial Services.
The company set up in Chester in 1984 when the company wanted to expand its
pilot credit card scheme in Scotland. Chester was chosen partly because it
was a development area and Marks and Spencer received a grant to help build
its offices.
The company, which deals with financial services including credit cards,
unit trusts and marketing, employs 567 people on a full-time or part-time
basis.
Mr Brian Hudspith, of Marks and Spencer, says: 'The company is very happy
with Chester. We have had no problems in finding the appropriate staff.'
Elsewhere, the Department of Employment has relocated people to Cheshire and
now employs 900 people at its centre in Runcorn.
Mr Aster, whose company publishes pharmaceutical magazines and other
scientific journals, says that the availability of good staff at reasonable
salaries is also an attraction.
'Apart from clerical staff, which is available, we are looking for people
who have graduated from one of the many educational institutions around
here. Typically they would have moved off to London and now want to come
back here because of quality of life available.'
He continues: 'I would say salaries are between 10 to 20 per cent lower than
London, but then so are costs. Chester is a very pleasant place in which to
live.'

FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (5): Dairy farming turns sour / A look at
the country's agricultural problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AROUND 170,000 hectares (408,000 acres), or 75 per cent of the rural areas,
of Cheshire are farmed in some way. The predominant agricultural activity is
dairy farming. Of the county's 4,500 farms, 53 per cent are dairy, compared
with a national average of 18 per cent. The county has a cattle and calf
population of 270,000, compared with 94,500 breeding ewes.
Of the other 47 per cent many are mixed farms, some of which have an element
of dairying.
In 1989 Cheshire produced 756m litres of milk, making it the third largest
dairy county in Britain after Devon (917m litres) and Somerset (796m).
According to Mr Robert Llewellyn at the Agricultural Development and
Advisory Service (Adas), the Cheshire plain is ideal dairying country. 'It
is bit like Ireland; grass grows very easily.'
Like other farming activities, dairying has been hit in recent years by the
slump in agriculture (though cereals have fared worse). Dairy farms have
suffered from a combination of EC quotas since the mid-1980s and a
continuing upward pressure on costs - high interest for any debt on land and
high input costs.
Figures supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food office
in Crewe show that, using 1982 as a base year of 100, incomes on dairy farms
in the county fell to 66 in 1985. They recovered a bit in 1987 and 1988 but
were down to 60 in 1990.
They are expected to be lower this year, and could fall further if EC
proposals for new price cuts are accepted.
The ministry estimates that average farm incomes in Cheshire are Pounds 790
a hectare. With the average size of a dairy farm in the county at 50
hectares, this gives an income of just under Pounds 40,000 a year. But net
incomes would vary considerably, of course, depending on the level of debt
and the number of employees. Around 11,000 people are employed in farming in
the county.
Inevitably, there is talk of diversification by farmers into other
activities such as tourism. Farmers are also looking at how they can add
value to their products - producing cheeses and yoghurt and so on.
There has been a squeeze on incomes. But there have not been significant
set-aside programmes. This is the government sponsored programme where
farmers receive compensation for taking land out of food production.
The ministry's figures show a total of 42 farmers from Cheshire have applied
for set-aside since 1988, either under the five-year programme or the
one-year scheme. The total land involved amounts to 877 hectares (2,104
acres).
Nationally, a total of 807 farmers are in the five-year set-aside scheme,
involving 29,000 hectares of land. It is possible to opt out of the
five-year programme after three years.
In 1991, a total of 890 farmers applied to be part of the one-year set-aside
scheme, involving 13,000 hectares.
Mr John Ford, public relations officer for the north-west region of the
National Farmers Union (which includes Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumbria)
says: 'Farmers in Cheshire, because of the emphasis on dairying, have done
rather better than our members elsewhere. The quotas meant that production
was cut but also that prices were stabilised. The numbers of farmers have
fallen in the past five years, but not greatly.
However, to farmers' existing woes a new worry has been added - the costs of
controlling agricultural pollution.
Agricultural pollution has become a particular issue in Cheshire, because,
although there are many many forms of waste creeping into the watercourses -
sheep dip, insecticides, herbicides, oil and diesel - some of the worst
pollutants are associated with dairying.
Milk itself is a very concentrated substance, and slurry and silage effluent
are particularly noxious pollutants. All three remove oxygen from the water
which means fish and other aquatic animals cannot survive. The water becomes
dead.
Cheshire comes within the catchment of the Mersey basin campaign. This is a
partly government-funded drive to clean up the watercourses in the Mersey
basin. The basin has been deemed the most badly polluted river in Britain
and one of the worst in Europe.
The National Rivers Authority was set up in 1989, when it was hived off from
the old water boards as a separate regulatory body. Its regional
headquarters are in Cheshire and it is active in the Mersey basin campaign.
It has brought a number of successful prosecutions against pollution
offenders. Some farmers have been prosecuted and this has tended to
emphasise agricultural pollution as an environmental issue in the area.
The NRA has been working with Adas to advise farmers on working methods. In
the 1960s and 1970s dairy herds were increased and farming practices changed
from keeping stock in cowsheds to the loose housing system of milking
parlours. This increased the dangers of liquid run-off entering drainage
systems, many of which had outlets to ditches and other watercourses.
Apart from advice on working practices, the ministry is also empowered to
give grants to farmers who want to set up waste handling schemes.
The local authorities in Cheshire, at county and district level are also
involved in environmental improvements. Officers at the county council
estimate that 15 per cent of farms in the county are now involved in waste
handling schemes.
The problem for the individual farmer is that - even with a grant - setting
up an effective treatment system can cost Pounds 60,000. At time when
incomes are being eroded, this can mean a considerable extra burden.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (4): Broad base for recovery - Chemicals
are at the heart of the county's industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE OTHER old industrial areas, Cheshire suffered decline in the recession
of the early 1980s. Unlike other parts of the north of England, Scotland and
Wales though, while manufacturing industries rationalised they did not
disappear altogether as they did in some steel, coal and shipbuilding towns.
The county thus had a firm broad base on which to build. At the heart of it
is the chemicals industry. Both ICI and Shell are present in the north of
Cheshire in some force.
ICI has been in Cheshire since its formation in 1926.
Brunner Mond, one of the four companies from which ICI was formed, has been
in Cheshire since 1873.
The original reason for the Cheshire location was the presence of vast
quantities of salt in the county. Salt in various forms is the basic
feedstock for a range of chemicals. Processes include the electrolysis of
brine for chlorine and caustic soda.
Although ICI Chemicals and Polymers is not exclusively involved with
salt-based products, as Mr Edward Brady, of ICI, puts it: 'In simple terms,
the salt-based products are made in Cheshire; petrochemicals are produced on
the other side of the country on Teesside.'
ICI Chemicals and Polymers employs around 5,500 people in Cheshire and
Merseyside, mostly at its main base in Runcorn. ICI also has a
pharmaceuticals division at Alderley Edge, in the prosperous eastern part of
the county near Macclesfield.
Shell UK also dates its involvement in Cheshire from the 1920s, although the
emphasis is on petrochemicals rather than salt-based products.
Mr Harold Bardsley, of Shell UK, says: 'The big expansion in Cheshire
started in the 1950s. Shell already had storage depots. In the 1950s
refining facilities were put in as consumption of oil and its products
expanded rapidly.'
Today Shell employs around 1,900 people at the main base in Stanlow and
another 1,000 throughout the county, including the new Shell Chemicals
headquarters in Chester.
Not only is Cheshire a chemicals base but the physical sciences are well
represented with British Nuclear Fuels, the Atomic Energy Agency and
National Nuclear Corporation all established in the county. British Nuclear
Fuels is a large employer with nearly 4,000 on the payroll. The AEA has
2,750 employees in a number of establishments, and the NNC some 1,700
workers.
Apart from ICI, other pharmaceutical concerns have been attracted to
Cheshire. Ciba-Geigy completed its headquarters move to Macclesfield in
1989, having had production facilities in the county, and the Wellcome
Foundation has a marketing and distribution operation in Crewe.
The county is well represented in engineering with Rolls-Royce Motors at
Crewe, and General Motors in the shape of Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port.
Vauxhall now employs 5,000 people. British Aerospace is just across the
border in Clwyd, Wales, but most of the workforce lives in Cheshire.
Since the early 1980s, using this industrial base, companies have been
attracted into the county in electronics, telecommunications, information
technology and motor components.
Electronics companies in Cheshire include Digital, Mercury
Telecommunications and ICL. The county council targeted electronics concerns
because it felt Cheshire had a pool of skilled labour that would chime in
well with such companies.
The companies were partly drawn by the assistance available because parts of
Cheshire were a development area but also because of the good communications
and the availability of labour and modern factories and offices.
In the second half of the 1980s the county council tried to diversify the
economy into such areas as financial services by encouraging the building of
quality business parks such as Chester Business Park, seen as a place where
white collar service companies would relocate.
Besides Shell Chemicals, Chester has become a headquarters for Marks and
Spencer Financial Services and the North West Securities Bank, part of the
Bank of Scotland.
Of the total workforce of 360,000, 29 per cent are employed in
manufacturing. This is above the national average of 24 per cent but low for
this corner of the country.
Around 61 per cent are employed in services, including the county council
and education and health. Between 1980 and 1988 there was an 83 per cent
rise in the numbers employed in the the finance, property and services
sector. By 1990 there were 51.000 employed in banking and finance and 74,000
in other services excluding distribution and catering.
A special effort was also made to encourage small businesses. The county
council set up 10 business generation centres in Cheshire. These centres
built small starter factories. Two thousand companies employing fewer than
50 people were established. Despite the recession the occupancy level of
these factories and workers is over 90 per cent.
Mr Michael Pitt, chief executive of Cheshire County Council says: 'We have
done well during the 1980s. Unemployment has been consistently in line with
the national average and well below the regional average.' At the end of
last year, unemployment was put at 7.8 per cent.
As the recession drags on, Cheshire like elsewhere is seeing its jobless
level creep up, and is developing one or two black spots.
Crewe is one cause for concern for the county authorities, since both
Rolls-Royce and Brel, the privatised British Rail engineering company, which
are based in the town, are experiencing difficulties.
Rolls-Royce Motors cut production in December in response to the continuing
steep fall in worldwide sales. Earlier in 1991 the company introduced a
three-day week for some workers.
Brewing is another industry where they has been rationalisation and job
losses.
Besides its black spots, Cheshire also has the problem of wide regional
variations in employment.
The county has the factories and offices in place and has the labour
available. It is a question of waiting for the recession to end before
further diversifying its economy.
Its communications should further improve with the opening of the Channel
tunnel. There is to be a passenger terminal at Crewe, the old railway town.
The county authorities are pushing hard for a freight terminal at Crewe
also.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (1): A tussle over growth - Though the
county outperforms much of the rest of the north in productivity levels,
both of the major parties in the area, in spite of government opposition,
favour new developments within the green belt near Chester to ensure
economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is trying to stop market forces doing quite as well as they
should in Cheshire, a small corner of England next door to North Wales. The
county is falling victim to its own success.
A row is boiling up about 800 acres of green belt near Chester, which both
the Conservative and Labour parties on the county council want for economic
development. The Liberal Democrats are against.
So is the government at present, on the grounds that denying Chester will
force investment into Merseyside, Cheshire's underperforming neighbour.
Majority local opinion is that the government has failed to understand the
precarious nature of Cheshire's success and its patchiness. In any event,
can you make Merseyside richer by making Cheshire poorer?
Part of the problem is the county's image. Much of it is bucolic, dotted
with ancient halls, old black-and-white timber-framed houses, the remnants
of two royal forests, country pubs, villages with upmarket boutiques and
antique shops, gourmet restaurants, country house hotels, BMWs, Mercedes
estate cars, Range Rovers, Land Rover Discoveries and Mitsubishi Shoguns.
This is the Surrey-of-the-north, where house prices in villages near
Macclesfield rival those of the south-east and have held up better in the
recession. It is also a county that outperforms much of the rest of north in
productivity levels and value added in manufacturing - but mainly because it
has a large concentration of capital-intensive chemical industry.
It is a place where many people in Greater Manchester and Merseyside want to
live. The population grew nearly 3 per cent in the 1980s. Though much was
the forced growth of Warrington New Town in the former no-man's-land between
Liverpool and Manchester, there was a steady gain of up to 2 per cent in
five of Cheshire's other seven districts.
Numbers will probably pass the 1m mark by the end of the century. In
Chester's case, the workforce is forecast to grow by more than 7 per cent in
the next 10 years, so the city and district will need more jobs.
Cheshire's most recent success is Vauxhall Motors at Ellesmere Port. This
once had the hallmarks of a branch factory forced into place by government
regional policy. An underskilled workforce and poor equipment confined its
goods to the less critical domestic market.
Now, Pounds 150m in new investment - plus Pounds 200m over three years for
an engine plant - has given General Motors one of its best plants in Europe.
Vauxhall is at present building up production of the new Astra, 35 per cent
of which will be exported. This year's output of 138,000 cars is assured,
rising to 145,000 next year.
'People have made all the difference,' says Mr Nick Reilly, the man in
charge. 'We have better training. There is more awareness of quality. We run
in teams, with team leaders responsible for quality.'
However, the factory also runs with only 4,700 people, compared with 11,000
in 1980. It is this sort of fall-out that has to be absorbed elsewhere - and
in a county where people are arriving all the time.
Another success is the Manchester Ship Canal. Although Manchester's dockland
has been transformed into a village called Salford Quays, Cheshire's is
still a string of working wharves, terminals and docks along the canal
between Ellesmere Port and Warrington.
The abolition of the national dock labour scheme in 1989 transformed
productivity and profitability. Bulk traffic includes containers, chemicals,
timber, foodstuffs and even draught Guinness.
In the south of the county, Foden was the first UK truck manufacturer to
reach the BS5750 quality standard and is producing a series of new,
award-winning 17-tonners at Sandbach. Paccar, its US owner, has just spent
Pounds 4.5m on a new headquarters and engineering centre there, relocating
its European office from Brussels in the process.
In the east, Siemens has burst at the seams in Congleton and has opened
another centre just over the county boundary near Manchester Airport, an
economic engine that does not recognise boundaries and drives growth in
Cheshire's Macclesfield district as much as in southern half of Greater
Manchester.
Warrington, only 20 minutes away from the airport by motorway, has also
benefited. Its two science parks are full. The headquarters of British
Nuclear Fuels - a major buyer of technologically-based design and
engineering services - is the most notable presence.
Motorways have made the centre of Cheshire into the centre of Britain from a
time-to-travel standpoint. About 95 per cent of the population is within a
half-day's travel, so distribution and warehousing companies have mushroomed
at Warrington, creating thousands of jobs.
Office rents in Wilmslow, next door to the airport but in Cheshire, are the
north-west's highest. The move there from Manchester city centre of Refuge
Assurance four years ago confirmed the area's prestige.
However, all this has caused an east-west divide, for Cheshire has generally
done better where it borders Greater Manchester than where it borders
Merseyside.
Widnes and Runcorn comprise Halton district, which borders Liverpool and
Knowsley, and have enough urban problems to qualify for City Challenge
regeneration funding from the government. The district of Ellesmere Port and
Neston - sandwiched between Chester and Wirral, another Merseyside borough -
is depopulating faster than anywhere else in Cheshire.
The staple industry of these two districts is chemicals, with ICI, Shell and
Associated Octel contributing to a forest of columns, chimneys and plant
along the southern bank of the ship canal from Ellesmere Port to Runcorn.
Shell's investment in its Stanlow refinery alone is more than Pounds 1bn.
Politicised environmentalism is taking its toll, with tougher legislation
and enforcement leading to fines for pollution, including Pounds 1m on Shell
for a broken pipeline.
Public confidence in the industry has not been reassured by a series of
alerts and mishaps, including leaks of toxic gases and chemicals and an
explosion and fire, in the last two years. Uncertainty therefore clouds the
industry's future and no one is predicting growth in jobs.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Pitt, Cheshire's chief executive, points to growing
worries about the recession's effect on Crewe, where Rolls-Royce Motors and
Brel, the rail locomotive engineers, are large employers.
He says Cheshire is going to need all the new development it can get. 'There
is a good case for more incursion into the green belt. Both the
Conservatives and the Labour party believe the government is getting it
wrong,' he says.
The land involved is within the new ring road which by- passes Chester to
the south. This road not only links with the M56 and M53 to the north and
east, but with a new dual carriageway to Wrexham - only 10 miles from
Chester to the south - and with the upgraded road to the North Wales coast
to the west.
Welsh local authorities support Chester's expansion because it will help its
re-emergence as a sub-regional centre. Indeed, the economic and social
forces involved take no account of the English-Welsh border, however wide
the gulf between the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office.
A new tunnel at Conwy puts Anglesey only 90 minutes from Chester, while much
of north-east Wales is now within easy commuting distance of Manchester. The
local view is that if Cheshire cannot be looked at in isolation from
Merseyside, why should it be isolated from Wales, now a more important
long-term neighbour, especially with the Toyota plant on Chester's boundary
with Shotton?
Manweb, the electricity supplier, sees the Chester-Wrexham-Deeside area as
part of a steady long-term development, in which its commercial sales to
offices will grow at 4 per cent a year, compared with 2 per cent for
industrial usage and 1 per cent on the domestic front, with Cheshire and
North Wales continuing to compensate for Merseyside decline.
Mr Les Rogerson, the county council's group director of environmental
services, sums up the majority local feeling: 'We question whether the
government understands what kind of county Cheshire is.
'The image is rural, with black-and-white houses and black-and-white cows,
but 60 per cent of people live in towns and 20 per cent live in smaller
places like Knutsford. We are trying to ensure economic growth in parts of
Cheshire that need it. Stopping development here will not push it into
Merseyside. It will probably go to Germany.'

ABOUT 50 Portuguese students and human rights campaigners were expected to
leave Lisbon by boat last night for Dili, the East Timor capital, in a
voyage designed to draw world attention to Indonesia's rule of Portugal's
former colony.
Departure was due as soon as ship's documents were cleared. The Lusitania
Expresso's voyage will take about a month, stopping at Darwin to pick up 50
more campaigners. The organisers want to put a wreath in Dili's cemetery,
scene of a massacre of civilians by Indonesian soldiers last November. An
Indonesian inquiry recently said 50 people were killed when the army opened
fire on mourners, but other estimates put the death toll at up to 100.
East Timor was abandoned by Portugal in 1975 and invaded by Indonesia
shortly after. Jakarta's annexation of the territory was never recognised by
the UN. Since then, widespread human rights abuses have been reported. Human
rights organisations estimate that up to 200,000 East Timorese may have died
from war and famine. Portugal is pressing its EC partners to take action
against Indonesia. The voyage to Darwin is likely to embarrass the
Australian government, which has signed oil-search pacts with Jakarta.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE head of the UN peace-keeping operation due to be launched in Cambodia
said yesterday it was short of money needed to implement peace accords, and
raising more cash would not be easy, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
'It is true we have a shortfall in our budget and getting the funding
approved for Untac (United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia) will
not be easy,'' Mr Yasushi Akashi, a Japanese diplomat, said, on arrival in
Phnom Penh on a fact-finding tour.
Under peace accords signed by rival Cambodian factions on October 23, Untac,
numbering several thousand military and civilian personnel, is to supervise
a ceasefire, the disarmament of four armies, and help administer the country
while arranging free elections envisaged for 1993. So far, only a small
advance UN military and civilian operation is in place.
Mr Akashi said he hoped Untac could be deployed before May, but acknowledged
problems did exist. Since the Cold War ended, the UN had had to undertake
many new operations. 'New peace-keeping operations are launched and the
payments of member states for these leaves something to be desired,' he
added.
He would try to hasten the approval of an initial Dollars 200m (Pounds
111.7m) budget for Untac. 'But I am sure that more will be required later.
This is an enormously complex project, probably unprecedented in the UN's
history.'
Full cost of the operation is expected to be more than Dollars 1bn. Also
facing funding difficulties is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' plan
to repatriate 370,000 Cambodian refugees from Thailand. Diplomats say big
problems exist in persuading UN member states to commit necessary funds for
Cambodia.

FT  23 JAN 92 / Turkey rules out closure of loss-making companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S new economics minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, yesterday ruled out early
closure of loss-making state companies. She said such a decision would
require consensus in parliament and among the Turkish public.
Rejecting criticism of her new programme as too cautious, Mrs Ciller said it
was necessary for the coalition government to seek consensus.
Businessmen and economists are worried that without more radical measures it
will not be possible to curb the public sector deficit, the main cause of
persistently high inflation. The deficit is running at more than 11 per cent
of GNP.
Mrs Ciller, an academic economist with no previous experience of government,
has had a testing time since the formation of the coalition in November
between her conservative True Path party and the Social Democrats who are
less enthusiastic about market reforms.
Mrs Ciller last week announced the formation of a new independent
privatisation agency to be staffed by businessmen and academics. However she
conceded yesterday that the future of the loss-making enterprises which
account for the main part of the deficit, was 'still vague'.
These include Zonguldak, the state coal company which alone employs 50,000
people. On the revenue side, the minister predicted that tax reform would
generate an increase of between TL10,000bn to TL21,000bn (Dollars
1.86bn-Dollars 3.9bn) in 1992. Legislation to increase the effective
corporation tax from 10 per cent to between 23 and 30 per cent was ready to
go before parliament. However she said many of the proposed tax measures
would only take effect at the end of 1993.
Turkey and Russia have agreed to co-operate rather than compete over newly
independent central Asian republics, the foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin
said yesterday, Reuter adds from Istanbul.
Turkey is pushing to expand economic ties with many former Soviet republics,
especially the Moslem republics of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kirgizia,
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
It would like to act as a bridge between the west and a region where it has
ethnic, religious and cultural ties, but denies any ambition to create a
pan-Turkic sphere of influence.
Mr Cetin said Russia would take over Soviet contracts to supply natural gas
to Turkey.

GERMANY'S treaty of good neighbourliness with Czechoslovakia, delayed in
ratification by conservative German demands for recognition of property
claims in the former Sudetenland, will be signed by Bonn unchanged before
the end of February.
The decision marks a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, his foreign minister, in facing down a threatened revolt by the
Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), junior partners in the ruling
coalition.
The argument and delay had threatened to irritate relations with
Czechoslovakia, where Germany is by far the largest foreign investor.
But the CSU won a sop yesterday with the agreement of its coalition partners
to adopt a German parliament resolution to strengthen the property claims of
former Sudeten Germans, without affecting the text of the treaty.
The treaty itself makes no provision for any outstanding property claims,
recognising the territorial integrity of Czechoslovakia, and the
inviolability of its borders.
Under the present restitution law in Czechoslovakia, property confiscated
before 1948, when the communists took power, cannot be given back. to former
owners. This has angered the 2.5m Sudeten Germans expelled from
Czechoslovakia in 1945, mainly because their former properties are now being
auctioned to local citizens under a small-scale privatisation programme.
It is still unclear what the German parliamentary resolution will say,
although Mr Genscher's Free Democrats (FDP) are equally determined it will
do nothing to alter the 'spirit or meaning' of the treaty, let alone its
text.
Bavaria, homeland of the CSU, is also the German state where the majority of
former Sudeten Germans moved after World War II. They have since campaigned
for property restitution, and see the new friendship treaty as a serious
blow to their hopes.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and CSU leader, has backed what he calls
the 'justified demands of the Sudeten Germans'. But Mr Kohl and Mr Genscher
have been more concerned to put German-Czechoslovak relations on a friendly
footing, especially in light of Germany's rapidly reviving economic
interests there.

FT  22 JAN 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Institutions face Pounds 200m
losses on MCC shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 23rd January 1992) appended to this article.
SOME OF the UK's leading pension funds and insurance groups together face
losses of up to Pounds 200m on their investments in Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
They may now take legal advice about whether they could recover some losses
on the grounds that there was a false market in the shares.
Despite growing worries about MCC's financial state, 20 per cent of the
company was still in the hands of two dozen blue chip institutions and about
2,000 individuals when the Maxwell empire collapsed.
The other 80 per cent is now controlled by banks who took the shares as
security for loans to Mr Maxwell's private companies.
Mr Maxwell had secretly breached the Stock Exchange's 75 per cent ceiling on
ownership of quoted companies, and the Serious Fraud Office is investigating
whether he illegally bought MCC shares to support the share price.
The suspension price of 35p values MCC at Pounds 226m, but the shares are
almost certainly worthless.
Most institutions would have invested between 150p and 200p per share - the
range in recent years - and face big losses.
Several have said they may follow some of the banks in taking legal advice
on whether they can recover some of the value of the shares.
Legal &amp; General, the insurance giant which holds 2.5m of the shares, said
'We are watching with interest to see if investigators establish that there
was a false market in the shares.'
L&amp;G would not disclose its losses, but they are believed to be over Pounds
3m. The company said the MCC shares were held in the Pounds 2bn pooled index
fund, for which the loss was not significant.
Other MCC shareholders are the pension funds of the Post Office, National
Westminster Bank, Barclays Bank, IBM UK, British Airways, British Aerospace,
Scottish Power, Rover Group and Rolls Royce staff.
Institutions contacted all held the MCC shares in index funds, which track
the performance of indices such as the FT-A All-Share Index.
Several fund managers commented that 'regrettably' the strict specifications
of these funds did not allow them to exclude index stocks from portfolios
even when they were concerned about the company.
Correction (published 23rd January 1992).
The pension funds of British Aerospace and Barclays are no longer
shareholders in Maxwell Communication Corporation, as reported in
yesterday's Financial Times. They sold their shares before trading was
suspended last November.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Questions over the Maxwell pension funds: A look at the
issues of trustee vigilance and responsibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For anyone running or contributing to a UK pension fund, the Maxwell saga
raises some worrying questions. Perhaps surprisingly, the most disconcerting
lessons are not the way in which Mr Robert Maxwell appears to have looted
pension fund assets, but the way in which he may have manipulated the funds
to his own advantage, perfectly legally.
By April 1990, for example, more than half the 20 largest investments in the
Mirror Group Newspapers pension fund were in companies which had some
connection with Mr Maxwell and his own private interests. Those investments
represented roughly 20 per cent of the fund's total.
From 1985, when Mirror Group Newspapers first came under Mr Maxwell's
control, the pension fund evidenced a striking transformation from a fund
whose largest investments were almost exclusively UK blue chip companies to
a fund in which none of the 20 largest investments fell into that category.
So the central question is: in the period before assets began to disappear,
were the funds being run in the best interests of beneficiaries or in the
best interests of Mr Maxwell? And even if the pattern of investment did make
large profits for the fund, did it expose it to undue risk?
For instance, in the year to April 1990, the pension fund's investments in
overseas unquoted equities - the most volatile and risky category - rose to
Pounds 32.1m, roughly 8 per cent of total investments.
Investments in unquoted UK companies also rose sharply to Pounds 8.4m from
Pounds 1.7m in 1989. Overall, overseas investments totalled roughly Pounds
160m out of Pounds 422m in total investments. That ratio is roughly double
the exposure of a typical UK pension fund to overseas investments.
But it is the composition of the 20 largest investments that would normally
have caused trustees to question the investment managers, according to Mr
Robin Ellison, partner at pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp and a member
of the Occupational Pensions Board.
'None of these investments was out of the ordinary for a pension fund,' Mr
Westhorp said. 'But the overall picture raises many questions.'
The fund's holdings include a Pounds 20.2m holding in Maxwell Communication
Corporation (MCC). Other - private - Maxwell companies in the list are a
Pounds 7.2m holding of the loan stock of Official Airline Guides, a
subsidiary of MCC. It also held a Pounds 2.7m stake in Quebecor, an
associate company of Mirror Group Newspapers.
The fund also held Pounds 5.4m of First Tokyo Investment Trust, an
investment trust managed by London and Bishopsgate International Investment
Management. This was a subsidiary of Headington Holdings, a company
controlled by Mr Maxwell.
Also in the fund are stakes in two privately-owned French investment
companies, Euris and Marceau Investissements totalling Pounds 17.1m and
Pounds 7.1m respectively. The two companies were involved in an unsuccessful
effort to secure control of Societe Generale, the French bank, in late 1988,
a move said to have had the backing of France's socialist government and the
government-controlled bank Caisse des Depots.
At the time, Mr Maxwell was reported to have been one of a group of
investors who co-operated in purchasing shares, while Caisse des Depots was
reported to have purchased a stake in MCC. Caisse des Depots was on the MCC
share register at the time of the Maxwell group's collapse.
Mr Maxwell may have encouraged the MGN pension fund to take a stake in
Societe Generale on his behalf. Indeed, the MGN pension fund accounts for
the year ended April 5, 1989 - the period covering the raid on Societe
Generale's shares - show that the fund's second largest investment at that
date was a Pounds 16.9m stake in Societe Generale. By 1990, the stake had
disappeared from the pension fund's 20 largest investments, but Marceau
Investissements and Euris had appeared in its place.
Maxwell-related investments had begun earlier. In 1986, the pension fund
records its first significant Maxwell-related investment, a Pounds 2.2m
stake in BPCC which the accounts note is 'related to the employer'.
Subsequently, BPCC's name was changed to Maxwell Communication Corporation.
By April 1990 the fund had acquired two other Maxwell-related holdings: a
Pounds 3.3m stake in Hollis, a company controlled by the Liechtenstein-based
Maxwell Trust; and a Pounds 3.6m holding of Hollis's convertible loan stock.
Hollis later became Pergamon AGB and a Pounds 3.6m stake in that company is
recorded in the fund's April 1989 accounts.
Pensions experts say that there is nothing illegal about any of these
holdings. However, Mr Ellison notes general trust law forbids trustees from
dealing directly or indirectly with the pension fund unless the trust deed
specifically allows it.
'Trustees have three obligations,' Mr Ellison said. 'The first is to
diversify investments, the second is to avoid exposing beneficiaries to
undue risk and the third is to act reasonably.'
When a fund invests in entities connected with a trustee, the board of
trustees should normally question the pattern of investment, and seek
independent valuations. Trustees should also question any significant
departures from normal patterns of asset allocation, and any unusual
investment decisions - such as weighting the portfolio heavily in unquoted
overseas investments.
The trustee in the case of the Mirror fund was a corporate entity, MGPT Ltd,
chaired by Mr Maxwell. Just what steps the other board members of MGPT took
to explore these issues remains unclear, according to Mr Paul Stannard, of
Travers Smith Braithwaite, the solicitors advising the new MGN pension
trustees. 'These are questions that we are seeking answers to,' he says.

FT  22 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS in the underlying stock market, a lower Wall Street and technical
trading conspired to depress recent high premiums on FT-SE futures
yesterday.
On the Liffe, the March contract opened at a strong premium of 46 points
above the underlying market against its estimated fair value - the premium
which allows for dividend flow and financing costs on the underlying Footsie
stocks - of 22.
March ticked up a little first thing and then, a heavy programme trade
weighted to the sell side in the cash market, brought it back from a high of
2,604. It reached a low shortly afterwards as a result of a sell order in a
thin market.
But, in the afternoon, the decline on Wall Street affected sentiment and
just before the close traders, who earlier bought the contract on its
relative cheapness, rushed to sell out and straighten their books. At the
official close, March was 2,577, a premium of 44, with some 5,600 contracts
traded. It continued lower in after-hours' trading to reach 2,563.
In LTOM, turnover of 21,569 lots was significantly down on the previous day.
Asda was the busiest stock option with 1,392 contracts traded. FT-SE Index
options were active.

FT  22 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAT loses ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of conglomerate BAT Industries was affected by a profits downgrade
from one securities house and a change of stance from another. The shares
were 7 down before recovering to close a net 5 off at 638p on turnover of
2.3m.
The shares, which stood at 765p last July, have been depressed by heavy
losses at BAT's insurance subsidiary Eagle Star. The latter was behind
yesterday's forecast cut. Mr Nyren Scott-Malden of Barclays de Zoete Wedd
downward revised his 1991 estimate by Pounds 30m to Pounds 1.05bn, with
Pounds 20m of that figure representing the estimated impact on Eagle of the
weak UK stock market in the fourth quarter.
Although remaining a buyer of the stock, Mr Scott-Malden has also cut his
1992 estimate by Pounds 50m from Pounds 1.5bn to reflect shifting exchange
rates.
Further, Mr Bruce Davidson of Smith New Court changed his stance to a hold
from a buy, arguing that: 'The yield on BAT is now in line with the lowest
of the UK composites.'
Inchcape firm
International services and marketing group Inchcape gained ground shortly
before the close of trading. It announced that the European Community had
approved its Pounds 382m purchase of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the vehicle
sales, distribution, transport and storage and tyre services concern.
The announcement was expected and the shares were already firm but they
moved forward another 3 on the news to close 12 ahead at 438p, an all-time
high. The partly-paid shares gained 23 to 279p. After the second instalment
of 151p is taken into consideration they are now at a discount of only 8 to
the fully-paid shares.
News of an encouraging gas discovery by an Arco-led consortium in block
44/18 in the North Sea triggered a flurry of support for the UK quoted
participants in the find: Goal Petroleum, which has a 15 per cent stake, and
Clyde Petroleum, with a 25 per cent interest. Clyde edged up 2 to 78p and
the former rose 4 to 60p.
Lasmo moved ahead 7 to 255p on heavy turnover of 3.6m, with much of the
demand emanating from Smith New Court. The broker published a detailed
document on Lasmo, labelling the shares a buy.
Mr Alan Sinclair, exploration and production specialist at Smith, described
Lasmo as a strong buy and said the company had made an excellent acquisition
in Ultramar which had transformed Lasmo from what was becoming a somewhat
depressing story of lack of growth.
British Gas was active (5.5m shares traded) and held at 246p after reports
that the group could be considering floating off its gas marketing
operations. BP firmed 1 1/2 to 293p as the market responded to news that
Saudi Arabia is reducing crude oil output by 100,000 barrels a day. The
Saudi move follows output cuts by Libya and Algeria.
Volatility in Glaxo was caused by continuing good news on the product front
contrasted by US selling.
The shares were off 12 in the morning but recovered to show a slim gain
after the company announced that it had won a UK product licence for one of
its hypertension drugs, Lacipil. However, continued unloading of the
American Depositary Receipts on Wall Street depressed the London shares
again and they closed 5 down at 859p with 5.5m traded.
Fisons put on 5 to 358p ahead of today's research and development
presentation. The company is expected to discuss two of its drugs, and the
feeling among analysts is that the company is bound to try and come up with
some good news to offset the recent negative comment.
Smith New Court placed nearly 2.2m shares in London International Group in
the market at 287p apiece. LIG firmed 2 to 292p on 6.4m share volume.
London &amp; Manchester fell 22 to 263p after revealing unexpected provisions
against commercial property for the year of Pounds 17m before tax, and a
dividend held at 9.144p. The news caught the market by surprise. An analyst
commented: 'I do not think anyone had contemplated anything of this nature.'
The announcement pushed other life insurers down on fears of similar
adjustments, Prudential losing 4 1/2 to 234p and Legal &amp; General, on a large
turnover of 2.3m, dipping 5 to 373p.
There was turbulence in the telecoms sector. Cable and Wireless dropped 17
to 589p on rumours that proposed merger talks with AT&amp;T, of the US, had been
called off and might not resume until after the UK general election.
Vodafone came under increased pressure, retreating 17 to 589p as the market
continued to digest Monday's share placing and also remained depressed by
disappointing figures, released recently, on new subscribers. Interest
switched to Securicor Group, up 45 at 738p, and its associated shares,
Securicor 'A', 23 stronger at 565p, and Security Services, 25 ahead at 455p,
partly on greater confidence in Cellnet, the rival cellular phone system in
which it has a 40 per cent stake.
Word that British Steel was experiencing disappointing sales on strip
products since increasing prices at the start of the year failed to have
much effect on the shares, which eased a half-penny to 75 1/2 p.
Bass was 20p lower at one stage on nervousness about a possible profits
warning being made at the company's annual meeting today. Last year's
meeting produced a significant profits warning that triggered a sharp fall
in the share price. However, the stock picked up from yesterday's initial
weakness to close just 5 off at 1092p.
There was more overseas selling of PowerGen and National Power - from Japan
and the US - which left the electricity generators off 2 at 136 1/2 p and 3
at 146p respectively. Volume was a relatively heavy 6.1m and 7.1m.
RTZ finished 6 higher at 539p, continuing a recent rise on technical factors
and in sympathy with recovery in cyclical stocks.
Lonrho gained a penny to 165p in active trading ahead of annual results due
tomorrow. There has been speculation that the group might cut its dividend.
Continuing bearish sentiment in British Aerospace left the stock 16 weaker
at 286p after brisk turnover of 5.7m. Monday's news of the resignation of
the finance director and possible property provisions again acted against
the shares. There was also renewed gloom in the market over the lack of news
forthcoming on BAe's Saudi defence contract.
Adverse dollar movements pushed Tomkins, the engineering group, down 10 to
435p.
A negative review of UK economic prospects by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew prompted a
selective downgrade of its leisure stocks. Analyst Mr Paul Heath said: 'We
estimate an increase in consumer spending of just 0.2 per cent in 1992,
which will have widescale implications for the leisure sector.'
Hotel group Forte's 1992 profits have been shaved Pounds 15m to Pounds 135m,
Queens Moat Houses' lowered Pounds 5m to Pounds 100m and Ladbroke's reduced
Pounds 20m to Pounds 230m. Rank Organisation, which is due to report
shortly, and Granada Group, recently revised by UBS, escaped the review.
Forte slipped a penny to 235 1/2 p, Queens Moat added the same amount at 74p
and Granada put on 4 to 217p, while Ladbroke eased 2 to 224p, as did Rank,
at 633p.
Market opinion shifted on Associated British Ports, where worries about
property provisions had recently pulled the price down. The stock rallied 12
to 341p.
Meyer International saw further profit-taking and closed 10 down at 401p.
However, Wolseley, one of the favoured stocks in the builders merchants
sector, added 6 at 416p.
Blue Circle Industries was among the market's so-called bid favourites
yesterday but the absence of any takeover news saw the shares relinquish 2
to 257p.
Hanson lost 2 1/2 to 211 1/2 p as investors switched from convertible to
ordinary shares. Turnover was a busy 10m.
Food retailer Asda closed slightly easier at 36p after telling customers to
return a range of garlic dips because glass fragments had been found in
containers.
A fresh slide in Ratners was accentuated by its decision to suspend payment
of its preference shares. The stock fell 4 1/2 p or more than 18 per cent to
20p, following a decline of 2 1/2 the previous day.

FT  22 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market falters after early gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN about the strength of the long hoped for upturn in the UK economy,
political worries and disappointment at the performance of the two key
overseas markets - Wall Street and Tokyo - took the shine off an early good
showing by UK equities.
Adding to a general feeling of anti-climax around London's dealing desks was
the continued absence of the strongly rumoured bid for one of the leading UK
stocks and a sharp downturn in the Footsie futures market. The latter has
been instrumental in leading the primary market sharply higher in recent
sessions.
Overall activity in London, however, was substantially higher as a healthy
two-way pull developed among the leading trading houses.
The FT-SE 100-share index moved up strongly at the outset, peaking at
2,561.6, up 16.7, some 40 minutes after the opening of business, but
thereafter came under modest but persistent downward pressure to close a net
1.5 down at 2,543.4.
Early trading in equities was highlighted by a general mark-up of some of
London's so-called takeover favourites. The initial strength was also
encouraged by an early spurt in the Footsie future, which moved to a
50-point premium over the cash market and well ahead of the fair value mark
which allows for dividend flow and financing costs of the underlying stocks.
The widespread rises in the blue chips, however, proved short-lived. A
series of heavy programme trades, a flurry of institutional selling orders
in both the future and the cash markets and a slightly disappointing opening
by Wall Street took the wind out of the market's sails.
Responding quickly to the pressure, the Footsie went into reverse and dipped
to register the day's low point - a 4.9 decline at 2,540.0 - immediately the
depressed money supply and bank lending figures were made public. Thereafter
the market moved narrowly. The Footsie future settled at a premium of 34
over the cash market.
Dealers noted at least three, and possibly more, hefty trading programmes,
one weighted heavily on the sell side and two more said to have been evenly
spread across the range of blue chips.
The programmes gave a big boost to market turnover, which picked up
significantly to reach 619.4m shares. This compared with Monday's 418.2m
shares and last Friday's 687.2m.
Another market depressant was a suggestion that one of the leading brokerage
houses had prepared a bearish note on the UK economy and downgraded its
Footsie estimates.
Oil shares attracted keen interest, with the 'majors' responding to recent
broker buy notes and tending to ignore yesterday's dip in crude oil prices,
which occurred in spite of news that Saudi Arabia proposes to cut its crude
oil output by 100,000 barrels a day. This comes hard on the heels of news
that Iran and Algeria have implemented output reductions.
Dealers were intrigued at the rumours of an imminent and sizeable bid for
one of the big UK stocks but no news emerged.
Food retailers responded to a broker buy recommendation, while Smith New
Court, London's 'bought-deal specialist', was said to have carried out a big
trade in London International Group.

FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking and stock
rotation dominate trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
PROFIT-TAKING and switching between sectors continued to exact a toll on US
stock markets yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.64 off at 3,223.39 and the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 3.72 to 412.64. Over-the-counter
stocks also succumbed to profit-taking, the Nasdaq composite index falling
14.51 to 604.87. New York SE turnover was 219m shares and declines led rises
by 1,186 to 569.
There has been no discernible shift in underlying market sentiment in recent
days, and the dominant trends of the past week - profit-taking and
rotational trading - were still in place yesterday.
The two trends are linked; investors take profits in sectors which look
overbought, and switch into sectors which look cheap and offer potential for
bigger gains. Although the headline numbers show a decline, little money
actually leaves the market.
Among individual stocks, fourth-quarter figures proved the biggest influence
on price movements. Wells Fargo dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 65 on
announcing a quarterly loss of Dollars 231m after making Dollars 700m of
loan-loss provisions, made primarily to cover real estate losses.
The two other big California-based banks, BankAmerica and Security Pacific
(which also reported a final quarter loss) slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
38 7/8 and Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 respectively.
United Technologies dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 after unveiling big
fourth-quarter losses, taken after a Dollars 1.275bn restructuring charge
and a Dollars 256m charge for increases in environmental reserves, both of
which were higher than expectations. The group announced plans to shed
13,900 jobs and close down or consolidate 100 facilities.
Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottling company for the big soft drinks
group, receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 14 3/8 after the company said it
would make a Dollars 152m restructuring charge and a Dollars 15m addition to
its insurance reserve during the fourth quarter. The charge, and revised
1991 earnings, mean that Coca-Cola Enterprises will announce a full-year
loss of about 79 cents a share when it unveils its results next month.
Revived rumours of possible bid interest from Jacuzzi, a Hanson subsidiary,
lifted Eljer Industries Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 . The stock was also
buoyed by speculation that the company may be close to negotiating more
favourable loan covenant settlements with its banks.
Leading over-the-counter stocks suffered at the hands of the profit-takers.
Apple retreated Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 , Microsoft gave up Dollars
3 1/8 to Dollars 119 3/8 , Amgen slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 66 1/4 and
Borland International, which reported a 10 per cent gain in fiscal
third-quarter net income, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 70 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks suffered a setback and ended at the day's worst on
profit-taking and nervousness over Ontario Premier Bob Rae's speech
scheduled for last night. Banks fell sharply on fears that Mr Rae would
somehow raise taxes for financial institutions.
The composite index surrendered 35.2 at 3,620.4. Declines led advances by
356 to 274 after volume of 31.7m shares (30.5m).
Alcan fell CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 24 1/4 . Traders said Kidder Peabody
downgraded the company's shares to a hold from a buy. On Monday Alcan
reported a 1991 loss of 25 cents per share.

FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent gets support from
firmer bond prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRMER bond markets in the D-Mark bloc supported some bourses yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT met profit-taking as the DAX index tested 1,700. It reached an
intraday high of 1,698.14 but closed more soberly at 1,685.29, up 8.12,
after a gain of 10.14 to 687.20 for the FAZ at midsession.
Volume climbed from DM6.5bn to DM9.5bn. In the early going the stock market
was supported by firmer prices in the German bond market, where the
Bundesbank's average bond yield dropped another 8 basis points to 8.03 per
cent. Banks saw the benefit, Commerzbank rising DM3.50 to DM261 and Dresdner
by DM5.50 to DM354.
There was no outcome, during the session or in the post-bourse, to the pay
talks between the steel industry and its employees. The sector weakened
after its recent gains, Klockner-Werke dropping DM3 to DM116; other sectors
on the move included retailers on the downgrade, and constructions improving
with Bilfinger &amp; Berger DM20 higher at DM970.
PARIS came off the day's high but still closed firmer as dealers started to
square positions ahead of the liquidation of the January account tomorrow.
The CAC 40 index went as high as 1,878.27 before closing at 1,867.91, up
2.06, in turnover estimated between FFr2.6-2.7bn after Monday's FFr2.7bn.
BSN dropped FFr45 or 3.9 per cent to FFr1,109 with 229,960 shares traded, as
the market took the view that a bid from the Agnelli family was unlikely
before the Cob made a decision on the recent sale of Perrier treasury stock
to Saint Louis, an Agnelli ally.
Thomson-CSF lost FFr6 or 3.8 per cent to FFr150.50 with 223,100 shares
traded on reports that the government was considering merging the company
with Aerospatiale, the state-owned aircraft group. Analysts said the Airbus
crash on Monday night also weighed on Thomson, which is partially
responsible for the avionics in the aircraft.
MILAN fell for the second day as investors started an uneasy vigil for
Fiat's 1991 operating profit details. The letter to shareholders had been
expected today, but analysts said its release had been delayed until January
28. The Comit index, which failed to break through 550 during the recent
rally, lost 6.29 to 539.96 in provisional turnover of L120bn after Monday's
L103.5bn.
Among industrials, Fiat fell L164 to L5,175 and lost another L15 in
after-hours trading. Pirelli dropped L42 or 3.4 per cent to L1,180 following
Monday's marathon extraordinary meeting during which shareholders accused
the management of mismanagement and withholding information in a failed bid
for Germany's Continental. However, the L518.6bn capital increase was
approved.
ZURICH mirrored Frankfurt with a firmer bond market. The all-share SPI index
added 5.1 to 1,110.4 after peaking earlier at 1,113.6.
Saurer, the textile machinery and metallurgy group, climbed SFr200 to
SFr1,850 ahead of a press conference tomorrow. EMS-Chemie bearers added
SFr80 to SFr5,050 after the company said that it planned to split its
registered and bearer shares to reduce the weight of the share prices.
AMSTERDAM, inspired by a firm bond market and new year investment from
abroad, closed almost one per cent firmer. The CBS Tendency Index closed up
1.3 at 121.1. Philips, the electronics group, was 70 cents firmer at Fl
32.90 while the food group CSM was also in demand, rising 50 cents to Fl
89.00.
MADRID ended flat in moderate trading, despite a strong opening, with the
general index down 0.02 at 252.62. Turnover rose to Pta18.5bn from Pta15bn.
Repsol closed Pta30 higher at Pta2,825 with a large block order boosting
volume. Some utility issues showed strong gains: Catalana de Gas put on
Pta110 to Pta5,970 while Fecsa advanced Pta9 to Pta713. Insurers Mapfre lost
Pta85 to Pta4,805, and Union Fenix fell Pta95 to Pta4,555.
STOCKHOLM fell in active trade as an overnight decline on Wall Street
triggered profit-taking after four days of gains. The Affarsvarlden General
Index closed down 11.0 at 978.2. Volume remained heavy at SKr498m. The
insurance sector fell 2.2 per cent and forestry, a strong performer in the
past three sessions, slipped 2.0 per cent.
OSLO lost 1.4 per cent on profit-taking, the all-share index closing 6.50
lower at 454.17 in active turnover of NKr341m. Oils and oils-associated
stocks went both ways, as Norsk Hydro fell NKr3 to NKr158 while Saga
Petroleum free shares ended NKr3 higher at NKr99.
BRUSSELS focused on Gechem and firm Acec-UM as it closed 1.7 per cent higher
on the first day of the new forward account. The Bel-20 index closed up
19.88 at 1,181.69 in high turnover of BFr1.22bn.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar focus in nervous trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar remained the focus of a nervous day in the foreign exchange
markets yesterday, falling sharply against the yen late in London on rumours
that the US and Japanese authorities would intervene to support the Japanese
currency, writes Simon London.
The US currency traded within very tight ranges overnight in the Far East,
barely moving from New York closing levels. The dollar ended the Tokyo day
at Y123.34 and DM1.5885, from Y123.43 and DM1.5887 in New York.
In European trading the cautious tone continued through the morning,
although the dollar gradually appreciated against both the yen and the
D-Mark during the session.
The US currency hit a high of Y123.85 and DM1.5950 before falling back. In
late afternoon the US unit was subjected to a spell of extreme volatility
following reports that the US Federal Reserve was checking market rates with
dealers at commercial banks.
Rate-checking can be a precursor of intervention and dealers speculated that
the US authorities were about to sell dollars for yen on behalf of the Bank
of Japan - a repeat of intervention which knocked the dollar down from
Y127.45 to Y124.45 late on Friday.
Fears of renewed intervention sent the dollar spinning down to Y122.55
before it sta-bilised.
Dealers said there was no sign of intervention by the close in London and
the dollar regained some poise. However, analysts noted that the US
authorities might have been waiting until European markets had closed before
operating in the market. Intervention is likely to make more impact when
trading volume is low.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5830 from DM1.5970; Y123.10 from Y123.65;
Pounds 1.8065 from Pounds 1.7910; and FFr5.3975 from FFr5.4450. In New York
it ended at DM1.5865, Y123.60, Dollars 1.8050 and FFr5.4085.
Today, US housing construction figures for December, the only significant US
indicator due for release this week, will be watched for signs of an upturn
in economic activity.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark continued to soften.
Analysts said worries over inflationary wage demands by German trade unions
continued to undermine the D-Mark.
The Spanish peseta, already the strongest currency in the system,
appreciated in line with other currencies. Against the D-Mark it reached a
high of Pta63.12, from Pta63.21 at the opening, raising sterling's floor
within the system to DM2.8587.
However, by the close the Spanish currency had fallen back to Pta63.21,
relieving some of the pressure on sterling, which closed comfortably above
its ERM floor at DM2.86, unchanged from Monday.
Today, the Bank of Spain is due to operate in the money market through its
regular repurchase agreements. Traders will be watching the rate at which
the authorities supply liquidity to the money markets for signs of any
change in monetary conditions.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates stable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money rates were stable yesterday, with the market facing a smaller
liquidity shortage than in recent days and sterling steady on the foreign
exchange markets, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 650m in early morning,
later revised up to Pounds 750m. The main factor was maturing treasury bills
and earlier assistance totalling just over Pounds 500m.
With overnight money rates retaining the softer tone seen on Monday, market
participants did not rush for liquidity and the Bank of England refrained
entirely from morning assistance.
In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 138m band 1 bank bills and band 2
bank bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance totalled Pounds 435m,
bringing the total injection of liquidity for the day to Pounds 573m.
This was sufficient to keep short-rates near Monday's closing levels.
Overnight unsecured funds traded at around 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent against a
close on Monday of 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent.
Longer cash rates were also steady. Three months inter-bank funds traded at
10 5/8 - per cent, unchanged from Monday. One month inter-bank money traded
at 10- 5/8 per cent, from 10- 9/16 .
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange traded at around 89.75 for most of the day and closed at
89.71. This implies base lending rates of 10.39 per cent from a current rate
of 10.5 per cent.
In Frankfurt, call money continued to trade around 9.40/50 per cent,
unchanged from the levels seen on Monday. Today the Bundesbank is expected
to set repurchase agreements to replace an expiring DM13.3bn pact. Funds are
being drained from the market at 9.55 per cent and the Bundesbank is
expected to inject new funds at 9.4 per cent, the rate set at last week's
repurchase operations.
The Bank of Japan did not operate in the money markets yesterday, in spite
of a Y210bn surplus of liquidity and a slide in three months certificate of
deposit rates.
In the past the authorities have been keen to stop short-rates from falling.
However, the weakness of the stock market this week may be an overriding
concern.
Call money traded at around the 5 9/16 per cent levels seen on Monday. Three
months CDs traded at 5.20 per cent, from 5.25 per cent.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis announce 100,000 barrels
a day oil output cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIYADH, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA yesterday became the latest member of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to announce a voluntary cut in output to shore
up crude prices. It is cutting production by 100,000 barrels a day with
immediate effect.
Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said the kingdom made the cut 'out
of its desire to maintain a balance between supply and demand on the oil
market'. He added: 'We hope that by taking this measure things will return
to normal'. The cut will reduce Saudi production to 8.4m barrels a day.
The reduction follows voluntary pledges over the past few days from six
other Opec members - Venezuela, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Iran and Qatar - to
cut output by a total of 200,000 b/d in response to recent softness in the
market. The United Arab Emirates has also hinted that it may trim its
production.
Opec's 11 fully producing members have been pumping oil flat out since the
agreement at their last ministerial meeting in November on a nominal output
ceiling of 23.65m b/d for the first quarter.
Real output, however, has been nearer 24.2m b/d and the combination of a
mild winter, a delayed economic recovery in the US and a draw-down on stocks
during the first quarter has undermined prices.
Opec ministers are due to decide on output levels for the second quarter at
their next conference in Geneva on February 12. Gulf oil officials said
yesterday that the round of token voluntary cuts would make agreement in
Geneva easier, but that the meeting would almost certainly have to agree on
further reductions in output.
They said the voluntary cuts would help to support prices before the meeting
while accelerating the first quarter draw-down on stocks, which is expected
to add to the demand for Opec oil in the second quarter. They believe,
however, that, despite the cuts, the February meeting would be Opec's most
difficult since the Gulf crisis, with several Opec states certain to press
for Saudi Arabia to undertake the biggest share of overall cut.
By lifting production during the Gulf crisis to help fill the gap left by
lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, the kingdom has lifted its share of Opec output
from less than a quarter to more than a third since the Gulf crisis.
Saudi Arabia is known to be seeking a pro-rata cut shared equally by all
Opec members, with the exception of Kuwait, which will be permitted to
recoup its lost revenues. 'The possibility for such an agreement is there,
particularly since these voluntary cuts have been shared - it will make it
easier if there are to be further cuts that they too should be shared,' said
one Gulf oil official.
Officials said, however, that the Geneva meeting was likely to see strong
disagreements over where the production ceiling should be set for the second
quarter and they predicted wide variation in members' forecasts for the
second quarter demand for Opec crude. Russia expects oil output to fall to
405.5m tonnes in 1992, from 462.3m tonnes in 1991, reports Reuter from
Moscow.
The forecast, contained in an official document, is below figures outlined
last week by Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the Russian energy minister. Mr Lopukhin
said that Russia intended to produce 426m tonnes of oil in 1992.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clean-up scheme for UK farms
proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS WERE announced by Britain's National Rivers Authority yesterday
for every farm to produce its own waste management plan giving details of
the type and volume of effluent produced and methods of disposal.
The scheme is intended to cut down on the amount of organic wastes and
agrochemicals that get into the rivers damaging fish and threatening the
drinking-water supply.
Although the authority says that the scheme is voluntary, it does envisage
that farmers who fail to comply would not receive existing grants for other
pollution control measure such as the provision of storage for waste.
However, it is proposing that government aid should be available to help pay
for drawing up the plans.
If a voluntary scheme fails, then the NRA says it will press for tough new
regulations imposing a duty of care on farmers to control pollution.
Mr John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, announced that a pilot study
would be carried out by the ministry to test the feasibility of
pollution-control plans.
'Although only 11 per cent of total reported pollution incidents are caused
by agriculture, there are still too many of them,' said Mr Gummer.
However, the NRA said that it had made 954 prosecutions for water pollution
over the past two years and 404 of these were against farmers. Between 1979
and 1990, the number of farm pollution incidents had more than doubled, from
just under 1,500 to over 3,000.
The authority maintains that agriculture has lagged behind industry in
dealing with waste. If necessary it would like to see large 'factory' farms
building their own treatment plants.
Under the proposals, every farm plan would include a map showing land
available for spreading wastes, a statement of management and maintenance,
the disposal system required and details of contingency plans in the event
of accidents.
The National Farmers' Union welcomed the report and said it was prepared to
co-operate in drawing up a scheme. It pointed out that Pounds 75m has
already been spent on better waste handling facilities on farms.

AN ADVISORY committee to Japan's Ministry of Finance announced in an interim
report this week that the law which prohibits stock price manipulation
should not be revised, but standards for its application should be
clarified, writes Emiko Terazono.
Criticism that the present Article 125 of the Securities and Exchange Law
was not sufficient to prove stock manipulation had prompted a review by the
committee last year.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Overnight gains in foreign markets lift
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>

GAINS in foreign markets overnight and sporadic short-covering helped to
lift US bond prices across the board in light trading yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 105
1/32 , yielding 7.563 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32
at 100 5/32 , yielding 4.913 per cent.
Despite the short-covering, which was said to have been concentrated among
Japanese players, the market lacked a firm direction. The strength of prices
at the intermediate and long end of the market was primarily a correction
from last week, when selling of longer-dated maturities was heavy amid
deflated hopes of further interest rate cuts. The biggest gains were seen in
the 10-year maturities.
The thinness of the market exaggerated the impact of the buying, and the
absence of retail demand suggested that underlying sentiment had not shifted
significantly.
LONG-dated UK government bond prices dropped on funding worries and
shortening trades yesterday.
Activity in the gilt market picked up after the Bank of England announced
details of its forthcoming auction yesterday afternoon.
The Bank said it would auction Pounds 1.8bn of the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due
2002 on January 29, bringing the total size of the issue up to Pounds 4.8bn.
After the announcement, traders reported some shortening trades into the
10-year sector.
The auction issue will be partly-paid, with 25 per cent payable on tender,
40 per cent on February 24, and the rest on March 26. The 9 3/4 per cent
gilt due 2002, which will become the new 10-year benchmark stock, was widely
tipped as the auction issue. The 10-year gilt is expected to appeal to
international investors, traders said.
However, the market fell on concern about further funding requirements in
the 1991-1992 tax year. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is forecasting a further Pounds
2bn in gilt issuance in the 1991-92 tax year on top of the Pounds 1.8bn
auction.
In the futures market, the Liffe gilt contract opened at 97.30 and fell to
97.09 by late afternoon on average volumes. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due
2003/07 fell from 116 3/32 to 115 19/32 while the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due
2002 fell from 102 7/32 to 101 31/32 . Sterling strength helped to limit the
fall among short-dated stocks.
SHORT and medium-dated Japanese government bonds ended stronger yesterday on
hopes that the Bank of Japan would lower interest rates in order to support
the Tokyo stock market.
The benchmark No 129 bond reached a two-year high when the yield fell to
5.26 per cent in Tokyo trading. The yield on the No 129 opened at 5.295 per
cent in Tokyo and moved to 5.26 per cent before closing at 5.28 per cent.
The yen strengthened against the dollar from Y123.85 to Y122.95, attracting
buying interest in the bond market, although traders reported some
profit-taking later on. Traders attributed the dollar's weakening to rumours
of central bank intervention. Both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of
Japan intervened on Friday to strengthen the yen.
THE European government bond markets rallied yesterday helped by strong
demand for short-dated securities from Far Eastern, US and European buyers.
Traders reported particularly strong demand from central banks for
short-dated Dutch and German government paper, which resulted in a
flattening of the respective yield curves.
In the Netherlands, investors poured Fl 7bn into the two new Dutch state tap
issues, bringing total sales of the 10-year and 15-year issues to Fl 8.8bn
so far this week. The financing agency boosted the selling prices on the
8.25 per cent tap bonds due 2002 and 2007 in stages during the day following
unexpectedly high demand for the issues.
Traders said investors were attracted by the spreads of about 50 basis
points over the 10-year German government bonds.
In Germany, the Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.46 and climbed to a
high of 88.69 before slipping to 88.61 by late afternoon.
Despite worries about the current wage negotiations, investors are expecting
the Bundesbank to come under considerable pressure to lower German interest
rates at the Group of Seven meeting this weekend.
Elsewhere in Europe, Spanish government bond prices picked up on hopes that
the strength of the peseta might prompt a cut in Spanish interest rates.
The Italian bond market, which opened the day on a strong note, closed
higher on the day, helped by gains in the other European markets.
The key March 2001 BTP ended at 101.22, compared with 100.93/94 the previous
day.
In the futures market, the Liffe contract closed about 20 basis points
higher at 98.71.
Yesterday's L8,500bn repo tender, at which the average rate fell to 11.74
per cent, pushed short-term interbank rates down, boosting sentiment in the
market.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese brokerage
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIWA Securities, a leading Japanese brokerage, yesterday announced it would
transfer 200 head office personnel to domestic branches, writes Emiko
Terazono.
The move reflects the company's need to boost branch level sales
commissions, which have declined sharply due to the sluggish stock market.
Japanese brokerages have been hard hit by the low trading volumes in the
equity market stemming from deteriorating investor confidence.
While smaller brokers, which rely heavily on stock broking commissions and
have been hit by the faltering market, have been announcing shifts of head
office employees to sales branches, Daiwa will be the first of the big four
brokerages - which also include Nomura, Nikko and Yamaichi - to implement
such changes. Yamaichi Securities also said it was considering a
reorganisation of employees at the end of next month.
The move also represents a change in business strategy of the leading
brokerages. The big four have been pressured to allow more autonomy to the
branches, as previous sales methods which involved the head office issuing
stock recommendations through branch networks have been criticised for
distorting share prices and, in some cases, price manipulation. Now the
branches are expected to operate more independently, tailoring investment
advice to local conditions and local customers' needs.

<TEXT>
SECURITY PACIFIC, the loss-making Los Angeles-based bank that is being
merged into the Bank of America, yesterday unveiled an 80.3 per cent leap in
1991 bad debt provisions, to Dollars 2.6bn. The bank also suffered a 74.6
per cent jump in 1991 loan write-offs, to Dollars 1.4bn.
SecPac revealed, as expected, a 1991 loss of Dollars 774.5m, a sharp
deterioration from the Dollars 161.3m net profit recorded in 1990. The
bank's fourth-quarter loss was Dollars 409.2m, compared with a loss of
Dollars 357.6m in the same period of 1990.
Mr Robert Smith, the chairman of SecPac, blamed much of the deficit on the
state of the California economy. He repeated a statement last week that Bank
of America had advised him the losses would not affect the planned merger.
On Wall street yesterday, SecPac's share price was marked  7/8 lower to
Dollars 32 5/8 .
Shawmut, another bank that yesterday reported a 1991 loss, saw its share
price marked down by Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 9 7/8 .
The Connecticut-based Shawmut, which last week abandoned merger talks with
the Bank of Boston, lost Dollars 170.7m in 1991, against a Dollars 133m loss
in 1990. The fourth quarter saw a tiny net profit of Dollars 2.4m, against a
Dollars 215.7m loss in the last quarter of 1990.
MR Ralph MacDonald, a co-head of global corporate finance at Bankers Trust,
resigned unexpectedly yesterday. Mr George Vojta, the other co-head of the
corporate finance business, was named a vice-chairman, while Mr Eugene
Shanks was named president.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Mobil will respond to Dollars
1.3bn back tax demand with lawsuit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOBIL, the second biggest US oil and gas group, yesterday said it would
respond with a lawsuit to a Dollars 1.3bn US government bill for back taxes.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claims Mobil owes about Dollars 300m in
taxes on Saudi Arabian oil bought in 1980 and 1981. A further Dollars 1bn of
interest is also being claimed.
Mr Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil, yesterday disputed the tax bill. It
centres on the so-called 'Aramco Advantage' issue of whether Mobil should
have charged its consuming country affiliates higher oil prices for Saudi
crude that was obtained below world market prices. At the time, Mobil was a
minority shareholder of Aramco.
Both Exxon and Texaco, two other former Aramco shareholders, are also
involved in litigation with the IRS over similar back tax bills.
A decision on these cases is expected from a Washington, DC tax court by
mid-year.
Texaco, the US energy group, yesterday unveiled a decline of almost 20 per
cent in underlying 1991 earnings, reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas
prices and depressed demand.
Stripping out special items in the fourth quarter, Texaco's profits dropped
37.6 per cent to Dollars 295m from Dollars 475m the previous year.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 1991 fell 16.5 per cent to Dollars 324m,
or Dollars 1.15 a share, from Dollars 388m, or Dollars 1.40, a year earlier.
Revenues declined by 25 per cent to Dollars 9.8bn from Dollars 13bn.
For the full year, Texaco had underlying profits of Dollars 1.24bn, against
Dollars 1.54bn in 1990.
Net income in the year eased 11 per cent to Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 4.61,
against Dollars 1.45bn, or Dollars 5.18, a year earlier. Revenues declined 8
per to Dollars 38.3bn from Dollars 41.8bn in 1990, reflecting sharply lower
crude oil and product prices in 1991 which were partly offset by slight
gains in crude sales volumes.
Texaco's earnings from exploration and production stood 49.1 per cent lower
in the fourth quarter at Dollars 175m, compared with Dollars 344m the
previous year.
The results were in line with expectations, and shares in Texaco added
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 3/8 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.

contraceptive vaccine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals group, said it was
seeking to develop a new contraceptive vaccine for women that could last for
at least two years.
The company has entered a licensing agreement with the University of
Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology, which has been working on the
vaccine.
Johnson &amp; Johnson, already an important manufacturer of birth control pills,
will finance the Virginia centre's testing of the vaccine on baboons. It is
hoped that human trial will begin within two years.
The contraceptive vaccine works by stimulating a woman's immune system,
causing it to develop antibodies to a protein molecule found in sperm.
The antibodies destroy the sperm's ability to fertilise eggs. The
contraceptive, which may be administered by pill or injection, could last
for as long as five years, according to the company.
The Johnson &amp; Johnson research project is not the first of its kind;
contraceptive vaccines are also being developed at universities in New Delhi
and British Columbia. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has also
patented a vaccine that is being developed.
News of the vaccine project did not excite investors on Wall Street, where
Johnson &amp; Johnson's share price fell by  7/8 to Dollars 104 1/8 .

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: IBM extends workstation range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer,
raised the temperature in the workstation market sharply yesterday with the
launch of a range of powerful systems which sets new standards of price and
performance.
The workstations, an extension of the company's RS/6000 family, range in
price in the UK from a basic Pounds 2,772 to Pounds 51,400. (Dollars
92,000). Complete with memory and screen, costs range from Pounds 4,948 to
Pounds 214,957.
Performance has been increased and prices kept down through the integration
of all the processor functions on a single silicon chip.
The launch marks IBM's move into the low end of the workstation business,
dominated by Sun Microsystems. From a standing start, it has already
captured 16 per cent of the workstation market in two years.
Workstations, powerful personal computers with high-definition screens
capable of being linked together in networks, have traditionally been used
by scientists and engineers. They are increasingly being used in business
for industrial design and the calculation of financial yields.
The workstation market is continuing to grow at 10 per cent or more a year
while other areas of the computer industry have slowed to 5 per cent or
less.
IBM's lead, however, may be short-lived. Last week, Hewlett Packard launched
a Dollars 5,000 low-end workstation, while Digital Equipment announced a
Dollars 4,000 systems last month.
Sun Microsystems, which has about 40 per cent of the whole workstation
market, is expected soon to launch a new generation of machines which will,
in turn, set new standards.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: MetLife to take part of
Executive Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW York State insurance regulators yesterday said they had tentatively
agreed to a deal under which Metropolitan Life, the nation's second largest
insurer, would take over much of the business of Executive Life of New York
(ELNY), writes Nikki Tait.
ELNY was one of two operating units within the sizeable First Executive life
insurance group. Heavy exposure to junk bonds prompted a policyholder run at
Executive Life of California, and caused California's insurance regulators
to seize this business in April. That exacerbated a similar problem at ELNY,
the smaller sister operation with 103,000 policyholders, prompting similar
action by the New York Insurance Department.
However, the two state regulators have different solutions. In California,
most of ELIC's junk bond portfolio was sold off; the cash proceeds added to
some other remaining investments and the insurance liabilities restructured.
In ELNY's case, a large portion of the liabilities and Dollars 1.46bn in the
cash and cash equivalents are being transferred to MetLife. This will leave
ELNY holding a large junk bond portfolio - with a book value of around
Dollars 1.9bn - which will fund certain remaining liabilities.
MetLife will probably pay around Dollars 60m-Dollars 70m for the single
premium deferred annuity and life insurance business it acquires, although
the figure could rise to Dollars 100m. Policyholders can remain with ELNY
and be paid the cash surrender value of their contracts over a four-year
period. Those who choose to move will generally be offered similar MetLife
contracts.
MetLife will also administer the business which remains with ELNY - single
premium immediate annuities, such as pensions and structured settlements.
MetLife will receive an annual fee, estimated at Dollars 1/2 m, while First
Boston Asset Management will handle the investment portfolio.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom of Canada boosted 1991 revenues by 21 per cent and earnings
by 14 per cent with the help of last March's acquisition of STC, the
UK-based telecommunications group.
Net earnings reached USDollars 514.9m, or Dollars 2.03 a share, last year,
up from USDollars 460.2m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, in 1990. Revenues climbed
to Dollars 8.2bn from Dollars 6.8bn.
Fourth-quarter income was a record Dollars 208m, ahead from Dollars 187.7m a
year earlier. Revenues in the final three months of the year advanced to
Dollars 2.3bn from Dollars 1.9bn, and order inflows were also at an all-time
high of Dollars 2.31bn, compared with Dollars 1.9bn a year earlier.
The group does not break out the precise contribution of STC, whose
operations have been totally integrated into the parent company. But STC was
the main factor in boosting sales outside North America to just over 20 per
cent of total revenues last year, from 13 per cent in 1990. Sales of STC's
submarine systems grew especially strongly.
Dr Paul Stern, Northern Telecom's chairman, maintained that performance
would have improved last year even without STC's contribution.
For instance, he said the company posted 'impressive' growth in the US,
where STC has no presence, thanks to increased market share. He declined,
however, to disclose precise figures.
The Dollars 2.6bn takeover of STC was the main factor in pushing up interest
charges to Dollars 221m last year from Dollars 80m in 1990. But Dr Stern
said the debt to capital ratio had fallen to 33 per cent to 34 per cent,
compared with the mid-50s at the time of the STC acquisition. 'We're going
to continue to drive it down,' Dr Stern said.
He predicted a further improvement in performance this year, except for
Canada. The optimism is based on continued international expansion, further
growth in US market share, and shipments of the new FiberWorld family of
transmission and switching products.
Nortel's share price has climbed steeply in the past year. It closed on the
Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 55 3/4 ,
against its 1991 low of CDollars 30.38.

downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service yesterday downgraded Dow Corning and Corning's
senior debt rating amid concern about possible litigation over silicone gel
breast implants made by Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow
Chemical and Corning, the glass products manufacturer.
The downgrade was followed by news of a product-liability suit filed against
Bristol-Myers Squibb in Chicago which alleges that the company's silicone
breast implants have serious and dangerous side-effects.
Lawyers said they expected to add claims against Dow Corning by the end of
the week. Although Bristol-Myers maintains that its implants are safe, the
company last year decided to close its breast implant operations.
Dow Corning's senior debt rating was cut to A2 from Aa2. The company's
long-term debt and commercial paper ratings were placed under review for
possible downgrade.
Although the implants bring in only 1 per cent of Dow Corning's annual
sales, there is increasing concern that the company may be flooded with
lawsuits as the controversy over the devices grows.
While Moody's downgraded Corning's long-term senior debt rating to single-A2
from single-A1, the rating agency left Dow Chemical's standing unchanged.
Dow Corning said the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) had asked for specific
new documents on its implants. The company disputed that the documents were
'new' and said it had already released this information to the FDA.
Dow Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, says it will take a
one-time pre-tax charge of Dollars 370m against fourth-quarter earnings. The
charge will push the company into the red for the period.

recession

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the US group with interests ranging from power systems to
financial services, yesterday reported a rise of just 2 per cent in
fourth-quarter net earnings as the US recession held back growth.
Net earnings totalled Dollars 1.263bn, or Dollars 1.46 a share, compared
with Dollars 1.239bn, or Dollars 1.42 a share, in the final period of 1990.
Consolidated revenues rose by 2 per cent to Dollars 17.5bn. GE shares closed
in New York at Dollars 78, a drop of Dollars 2 1/2 in a generally falling
market.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said that, despite the recession, all the group's
operating segments, apart from broadcasting and materials, increased their
operating profits, demonstrating the strength and breadth of its businesses
in face of a difficult global economy.
However, the group gave no detailed breakdown of each sector's
fourth-quarter performance.
For the full year, earnings were up 3 per cent at Dollars 4.435bn, or 5 per
cent on a per share basis at Dollars 5.10, before the adoption of a new
accounting standard for retirees health benefits. This non-cash adjustment,
taken in the third quarter, reduced reported earnings to Dollars 2.636bn.
The group's 11.3 per cent operating margin compared with 11.6 per cent in
1990, but GE said this was more than accounted for by price declines and
lower ratings at NBC, its television network. Operating margins at the
group's other businesses grew from 11.5 per cent to 11.9 per cent.
GE's financial services operations produced a strong performance, with
earnings rising 17 per cent in the year to Dollars 1.275bn. The company said
contributory factors included strong portfolio growth in GE Capital, its
main asset-holding arm, reduced borrowing costs and an improved performance
at Kidder Peabody, its stockbroking arm.

AMERITECH, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bells', reported 1991 net
earnings of Dollars 1.16bn, or Dollars 4.39 a share, down from Dollars
1.25bn, or Dollars 4.73, last year.
A Dollars 141m restructuring charge, taken in the fourth quarter, caused the
annual results decrease. Without it, net earnings would have been Dollars
1.3bn, which included a Dollars 73.6m gain from the initial public offering
of Telecom Corporation of New Zealand shares.
Revenues for 1991 rose slightly to Dollars 10.8bn, from Dollars 10.7bn.
The one-time charge included costs related to job cuts, write-downs of
certain assets, some other non-recurring charges in the company's
unregulated businesses and retirement of debt.
In the fourth quarter, net earnings after the charge were Dollars 199.2m, or
75 cents per share, compared with Dollars 286.8m, or Dollars 1.09, a year
ago.
The charge reduced per share earnings by approximately 53 cents.
Customer telephone lines rose in 1991 by 306,000 to 16,584,000 compared with
1990. Cellular customers increased 48 per cent to 483,000 from 157,000 at
the end of 1990.
Ameritech is the parent of Bell companies serving Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin and other information related companies, both
foreign and American.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Regulators remove HLT definition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BANKING regulators announced yesterday they intend to phase out 'highly
leveraged transaction' definition and to end reporting requirements for HLT
loans after June 30.
A joint statement from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
claimed the HLT definition had served its purpose. It had 'focused attention
on the need for banks to have strong internal controls for HLTs and to
structure HLT credits in a way that was consistent with the risks involved.'
The regulators added they recognised the HLT definition might be having an
'undue effect on pricing and availability for credit to certain highly
leveraged borrowers.' They would still scrutinise HLTs in bank examinations.
The idea of formally categorising deals as 'HLTs' if they met certain
criteria began in 1989 when regulators were worried about the amount of bank
lending to over-leveraged companies. The definition was refined, but
basically covered financing for buy-outs, acquisitions or recapitalisations
which pushed the borrower's liabilities-to-assets ratio beyond 75 per cent,
or which doubled the borrower's liabilities and sent the
liabilities-to-assets ratio over 50 per cent.
However, as analysts' worries about banks with high levels of HLT loans
grew, lending to HLT situations dried up and critics of the HLT definition
claimed some potentially sound borrowers were being unfairly stigmatised. In
July, the regulators asked for public comment on the definition.
Although eliminating the definition was always an option, it has been
suggested such a move might engender opposition from the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Wells Fargo hit hard by Dollars
700m loan-loss provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPECTED Dollars 231m fourth-quarter loss and Dollars 700m of bad debt
provisions in the quarter wiped out almost all of the 1991 profits at Wells
Fargo, the big California commercial banking group.
Heavy real estate loan losses and the deteriorating California economy
contributed to the slump, which resulted in Dollars 21m of net profits for
1991, compared with Dollars 712m in 1990.
This translates into 1991 net earnings per share of 4 cents, compared with
Dollars 13.39 the previous year.
Although the bank announced the gloomy outlook before Christmas, investors
on Wall Street yesterday reacted to the news by marking down the Wells Fargo
share price by Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 65.
Wells Fargo initially indicated it would be making heavy real estate bad
debt provisions following a tough inspection by US bank regulators in
December.
Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman of the bank, said yesterday the economic
environment 'continues to be difficult for banks'. He said it was,
therefore, appropriate that a significant addition to loan-loss reserves be
made.
Wells said its non-interest expenses rose by 18 per cent, to Dollars 2.02bn,
in 1991, caused in large part by costs associated with higher foreclosed
assets.
At year-end, the bank's non-performing and re-structured loans amounted to
Dollars 1.98bn, or 4.5 per cent of total loans. As of last month, the bank's
commercial real estate lending amounted to Dollars 12.7bn of total bank
lending of Dollars 46bn.
Nationbank, the renamed bank resulting from the merger of NCNB of Charlotte,
North Carolina, and C&amp;S/Sovran of Atlanta, Georgia, said it suffered a
Dollars 243.8m fourth-quarter loss, mainly because of costs associated with
the merger.
The bank, which now ranks as the fourth largest in the US in terms of
assets, said it made a profit of Dollars 201.8m for the whole of 1991.

hand - Onno Ruding, the US bank's new vice-chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MR HERMAN Onno Christiaan Rudolf Ruding
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Onno to his friends - was in a joyful mood yesterday afternoon. Having just
been named a new vice-chairman of Citicorp, the wounded Gulliver of US
banking, the 52-year-old Mr Ruding relaxed in a second-floor office with Mr
John Reed, the Citicorp chairman, chatting about Mr Reed's 'kind offer' to
join the bank.
The lanky Mr Ruding, best known in financial circles as a former Dutch
finance minister and as a past executive director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), did work as a banker in the 1970s, when for five years
he was joint general manager of AMRO Bank.
Having failed in recent years to land such jobs as head of the IMF (1986)
and head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (1991), he
has been filling his time as three-day-a-week chairman of the Netherlands'
Christian employers federation and as a board member at Unilever, Philips
and, of course, Citicorp.
By March 1, he will move lock, stock and barrel to New York and devote
himself 'more than 100 per cent' to Citicorp. As a wily politician, however,
Mr Ruding declined to rule out a return to Dutch politics.
Mr Reed, who yesterday reported nearly Dollars 5bn of loan write-offs in
1991 and a heavy loss for the year, looked only mildly disconcerted when Mr
Ruding was asked to offer his analysis of the current woes of Citicorp and
the US banking industry. 'It is quite different from European banking. There
are some tendencies of weakness in American banking,' Mr Ruding began,
before singing the praises of Citicorp's stature as 'the most global bank.'
Citicorp's most significant problems, Mr Ruding then essayed, are 'in the
field of credit policies and in the credit portfolio, and in the field of
capital'.
Among Mr Ruding's responsibilities will be the running of Citicorp's Japan,
Europe and North American (JENA) corporate finance division, which last year
suffered nearly quadrupled losses of more than Dollars 1bn. But the
diplomatic Dutchman, while admitting that 'nobody expects US real estate to
be better in a few months' time,' said he wished to point out that there are
some profitable bits of JENA.
Mr Reed himself has taken charge of the real estate portfolio, and he
stressed the way in which he perceives Mr Ruding 'as firstly a colleague at
the senior level' whose most important contribution will be the views he
brings to senior management.
Mr Ruding's line responsibility for the bank's corporate division is, for Mr
Reed, second to his 'strong personal views and leadership'.
The issue of whether or not Mr Ruding is the man to turn around Citicorp's
corporate business remains to be seen.

<TEXT>
DEN NORSKE Bank, Norway's biggest bank, will make provisions for identified
and estimated losses on loans and guarantees for 1991 of NKr5.6bn (Dollars
89.4m).
DnB also announced yesterday a sweeping reorganisation into two main
divisions - corporate and retail banking - in which 480 jobs would be lost
and 13 domestic banking outlets closed.
The bank's credit losses jumped by NKr1.8bn in the final three months of
1991, from NKr3.78bn at the nine-month stage, confounding earlier optimism
for a fourth-quarter improvement.
DnB said that, after the reorganisation, 630 full-time positions would be
eliminated but that 150 of these would not require job losses. The bank
warned that its management had the authority to 'implement lay-offs if this
proves necessary to reach the required staff level'.
Last month, DnB was rescued by a NKr5.9bn state-backed bail-out with a
NKr3.25bn cash injection in the form of preferential capital and a NKr1.68bn
state guarantee for a planned NKr2.37bn preferential share issue.
Under the agreement, DnB was ordered to report its developments on a regular
basis to the state-operated bank insurance fund. But the state also saddled
DnB with the acquisition of Realkreditt, Norway's biggest mortgage company,
which was facing technical insolvency.
Mr Torstein Joerstad, a bank analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit
rating agency, said DnB's credit losses reflected a continuing trend of
Norway's ailing banking sector. The bank already has an A-3 investment grade
rating, the lowest assigned by S&amp;P.
'We are not likely to review this rating for another 18 months,' Mr Joerstad
said. 'In any case, DnB will have to show sustainable, good profits and the
ability to stand on its own without the prop of state subsidies while
seeking to reduce non-performing loans.
'It looks like the bank has a long way to go,' he added.

A LEADING Japanese home-builder, Misawa Homes, is negotiating with an ailing
contractor, Ishihara Construction, over a rehabilitation plan. The scheme is
likely to include the taking of a 20 per cent stake in Ishihara, which has
been weakened by links to failed property developers.
The negotiations reflect the reluctance of Japanese banks to allow leading
clients to fail. Ishihara is listed on the second section of the Tokyo
exchange, and its bankers, including Mitsubishi Trust and Mitsubishi Bank,
had apparently been seeking a partner to assist in its restructuring.
Misawa Homes has remained strong in spite of the downturn in Japan's
property market over the past year. Mr Fumichika Ishihara, president of
Ishihara Construction, said the Misawa group was the most likely of the four
candidates seeking a capital tie-up with his company, which has debts
estimated at Y110bn (Dollars 863m).
Ishihara Construction was closely linked to Kyowa Corporation, a bankrupt
steel frame builder and property developer at the centre of a political
scandal last week for its large donations to the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
Mr Fumio Abe, a former Japanese cabinet minister, was arrested for allegedly
taking bribes from Kyowa, which collapsed owing more than Y200bn in late
1990.

CITICORP, the biggest US bank which is struggling to contain losses and cut
costs, yesterday reported a 72 per cent cent jump in total loan write-offs
to Dollars 4.9bn for 1991.
The bank also unveiled a Dollars 457m loss for the year, which compares with
a Dollars 458m net profit for 1990.
Citicorp's losses, Dollars 133m in the fourth quarter, had been forecast by
Mr John Reed, the chairman. Total bad debt provisions for 1991 rose by 46
per cent, to Dollars 3.89bn.
Mr Reed, as expected, yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Onno Ruding,
a former Dutch finance minister, as vice-chairman of Citicorp with
responsibility for the troubled corporate finance division. Mr Michael
Callen, former head of Citicorp's corporate division, left last week.
Earnings from Citicorp's global consumer banking division, which has in the
past provided up to 60 per cent of the bank's total core earnings, slumped
by 39.3 per cent in 1991, to Dollars 549m.
The corporate division Mr Ruding is taking over, which covers North America,
Europe and Japan, suffered a 1991 loss of Dollars 1.02bn, nearly four times
the level of 1990's Dollars 275m loss.
The cross-border refinancing portfolio managed a Dollars 187m profit in
1991, compared with a loss of Dollars 317m the previous year. The
international banking and finance division achieved a modest improvement in
1991, with profit rising to Dollars 426m from Dollars 407m in 1990.
Mr Reed yesterday reiterated his expectation that Citicorp would return to
profitability in 1992. He also said the bank's cost-cutting and
capital-bolstering plan remained on track.
Operating expenses in 1991 were Dollars 10.3bn, but this excludes
restructuring charges of Dollars 750m. In 1990, Citicorp's operating
expenses were Dollars 10.8bn, excluding Dollars 300m of restructuring
charges.
The ratio of Citicorp's common equity to total assets at the end of 1991 was
3.4 per cent, down from 3.8 per cent at the end of 1990 and still well below
the US banking industry average.
The bank's total revenues for 1991 were Dollars 14.8bn, compared with
Dollars 14.6bn in 1990. Total assets at the end of 1991 were Dollars 222bn,
down from Dollars 232bn a year before. The number of employees fell to
86,000 at the year-end from 95,000 at the end of 1990. The Citicorp dividend
was halted, as previously announced.

that it would not allow the Agnellis to further increase their investment in
BSN.
Perrier and BSN are embroiled in the battle that is brewing between Nestle,
a traditional ally of BSN, and the Agnellis in the European food industry, a
sector long considered ripe for consolidation.
Mr Jacques Vincent, president of both Perrier and Exor, issued a statement
condemning the bid by Nestle and Indosuez saying that it threatened to
'dismantle Perrier' by dispersing its brands between Nestle and BSN.
He affirmed his support for the Agnelli bid for Exor and for the investment
in Perrier by Saint Louis, the French paper and packaging company associated
with the Agnellis. Both the Exor bid and the Saint Louis investment are
being investigated by the French stock market authorities. Nestle yesterday
said it had obtained court orders to freeze Exor's voting stock in Perrier
and to freeze Saint Louis' voting rights on its 13.8 per cent stake.
The Agnellis have made no secret of their hopes of raising their
indirectly-held 5.8 per cent stake in BSN.
Mr Antoine Riboud, president of BSN, was yesterday quoted in Liberation, the
French newspaper, as saying that he would block any attempt to increase the
Agnelli's investment. Under the terms of an agreement, the Agnellis are
unable to directly or indirectly buy BSN shares without Mr Riboud's consent.
In Paris, BSN's shares slipped by FFr43 to FFr1,111.

International Media Communications achieved its first profitable half year
since 1988 after benefiting from the delivery of the greater part of the
British Airways order for Skyview, its project involving the installation in
aircraft of individual video players.
As a result, the group turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 301,000 for the
six months to October 31, compared with a Pounds 597,000 loss for the same
period of 1990 and a Pounds 715,000 deficit for the last full year.
Turnover doubled to Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 499,000). Earnings per share
emerged at 0.13p, against losses of 0.51p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John D Wood, the USM-quoted estate agent, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
194,000 in the six months to October 31 1991.
That followed the deficit of Pounds 186,000 in the second half of last year,
and compared with a profit of Pounds 201,000 in the corresponding first
half.
Losses per share were 1.9p (earnings 1.5p) and the interim dividend is
omitted. Last year 1.5p was paid but there was no final.
Mr George Pope and Mr Ian Homersham, joint chairmen, said the nine central
London sales offices and lettings and management department continued to
trade profitably.
Turnover fell nearly 6 per cent to Pounds 2.56m and expenditure increased
slightly because of the new office in Wimbledon, expansion of the
development department, unlet space within the head office, and redundancy
costs.

<TEXT>
Sheriff Holdings, the USM-quoted plant hire group, is cutting its dividend
from 5.1p to 1.5p, a move which Mr Richard Dunn, chairman, said reflected
current performance, prevailing market conditions, and longer term
requirements.
Pre-tax profit in the year to September 30 dived from Pounds 1.08m to Pounds
312,000, and Mr Dunn said he did not anticipate any overall increase in hire
activity for another 12 or 18 months.
Turnover fell to Pounds 9.15m (Pounds 10.1m). Revenue from the hire of
equipment, the core business, was maintained at 99 per cent of the previous
year's level of activity, but revenue from sales diminished substantially.
Earnings per share came to 3.4p (11.3p). The final dividend is 0.75p (3.2p).

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries and Ferro of the US have called off their joint
venture to form the world's largest manufacturer of industrial powder paints
because of wrangles over who would run it and how it would be financed.
The venture, which would have had annual sales of Dollars 200m (Pounds
112m), was announced last August and was supposed to start operating on
January 1.
Neither side would comment on the failure yesterday, but talks cannot have
been helped by the previously fast-growing powders market being stopped in
its tracks by the recession.
ICI planned to take a 51 per cent stake in the venture, which would have
been based in Cleveland, Ohio, where both Ferro and ICI's Glidden paints
subsidiary have their headquarters. The chairman was to have been Mr John
Danzeisen, who runs Glidden.
Ferro managers are understood to have been concerned about their role, while
ICI grew worried about the new business's likely increasing demands for
working capital as markets tightened.

THE Pounds 7M rights issue by Tottenham Hotspur, owner of the north London
football club, was taken up by about 2,000 shareholder fans at 125p - a
premium of 30p over yesterday's market price.
Holders representing 42.4 per cent exercised their rights, representing
2.47m new ordinary shares out of 5.82m offered. Of the 10,000 small
shareholders some 20 per cent opted to take up their new shares.
The issue confirms the control of the company by Mr Alan Sugar, chairman,
and Mr Terry Venables, chief executive.
Mr Sugar, who took up his rights in respect of 1.66m shares, said: 'I am
surprised and pleased that so many of our shareholders have supported the
issue. It is a particularly high level when one considers that our
shareholders are not, in the main, traditional investors in the market.'
Edennote, a company owned by Mr Venables, took up its rights in respect of
640,000 shares, giving it a 22.1 per cent stake.
The shares not taken up were split between Mr Sugar, who will take up
another 3.09m, giving him 47.8 per cent of the enlarged capital, and
Viewthorpe, which will take 266,772 shares, as part of the underwriting
arrangements. Viewthorpe is a company in which the family of Mr Frank
Sinclair, a former Tottenham director, is interested.
Mr Bernard Jolles, director of Henry Ansbacher which handled the issue, said
it had reduced the company's debt to Pounds 5.9m and valued it at Pounds
16m.

<TEXT>
John Brown, the engineer-ing group owned by Trafalgar House, yesterday
announced a further move to strengthen its growing operations on the
Continent, writes Andrew Taylor.
Sofresid, a French engineering company 49 per cent owned by John Brown, is
understood to have paid more than Pounds 5m for Sechaud &amp; Bossoyt, a French
engineering design group. The company was the prime contractor in the recent
reconditioning of the Eiffel Tower.
Mr Allan Gormly, managing director of John Brown and a Trafalgar House
director, said that the purchase would give the group a very strong position
in the French market.
Sechaud has 450 employees with offices in Paris and 11 provincial towns and
has a turnover of about Pounds 30m, Mr Gormly said. This compared with a
staff of 2,600 and turnover of Pounds 240m at Sofre-sid.
John Brown, in addition to its French operations, has a wholly-owned
subsidiary in the Netherlands and a joint venture with Sener, a Spanish
engineering company.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Cable and Wireless talks collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between American Telephone and Telegraph and Cable and Wireless
over forming a global alliance between the two telecommunications groups
have broken down because of political concern in the run-up to the UK
general election.
A central element of the alliance would have involved the US group buying a
minority stake in Mercury Communications, C and W's UK subsidiary.
AT&amp;T is understood to have been concerned that it could have become a pawn
in a much bigger game between the Labour and Conservative parties in the
tense pre-election period.
Talks between the two groups may start again after the election. This is
likely to depend partly on who wins - in particular, whether a Labour
government would change telecommunications policy - and partly on what
alternative alliances the groups pursue in the interim.
C and W's share price closed down 17p at 589p last night as the stock market
sensed that a deal had fallen through. Last week, when the market believed
an agreement was imminent, the price peaked at 632p.
Political worries are not the only reason that a deal, which has been the
subject of talks since last September, has not been concluded.
C and W, which is chaired by Lord Young, wants to collaborate throughout
Europe, not just on Mercury. But it is not clear whether AT&amp;T, which is
chaired by Mr Bob Allen, is willing to negotiate such a broad deal or would
prefer different partners in different geographical markets.
During the past six months, the international telecommunications industry
has been in a frenzy of deal-making, as what were once national monopolies
try to turn themselves into globally competitive operators.
Failure to conclude a deal now between AT&amp;T and C and W may mean that other
partners look more attractive to both groups after the election.
C and W has in the past considered taking a stake in Sprint, the third
largest US long-distance telecommunications carrier. It also planned to
develop its own presence in the US market by acquiring TRT/FTC, the fourth
largest carrier, but pulled out of this deal last November.
AT&amp;T has held talks with a number of European companies, including Germany's
Bundespost Telekom and France Telecom.
Mr Allen's ambition is that AT&amp;T will earn half its revenue outside the US
by the year 2000, compared with less than a quarter today.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Budgens cuts shops trading on Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain, will decrease the number of its
stores open for Sunday trading now that rival food retailers are offering
seven-day shopping.
The example of Budgens was cited when leading food chains such as Tesco and
J. Sainsbury started Sunday trading last year. Now Budgens will concentrate
Sunday opening on stores where it makes sense for its customers - mainly
inner-city sites and in holiday areas. 'In most cases, Sunday trading does
not make sense. People will not eat or drink more, so you are just spreading
the same trade across seven days,' Budgens said.
'People will realise there is a big hidden financial cost to Sunday opening.
It means you need a different management structure, have problems with
shelf-filling and repairs must be done at night,' said Mr John von
Spreckelsen, chief executive.
About three-quarters of Budgens' 95 stores, which are in the south-east of
England, have opened on Sundays in the last year. Mr von Spreckelsen said
the decision on Sunday trading would be made store by store, but he did not
expect it would have a big impact on the results of the group.
Budgens, whose institutional shareholders installed new management last
April, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m in the six months
to November 28, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 33,000 for the same
period last year.
Mr von Spreckelsen described the results as a 'significant first step on the
road to recovery', and said his three-year plan to revitalise the group was
on course. Institutions injected Pounds 21.7m into the group last summer,
after forcing the resignation of Mr John Fletcher as chairman.
Sales rose 9 per cent to Pounds 156.65m. The group said this growth
reflected the benefits of improved service and product availability from its
Wellingborough depot and a one-off effect from increased trading hours.
Trading profits rose 40 per cent to Pounds 3.26m, with operating margins
improving from 1.6 to 2.1 per cent.
The pre-tax profit figure was lifted by an Pounds 842,000 exceptional gain
from a disposal in 1990 to Betta Stores. Earnings per share were 1.46p,
compared with a loss of 0.03p last time.
There is no interim dividend, as flagged at the time of the refinancing.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Trafalgar House wins court ruling over oil rig payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the construction and shipping conglomerate, yesterday won
an important ruling in its battle with Midland and Scottish Resources over
payment for the Ocean Emerald oil rig.
A ruling by the High Court stipulated that Trafalgar can keep control of the
rig until it is able to draw upon the Pounds 118m letter of credit with the
project's bankers or unless it is paid in full by MSR.
Former shareholders in Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar took over last
June, will get their second payment, totalling Pounds 54m, from Trafalgar
once the conglomerate can draw on the letter.
Trafalgar warned that the second payment of 45p a share could still be a
long way off since it might not be able to draw on the letter of credit
because of MSR's refinancing of the contract.
Mr Allan Gormly, a director of Trafalgar, said: 'The High Court ruling is an
important clarification. We have our hands on the asset but we are no nearer
being able to draw on the letter of credit.'
Last autumn MSR told Trafalgar that it had drawn up a plan to refinance the
Emerald rig project, with Den norske Bank, the Norwegian bank, largely
replacing several British clearing banks as the project's banker.
Under the plan MSR offered Den norske Bank the rig as security. This
jeopardised MSR's prospects of obtaining a so-called section 10, ship
mortgage guarantee, from the Department of Trade and Industry. Only once the
project was backed by this section 10 guarantee would Trafalgar be in a
position to draw upon the letter of credit.
MSR argued that under a clause in the rig contract which related to the
letter of credit, Trafalgar would only be paid once the rig was fully in
production.
Mr Jon Hawksley, MSR's managing director, said the company was still
considering whether to appeal against the judgment. But he added that he was
confident that the dispute would now be settled between the two parties. 'We
feel it is now in the best interests of all parties to get on with the
project.'
Trafalgar's shares rose 1p to close at 135p, while MSR's fell by 12p to
close at 38p.

FT  22 JAN 92 / United Tech to cut 14,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Technologies announced yesterday that it would cut its workforce by
almost 14,000 over the next two years, close or consolidate more than 100
facilities around the world and take a Dollars 1.275bn (Pounds 709m)
fourth-quarter pre-tax charge against earnings.
The US aerospace and building products group has been hit hard by recession
in the US, lower American defence spending and turmoil in the world civil
aviation industry. It is the latest in a long list of blue chip US companies
to announce severe cuts.
The group's businesses include Pratt &amp; Whitney, the aero-engine maker,
Sikorsky helicopters, Otis elevators and Carrier, the air conditioning
company.
UTC said the restructuring charge, together with a Dollars 256m pre-tax
charge to increase its reserves for environmental issues, produced a
fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.22bn, or Dollars 10.33 a share. That
compared with net income of Dollars 168.8m or Dollars 1.24 a share a year
earlier.
The company said the shake-up should produce annual cost savings of Dollars
1.1bn by 1994. It is aiming for an 18 per cent return on equity by that year
compared with 15.1 per cent in 1990.
The package involves cutting about 7 per cent of the group's workforce,
including a 12 per cent drop in executive jobs, which will save about
Dollars 440m a year. The plant rationalisation will reduce manufacturing
capacity by 16 per cent, saving Dollars 260m annually.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said UTC also planned improvements in its
design, engineering and manufacturing processes to save about Dollars 380m a
year. UTC would become 'leaner and tougher minded', he added. Mr Daniell won
wide praise after he took over as chairman in 1986 for reducing UTC
bureaucracy and cutting costs, but Wall Street's enthusiasm has waned over
the past year, because of a decline in profits, the uncertain and intensely
competitive market facing Pratt &amp; Whitney and continuing poor results at
Carrier.
The biggest restructuring will be at Pratt &amp; Whitney. It will shed 5,000
jobs, or 11 per cent of its workforce, shrink manufacturing space by 30 per
cent and cut manufacturing suppliers from about 500 to less than 250.
In the fourth quarter, Pratt saw operating profits before charges dip from
Dollars 252m to Dollars 138m, because of lower engine volume and spare part
sales.
For all of 1991 UTC reported a loss of Dollars 1.02bn, or Dollars 8.91 a
share, compared with income of Dollars 750.6m, or Dollars 5.53 a share in
1990.

FT  22 JAN 92 / Vow to resist lawsuit on Halcion drug claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RETIRED Scottish professor said yesterday he would continue to warn about
the dangers of Halcion, Upjohn's best-selling sleeping drug, in spite of the
US company's threat to bring a lawsuit against him before the end of the
week.
'I shall tell everything,' said Dr Ian Oswald, head of psychiatry at
Edinburgh University for seven years before retiring in 1989. His findings
were instrumental in the UK authorities' decision to ban Halcion in October
last year.
He said he planned to defy Upjohn's virtually unprecedented threat of legal
action and talk next month at a public meeting on Halcion's safety held by
the German Ministry of Health.
Dr Oswald claims Halcion's serious adverse side effects were discovered by
Upjohn as early as 1972 but were omitted in submissions to the US Food and
Drug Administration.
Dr Oswald spent more than 1,000 hours studying confidential Upjohn reports
on the drug as an expert witness in a US action against the company. Upjohn
settled the suit out of court.
It involved a woman, Mrs Ilo Grundberg, who had shot her mother eight times
while allegedly under the influence of Halcion. Dr Oswald was paid by Mrs
Grundberg's defence lawyers for his role as an expert witness.
Dr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman and chief executive, said this week
that Dr Oswald's claims of fraudulent concealment were false and reckless.
He added: 'We've been caring for patients now for more than a century, and
it's not fair for our employees to continue to be smeared by Oswald or for
patients to be frightened and misled by this kind of junk science.'
The Committee on Safety of Medicines, the UK government's drug safety
watchdog, banned Halcion after Upjohn refused to withdraw the product
voluntarily. French and Spanish authorities subsequently insisted the drug
should be sold in 0.125mg pills rather than 0.25mg.
Dr Oswald, however, questions whether the drug is effective in such low
doses. An Upjohn submission to the FDA in 1985 said that only a 0.5mg dose
was effective in the treatment of insomnia in non-geriatric patients. Dr
Oswald said: 'It's incongruous that the only dose allowed in France and
Spain is in doses that are regarded by Upjohn as frequently ineffective.'
Although Halcion may not be effective as a sleeping treatment at low doses
for most patients, it may nevertheless still be dangerous, according to Dr
Oswald. He points out that in 1987, Upjohn told the FDA that adverse
psychiatric reactions with Halcion were of uniform frequency whatever the
size of the dose.
He added: 'This means Halcion is just as likely to induce mentally ill
effects in small doses as large. There is no dose dependency.'
An Upjohn executive argued in a US newspaper this week that Dr Oswald could
in no sense be considered an unbiased, neutral reviewer of the data.
Dr Oswald yesterday challenged Upjohn to make confidential data from
clinical trials public if it wanted to clear its name. 'I am an academic
medical research scientist,' said Dr Oswald. 'I am only interested in the
truth. That is my only concern.'
