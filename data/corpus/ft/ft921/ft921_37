FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (5): The medicine seems to be working -
Signs of vitality in the hard-pressed economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EGYPT'S economy enters the new year in better shape than many can remember,
with an improved balance of payments and amid signs that IMF-inspired
monetary reforms are beginning to work their way through the system.
The IMF, in a review of progress towards implementing its May, 1991
programme, approved Egypt's reform efforts, and had no hesitation in
disbursing the second tranche of an SDR272m standby credit.
Fund officials focused particularly on Egypt's efforts to restrain its
budget deficit. Overspending has been the rock on which previous IMF reform
programmes have foundered, most notably the short-lived 1987 agreement which
barely lasted long enough for the ink to dry. A Fund spokesman said that
Egypt appeared to be making progress in its efforts to curb spending, and he
was relatively confident that it would hold its deficit more or less to the
target of 10.3 per cent of GDP for 1991-92.
This assessment surprised observers since it was assumed that teething
difficulties in collecting a new sales tax and also lower-than-expected tax
receipts due to the lingering recession would make it difficult for Egypt to
adhere to IMF budgetary targets. Egypt's much improved balance of payments -
the deficit this year is expected to drop below Dollars 1bn - is due largely
to the strong rebound in the tourism sector and to the forgiveness or
rescheduling of about half of its Dollars 50bn foreign debt following the
Gulf crisis (interest payments this year will be down to about Dollars
600m).
Other positive factors included cash transfers of aid from Gulf states in
recognition of Egypt's role in helping to mobilise Arab opposition to Iraq's
takeover of Kuwait, and stronger exports. Egypt's improved access to markets
in Libya and in the Gulf have been a factor in this.
Another pleasing development has been the pick-up in the construction sector
driven partly by the real estate boom. Construction had been in the
doldrums.
While representatives of international lending institutions and aid donors
accord Egypt high marks for the implementation of IMF reforms aimed at
curbing inflation, reducing the debt burden and stabilising the currency,
they are much less complimentary about efforts at structural reform, the
other key element of the reform programme.
Egyptian tardiness in complying with World Bank requirements that it raise
cotton prices to 60 per cent of the world market to encourage local
production, and delays in removing trade restrictions held up disbursement
of some Dollars 300m in structural adjustment loans.
Egypt has also made something of a mess of efforts to set in place the
necessary machinery to disburse up to Dollars 400m in a World Bank-sponsored
'social fund' to help soften the blow of structural adjustment that will
lead to the loss of jobs in some sectors. A danger for the IMF-World Bank
reforms is that the two halves - monetary reform and structural adjustment -
will get so far out of tandem that reform efforts, which rely on a balanced
programme of demand and supply side measures, will be dissipated.
Government fiddling and time-wasting are especially evident in the
implementation of reforms of Egypt's unwieldy public sector which accounts
for about 70 per cent of industrial output. A meaningful divestiture
programme is one of the principal demands of the World Bank and aid donors,
notably the US.
A new public sector law meant to facilitate privatisation is so hedged with
qualifications that opponents of divestiture should find it a useful asset
in their efforts to slow down the process. Divestiture thus far has been
largely restricted to the tourism sector where government-owned hotels are
beginning to be sold to private investors.
The authorities have commissioned the international accounting firm, Coopers
and Lybrand, to begin valuing public assets for possible sale, but there is
no sense of urgency. There are many candidates for divestiture in the
sprawling public sector. There is scarcely one sector of the economy,
heavily nationalised in the 1960s, that is free of government involvement -
from confectionery to heavy industry.
Unlike many of the countries of Eastern Europe, Egypt is adopting an
extremely cautious approach to 'de-nationalisation', and seems in danger of
repeating some of the mistakes of the past. One ominous development is the
new public sector law's provision for the establishment of
government-controlled 'holding companies', grouping similar industries, that
are meant to act as 'half-way houses' to divestiture.
Critics claim that this will create yet another level of bureaucracy and,
rather than facilitate privatisation, will make things much more
complicated. Government officials insist that the new law reflects a
commitment to liberalisation.
Another focus of World Bank concern is the run-down state of Egypt's capital
markets. The Bank has sponsored several studies into ways in which capital
markets might be enlivened, and new legislation reflecting these
recommendations is being drafted. Among factors slowing activity in stock
and bond markets are a serious lack of management sophistication, lack of
underwriting institutions and tax laws which discriminate against equities
in favour of tax-exempt bank deposits, interest income and returns on
government paper.
As last year drew to a close, it appeared that inflation was easing with
prospects that interest rates may begin to come down. The IMF believes that
inflation could be brought below 20 per cent for fiscal 1991-92, but
assessing the real rate of price rises in Egypt has always been difficult
since staple items continue to be subsidised. Unemployment continues to be
high, especially among urban youth (rates are said to exceed 20 per cent).
But the situation eased somewhat in the latter part of 1991. While tens of
thousands of Egyptian workers fled Iraq during the Gulf crisis, many have
found work in Libya and in the Gulf states. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have
been replacing their Palestinian and Yemeni expatriate workers with
Egyptians. Improved ties between Cairo and Tripoli have opened the way for
many Egyptians to work in Libya.
Economically, Egypt is far from being out of the woods, but circumstances
are certainly more promising than they have been for several years. Foreign
currency reserves, according to latest BIS figures, stand at about Dollars
3bn and prospects are for a continuing healthy reserve position, provided
tourism holds up, oil prices remain at more or less present levels and aid
flows are sustained.
But few would deny that much work needs to be done to promote real economic
growth along with efforts to encourage non-traditional exports to reduce a
chronic trade imbalance. As an IMF official observed: 'The Egyptian
authorities need to work on the real sector of the economy. They have done
what they can on the monetary side.'

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (3): Disciplines in a crowded marketplace -
A tighter credit regime is exposing several banks' inherent weaknesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S bankers have experienced a tough year with the government tightening
credit restrictions and introducing new IMF-inspired prudential requirements
that are tending to expose the inherent weakness of a number of banks.
The successful introduction of a treasury bill auction system last January
has squeezed liquidity in the market. Life has been made more difficult for
banks with small deposit bases and thus over-dependent on what has proved an
extremely tight interbank market. The latter part of 1992 has been marked by
debate about a new law, aimed at strengthening Central Bank control over the
financial sector which has long required more sophisticated monitoring.
Influential figures in Egypt's financial circles have criticised sharply
provisions in the proposed new law that would give the Central Bank the
power to order the liquidation or merger of banks under its jurisdiction.
Other provisions that would effectively invest the Central Bank with veto
power over board members and managers of banks have also been attacked by
those who claim that such measures run counter to the spirit of
liberalisation that the government claims to have embraced.
Representatives of some 18 foreign currency branch banks - those that are
empowered to deal only in foreign currency - were especially disappointed
that the new banking law did not contain provisions that would allow them to
trade in local currency. These banks, most of which were established in the
1970s, have been agitating for years for their charters to be broadened, but
in spite of repeated undertakings to look favourably on their requests, the
government seems reluctant to redefine the role of institutions in an
already crowded marketplace.
Foreign branches, which had sought to develop a niche for themselves by
pioneering debt swaps, have been frustrated in recent months by delays in
official approvals. Officials say they have been seeking to ensure that new
business does not contradict the spirit of the May, 1991 Paris club
agreement under which a substantial portion of Egypt's official debt was
rescheduled on extremely favourable terms.
Egypt's banking system, which includes about 38 commercial banks, is
dominated by the 'big four' public sector banks - National Bank of Egypt
(NBE), Banque Misr, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria. With their vast
branch networks these dwarf the rest of the banking sector, accounting for
more than two thirds of total bank deposits.
After many years of prevarication, the government has at last acted to
strengthen the balance sheets of these state-controlled banking giants to
bring their operations into line with Bank of International Settlements
criteria. Not least of steps adopted is the injection of new capital into
each of the 'big four' with increases of LE1bn apiece for NBE and Banque
Misr, and LE750 million for Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria.
All banks in Egypt, and most particularly the four 'core' institutions, are
also being obliged to meet BIS criteria for doubtful and non-performing
loans. Previously, extremely lax definitions applied. At this stage there is
no talk of privatising the financial sector, but in time, assuming that
Egypt's stuttering liberalisation process proceeds, there is an increasing
likelihood of calls for divestiture of state-controlled financial
institutions.
Government efforts, under IMF pressure, to bring capital adequacy
requirements into line with international standards plus the enforcement of
much tougher provisioning requirements will make these debt-laden
institutions more appealing to investors. Most active in new private sector
business are the bigger joint venture banks led by Misr International Bank
(MIBank) in which First National Bank of Chicago has an interest. Other
market leaders include Egyptian American Bank, 49 per cent owned by American
Express, and the NBE-owned Commercial International Bank.
For much of the year, the banking sector has been overshadowed by the Bank
of Commerce and Credit International scandal which has had a direct fallout
in Cairo where the joint venture BCCMisr (BCCI's stake in BCCM is 49 per
cent) had placed 80 per cent or Dollars 466m of its hard currency deposits
with its parent. The authorities appointed an administrator in an effort to
salvage something from the wreckage.
Hopes of recouping lost funds depend partly on the importance Abu Dhabi's
ruling family - the owners of BCCI  - attach to fraternal relations with
Egypt. President Mubarak has, more than once, appealed to Abu Dhabi's Sheikh
Zayed to make good the losses. Among local banks, the Saudi-owned Faisal
Islamic Bank was also particularly hard-hit by the BCCI disaster. Faisal
Islamic lost millions in the 1980s due to failed BCCI-managed operations in
the Cayman Islands. Faisal Islamic managers insist losses were much less
than the Dollars 360m reported.
IMF officials monitoring Egypt's introduction of financial sector reforms
say they are well-satisfied with developments. They are especially pleased
with the operations of the treasury-bill auction system. By the end of the
year there was some LE7bn of stock outstanding with interest rates around 20
per cent. The new system is credited with achieving its aim of soaking up
liquidity, and together with the introduction of tight credit ceilings had
helped somewhat to counter inflation.
Businessmen have complained long and loud about the IMF-inspired credit
squeeze, but the tight money policy appears to be achieving one of the IMF's
principal aims: encouraging local investors to repatriate funds lodged
abroad. While evidence at this stage is largely anecdotal there are positive
indications that capital flight is at last being reversed.
Central Bank figures indicate one other promising trend: the beginning of a
process of a 'de-dollarisation' in response to the liberalisation of
interest rates. The latest CBE report noted that in 1990-91, savings in
local currency increased by 20.7 per cent compared with 19.8 per cent the
previous year. Growth in deposits in foreign currency was down to 9.5 per
cent against 16 per cent in 1989-90.
Perhaps the most striking reform of the past year has been the floating of
the Egyptian pound well ahead of the February, 1992 deadline agreed with the
IMF. Surprisingly, and certainly not altogether to the IMF's liking, the
pound has remained remarkably stable in the past year, trading at around
LE3.30 to the dollar.
This is attributable to Egypt's much improved reserve position, to the
liberalisation of interest rates and to the government's tight money policy.
The IMF and World Bank had been calculating that the pound would drift lower
against foreign currencies, thus improving Egyptian competitiveness.
The new year may produced greater fluctuations as the new exchange system
settles down. The introduction of official money changers may also enliven
things. The banks themselves will be looking to a further easing of credit
restrictions.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (2): At centre stage again - Egypt resumes
its geopolitical pre-eminence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali was elected Secretary General of the United
Nations last November - the first Arab to fill the post - it capped a highly
satisfactory year for Egyptian diplomacy.
Mr Boutros-Ghali's appointment to the key UN job followed the election last
May of Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, the former foreign minister, to the Secretary
Generalship of the Arab League. At no time in the four decades since the
1952 revolution and the coming to power of Gamal Abdel Nasser have Egyptians
been quite so prominent in international forums.
The return of the Arab League headquarters to the banks of the Nile after an
absence of more than a decade and the election of Dr Meguid confirmed a
trend apparent for some time: the re-emergence of Cairo as the regional
diplomatic hub.
Not that the Arab League plays much of a role these days: its effectiveness
has been diminished by continuing divisions in the Arab world left over from
the Gulf crisis. Iraqi malevolence makes it difficult for the League to take
initiatives across a fairly broad range of issues, but officials note in
defence of the organisation that it is better for Baghdad to be involved in
deliberations than for it to be left out in the cold.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's new foreign minister, is seeking to energise Egyptian
diplomacy both at a regional and at an international level in the light of
upheavals in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, and Europe's move to a
unified market this year. To this end, Mr Moussa raised with European
Community foreign ministers in Brussels in December the possibility of
creating a new regional forum for European states and non-community
countries of the Mediterranean littoral - stretching from Morocco in the
west to Turkey in the east.
Egypt wants the 'Mediterranean forum' to provide a framework for the
discussion of such issues as security, trade and the environment. Mr Moussa
made it clear in an interview that Egypt was keen to hitch itself to
European security arrangements being developed under the umbrella of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 'I believe that the
essence of new thinking and new security in the Middle East is to link up
with the world. And you cannot do that without cooperating with Europe and
establishing a new forum based on the Mediterranean region,' he declared.
Egypt is also deeply concerned about disruption to its traditional East Bloc
markets caused by the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the dramatic
economic changes among the old Comecon group of states, many of whom were
among Egypt's most reliable trading partners. Egypt's cosy state-to-state
trading relationship with the Soviet Union amounting to about Dollars 1bn
annually in two-way barter trade is now an institution of the past.
Mr Moussa and his advisers fear that Egypt will be slow to respond to these
dramatic changes and trade will suffer as a consequence. The new foreign
minister, who is in his fifties, perhaps understands better than his
predecessors the link between an effective foreign policy and sound economic
policies at home. Egypt's economy, he says will have to become 'more
international in its outlook'.
Egypt's traditional consensus role in Arab forums has been most conspicuous
in its efforts to help facilitate the US-sponsored Middle East peace
process. The only Arab state to have established relations with Israel,
Egypt continues to devote considerable diplomatic energy to faltering
attempts to promote Middle East peace. Cairo was helpful in securing Syrian
and thus Lebanese cooperation, and also used its weight to back Palestine
Liberation Organisation moderates in their decision to sanction the
participation of Palestinian surrogates in negotiations with Israel.
The PLO leader, Mr Yasser Arafat - snubbed by Egypt because of his support
of Iraq in the Gulf crisis - is a regular visitor, once again, in Cairo.
Egypt's return to prominence in Arab forums has been facilitated by it close
relations with both Saudi Arabia, the smaller Gulf Arab states, and with
Syria. The Cairo-Riyadh-Damascus axis, which solidified during the Gulf
crisis, is, for the time being, dominant in Arab forums.
Egypt's relations with Jordan have also begun a slow improvement, but
mistrust persists over King Hussein's role in the crisis. Egyptian leaders
suspect that he was more deeply implicated in Iraqi designs than he has been
willing to admit. Cairo's other regional concerns have focused on the
fortunes of its two closest neighbours: Libya and Sudan.
A conspicuous feature of relations with Tripoli has been Egyptian efforts to
calm international anger over allegations that Libyan agents bombed US and
French passenger planes in 1988 and 1989. Egypt, which has worked extremely
hard to encourage Libya's Colonel Muammar Gadaffi to moderate his behaviour,
fears that a sanctions campaign will undo its efforts. It was noticeable
that Col. Gadaffi turned to Cairo for support when international pressure
grew.
Egypt's concerns about neighbouring Sudan go deeper, since the stakes are
much higher. Further upheaval in Sudan and possible growing antagonism
towards Egypt could threaten its lifeblood, the Nile, whose twin tributaries
join at Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. Cairo believes that a weak military
leadership in Sudan is being manipulated by the militant Islamists, and this
poses serious dangers not only for internal Sudanese stability, but may lead
to a further worsening of relations with Sudan's neighbours.
Egyptian leaders have never made any secret of the fact that they would not
hesitate to go to war to protect the nation's sole water source. the
question is to how much circumstances need to deteriorate in Sudan before
Egypt felt obliged to intervene.

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (1): The fruits of moderation - Egypt's
finances and its international standing are now stronger than for several
decades. But it still faces chronic economic and social problems and its
rulers, constantly challenged by Islamic radicals, cannot afford to rest on
their laurels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak permitted himself some justified self-congratulation
last October. He had weathered 10 difficult years in office that began so
unpromisingly with the assassination of Anwar Sadat by Islamic militants.
Few people at the time of Sadat's assassination gave the then relatively
unknown Hosni Mubarak much prospect of remaining in power for very long.
Ten years later Mr Mubarak appears firmly in command, although recent events
in Algeria, where the democratic process was aborted by the military to
prevent fundamentalists gaining power through the ballot box, show that in a
volatile region nothing can be taken for granted.
For an Egyptian leadership, which is engaged in promoting its own slow
process of democratisation, the lessons of Algiers will be pondered
carefully. Indeed, Mr Mubarak had been privately critical of what he
regarded as Algeria's hasty transition from one-party rule to putative
multi-party state.
In impromptu remarks to the Financial Times last June he revealed that he
had warned his friend, Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, of the dangers,
but his warnings had not been heeded.
The implication of Mr Mubarak's observations then were clear: Egypt would
continue to proceed cautiously with its own democratisation. It would not
bow to outside pressures to hasten political liberalisation. The danger in
the wake of Algeria's troubles is that a president, known and often
criticised for his gradualism in all things, will be even more cautious
about economic and political reform.
Egypt has its own restless militant tendency to contend with, and there have
been signs recently of the government bowing to Islamic pressure by
prosecuting authors and banning publications frowned on by the radicals.
If it were not for concerns about a fundamentalist trend that appears once
again to be entering one of its periodic upswings, Egypt's leadership could
view the future with optimism after a successful year on various fronts.
Among all regional states, Egypt perhaps gained most from the Gulf crisis.
Its commitment of about 20,000 troops, including a tank division, to the
liberation of Kuwait and its role in holding together the anti-Iraq alliance
in Arab forums were handsomely rewarded.
About half Egypt's foreign debt of Dollars 50bn was either forgiven outright
or rescheduled on favourable terms. Its balance of payments is healthier
than for several years thanks to increased oil revenues, stronger exports
and a post-Gulf crisis rebound in tourism, its main currency earner.
After living from hand to mouth for most of the past decade with the Central
Bank barely able to fund grain imports on occasions, Egypt is now in a much
healthier position financially: according to IMF/World Bank estimates
reserves stood at about Dollars 3bn at the end of 1991, sufficient for six
months of imports. One effect of Egypt's much improved balance of payments
was that the value of the Egyptian pound stabilised after falling some 60
per cent against foreign currencies in the past five years. Late in the year
the pound was floated well ahead of a February, 1992 IMF deadline - a
further sign of confidence.
The unifying of the foreign exchange market coincided with a favourable IMF
review of progress in Egypt's implementation of a May, 1991 reform
programme. The IMF granted Egypt a second tranche of a SDR 272m standby in
recognition of it having achieved interim monetary growth and budget deficit
targets. By the end of the year inflation, driven by IMF-inspired price
increases, appeared to have abated somewhat. There were also anecdotal
indications that the Egyptian economy, burdened by a lingering recession,
had begun to grow again, although it was too soon to assess the strength of
the pickup in economic activity.
While Egypt won praise from international lending institutions and aid
donors for adhering to IMF monetary reforms, it was censured for slow
progress in implementing a Dollars 300m World Bank sponsored structural
adjustment programme. Critics worried that the benefits of the combined
IMF-Bank reforms would be squandered.
Tardiness in pressing ahead with the liberalisation and rationalisation of
the state sector, including a process of 'de-nationalisation', is seen by
both western economists and the local business community as slightly
worrying. Fears are being expressed that Egypt might falter in its reform
efforts after having cleared the first, namely the IMF, hurdle.
In the past the country's rulers have tended to rest on their laurels after
imminent economic disaster had been averted by further injections of aid
money or another round of debt rescheduling. But even at this moment of
singular good fortune, Egyptian policymakers cannot afford to be complacent.
Any optimism must be tempered by the size of the country's manifest
problems, including a chronic overdependence on imported foodstuffs, lack of
real economic growth and huge populations pressures. A critical shortage of
managerial talent is not the least of the problems besetting the structural
reform programme.
The authorities are right to be nervous about the consequences of reforms
that bring further hardship to an already hard-pressed populace. Steep price
rises for many basic commodities, as Egypt seeks to comply with IMF
requirements for reductions in subsidies, have provoked fairly widespread
grumbling, although no serious public disturbances.
The question is how much more people can tolerate before general unhappiness
spills over into public agitation. Memories of the 1977 bread prices riots
are still relatively fresh in the minds of the leadership and go some way
towards explaining its innate caution.
Egypt has been lucky that the large unofficial economy (many Egyptians have
two, three or even four jobs) has helped cushion the most painful effects of
reform. According to some estimates the so-called underground economy
accounts for as much as 25 per cent of GPD.
While Egypt's image in the West remains extremely positive, it has been
tarnished somewhat by continuing reports of human rights abuses under the
emergency laws that have been in force since President Sadat's
assassination. These laws allow detention without trial for protracted
periods, and have been used mercilessly against Islamic extremists.
While Egypt's efforts this past year to bring about economic reform and at
the same time improve living standards have met with mixed results, its
foreign policy achievements have been impressive. The election of Dr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali as the new United Nations secretary-general crowned a highly
successful year that saw the return after a 12 year absence of the Arab
League headquarters to the banks of the Nile, and the installation of an
Egyptian, Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, as the League's secretary-general.
Egyptian diplomacy was also active and effective in efforts to bring about a
Middle East peace conference in Madrid, and in continuing attempts to
promote a settlement. Cairo has used its close relations with Damascus and
with Riyadh to good effect in this regard. Few would argue that the
diplomatic focus of the Arab world has returned to Egypt, and Egyptian
diplomats are once again playing their traditional consensus role at the
heart of Arab politics.
It is not the smallest of paradoxes that while Egyptian officialdom
continues to show an aptitude for diplomacy, the reverse is the case with
economic management.

Kalamazoo, the business systems and specialist print manufacturer, has
completed the sale of its shares in Great American Software to Meca Software
for Pounds 4.3m.
That will be satisfied as to Pounds 2.6m cash, 800,000 of Meca loan notes
and 100,000 shares. A further 140,000 shares will be issued subject to the
performance of the company.
The seasonal nature of GAS's trade, combined with the depressed US economy,
meant that it would show, as a discontinued activity, a substantial loss in
Kalamazoo's interim results to January 31 1992.
Accordingly, the effect on Kalamazoo's balance sheet of the disposal was
expected to be about neutral.

FT  21 JAN 92 / New Treuhand marketing strategy aims to lift sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency, is adjusting its marketing
strategy in an attempt to sell the remaining companies in its portfolio by
the end of the year, writes Andrew Jack.
The 6,000 former East German enterprises still held by the agency will be
sold in sectors to allow more targeted advertising to potential buyers,
starting this week with the wood and furniture industry.
Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen, the accountancy and consulting firms,
have been appointed to act as 'mail boxes' to receive inquiries from
potential international bidders.
The initiatives are in part a reflection of Treuhand disappointment that it
has not had more international interest in the sales.
Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen will receive a small payment for their
service, and will provide basic information on businesses being sold.

<TEXT>
The first batch of over 600 Sri Lankans who fled to India to escape civil
war in their country left for home yesterday heading for an uncertain
future, Reuter reports from Madras.
In Colombo, aid workers expressed concern over the fate of more than 30,000
who have volunteered to return home. They said that the conditions that had
forced more than 200,000 Tamils to flee fighting between Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) guerrillas and government troops had not changed
sufficiently to justify their return.
India's southern Tamil Nadu state, which accommodated most of the Sri Lankan
refugees, had put them under close surveillance after the May 21
assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by a woman
suicide bomber, a suspected LTTE activist.

Zimbabwean riot police were called out yesterday to control hundreds of

striking rail workers were dismissed, AP reports from Harare. There were no
reports of injuries.
Some 6,000 semi-skilled workers began striking last Tuesday, a work stoppage
that has cost the indebted company an estimated Dollars 1m in losses. Only
2,000 strikers heeded an order to return to work by Friday, and Mr Alvord
Mabhena, the railway chief, sacked the remaining 4,000. The strikers have
demanded increases of up to 13 per cent on monthly salaries and allowances.

<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S voucher privatisation programme, which aims to distribute
state-owned enterprises to the population, has been disrupted by the
activities of investment funds believed to be hoarding voucher books.
For a small fee, all Czechoslovak citizens over 18 can participate in the
mass privatisation programme by buying vouchers, which will become shares in
the new private enterprises once the programme is completed.
Since the scheme was launched, more than 300 private investments funds have
mushroomed across the country offering to invest the vouchers of citizens  -
often overwhelmed by the process and lacking basic information on the
enterprises.
Nearly 3m citizens have registered so far to take part in the voucher
programme ahead of a January 31 deadline. But recent participants have come
up against a lack of voucher books, which have seemingly disappeared
although 8m were printed.
Mr Tomas Jezek, privatisation minister for the Czech republic, recently
accused investment funds of buying up the books to entice would-be
participants to become customers.
These funds will hold the vouchers for customers and take investment
decisions for them. The greater the number of customers, the larger the
profit from customer fees.
All big banks have set up investment funds in Czechoslovakia, alongside
managers and individuals able to raise Kcs1m (Dollars 300,000).
To tackle the problem of missing voucher books, Mr Vaclav Klaus, federal
finance minister, announced that registration cards would be issued until
books were either brought back into circulation or reprinted.
But the hoarding has highlighted the lack of regulation in the process and
investment scandals could take their toll on the government as next June's
elections approach.

FT  21 JAN 92 / (CORRECTED) International Capital Markets: European
programme trading up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 22nd January 1992) appended to this article.
PROGRAMME trading by UK and continental European fund managers increased
sharply last year, and is expected to rise further in the coming 12 months,
according to a study from US research and consulting group Greenwich
associates.
In its latest annual report on the UK and continental broking industries,
Greenwich says that nearly a third of UK institutional investors now use
programme trading or other portfolio restructuring services. This compares
with around a quarter the year before. Greenwich's research also highlights
that 22 per cent of British fund managers expect to start programme trading
this year.
The growth in use of stock index futures by UK institutions has mirrored the
growth in programme trading.
Research among continental European investors show an even sharper increase.
In US shares, some 38 per cent report that they engage in programme trading,
compared with only 15 per cent last year.
Other findings include:
More than half of UK institutions now use soft commission brokers. Last
year, the comparable figure was 42 per cent. Greenwich estimates that some
13 per cent of UK equity business is conducted this way. This is up from the
5 per cent of 1989, but still down on the estimated 22 per cent of trades
which US institutions channel through soft commission brokers.
The decline in net trading by UK institutions has reversed. In 1986, some 46
per cent of trades were conducted net, a proportion which had fallen to as
little as 15 per cent three years later. That proportion has increased
slightly to 17 per cent.
The typical British institution spends almost as much on continental share
trades as on British trades. Institutions which contributed to the survey
said that last year they spent an average of Pounds 1.1m in commissions on
UK trades, down slightly from the previous year and short of the record
Pounds 1.6m in 1986.
CORRECTION (PUBLISHED 22ND JANUARY 1992).
YESTERDAY'S report, 'European programme trading up sharply', was based on
research carried out by Greenwich Associates in February and March last
year, and the findings related to 1990 rather than 1991.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Dollar rally halted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacular rise of the dollar on the foreign exchange markets last week
came to an abrupt halt on Friday afternoon in London, as a wave selling cut
3 pfennigs from the value of the US currency, writes Simon London.
This was followed in New York by some well-timed intervention by the Bank of
Japan and the Federal Reserve, selling dollar against the yen. The US
currency fell to just above Y124 from Y127.45 at the close in London
This sudden decline underlined that the rally of the dollar so far this year
has been a fragile affair, driven by technical factors rather than a
reappraisal of economic fundamentals.
After all, the only optimistic news to come out of the US inthis period was
better than expected non-farm payroll data, a notoriously volatile
indicator. Other than this, the economic data has been as gloomy as that
which put the dollar in the doldrums at the end of last year. Trade figures
for November and the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey, both
of which were released on Friday, underlined the gloomy tone.
The first showed a substantial 5.5 per cent fall in imports during November
as consumer spending slumped. The latter reported a further dive in consumer
confidence in early January, undermining hopes of a change in sentiment.
In addition, co-ordinated intervention by monetary authorities highlights
the fact that a strong and rising dollar is at odds with the US governments
over-riding policy goal - to get the domestic economy moving.
This leaves participants in the currency markets asking whether the events
of Friday presage a period of more widespread interventionism by central
banks.

FT  20 JAN 92 / UAL says it faces biggest quarterly loss in its history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED AIRLINES, one of the three largest US carriers, warns that its fourth
quarter will show the 'largest quarterly loss in the company's history'.
This, said United, would 'substantially exceed the previous largest
quarterly net loss of Dollars 157m (Pounds 87.7m) recorded in the first
quarter of 1991'. That reflected terrorism fears during the Gulf war. United
added that the quarterly loss would reflect 'among other things, a
significant amount of non-recurring expenses'.
This is the second time United has warned about the fourth-quarter figures.
It suggested in December there would be a loss, although at that stage it
blamed 'a weak domestic economy and a poor pricing environment'. On Friday
the company declined to say why it had reissued the warning. The figures
will be released on January 30.
United's pessimism comes in the wake of a relatively encouraging
announcement from American Airlines, one of its big rivals, last week.
American suggested that some of the extreme ticket-discounting on domestic
fares was abating, a sentiment which others echo. Although AMR, the parent
company, posted a Dollars 124.9m loss in the final three months, the news
prompted share price gains in the sector generally.
United's shares have been particularly strong lately, as analysts have
warmed to its Dollars 135m purchase of Pan Am's Latin American routes.
Shares in UAL, the parent company, which were about Dollars 117 ahead of
this transaction, closed on Friday at Dollars 156, down Dollars 3. The Pan
Am assets may give United the most comprehensive global route structure; it
already has a fairly strong Pacific presence and has been enhancing
operations in Europe.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Monday Profile: Courage of a Russian reformer - Yegor
Gaidar, the man with the gargantuan task of reshaping the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are a lot of risk factors, but they don't guarantee us a fatal blow.'
This is how Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first Russian leader to conduct market
reform rather than talk about it, calmly sums up his terrifying job.
Indeed, the first quality which strikes you about this short, balding,
35-year-old economist, who is deputy prime minister in charge of economic
reform, is his steely courage. A superpower bristling with nuclear weapons
has collapsed, production is in free-fall, hyperinflation looms, the army is
large and hungry, and he has very little time to switch the country to a
market system after 74 years of Communist rule.
'I feel like a chess player who is not only playing a very difficult match,
but who is also surrounded by other players who may at any time sweep my
pieces off the board,' this former journalist told the Foreign
Correspondents' Association in Moscow over dinner last week.
There are ambitious politicians waiting in the wings to exploit the
unpopularity of his reforms for personal gain. Some of the country's best
economists - including Mr Nikolai Petrakov and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, who
themselves were unable to achieve any results while advising Mr Gorbachev -
have sourly rallied against him.
And with the west still nostalgic about Mr Gorbachev and the union, western
states may be tragically late in throwing their full weight behind President
Boris Yeltsin's courageous and able government.
A former economics commentator for Pravda, the Communist party daily, Mr
Gaidar is one of a group of talented young economists who were taught by
Professor Stanislav Shatalin, the veteran economist and author in 1990 of
the 500-day plan for radical reform.
A scion of the Soviet establishment - his grandfather was a popular author
of children's books and his father a rear-admiral - Mr Gaidar used his
privileged position to spend much of his career studying ways of abandoning
the system, before his rapid rise to the top.
Although some of the criticism by fellow economists is sour grapes, Mr
Gaidar himself is aware that his reforms are far from perfect. But he says
simply that there is no alternative, and he is no doubt right.
'After a lengthy period of populist policies which led this economy towards
full collapse, we are having to take responsibility for changing course and
adopting harsh measures,' he says with a suave smile. 'We never expected
such measures to be either painless or politically profitable.'
The state can no longer afford to keep up with food subsidies because
producer prices are out of control. It cannot print any more money without
totally destroying the currency. The financial crisis is too pressing to
wait for structural reforms, which should have been started a few years ago
by predecessors who preferred to talk about market reforms rather than act
on them.
Endowed with a sort of Levantine charm - his oriental sounding surname is a
nom de guerre picked up by an ancestor - Mr Gaidar has had to acquire basic
survival skills quickly. For somebody who has never been in politics before,
he has learned fast.
After a first gaffe - when he declared that the present central bank chief
would be replaced before he had even agreed to go - Mr Gaidar is polite and
tactful about everyone, and that includes Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
thuggish parliamentary chairman who has taken no such pains when attacking
him.
Although still a little clumsy in public, Mr Gaidar is articulate and
endowed with a biting sense of humour and a coolly rational mind.
Almost comically dwarfed by the rostrum from which he defended his policies
in parliament last week, Mr Gaidar warned deputies that the greatest threat
to his reforms was that of panic.
He said that it would be panic to reimpose price controls, loosen credit
policy, increase public spending, give in to limitless pay claims and lower
taxes at a time when financial stabilisation was a key priority.
With price liberalisation under way, the government is getting to grips with
privatisation and the next stages of financial stabilisation (including a
tight budgetary and monetary policy). It also has to deal with the defence
industry's conversion to civilian uses - defence procurement this year is
down to 15 per cent of last year's level.
The task is gargantuan, but not hopeless. The Russian people, exhausted by
five years of wavering, may well give this government a chance, simply
because it is taking action.
Mr Gaidar, who leaves his government dacha at 7.30am and gets home from the
office at 11.30pm, is putting everything into the job. 'I have no news of
how my family is doing because I hardly ever see them.'
Unlike previous Communist administrations, this government is not only
serious about market reforms, but competent and well-advised.
Mr Yeltsin has so far stoically stood by the government he appointed last
October. But the Russian government's pleas for massive financial help to
achieve results - going behind humanitarian aid which will be discussed in
Washington later this week - should not be discarded as in the past.
Much of the government's success depends on its ability to keep the
population fed with basics such as bread, and to cushion it against the
worst effects of reform until market mechanisms can begin to take effect.
In contrast to the chaos and back-biting of the previous administration,
this government is also refreshing for its unity - the result of Mr Gaidar's
insistence that he should bring like-minded colleagues, many of whom are his
friends, into office with him.
Their straightforward businesslike approach - 'they want to create a
relationship of trust with the west,' as one diplomat explains - has cheered
western interlocutors.
However, they are not without their domestic critics. Reproaching them for
their youth and lack of political experience, Vice-President Alexander
Rutskoi, an Afghan war hero with no knowledge of economics, recently
referred to the cabinet as 'little boys in pink shorts'.
The problem with Russia, as it tries to switch to market economics after
decades of socialist planning, is that its older people tend to have the
wrong kind of experience for such an undertaking. It seems to be only the
younger generation that can adapt to both new ideas and new methods of work
 -witness the rise of the young economist, Mr Yavlinsky, to chief Soviet
economic strategist after the coup.
Such a generation gap is not new in Russia. Ivan Turgenev, the great Russian
writer, captured a similar divide in the 19th century with Fathers and Sons,
a novel contrasting the ineffectual older generation - looking for change
but tied to the old regime - and young radicals attached to western ideas.
This has produced the striking sight of Mr Yeltsin, the former party boss,
shielding with his personal authority a government whose policies he may not
understand, but which he has embraced intuitively.
The fear is that he will lose his nerve if these policies cannot show
results quickly enough; hence the feverish attempts to make the reforms
irreversible.
'The problem is not whether Gaidar lasts - because he will not last - but
how long he will last; . . . how long Yeltsin is prepared to give him
political support to carry out reforms before he becomes too much of a
political liability,' says one western diplomat.
'If he lasts until next autumn that will be ideal and enough. I don't think
he expects any more.'
Why has Mr Gaidar taken upon himself this role of sacrificial lamb?
The answer is probably for a mixture of reasons: ambition - for if he
succeeds, he will have earned a name for himself in history; conviction  -
not many economists have had the chance to conduct reforms that they have
long known to be necessary; and a dose of patriotism no doubt as well.

FT  20 JAN 92 / The real pains of withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
One can only envy the Americans. When the dollar rises sharply in thin
markets, contrary to the current game plan, there is no agonised national
debate, nor even anything which could be dignified as a policy decision. An
un-named Treasury official (aka Mr David Mulford, surely) simply rings one
of many friends in the press and remarks that there is 'no economic
justification' for the rise.
Now go long on the dollar if you dare; his next call might be to more
influential friends in the Group of Seven. The fact that they might not
share his view, and that a strong dollar is profoundly welcome to the more
embattled of America's trade partners, is immaterial. In thin markets,
talking the dollar down is usually highly effective. The subsequent fall in
the dollar can be explained as a market movement, not a national disgrace;
and so the growth of exports, currently the only positive factor in the US
economy, is protected.
Messrs Major and Lamont, inspecting the frost damage to the few green shoots
they claimed to have found, must sometimes sigh in frustration. A
devaluation would no doubt be seen as disgraceful and even cowardly; but it
would work. There is no more reliable stimulus to a depressed economy than a
gain in competitiveness, as Mrs Thatcher at least understood after the
recovery from recession and over-valuation in 1982-83. It is also
potentially inflationary; but that effect is most immediate in a fully
stretched economy. It might be very slow and muted in this depressed,
scared, price-cutting economy.
There is still an economic case for sticking to the painful road we have
chosen, but it is essentially long-term, and highly debatable at that. The
decisive objections are political; and for different reasons, a possible
future Labour government will find itself equally politically constrained.
But the decision will not be taken for want of discussion.
Meanwhile, the debate helps to sustain the pressure for a parity change,
because it is bound to make the currency markets edgy. That means higher
interest rates than would otherwise be needed, and a potential sterling
crisis every time the trade figures take a lurch into the red. And in a
vicious circle, each crisis will tend to renew the arguments. If and when
the decision is finally taken - perhaps in a final pre-monetary-union
realignment in Europe - the chancellor of the day will not be able to say,
as poor Philip Snowden did in 1932: 'Nobody told us we could do that.'
The case in favour of the hard road would be easier to support if its
proponents were blunter about just how hard it is. A frank challenge usually
gets better results than double-talk and evasion. What we are engaged in is
an attempt to change national behaviour, and especially the habit of British
employers of buying productivity improvements, or just plain peace, with
'excessive' wage increases. The excessiveness may be clear from a national
point of view, but to a company which has just raised productivity and
quality as, say, Rover has done, the figure may even look like a bargain.
The strategy is already producing the desired results in the most
internationally exposed sectors of the economy; but it is anybody's guess
how long it will take for good new habits to spread to the more sheltered
regions, and bring the averages down. (Perhaps it is this contrast which
explains why some defenders of the present exchange rate argue that we
should stick to it because it is already working, and some because it has
not had time to work.) Pessimists guess at a long depression (as in Eire);
optimists at some years of sluggish growth (as in France).
The choice may look unattractive, but it is crucial. Slow growth and fairly
stable employment are not much fun, but they are tolerable; but a long
depression would provoke both people and capital into emigration. For that
reason, the seemingly technical debate about the equilibrium exchange rate
for sterling deserves much more serious attention than it has had up to now;
it could settle the depression-versus-growth issue.
This column is not the place to get into the details; but it can list some
of the pertinent questions. The first is to ask the defenders of the present
exchange rate to produce some technical case for what they are saying. Until
now, it is the devaluers who have made all the running, attempting to
estimate what rate would not only produce an appropriate trade balance (in
surplus, that is to say, in a recession), but would tend to balance the
flows of long-term capital, so that sterling need not be indefinitely
sustained by attracting hot money. The resulting estimates of over-valuation
are in the 10-20 per cent range.
The stick-it-out school, by contrast, relies on evasion ('Policy cannot
change the real exchange rate'; or 'Nobody can know the 'right' rate,
anyway'), trade shares (flattered recently by the now-dead German boom) or
largely meaningless history. The claim that the chosen rate is in line with
the real average of the last two decades is true, but insignificant: it is
the average of a roller-coaster whose track, set by oil resources and
capital market fashions to name but two, is being reconstructed as we rise.
All we know for certain is that British money wages are still quite low, and
social costs not only below average, but likely to fall further behind the
main European economies. That is why Nissan and others continue to invest
here, and is the real long-term case for hope.
But the short-term case for despair is that British unit costs are still
rising faster than among our main competitors. Any over-valuation must be
clawed back not just by falling into line with the competition, but by
outperforming it. This means that every percentage point of over-valuation
will probably take at least a year of misery to correct; so the numbers are
vital. A government which understood this would surely be demanding a
container-load of detailed studies. Its chances in the next election but one
could depend on it.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Russia may flood aluminium market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA's desperate need for hard currency will drive it to maximise exports
of aluminium this year, adding to the turmoil in the already depressed world
industry.
Russian officials have indicated that they hope to sell 1m tonnes of the
metal, the same as last year when a sudden flood of Russian aluminium caused
extensive production cuts in the west and drove prices down to their
lowest-ever level in real terms.
Russia's plan is bound to increase pressure from aluminium companies in
North America and Europe for import quotas on Russian sales. Already nearly
1m tonnes of western aluminium smelting capacity has been or is about to
shut down, representing more than 5 per cent of available capacity.
Aluminium is used for a wide variety of products, but mainly goes to the
construction and packaging industries. Prices have fallen by 60 per cent
from the peak in 1988 and for some months have been near 50 cents a pound,
at which level 75 per cent of western world smelters are operating at or
below cost.
Concernalumini (Aluminium Company), set up recently in the Russian Republic,
has told western industry representatives that it understands problems are
being created in the west but that Mr Boris Yeltsin's government wants it to
maintain exports at a high level to earn as much foreign currency as
possible.
The new company, which has taken over most of the aluminium production
assets in the former Soviet Union, confirmed that it achieved last year's
export objective of 1m tonnes, more than three times the net exports of
300,000 tonnes in 1990. The information was given to a team from VAW
aluminium of Germany, the first delegation from the western industry to
visit their Russian counterparts this year.
Mr Karl Wobbe, VAW's management board member responsible for aluminium
production, said at the weekend that he doubted the Russian industry could
meet its export target this year because of raw material and spare parts
shortages.
'My personal impression from visiting smelters is that production will
probably go down by another 20 per cent this year after falling 10 per cent
last year,' said Mr Wobbe at the weekend.
The Russian industry has between 3.5m and 3.6m tonnes of annual aluminium
capacity, he pointed out. 'We estimate production will be down to 2.5m to
2.8m tonnes this year.'
Mr Yeltsin was worried that the domestic aluminium fabricating industry
would be starved of material and decreed that smelters in the first quarter
of 1992 must supply the domestic market with at least 70 per cent of the
tonnage supplied in the same months last year.
Mr Wobbe said smelter managers would be unlikely to comply fully with this
decree. 'They need foreign currency to pay for food for their employees and
their families and for spare parts to keep the plants going,' he said.

Even if Sir Charles Powell himself has not forgotten how many directorships

The latest batch for Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy supremo who moved to
the private sector with a vengeance in the middle of last year was announced

Sir Charles, who became a director of Jardine Matheson last August, is now
spreading himself liberally around the group. Mandarin Oriental, the luxury

FT  20 JAN 92 / Port leaves a bitter taste in Rifkind's mouth: Disagreements
over the Tees &amp; Hartlepool privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT the first privatisation of a trust port has turned into an embarrassing
debacle is clear. But is it a case of bungling on a spectacular scale? Or
has the decision simply been misunderstood?
A furore erupted when the Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority decided last
month to sell its port neither to the highest bidder nor to a
management/employee buy-out team, but to a consortium called Teesside
Holdings for Pounds 180m.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, said he was 'minded' to approve
the decision as soon as the necessary order had been approved in parliament.
Last week, however, he was obliged to bow to the protests by ordering a
departmental review of the port authority's decision.
The review, likely to take about two weeks, will need to address a number of
serious concerns. The main ones are:
Why was the port not sold to its management and employees?
The simple answer is price: the buy-out team offered only Pounds 150m
compared with Teesside Holdings' Pounds 180m. Yet price was only one of
three criteria set for the port's sale. The others were to ensure that the
port operated to the benefit of the local economy, and 'to have particular
regard to the desirability of encouraging the disposal to managers and staff
of the whole, or a substantial part, of the equity'.
Given this strongly expressed preference for a buy-out, how could Teesside's
bid have been preferred when it was offering employees an equity stake of
only 5 per cent compared with the buy-out team's 100 per cent?
One adviser close to the sale says the buy-out team misjudged the degree of
preference that would be given to a management/employee bid. It was clear
from other privatisations - for example, in the bus industry - that a bid
from a buy-out team would be worth only an extra 5 per cent or so on the
value of their bid.
'They could easily have closed the gap by bringing in a bit of outside
equity and ratcheting up a bit,' he said. But in his opinion, the buy-out
team was greedy: it wanted all the equity for itself.
Did the port authority favour Teesside by negotiating with it during the
contest?
Teesside is said to have raised its initial bid from Pounds 100m to Pounds
120m, brought in two outside investors - Powell Duffryn and 3i - raised its
bid again to Pounds 180m and changed its name to Teesside Holdings before
the bidding closed. The implication is that it received guidance from the
vendor's advisers that its original bid was deficient.
That, however, is not unusual or improper in privatisations of this kind.
Those involved in the sale say all the bidders were advised about the
competitiveness of their offers, and could have adjusted them accordingly.
Then why was the buy-out team not advised that its bid was unlikely to win?
Advisers connected with the sale says it was, but claim the management was
over-confident to the point of arrogance. 'They really committed hara-kiri
on this,' says one. 'They just wouldn't listen to what they were being
told.'
If price was the ultimate consideration, why was the port not sold to the
highest bidder?
Teesside's bid of Pounds 180m was well short of the Pounds 202m offered by
the highest bidder, Maritime Transport Services. Furthermore, MTS had
devised a scheme for putting up to 20 per cent of the equity in the hands of
management and employees, against Teesside's 5 per cent.
What counted so heavily against MTS was concern about the company's other
main activity: operating the relatively new Thamesport container terminal on
the Isle of Grain in Kent. This is incurring heavy start-up costs, which led
to fears that Tees &amp; Hartlepool's revenues could be diverted to support it.
One adviser to the sale says these fears were made known to MTS, but the
company did not adequately dispel them.
Its plans for the development of Tees &amp; Hartlepool were less ambitious than
Teesside's, exacerbating concerns that it could be planning to use the port
as a cash cow.
Set against this, however, is the fact that MTS's chairman, Mr Geoffrey
Parker, is one of the industry's most experienced leaders, and that the bid
had the backing of County NatWest and Legal &amp; General Ventures. The puzzle
is that these qualifications failed to set the authority's mind at rest.
Could Teesside's offer of seats on its board have presented the port
authority with a conflict of interest?
Teesside said that if its bid succeeded, it would bring in local expertise
by appointing one member of the port authority to its board and one local
lawyer. However commendable in motive, the effect was that the people
judging the competition knew that one of their number could benefit if
Teesside won. Furthermore, it seemed possible that the local lawyer chosen
would be from the firm advising the port authority on the bidding. The
possibility of the public perceiving a potential conflict of interest in the
offer of two places on the board makes it remarkable that it was allowed to
stand.
As with the other concerns over the sale, Mr Rifkind's problem is not just
to establish that the decision was fair, but to persuade a doubting public
that it can be seen to be fair. The second may prove more difficult than the
first.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Universities urge Lords to reject Clarke compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITY vice-chancellors are urging peers to reject a compromise over
government powers to intervene in universities when the plan is debated in
the Lords, Andrew Adonis writes.
The controversy arises from the Further and Higher Education Bill, currently
before the Lords. As originally framed, the bill gave ministers the right to
issue directions to particular institutions as they saw fit. After pressure
from universities, and backed by an all-party group of peers, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, education secretary, agreed to re-examine the issue.
However, the new clauses he has tabled - decided without consulting the
committee of vice-chancellors - narrow the proposed powers without removing
them. Under them, ministers may not intervene to direct the content of
courses of study or research, although they may limit their duration, a
power the government is keen to retain.
The committee believes the new formula still gives too much scope for
intervention. In a letter to Mr Clarke, Mr David Harrison, the committee
chairman, calls instead for the bill to specify those circumstances in which
the government may intervene. He believes intervention should 'be by way of
special directions subject to parliamentary consent'.
In the Lords today, Baroness Young, a former Conservative education
minister, will attempt to broaden the new limits set out by Mr Clarke. In
particular, she proposes that ministers should have no powers over the
admission of students or the appointment of academic staff to universities.
Six colleges of higher education in Wales have indicated that they would
like to join the University of Wales, leading to fears that the university
could break up in its present form.
Such a move could lead to some of the six colleges that comprise the federal
university seeking to set up as universities in their own right.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Savings study at odds with official figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BRITONS say they have not been saving more in the past two years,
according to a survey by Mintel, the market research company.
Official statistics have shown an increase in the savings ratio, which
measures savings as a percentage of total personal disposable income, but 70
per cent of those interviewed by Mintel say they have not started to save
more in the past year or two.
Some economists believe that the end of the house-price surge will have
encouraged people to build up financial assets. Previously, they were able
to rely on rising house prices for increases in their wealth. However, only
10 per cent of those interviewed agree with the statement: 'The end of the
house-price boom has given me the incentive to start saving again'. And 83
per cent disagree.
Of those who are saving, Mintel says that 49.9 per cent of their assets are
in the form of life assurance and pensions, compared with 32.6 per cent in
1979. The proportion of assets held in the form of securities and unit
trusts has fallen from 14.4 per cent to 11.8 per cent over the same period.
The report identifies five types of saver. The first is the 'empty-nester
investor', mainly men aged 45 to 64, living in London and the south-east and
earning more than Pounds 20,000 a year. They have high levels of ownership
of personal equity plans, pensions and high-interest accounts.
'Nervous non-savers' are predominantly women aged over 55 and earning less
than Pounds 8,000 a year. These people typically own life assurance
purchased from a salesman, but find it difficult to save.
'Careful consumers and safe savers' are often women aged over 45 and earning
less than Pounds 11,000. They save through building societies, but feel that
shares are too risky.
'No wealth, no worries' is how Mintel describes the fourth group. These
people tend to be men and single women aged under 34 who have bank or
building society accounts which allow them to withdraw money through
automated teller machines. But they feel they are no good at saving, and
like to leave financial matters to someone else.
'Tangled savers', Mintel says, are people aged between 25 and 44 who earn
more than Pounds 11,000. Although they own a wide range of investment
products, they feel they are no good at saving.
The Mintel analysis was based on a sample of 25,000 people studied by the
British Market Research Bureau.
National Savings inflow rose sharply in the nine months from March to
December, according to figures released yesterday. The total inflow of
savings was Pounds 1.88bn, up from Pounds 1.05bn in the same period a year
earlier.

FT  20 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Major may back target for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is expected to announce this week that
more than 1m people should be training for the new work-based qualifications
by 1995. He may also give the target government backing.
Mr Major will be speaking at a conference on Thursday attended by 300
industrialists and organised by the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications. The council was set up five years ago to create National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) which would be applicable to all sectors of
industry and commerce.
The choice of 1m by the council is the first time a specific target has been
set for the numbers of people expected to participate in NVQs.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, abandoned ambitious targets set for
proportions of young workers by Sir Norman Fowler, his predecessor, after
what is believed to have been the personal opposition of Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, then prime minister.
The government, however, has given its support to similar but voluntary
targets set last year by the Confederation of British Industry in
consultation with other bodies including the Trades Union Congress.
These include the attainment by 1997 of NVQs at level two, (the vocational
equivalent of four GCSEs) by at least 80 per cent of 16-to-18-year-olds. The
present figure is 45 per cent.
The UK has the lowest proportion of 17-year-olds in education among its
competitors even though the range of subjects covered by NVQs means that
they are now available to about 40 per cent of the UK national workforce.
But it is believed that fewer than 300,000 people are now involved in
training leading to NVQs. Much of the workforce and industry are ignorant of
NVQs, which are intended to provide a comprehensive and coherent framework
for vocational qualification. At present most are for jobs below management
level, but it is intended that the framework will extend to management and
professional jobs.
According to a survey published by the council, British workers are more
receptive than ever to work-related qualifications.
The council said that was a big improvement over previous studies, in which
40 per cent of workers said they could see no benefit in undertaking
vocational qualifications.

FT  20 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Lucas accused over centralised pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS of the AEU engineering union have accused Lucas, the aerospace and
automotive group, of returning to centralised pay bargaining in order to
force through a 3 per cent pay offer in most of its big factories. Lucas
abandoned national bargaining in 1989.
Mr Ray Griffiths, an AEU regional official, said that decentralisation was
'a complete joke this year'.
In recent years there have been significant differences between the offers
made and the deals eventually agreed at Lucas's 40 plants.
Lucas said the decision to decentralise pay had been correct and had not
been reversed even if there was still sometimes a 'going rate' that applied
to many plants.
Mr Griffiths said that in his area of the Midlands three plants - Lucas
Aerospace Marston Green, Lucas Automotive Holford, and Lucas Kienzle
Instruments - had all been offered a 'final' 3 per cent pay rise. Other
plants that have also been offered 3 per cent include Lucas Aerospace
Netherton and Lucas CAV. Mr Griffiths said he had not heard of a Lucas plant
that had been offered anything else.
Most plants seem to be settling around the 3 per cent mark although a few,
including Lucas Aerospace Netherton, are balloting on industrial action. A
few others have won more than 3 per cent as part of local productivity
deals.
Some pay analysts will see the Lucas case as further evidence that
decentralisation has been more apparent than real over recent years.
Three quarters of pay rises in December and January were between 4 per cent
and 6.9 per cent with the majority between 5 per cent and 5.9 per cent,
according to the latest settlement data from Incomes Data Services.

<TEXT>
FEWER than one in 200 board members in Britain's top 1,300 quoted companies
are women, according to figures in the forthcoming issue of Crawford's
Directory of City Connections.
Ms Anita Roddick of Body Shop, the toiletries retailer, is the only female
managing director, according to the directories subsidiary of The Economist
which publishes Crawford's. The Economist is part-owned by Pearson, owner of
the Financial Times.
The analysis says there is also only one woman chief executive - Ms Ruth
Henderson at the fashion retailer Alexon Group - and five women who chair
top companies.
Women comprise 2 per cent of the total in Crawford's broader category of
'top executives'. Of 7,103 people in senior positions in listed and Unlisted
Securities Market companies, 152 are women.
Among USM companies, the proportion of women at the top is slightly higher
than in larger, listed companies.
Four of the 330 USM companies have female managing directors. They are Ms
Linda Serr at Honeysuckle Group, the clothing wholesaler; Ms Karen Jones at
Pelican Group, the restaurant group; Ms Margarita Hamilton at Swanyard
Studios, the music publisher and owner of recording studios; and Ms Anne
Bruh at Frank Usher, the clothes maker. Two women shared the position of
managing director of a USM company with their husbands.
Almost all the companies where women are in the most senior positions are in
fashion, toiletries, restaurants or children's goods.
The directory shows that 71, or 5.5 per cent, of 1302 company secretaries of
quoted companies are women.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Scots election campaign kicks off

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERAL election cam-paign opened in Scotland on Saturday night with a
noisy public debate on the country's constitutional future between the four
Scottish party leaders.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, was booed and for a time drowned out by an
audience of 2,500 in Usher Hall, Edinburgh. He mounted a defence of the
union and offered the other leaders discussions on ways of improving the
workings of the present system of rule.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, was also subjected to booing and
slow handclapping from an audience that contained disproportionately large
numbers of Scottish National party members. He said Labour's plan for a
Scottish parliament would be the greatest change to the British constitution
in 300 years. It would be set up as soon as possible after the election of a
Labour government and would have saved Scotland from the poll tax and the
opting out of hospitals.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the
Conservative administration in Scotland had become 'wilfully out of touch
with the wishes of the people'.
The scheme for a Scottish parliament agreed between the Liberals and Labour
in the Scottish constitutional convention offered proportional
representation.
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, proved the most
effective performer. He said that no one would make a better job of running
Scotland than the people who lived there. No independent Scottish government
would have allowed British Steel to destroy the Scottish steel industry.
Labour and the Liberals offered Scotland 'a plasticine government'.

Bass, Courage, Allied-Lyons, Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle - to explain
why beer prices have been rising faster than inflation.
Brewers claim the rises were largely due to increases in duty and VAT, which
added up to 7p to the price of a pint, and to the costs of complying with
government orders to restructure their pub estates.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Charities seek relief from VAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 250m annual burden of value added tax on charities is a
disincentive to voluntary activity, the Charities' Tax Reform Group has told
the government.
Many charities lose the equivalent of 10 per cent or more of their donations
in unrecoverable VAT. This, says the group, discourages volunteers and may
explain the fall in financial support.
The group is proposing a system of VAT rebates similar to relief for
councils and health authorities. Under the proposal, charities would pay VAT
like commercial organisations but be able to recover an equivalent amount
annually.

NISSAN UK, the former distributor of Nissan vehicles, has launched a price
war against Nissan Motor, the Japanese vehicle maker, Kevin Done writes.
Nissan Motor took control of its UK distribution operations on January 1
after removing the franchise from Nissan UK following a legal battle.
Nissan UK, the privately owned company controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, still
has considerable stocks of new Nissan vehicles. It is offering a base model
for an on-the-road price of Pounds 5,595, which it claims is more than
Pounds 700 below the cheapest model sold by Nissan Motor in the UK.
Nissan Motor is seeking to prevent Nissan UK from using the Nissan name and
logo in marketing vehicles.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Pit leasing plan not yet finalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of mine-workers planning to lease British Coal's disused
Monktonhall colliery have yet to complete their business plan, in spite of
earlier claims to have secured financial backing.
British Coal agreed last month to negotiate leasing the colliery near
Edinburgh to Monktonhall Mineworkers, a company set up by former British
Coal miners and pit managers. It would be the first time British Coal has
leased a deep mine.
Consortium members have frequently told local newspapers over the past two
years that backing for the project from financial institutions was secured.
Last month The Scotsman newspaper quoted Mr Jackie Aitchison, chairman of
Monktonhall Mineworkers, as saying the bid had the backing of financial
institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland and County NatWest.
But Mr Ian Durie of Price Waterhouse, the accountants, who is advising the
company, said these statements were incorrect and could be attributed to the
miners' financial inexperience. Financial institutions had said they would
look at the project when the business plan was complete.
Mr Durie said the company had its first meeting with British Coal since the
December announcement last week, and had asked for additional information.
'Once we receive that information we will finalise our business plan which
will be submitted to potential sources of finance,' he said. 'No offers of
funding are in place because we are not in a position to ask institutions
for money until the terms are known.'
Royal Bank of Scotland said it had examined the project, but stressed that
it was not involved in providing financial backing.
County NatWest Ventures said it had 'in no way committed itself to financing
the company', but would look at the project if the business plan were
completed.
3i, the venture-capital group, said it had always made clear it would look
at the business plan once it was complete and had been 'devastated' by
earlier newspaper reports that it had promised finance.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Pre-Christmas sales dismay retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLUME of pre-Christmas sales was sharply lower than retailers had hoped
for, in spite of heavy price discounting, while retail sales this month are
expected to fall for the first time since June last year.
This is the message from the latest Distributive Trades Survey conducted by
the Confederation of British Industry.
Retailers report that sales in December were fractionally up on a year ago,
but by much less than had been anticipated in the November survey.
The heavy price discounting seen throughout last month did not produce the
hoped-for boost, said Mr Nigel Whittaker, survey panel chairman.
Moreover, what sales there were involved consumers moving their purchases
forward from this month to December. 'As a result, retailers now expect
sales to weaken in January,' Mr Whittaker said.
The survey, conducted between December 16 and January 8, shows that 39 per
cent of retailers reported sales last month above the level of the same
month the year before, while 34 per cent reported lower sales. This gives a
positive balance of 5 percentage points, compared with a positive balance of
28 points for those who had been expecting higher sales last month.
Taking the distributive trades as a whole, covering 15,000 outlets in the
wholesale and motor trades as well as retailers, the picture was even more
gloomy. Overall, 31 per cent of traders reported higher sales in December
than the year before, with 38 per cent reporting lower sales. The negative
percentage balance of 7 points comes after three successive months in which
sales were reported to be up on the same month the previous year.
Among retailers, grocers and chemists reported continued year-on-year growth
in sales, while off-licences and retailers of footwear and durable goods all
reported sales volumes below those of the previous year. Clothing retailers
experienced a particularly sharp turn-around after two months of sales
growth.
Only 25 per cent of retailers expect sales this month to be higher than a
year ago, with 31 per cent expecting lower sales. This balance of
expectations suggests that overall sales will fall this month for the first
time since June. Off-licences and booksellers expect the largest declines.
Modest sales growth and falling expectations for trade this month have led
retailers to cut back both on stocks and on wholesale orders. A higher
proportion of retailers reported placing lower orders with suppliers last
month than in December the previous year, and similar numbers expect to
reduce orders this month.
Lower orders from retailers have already bitten into wholesale sales, which
have slipped below the depressed levels of December 1990 after three months
of year-on-year growth. A total of 27 per cent of wholesalers report higher
sales last month compared with 37 per cent reporting lower sales. The
negative balance of 10 points remains above the low of a negative balance of
48 percentage points in February.
Sales in the motor trades remain poor and are expected to deteriorate again
this month, although at a slower rate than last year. Most report lower
sales last month, although the negative balance of 47 points is an
improvement on the low of a negative balance of 89 points in May of last
year, while sellers of parts and accessories report sales last month up on
the year before.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Change in urban policy signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the environment secretary, is considering setting up
an urban development corporation in Birmingham.
Such a move would mark a further shift in the government's urban
regeneration policy. The 11 existing urban development corporations, which
are given funds to stimulate local economic revival independent of local
authority control, have been told to prepare for their own demise.
During the 1980s the corporations were the government's main tool for
promoting the regeneration of rundown urban areas. Latterly the government
has focused regeneration efforts on City Challenge, with local authorities
drawing up development schemes and competing for central funds.
The new corporation would be in an area of 2,350 acres on the east of the
city close to Spaghetti Junction known as Birmingham Heartlands, whose City
Challenge bid last year failed. Birmingham Heartlands is the name given to
an urban development partnership, active in the area since 1987, which is 65
per cent owned by five construction groups - Bryant, RM Douglas, Galliford,
Tarmac and Wimpey - and 35 per cent by Birmingham City Council.
The initiative for setting up an urban development corporation appears to
have come from the council. The Department of the Environment said there had
been talks between Mr Heseltine, Sir Richard Knowles, council leader, and
Sir Reginald Eyre, chairman of Birmingham Heartlands.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Political fears hit north-west businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in north-west England is being adversely affected by
political and economic uncertainty, as well as the recession, according to
the 1991 fourth-quarter survey of nine chambers of commerce in the region.
Some manufacturers reported signs of improving exports, but domestic orders
continued to reflect low demand. But the gap between those reporting a drop
in home orders and those experiencing a rise was the smallest for the year.
Confidence fell from the third-quarter peak, with companies expecting some
upturn in the second half of this year, but from a very low base and with no
evidence or experience yet apparent to back up this belief. The survey
covered 279 manufacturers employing 63,000 people and 218 service-sector
companies with 41,000 employees, with the bulk of companies employing fewer
than 200 people each.
London's service sector is showing faint signs that it is emerging from
recession, according to the latest quarterly economic survey from the
capital's chamber of commerce and industry, Edward Balls writes.
Yet there is little evidence in the survey to suggest that a strong overall
recovery is under way, cautioned the chamber of commerce: 'The signs of
recovery in the service sector are still faint while the manufacturing
sector is still very much in recession.'
The survey of 250 companies with a total of 250,000 employees reveals that a
net positive balance of 3 percentage points of service companies are
increasing their domestic activity, against a negative balance of 23
percentage points in the previous survey.
Manufacturers remain depressed, with output falling particularly sharply in
export markets. Domestic orders remain depressed, with a negative balance of
5 percentage points reporting higher orders, against a negative balance of
18 points last survey.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Lords threat to council tax timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S aim of enacting the Council Tax Bill by the end of next
month could be at risk unless ministers make concessions to strong
cross-party alliances among peers who tomorrow start detailed discussion of
the bill.
Ensuring the legislation is completed within the next six weeks or so is
critical in terms of election timing, especially with renewed emphasis on
the possibility of an April poll.
The Tories insist that the poll tax will be abolished from April next year,
and failing to secure the bill to introduce its replacement would seriously
undermine this commitment.
Tory backbench peers have already proposed changes to the bill to improve
the position of tenants in tied cottages. Changes to get a better deal for
the disabled have attracted support from both sides of the Lords. Tory and
Labour peers have also privately been voicing concern about the speed with
which the bill was dealt with in the Commons.
There are signs that peers will want to compensate for the lack of committee
discussion among MPs on the interaction of social security benefits with the
council tax discount system.
There are also peers linked with interested pressure groups and charities
who are concerned their organisations did not have enough time to study the
proposals and put forward changes in the time the bill could have been
amended by the Commons.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'It is vital
that the House of Lords is able to provide detailed scrutiny of this
legislation because of the government's draconian tactics in the Commons.
'The government's business managers will be desperate to bulldoze this
through. In the interests of parliamentary democracy and local taxpayers,
the Lords should ensure a full discussion of all these important issues.'

FT  20 JAN 92 / Tories study fresh child care tax move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is examining new tax relief measures aimed at encouraging
small and medium-sized employers to participate in child care schemes
outside the workplace, it emerged yesterday.
Also under consideration are special payments or vouchers to help working
mothers pay for creches and other child care during working hours.
Budget reforms three years ago introduced tax relief on the use of
employer-provided nurseries. That could now be extended to registered
nurseries out of the workplace, allowing employees in companies that employ
too few people with small children for an in-house creche to benefit if
their employers contribute to local schemes.
Womens' interest groups are also pressing for allowances payable to mothers
whose jobs are jeopardised by the need to care for children in the
afternoons or holidays. They suggest that a payment or voucher worth about
Pounds 5 a week could help at a cost to the Treasury of as little as Pounds
10m a year.
Mrs Angela Rumbold, Home Office minister responsible for womens' issues, is
expected to see Mr John Major, the prime minister today or tomorrow to press
for measures to raise the Tories' electoral appeal to women. She said last
night: 'I believe that my Treasury colleagues are well aware of the
political importance of making sure working women are not disgruntled.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that the
government was looking again at homelessness among the mentally ill. He said
most of those released from long-term institutions over the past few years
had found accommodation.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Brooke will report to MPs on IRA murders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, will report to MPs today on the
IRA's murder of seven building workers in County Tyrone on Friday, amid
intensifying gloom about the prospects of resolving the province's political
future.
His decision to make a Commons' statement on security in Ulster follows the
arrival yesterday of an extra 500 troops in the province.
Tonight Mr John Major, the prime minister, will meet a delegation of
Unionists MPs whose anger at the terrorist outbreak is overshadowing Mr
Brooke's attempts to start 'round-table' talks.
Mr Brooke is likely to tell MPs that fresh talks before the general election
are unlikely. But he will make clear his intention to continue 'talks about
talks' to ensure that communication with all sides continues.
He faces a call from the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist
party, to resign for his alleged insensitivity in allowing himself to be
persuaded to sing a folk song on an Irish television chat show only hours
after Friday's bombing.
Although Mr Brooke may express regret today, the Northern Ireland Office
believes it would have been allowing the IRA to set the agenda if he had
withdrawn from the programme.
The IRA warned last night in a statement issued in Dublin that the policy of
attacking companies providing services and materials to the security forces
would continue.
Ministers said the decision to send extra troops to Northern Ireland was
taken before Friday's murders on the main road from Omagh to Cookstown.
Unionists continue to press for internment of IRA suspects - a measure
rejected by Mr Brooke.
Concern about security and the continuing failure on talks have forged
cross-party unity at Westminster. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader,
yesterday called for a non-partisan pact to make clear that, whoever wins
the general election, there will be no private deals with either the
nationalist or Protestant communities.
Similar support for Mr Brooke's efforts has already been offered by Mr Kevin
McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Turkey unveils populist budget to lift economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S coalition government has announced a populist economic programme in
its new budget, using tax incentives and subsidised bank credit to boost
investment and revitalise the economy.
The proposals, presented on Saturday by Mrs Tansu Ciller, chief economics
minister, envisage growth of 5.5 per cent in 1992, compared with about 2 per
cent last year. Inflation, now at 70 per cent, is to be brought down to 42
per cent.
Tax exemption for minimum wage earners will be introduced. Tax breaks and
cheap credit channelled through development banks will stimulate activity in
poorer regions, particularly the Kurdish-speaking south east.
Further tax changes for government securities are planned to attract funds
to equity markets.
The government projects a slower real depreciation of the Turkish lira,
devaluing against the dollar by 52 per cent in 1992. The average rate for
the lira over this year is forecast at 6,332.
The budget also foresees spending of TL207,000bn (Pounds 21.5bn) and
revenues of TL176,000bn. This excludes subventions to state enterprises.
Short-term borrowings by the Treasury are to be reduced. Rates of
withholding tax for government securities will be adjusted, encouraging
banks and corporations to invest in longer term paper.
Bills of maturities up to a year will be taxed at 15 per cent. Longer term
bills will remain at the 10 per cent level.

FT  20 JAN 92 / US presses growth strategy on G7 partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will continue to press its economic partners to sign up for a growth
strategy at this week's meeting in the US of finance ministers from the
Group of Seven industrial countries. However, Bush administration officials
admit they have not yet won over their European counterparts.
After President George Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
declared in Tokyo earlier this month a strategy for strengthening growth in
the world economy, US officials have sought to enlist the support of the
European members of the G7 - Germany, France, Italy and the UK.
They say there is greater recognition that their worries about the pattern
of world economic growth are justified.
'I think there is acceptance of the fact that there is a growth problem,' a
senior Treasury official said, noting that aggregate growth in the G7
countries was estimated to have been no higher than 1 per cent in 1991, and
was forecast at 2 per cent in 1992.
But the official acknowledged that Germany remained reluctant to adopt a
formal growth strategy similar to the Tokyo declaration, and that the other
European countries were severely constrained in their freedom to act without
Germany.
'A number of countries don't have much room for manoeuvre, because of the
dominating position of the Bundesbank, the D-Mark and Germany,' he said.
The US is particularly pleased with the Tokyo communique, as it commits
Japan to policies designed to promote economic growth through domestic
demand and not expanded exports.
Germany, on the other hand, has given priority to the fight against
inflation and recently raised its short-term interest rates.
Other European countries, such as France, might have preferred to cut rates,
but place greater emphasis on the sanctity of the European monetary system's
current exchange rate parities.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Why the case against devaluation is not clear-cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVALUATION has become a dirty word for most British politicians and
economists. Witness the dismissal of recent calls for sterling to be
realigned within the European exchange rate mechanism as unnecessary,
ineffective and counter-productive. But how strong is the economic argument
that lurks behind this anti-devaluation rhetoric?
The case against devaluation has three parts: in the short-term, it would
lead to higher interest rates and so delay the recovery; sterling is not
'over-valued' so there is no need to try to boost export competitiveness;
and even if sterling were over-valued, the competitiveness gains would
quickly disappear.
The first argument is almost certainly true. UK interest rates are high
because nervous investors demand a premium over high German rates. Devaluing
would further jangle their taut nerves.
But the jury is still out on whether sterling is over-valued. The UK real
exchange rate, the nominal rate adjusted for differences in national price
inflation in the traded sector, is broadly in line with its average level
over the past two decades. Yet Britain also has a trade deficit at the
bottom of a deep domestic recession. Moreover, the UK's relatively
unprofitable manufacturing sector, the main source of traded goods,
constitutes a smaller share of gross domestic product than in any other of
the six largest industrialised countries except the US.
Of course, the anti-devaluationists can concede that sterling could be
over-valued. If so, a real devaluation will be needed to divert output to
the traded sector. But this real devaluation cannot be achieved painlessly
by changing the nominal exchange rate. Devaluing sterling would merely raise
inflation, leaving the real exchange rate unchanged.
It is easy to assert that the benefits of a devaluation would be wiped out
by rising prices; but more difficult to demonstrate it. Historical evidence
is undermined by a myriad of special factors; international experiments do
not compare like with like. But neither source proves the
anti-devaluationist's case.
The left-hand chart shows the dollar and a real exchange rate using changes
in unit labour costs as a proxy for traded goods prices. These two exchange
rates moved together throughout the appreciation and subsequent depreciation
of the dollar in the 1980s. Far from fuelling high wage inflation, the
nominal depreciation was more than out-paced by the accompanying real
depreciation. Of course, the US is a large and relatively isolated economy.
For a small, open economy like Denmark, the gains would be quickly eroded by
wage and price inflation. Rising import prices would push up costs, while
consumers would pour in to buy cheap non-traded goods and services.
The impact on medium-sized economies such as Italy or the UK should lie
somewhere between these extremes, particularly as both the UK and Italy have
more inflation-prone labour markets than the US. Yet the depreciation of the
lira over the past two decades has been more than offset by higher domestic
wage and price inflation, while the relationship between the UK nominal and
real exchange rates looks more like that of the US than Italy.
One reason is the very different exchange rate regimes facing sterling and
the lira in the 1980s. The Italian real exchange rate started to move in an
opposite direction to the nominal rate once Italy joined the ERM, and
especially after 1987 when realignments became less frequent. The UK nominal
and real rates only moved apart after sterling joined the ERM in 1990.
Another reason is fiscal policy. Both the US and the UK had a contractionary
fiscal policy while their exchange rates were depreciating; but loose
Italian fiscal policy reinforced rather than offset the impact of the
depreciation on domestic demand.
Whether the response of the UK real exchange rate to a sterling devaluation
within the ERM would resemble the Italian or the US experience would depend
on whether, unlike in Italy, anti-inflationary credibility could be
maintained afterwards. This would depend on whether it was accompanied by
credibly tight monetary and fiscal policy, and changes in wage-bargaining
practices. Of course, if sterling is not over-valued then this is all idle
speculation.

<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA is urging the US to organise a large covert campaign to help
Kurdish and Shia rebels overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq,
according to US newspaper reports, writes George Graham in Washington.
The New York Times said Saudi Arabia wanted to provide air support as well
as missiles and arms to help rebels against Mr Saddam's helicopters and
tanks.
Mr Richard Cheney, US secretary of defence, yesterday described the report
as 'overblown', arguing that Mr Saddam no longer posed much of a threat to
his neighbours or to the world. 'How many American lives is toppling Saddam
Hussein worth? My answer to that is not very damn many,' he said in a
television interview, adding he believed the Iraqi leader would eventually
be ousted.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, added: 'So long as we
maintain the sanctions as we have and as our allies have and as the UN has,
I do not think he's a danger outside his country.'
General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, is reported
to have argued that increased US intervention could only be successful if it
involved at least as large a ground force as that used in Operation Desert
Storm.
Saudi officials, according to the New York Times, believe the allies would
not have to commit ground troops, but could limit their role to supplying
missiles and munitions.

MR Martin Shikuku, interim secretary of Kenya's opposition Forum for the
Restoration of Democracy (FORD), addresses at the weekend the country's
biggest political rally in two decades (above). About 200,000 people were
urged to vote out President Daniel arap Moi in elections expected later this
year.
FORD was registered as a party earlier this month after Mr Moi's Kenya
African National Union government in December bowed to mounting
international and domestic pressure and switched to pluralism, ending more
than two decades of one-party rule, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Several new groups have already been formed but FORD appears to command the
most opposition support from Kenya's multi-ethnic population of 24m.
Political analysts said the rally's turnout - one of the biggest since
independence from Britain in 1963 - illustrated the growing threat to Mr
Moi's 12-year rule.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Algeria recalls envoys to Paris and Tehran
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA has recalled its ambassadors to Iran and France in response to
criticism of last week's coup. It has also asked the Iranian ambassador to
Algiers to leave.
The deteriorating ties with the countries - one a leading Middle East ally,
the other Algeria's largest trading partner - underlines the uneasy
relationship between the new five-member Council of State and the rest of
the world.
The move came over a weekend which saw the first reported attack on security
forces since the army stepped in and cancelled elections expected to bring
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to power.
According to the Algerian news agency, a group of Islamic militants attacked
barracks at Sidi Moussa, 45km south of Algiers, on Saturday night. One
soldier was killed and two others wounded.
Algeria's decision to recall its ambassadors follows blunt criticism from
Iran, and what Algeria's new leaders regard as a patronising and unhelpful
response from France.
Iran's sharpest comment came last Thursday, when President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said: 'Algeria presents a historical test, where the supporters
of freedom and democracy failed and are really disgraced.' The close ties
with Iran go back 11 years, when Algerian diplomats succeeded in convincing
the Iranian leadership to release US diplomats who had been held hostage in
Tehran for more than 12 months.
Since 1979 Algeria has represented Iranian interests in Washington and in
the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
A suggestion by President Francois Mitterrand of France that Algeria should
renew what he called a diplomatic dialogue is regarded by government
officials as paternalistic. They also point out that as minister of the
interior at the start of the Algerian war of independence in November 1954,
he initiated a military campaign that paid little heed to democratic
principles.
Reacting to Algeria's decision to recall its Paris ambassador for
consultations, Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, said on French radio he had
confidence that Algeria's people would find 'the route to progress and
democracy'.
US officials have backed away from suggestions that Algeria might be
producing a nuclear weapon at a secret research centre. Satellite
intelligence data had been misinterpreted, they said.

REFORMIST Zhelyu Zhelev won Bulgaria's first presidential election
yesterday, according to unofficial results, ending communist hopes of
clinging to a slice of power, Reuter reports from Sofia.
His victory consolidates power in the hands of the Union of Democratic
Forces (UDF), which now controls the presidency as well as the government it
formed after winning a general election last October. But the margin of
victory was relatively narrow in both cases, reflecting the lingering appeal
of communist-inspired policies in the Balkan country of 8.5m people.
According to unofficial results which the state news agency BTA said would
be confirmed, Mr Zhelev was given about 54 per cent of the vote, edging out
Mr Velko Valkanov, his rival backed by the socialists (former communists),
who got about 46 per cent.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Georgia's rulers vow to crush ex-president: Risk of civil
war still 'quite real'

<TEXT>
GEORGIA'S ruling Military Council claimed at the weekend that it would
easily crush an attempted comeback by the republic's ousted president, but
the acting prime minister, Mr Tengiz Sigua, admitted that the risk of civil
war was still 'quite real'.
The council said supporters of Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the ex-president, had
abandoned Samtredi, one of their key strongholds about 180 miles from
Tbilisi, the capital. Tass news agency reported that Mr Gamsakhurdia was so
desperate for weapons to arm his supporters that he had launched a raid on
units of the former Soviet army.
However, gunmen, some of them dressed in paramilitary uniform, failed to
prevent a rally yesterday in Tbilisi in support of Mr Gamsakhurdia. About
3,000 people who massed at the city's railway station refused to disperse
even when the gunmen fired into the air. Instead, the protesters marched
toward them, forcing them to retreat. There were no reports of injuries.
Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the guerrilla leaders who helped chase Mr
Gamsakhurdia out of Georgia before he returned last Thursday, said that the
former leader still had popular support in the western town of Zugdidi - but
only 300 armed men to challenge the council's rule.
Undeterred by the challenge, the Military Council, which seized power to end
what it described as dictatorial rule by Mr Gamsakhurdia, has launched
long-delayed market reforms. It has decreed the privatisation of trade and
the service sector from February 1, and a start to handing land over to
peasants for the rebirth of private agriculture.
Meanwhile, General Valery Patrikeyev, commander of the Transcaucasus
district, which encompasses Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, said at the
weekend that relations with the Georgian leadership had improved since Mr
Gamsakhurdia's fall.
He said the council had revoked an earlier parliamentary decision describing
the former armed forces as an 'occupation army', and armed raids on the
Soviet army had significantly decreased.
But he said the armed forces would in no circumstances intervene to help the
Military Council defeat Mr Gamsakhurdia.
He said interference in the republic's politics would spell catastrophe  -
as it had in April 1988, when the army killed 88 people in a crackdown on
pro-independence demonstrations in Tbilisi.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Hurd backs Kiev plans to destroy nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the British foreign secretary, yesterday visited Ukraine to
discuss the republic's efforts to move to a market economy and its plans to
dismantle nuclear weapons on its territory.
Mr Hurd, who was in Kiev, the capital, between trips to Kazakhstan and
Russia, arrived at a tense time: Ukraine's relations with other members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States have been strained nearly to breaking
point by a dispute over the division of the Soviet military. Although Mr
Hurd said the issue was not raised in his discussions with the leadership,
he said 'it would be a pity' if Ukraine left the Commonwealth and urged it
to follow the example of the European Community in resolving conflicts
between member states through negotiation.
Over the weekend, in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata, Mr Hurd received
assurances from the republic's president that Kazakhstan would join the
treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and intended to become a
nuclear-free state. He received similar reassurances from Mr Leonid
Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Konstantin Morozov, minister of
defence.
Ukraine has been steadfast in its plans to dismantle nuclear weapons.
Mr Hurd praised it for setting dates for the removal and destruction of
nuclear weapons on its soil and said Nato countries 'will be willing to make
what contributions will be necessary to the progress of dismantling nuclear
weapons'.
Mr Hurd also said he was 'encouraged' by the manner in which Ukraine and
other republics were negotiating the reduction of conventional forces and
believed it would be possible for them to abide by the Vienna Agreement on
Conventional Forces in Europe.
On the economic front, Mr Hurd said Ukraine's application for full
membership in the IMF was a priority and should serve as a cornerstone in
the republic's efforts to move to a market economy.
In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said republics of the former Soviet Union
would continue to receive western economic aid only if they convinced the
west they were honouring international arms control agreements, Reuter
reports.
In an interview published yesterday, Mr Kohl spelled out a link between aid
for the CIS and assurances that agreements signed by former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev would be honoured. 'In our talks on western aid, we must
make clear to those responsible in the former Soviet republics that trust is
a precondition for help,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE has brushed aside an appeal by officers of the former Soviet army
not to break up the armed forces, saying it does not recognise the
legitimacy of a conference held by 5,000 officers who voted for an
indivisible force.
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk also reiterated his threat to leave the
fledgling commonwealth of 11 former Soviet states if Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, the commonwealth commander in chief, tries to prevent Ukraine
from pressing ahead with plans for its own army.
'If Marshal Shaposhnikov can change the decisions of the heads of state
overnight, then that kind of commonwealth of independent states will find it
very difficult to survive,' he told reporters yesterday.
Commonwealth leaders last month agreed that Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova
should be allowed to create their own armies, while vaguely-defined
strategic forces would remain under unified command.
However, the leaders did not work out a clear mechanism or timetable for
altering the composition of the former Red Army to allow for republican
armies.
Earlier, Mr Kravchuk was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying it was not
'clear at all whom the delegates to the Moscow all-army conference
represented, and by whom and on what legal basis they were elected'.
Delegates to Friday's conference voted unanimously for maintaining the unity
of the world's largest army.
Marshal Shaposhnikov has said he hoped the message from the officers would
push commonwealth leaders into solving 'military issues more seriously,
fruitfully and in a considered manner' when they meet in Minsk next month.
In an unprecedented foray into inter-republican politics, the officers'
conference voted to send a delegation to the February 14 summit. '(We) must
compel the state leaders to listen to the officers and correct their
previous decisions,' one of the air force delegates, Major A Taranenko, told
the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star).
The conference has undoubtedly boosted attempts by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and other republican leaders, such as Kazakhstan's President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, to retain a single commonwealth army. But although it
may discourage other republics such as Moldova and Azerbaijan from
unilateral takeovers of the armed forces, the conference vote is unlikely to
reverse steps already taken by Ukraine to set up its own army, which the
republic has described as essential to preserving its independence.
In a clear sign of Ukrainian determination, 99.4 per cent of servicemen of
the Kiev military district on Saturday swore allegiance to the
newly-independent republic, followed by officers and soldiers from the
Odessa and Carpathian districts, Tass reported.
Marshal Shaposhnikov said after the conference that while Ukraine was still
determined to take over land forces on its territory, there was hope for a
'constructive dialogue' on the future of the Black Sea Fleet  - the bulk of
which, according to the marshal, would remain commonwealth property.
However, reiterating the view expressed at the conference that the army
would never forcibly intervene in politics, General Valery Patrikeyev,
commander of the volatile Transcaucasus district, said he would keep out of
Georgia's internal power struggle.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Dinosaurs cling to power: Dissatisfaction with Greece's
ageing politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former Greek prime minister, relaxes after his
acquittal on corruption charges, he may well reflect that even Pericles, the
greatest Athenian politician of them all, was once accused - and cleared -
of embezzling state funds.
But he might also recall that one of the ancient statesman's few political
blunders was his insistence on clinging to power into old age.
Both Mr Papandreou, now the opposition leader, and his lifelong political
rival, prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis, say they have no intention of
retiring, although they are 72 and 73 respectively.
They can point with justification to 84-year-old President Constantine
Karamanlis, a former conservative prime minister born in northern Greece
when it was part of the Ottoman Empire, who is still an active head of
state.
However, the three elderly leaders are collectively known as 'the dinosaurs'
to an increasing number of Greeks impatient to put behind them an era of
domestic political intriguing and unashamed use of patronage.
Their frustration is openly expressed. Younger technocrats'efforts to
contribute to policy-making are undermined by rivalries between senior
ministers. Foreign ministry officials complain they are not consulted on
fast-moving developments in the Balkans. Businessmen are reluctant to make a
substantial investment without an assurance that it is viewed favourably by
senior members of the government.
Regardless of the not-guilty verdict, Mr Papandreou's reputation remains
tarnished, if only because he failed to sever links with Mr George Koskotas,
the former Bank of Crete owner who admits embezzling its funds, despite
repeated protests from the governor of the central bank.
Mr Mitsotakis is also open to criticism for appearing to exploit the
judicial system to give his conservative New Democracy party an edge in two
general elections that followed Mr Papandreou's indictment by parliament in
1989.
Public attention is now focused on Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, a co-defendant and
former finance minister, who refuses to pay a Dr912,000 (Pounds 2,800) fine
to buy off his 2 1/2 -year sentence for breach of trust. After being
stripped of his parliamentary seat, he remains holed up in the central
offices of Mr Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), vowing to
resist arrest.
Mr Papandreou's call for an immediate election sounds hollow, even to his
supporters, give his precarious state of health. The chances are that a
serious contest for the Pasok leadership will get under way in the next few
months.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Israel's hardline coalition collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S hardline coalition collapsed yesterday, buckling under the strain
of its competing aims of entrenching Jewish control over the occupied
territories and pursuing peace talks with the Arabs.
The 20-month government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister, will formally
lose its parliamentary majority tomorrow when yesterday's resignations by
two extreme rightwing parties, Tehiya and Moledet, take legal effect.
Intense parliamentary manoeuvring, which began last week when the
coalition's impending demise became clear, is under way to determine when
the government's official end will happen.
A general election is widely predicted in May or June, before the scheduled
date in November, following a no-confidence vote or an agreement between the
main parties on the dissolution of the Knesset.
The fall of the government would inevitably slow the halting progress of the
US-brokered peace process, launched at last October's Madrid peace
conference, still further.
The coalition of right-wing and religious parties, led by Mr Shamir's Likud
party, took office in mid-1990 following the fall of a previous coalition
between Likud and the Labour party.
As in 1990, the coalition collapsed because of deep divisions over Middle
East peace policy. Then, Likud refused to proceed with US proposals for
negotiations with the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Yesterday, Tehiya and Moledet quit because they objected to Likud's
willingness to offer a limited form of self-government to the Palestinians
in the US-backed talks.
Tehiya and Moledet - the latter espouses the 'transfer' of Palestinians out
of the occupied territories to render the lands completely Jewish - oppose
any form of self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an irreversible
step towards Palestinian statehood. They advocate the annexation of the
territories.
Likud believes it can achieve Jewish sovereignty and Arab acceptance of
limited, non-sovereign Palestinian self-rule. It entered the peace talks on
that basis. Mr Shamir is already casting Likud, for years a party of the
hard right, as the party of the moderate centre, committed to peace
negotiations.
Yesterday, Mr Shimon Peres, the Labour leader, said the peace talks should
be suspended while elections were in the air. But Mr Shamir is anxious not
to jeopardise US economic assistance and has promised to continue the talks.
However, the issue of Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in US
loan guarantees, which Washington insists on tying to a freeze on Jewish
settlement building, took an embarrassing twist for Jerusalem yesterday.
Mr Avraham Burg, a Labour MP, released a copy of a letter from the Israeli
embassy in Washington to all Israeli consulates in the US suggesting that
the recent fall in President George Bush's popularity offered the chance for
the US Jewish community to press Congress - especially Republican members -
with renewed vigour to approve the assistance.

FT  20 JAN 92 / BAe faces Pounds 80m claim by Asda over property deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE, the troubled industrial combine, faces an Pounds 80m
claim from Asda, the supermarket group, arising from an ill-starred property
joint venture.
BAe also confirmed yesterday that Mr Dudley Eustace, its finance director,
was leaving the company. The parting was 'amicable', it said, but would make
no further comment. A formal announcement is due today.
Mr Eustace has been BAe's finance director throughout recent turbulent
events surrounding the company, including the removal from the chairmanship
of Sir Roland Smith, his replacement on a temporary basis by Sir Graham Day
and the restructuring of top management under Sir Graham in December.
The company has been striving to repair the damage to its City image wrought
by the failure of last year's Pounds 432m rights issue and heavy fall in
profits. The rights issue collapsed, leaving 95 per cent with the
underwriters.
BAe is involved in what are described as 'delicate discussions' with Asda,
which is calling in a property value indemnity originally signed with
Arlington Development Properties just before the property group was acquired
by BAe.
At last week's meeting to announce an interim loss of Pounds 68.8m, Mr
Archie Norman, Asda's recently appointed chief executive, told a City
analyst that the group had full indemnity cover on this venture. 'Our
lawyers say that the indemnity agreement is absolutely rock solid,' Asda
said yesterday. The agreement concerns Burwood House Group, a 50 per cent
jointly owned operation formed in 1989, into which Asda put 34 stores then
valued at Pounds 350m and Arlington some Pounds 75m of property interests.
The indemnity provided that BAe would be liable for any shortfall on
valuation of Arlington's Burwood assets on December 31 1990, and it is on
this liability that Asda is now basing its call for Pounds 80m. The
valuation, carried out by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, was deferred by
agreement until last month, but was based on values as at December 1990.
'We did them a big favour,' commented one Asda executive. 'The shortfall at
December 1991 would have been much greater.'
The discussions between the joint owners of Burwood House appear to be
limited to the precise figure of Aerospace's obligation rather than
presenting any challenge to the indemnity itself.
The surfacing of widely predicted losses on the Burwood House deal will
inflict a further blow on BAe's reputation. The Pounds 278m purchase of
Arlington in 1989, at the peak of the property boom, was strongly
crit-icised in the City at the time.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Early poll date option kept open by prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday kept open the option of an early general election by
signalling that the government was no longer awaiting a 'feel good factor'
among voters nor prepared to stimulate a 'short-term, artificial boom' for
electoral reasons.
The prime minister used a wide-ranging television interview to stress that
the fall in the inflation rate and a rise in the number of job vacancies
showed that conditions for a sustained recovery were in place, awaiting only
a revival in consumer confidence.
He delivered another strong hint of a possible tax cut in the forthcoming
Budget and specifically ruled out plans for an increase in value added tax.
Conceding that confidence was an 'intangible factor', he said the slowdown
in the world economy had 'delayed the speed of recovery that we previously
had imagined.'
But Mr Major emphasised the government's prudent policies demonstrated its
determination to hold down inflation and maintain stable exchange rates.
'To throw away the chance of actually putting all those essential bedrocks
of a good economy in place would be absolute folly - and we won't do it,' he
told Mr David Frost in a confidently delivered 40-minute pre-recorded
interview with TV-am.
'And if that means I have to argue in the general election (that) if we put
things in place but every aspect of the feel-good factor isn't there, well,
so be it.'
Mr Major argued that increased public spending and tax cuts were compatible,
repeating earlier hints that the Tories will take action to encourage a
'capital owning' democracy.
In response, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, immediately led a
series of opposition counter-attacks on Mr Major, stressing earlier Tory
promises that an upturn was on the way.
'It is a terrible indictment that having hung on for 18 months hoping that
the economy improves, he still has to go to the country without an economic
improvement,' he said.
Mr Major's comments came amid widespread expectation that Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, will announce the date of the Budget in Wednesday's debate
on the Autumn Statement on public expenditure.
While Downing Street insists that March 3 remains an option, Treasury
officials have indicated that March 10 and 17 are much more likely.
With Labour thrown on the defensive by last week's attacks on its tax
policy, some senior ministers say the Conservatives could go to the polls as
early as April 9 after a tax-cutting Budget again puts taxation at the
centre of political debate.
Yesterday opinion polls in The Observer and the Sunday Express showed the
parties neck and neck, with Labour just one point ahead.
Tory campaigners made clear that there would be no let up in the attacks on
Labour as the party of 'higher taxes, higher inflation and higher interest
rates.'
Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, used an independent poll of Labour MPs
to claim that 57 per cent favour increases in basic income tax rates of 1p
or more to finance the party's public expenditure programme. The poll was
conducted in the autumn.
Tomorrow, Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary, will publish revised
costings of Labour's programme, alleging that it will exceed Pounds 35bn.
By contrast, Labour plans to regain the initiative by switching its focus in
daily press conferences to the Conservatives' record in office since 1979.
A senior Labour campaign official said there was a firm conviction in the
party that the Tories had played their principal electoral cards too early.
'By the end of next week they will have said all they have to say on public
expenditure, yet we are level pegging with them in the polls without even
raising our 'winning' issues like health, education and the poll tax,' he
said.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Retailers expect sales to fall this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS had a disappoint-ing Christmas and expect sales to fall in
January, reversing a six month rising trend, the Confederation of British
Industry reports today.
This gloomy picture of sluggish sales and orders among retailers and
wholesalers, from the CBI's latest distributive trades survey, reinforces
the view that the unwillingness of UK consumers to resume spending is
delaying the upturn. It stands in sharp contrast to the prime minister's
view, restated yesterday, that slow world economic growth is to blame for
the imperceptibly slow pace of the recovery.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI survey panel, said heavy price
discounting in December did not produce the boost in trade that retailers
had hoped for. 'Retailers report that December's sales volumes remained
moderately above the already very depressed levels of a year ago.'
The CBI expects such consumer spending as there was in December - encouraged
by unprecedented pre-Christmas discounting - to eat into sales in January.
'Retailers expect sales to slip back a little below last year's levels for
the first time since June,' Mr Whittaker said.
The government remains confident in its forecast of economic recovery.
Speaking in his TV-am interview yesterday, Mr John Major claimed that the UK
would be among the first countries to benefit from world economic recovery
in 1992. 'We are at a different stage of the cycle from many of our
competitor countries and I think we will come out of our difficulties
earlier than them.'
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment spokesman, dismissed Mr Major's claims
as 'utterly remote from reality'.
The CBI survey suggests that the government faces more bad economic news
today when the Central Statistical Office releases the provisional retail
sales figures for December. Markets are expecting seasonally adjusted sales
in December to be unchanged on the previous month.
The final retail sales figures for November, released last week, showed that
sales rose by 1.3 per cent on the previous month. But sales in the three
months to November were down by 0.3 per cent on the previous quarter.
This week also brings industrial production figures for November, expected
to show production remaining flat compared with October, when it fell from
the previous month.

FT  20 JAN 92 / A classic Mitterrand strip-tease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten days ago, President Francois Mitterrand of France suggested that the 12
European Community countries should develop a joint doctrine on nuclear
weapons. He did not say why they needed a joint nuclear doctrine, and he
declined to say what it should consist of. But he declared that this would
'very quickly' become a significant issue in the building of a European
defence.
This kind of talk, which is both provocative and evasive, challenging but
enigmatic, is a classic Mitterrand strip-tease. The president is manifestly
suggesting the opening-up of the long-guarded treasure of French national
independence in nuclear policy. Yet he makes the suggestion so obliquely and
moves on so quickly, that the casual observer is not sure whether the
diaphanous veil fluttered aside for a moment or two, nor, if it did, whether
what was revealed was worth seeing.
On the face of it, the suggestion is a reckless provocation at the heart of
the French body politic. More than 25 years ago, France walked out of the
integrated structure of Nato, and for an even longer period it has
proclaimed that its nuclear arsenal is independent from those of its allies.
This insistence on independence may have played a key role in maintaining
popular support for France's nuclear role; it has been a constant feature of
the stock-in-trade of all mainline politicians for a generation.
Deliberately to suggest the development of a European nuclear doctrine,
therefore, would seem foolhardy and premature. Mr Mitterrand's immediate
need is popular support and formal ratification for the Maastricht treaties
on economic and political union. These treaties already call for
far-reaching shifts of national sovereignty between France and the emerging
federal structures in Europe. They do not explicitly require any early
change in French nuclear doctrine; so it seems gratuitous to give the
national nuclear consensus an extra shake before it is absolutely necessary.
That, at least, was what I thought when I read his speech; it appears I was
wrong. Since he spoke, there has been almost no reaction from the political
establishment in France. One choleric protest came from Mr Jacques Baumel,
an unreconstructed Gaullist politician of the old school; but it turned out
that he had misunderstood what President Mitterrand had said. By contrast,
Mr Bernard Bosson of the pro-European centrist CDS party, had not
misunderstood and warmly approved.
For the rest, President Mitterrand's tease did not stir up France's leading
politicians at all - not even the top brass of the Gaullist party. Of
course, the Cold War is over, and nuclear deterrence no longer makes the
headlines as it once did; so perhaps the French are less sensitive to the
question of nuclear independence. Whatever the reason, it looks as though
France's national nuclear deterrent may be on its way to being
de-sanctified.
This is all to the good. There has long been a deep contradiction at the
heart of France's European policy, between the active pursuit of integration
in political and economic affairs, and the doctrinaire refusal of
integration in defence. The contradiction has become even more stark during
the past year, after France (with Germany) openly started pressing the case
for a European defence policy, without abandoning the traditional Gaullist
rhetoric at home in relation to French national defence.
These Gaullist hang-ups are now being discarded in a fairly systematic way.
In November, Nato endorsed the development of a European defence role,
through the creation of 'integrated and multinational European structures'.
It was a historic compromise: the US has stopped asking the French to rejoin
Nato, and the French have stopped objecting to military integration. That
removed the last obstacle to an agreement at Maastricht on the objective of
a European defence.
The unresolved question was where French nuclear weapons fitted in with
Europe's defence. It is easy to argue, like Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission, that French (and UK) nuclear weapons should be
handed over to a strong European federal authority; but such an authority
will not exist for decades.
President Mitterrand's proposal, for the development of a European nuclear
doctrine, is bolder, because it could start to happen more quickly.
So what does he have in mind? Officials smile and shrug. If Mr Mitterrand
has something precise in mind, he must be keeping it to himself. They say
his main objective is political, not technical: the central fact is that he
has, for the first time, placed the question of French nuclear weapons on
the European table.
'The nuclear question is posed,' says one. 'We need to ask what is the
future of nuclear deterrence in Europe, after the dissolution of the Soviet
enemy? There is no longer a French taboo. This reinforces the credibility of
our approach to European defence; we shall be seeking the reactions of the
British and the Germans.'
It will take more than a few oblique phrases to wipe out 30 years of
Gaullism, however. A senior German diplomat was sceptical: 'This is new; but
I'm not sure it means a lot. It is hardly likely that Mitterrand will offer
to discuss nuclear targeting.'
A senior UK diplomat was even more dismissive and smug: 'Mitterrand is
simply signalling that he is aware of the contradictions in the French
position; we do not know if there is anything more behind it. The French
have a problem; we do not.'
My hunch is that Mr Mitterrand wants to start serious political discussions.
The Germans and British therefore need to decide what they think and what
they want. Scepticism will not be enough.

FT  20 JAN 92 / The forgotten virtue of saving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Campaigning in New Hampshire, President George Bush promised to unveil a
long-term growth package in next week's State of the Union address. Judging
from subsequent leaks in Washington, however, the reality will fall far
short of the rhetoric.
The danger is that Mr Bush will try to buy votes by offering an array of
fiscal goodies. The likely menu includes tax relief for first-time home
buyers, a tax credit for children or a higher personal exemption, faster
depreciation for capital equipment, lower taxes on capital gains and tax
credits for medical insurance. Some of this will be offset by proposed cuts
in defence spending and the means-testing of some social benefits for higher
earners. But the precise details hardly matter, because Mr Bush's budget
will be just an opening gambit: a slate on which Congressional Democrats and
Republicans will write their demands.
Since most legislators are keener on a fiscal stimulus than Mr Bush, they
are likely to reject most of the proposed cuts in spending (at least those
outside defence) and press for bigger tax cuts. Unless the economy stages a
spectacular recovery in the next few months, which seems highly improbable,
a sizeable fiscal stimulus - perhaps Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn - appears
likely. It will be accompanied by pledges on all sides to cut the Dollars
400bn deficit once the recession is over.
Now indulge in a flight of fancy. Suppose Mr Bush believed his rhetoric. How
could he best improve the US's long-run growth prospects? The answer is
simple, dull and highly unpopular: by encouraging Americans to save more and
spend less; by mounting a frontal attack on the nation's consumerist
culture; by excoriating the prevailing 'me, now' philosophy.
By far the biggest economic problem facing the US is the abysmally low level
of net national savings. Economists calculate this as the sum of household
savings, business savings (ie, increases in retained earnings) and federal,
state and local budget surpluses. The 'net' refers to the deductions needed
to allow for depreciation of assets, which counts as negative saving.
Professor John Shoven of Stanford University recently scrutinised the US
savings record in a paper for the American Council for Capital Formation, a
Washington think tank. He found net national savings were remarkably
constant between 1950 and 1980 at 7-8 per cent of national income. But the
ratio plunged to less than 4 per cent in the first half of the 1980s and to
only 2 per cent by the end of the decade. He attributes about 2 percentage
points of the decline to the swollen budget deficits of recent years and the
rest to lower savings by households and companies.
There is no international precedent for a collapse of savings on this scale.
The UK, for example, enjoyed a comparable consumer boom in the 1980s, but
the sharp decline in personal savings was offset (until very recently) by an
increase in public savings as the government budget moved into surplus.
Between 1980 and 1987, the national savings rate for rich industrialised
countries averaged about 9 per cent, while the Japanese savings rate was
twice that at nearly 18 per cent.
Looked at another way, net national savings represent the expected growth of
national wealth. US wealth is about three times national income. A net
savings rate of 2 per cent of gross national product (GNP) thus permits
national wealth to grow by only two thirds of a percentage point a year,
barely enough to keep pace with US population growth. Indeed, Mr Shoven
calculates that real net wealth (or capital) per worker actually fell during
the 1980s. It was at the same level in 1990 as in 1976. This collapse in
savings - and hence in wealth creation - is a fundamental cause of the US's
economic stagnation. It threatens to extinguish the American dream of
steadily rising living standards.
If Mr Bush wants to improve the US's long-run prospects, he must raise the
national savings rate. This means abandoning all thought of tax cuts: it
ought to be obvious that higher borrowing will not solve problems created by
years of excessive deficits. Indeed, in an economy with deficit-fatigue, a
Keynesian fiscal stimulus is unlikely to spur growth even in the short run.
The best long-term strategy would be to set a goal of increasing net
national savings to, say, 10 per cent of national income, or slightly above
the average for rich countries. Mr Bush should seek bipartisan support for
such a target and for an associated pledge that federal government will do
its part to rebuild the nation's savings. How? By striving not merely to
reduce the budget deficit but to generate, over time, a sizeable surplus,
equivalent to perhaps 2 per cent of GNP. As soon as such a radical pledge
became plausible, long-term interest rates would fall sharply, allowing a
faster recovery of private investment.
The second plank in a pro-savings policy would be a commitment to radical
tax reform. The most striking aspect of US taxation is the minimal reliance
on consumption taxes. The US is almost alone in lacking a national value
added tax. The introduction of a European-style VAT would enable the federal
government to increase taxes almost painlessly (thus moving towards its goal
of a budget surplus), while spurring growth by lowering the effective rate
of taxation on income and capital.
Perhaps the US should now stop kidding itself and face a hard truth: it can
only grow faster in the future if it consumes less of its national income
today.

FT  20 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Europe benefits from heavy reallocation
of US assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPEED and scale of the shift out of the US Treasury market into European
bond markets last week surprised many of the traders who had predicted such
a move this year.
'There has been a massive reallocation of assets, in a very volatile
market,' one trader said. A significant portion of the funds involved
originated in the US: dealers said the first to make a move were the
leveraged funds, which tend to be more speculative, followed by proprietary
traders at banks, and finally, and in reasonably large volume, US mutual
funds and insurance funds.
The shift is perhaps more surprising, given that the dollar at last appears
to have bounced out: during the last two weeks, the dollar has strengthened
by around 10 pfennigs. However, traders believe many US investors have been
switching the foreign exchange exposure of their European bond investments
back into dollars. (In fact, this hedging activity may have been a factor in
the strengthening of the dollar.)
What the move does underscore is a strong view on the path of European
interest rates compared with the US. The US bond market underwent a sharp
correction over the past week or so, as investors decided to position
themselves for ultimately higher US rates and for lower European rates at
the next change in rates.
Although the US market recovered somewhat at the end of last week - from
what many traders felt was an oversold position - the strong wave of
enthusiasm for US securities over Christmas and the New Year has waned.
Having missed the strong rise at the end of the year, many traders became
involved in what some term 'a lemming trade'. The heavy flow of new issues
in the Eurodollar and the US corporate bond market has added to the strain,
and forced Eurobond spreads to widen, even as the market fell.
Some traders maintain the US will see another interest rate cut, and argue
the current shift is not logical. Certainly, it does not seem to be based
solely on economic fundamentals or trading technicalities and the recent
volatility in prices seems to have left traders uncertain where value lies.
The main beneficiaries of the move into European bonds have been the
mainstream markets: first the German Bund market and then the French OAT
market, and, to a lesser degree, the gilt market and the Dutch government
bond market.
The strength in the German and French markets also provided a fillip for the
Ecu bond market, where there was aggressive buying of four to six-year
bonds.
The preference for this area of the yield curve reflects a view on falling
interest rates, but also the recognition of a cheaper area of the yield
curve, which had become quite inverted due to buying at the long end.
THE FRENCH government is in talks with banks about an issue of 30-year Ecu
bonds, under its Ecu OAT programme. Such an issue would substantially extend
the Ecu yield curve, a gap which will also be filled by the UK's first
auction of three-year Ecu Treasury notes this week.
Rumours of the French plans had a negative impact on what currently
constitutes the long end of the Ecu bond market - Italy's 20-year deal  -
which fell around 40 basis points in price, on expectations of the supply.
The French deal under discussion is expected to total Ecu1bn-Ecu2bn. The
Treasury plans to control stripping of the bond to preserve as much
liquidity as possible, by restricting stripping to market makers in the
programme, market sources claim. 'Stripping' a bond involves reducing it to
its component parts by selling each coupon separately, leaving a zero-coupon
bond, so an investor can buy, for example, a piece of paper which pays
interest once only, in 25 years' time.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Neste restructures Dollars 400m 10-year
loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil company, has been forced to restructure
its Dollars 400m 10-year syndicated loan and offer more attractive fees to
lenders, after its original deal was cold-shouldered by the syndicated loans
market.
The deal - a project finance facility for Neste Petroleum, Neste's wholly
owned Norwegian subsidiary - has attracted only Dollars 150m from banks
since its launch at the end of November. Chase Investment Bank and Citicorp
Investment Bank are relaunching the deal with the following changes:
An agreement from Neste, the parent company, to provide a completion
undertaking, ensuring the company has sufficient funds to cover any calls
for cash on the two oil projects concerned. The money is intended to finance
the development of the Brage and Heidrun oil fields. The definition of
completion now includes both oil fields and not just Brage. The banks will
be provided with an independent report on the oil reserves within 12 months,
an amendment intended to dispel doubts about the figures originally
provided.
Front-end fees have been increased while the margin over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) and the commitment fees are unchanged.
Front-end fees have been raised from 20 basis points to 32.5 basis points on
Dollars 35m, from 15 basis points to 22.5 basis points on Dollars 25m and
from 10 basis points to 15 basis points on Dollars 15m. The margin is
between 60 basis points and 102.5 basis points over Libor, depending on
coverage ratios, while the commitment fees range from 22.5 basis points to
27.5 basis points.
The oil and energy sector was the source of several deals recently in the
syndicated loans market. The latest deal is a Pounds 375m loan for Keadby
Power. The mandate for the 17 3/4 -year loan has been won by UBS and
NatWest. The margin is 120 basis points over Libor during the construction
period and between 110-115 basis points over Libor thereafter.
Elsewhere, Chase has completed a seven-year, FFr227.5m financing for an
Italian borrower - Societa Italiana Per Il Traforo Del Monte Bianco, the
Italian company with a concession for developing the motorway linking Val
D'Aosta with the Mont Blanc tunnel. Autostrade, the Italian motorway
operator, owns 51 per cent of the company and is guaranteeing the entire
loan.
Italian state-controlled borrowers have been largely out of favour since the
Federconsorzi scandal last summer. Many international bankers had regarded
Federconsorzi, the financially troubled farm services co-operative, as
carrying a state guarantee and were furious when the Italian authorities and
public-sector banks refused to compensate foreign lenders. But, Chase claims
the Mont Blanc deal was 'comfortably oversubscribed' and the proceeds were
swapped into lire to provide more advantageous terms for the borrower. The
deal carries a margin of 52.5 basis points over Libor and fees of up to 20
basis points for participations of FFr40m, and of 15 basis points on
participations of FFr20m.

supply of the instruments over the next two years.
During the week yields came down by about 10 basis points for long-dated
securities and by slightly more for instruments at the short end of the
yield curve. But, the accompanying rise in prices was reversed on Friday
after news of a Pounds 1.2bn public sector borrowing requirement in
December, far above most City estimates. The figure indicates that the
Treasury's forecast of a Pounds 10.5bn PSBR for 1991-92 is unlikely to be
met. It is more likely to be about Pounds 12bn, with a borrowing requirement
of perhaps twice this in 1992-93.
Of concern to many investors is that a large increase in gilt issues - which
would be needed to pay for public spending over the next two years - could
lead to a glut of the securities, depressing prices.
Other potential negatives for gilt investors concern the election, which
must be fought by July. A change of government would introduce new
uncertainties into the gilt market, which is worried by the prospect of the
still larger borrowing that could be required to pay for a Labour
administration's spending plans.
Such considerations, and the possibility that sterling might further test
its limits in the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) over the next few
months, have led some gilt specialists to wonder if the recent rise in gilt
prices might be about to end.
Mr Mark Cliffe, an economist at the London office of Nomura, the Japanese
stockbroker, said he thought the market had recently indulged in 'wishful
thinking' about the prospects for gilts. In his view, the difficulties
because of the ERM constraint in reducing UK base rates from their current
10.5 per cent would decrease the popularity of the government, reducing its
chances of a clear-cut election victory.
If Mr Cliffe is right, the recent downward movement for yields will soon
start to run out of steam. The underlying support by many investors for
gilts in the second half of 1991 was highlighted by a Bank of England report
showing long-term investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and
investment, unit and property unit trusts, bought a net Pounds 1bn of UK
government securities in the third quarter of 1991 after being net sellers
of nearly Pounds 3bn of such securities in the first half of 1991. The
institutions sold a net Pounds 2.96bn of UK government securities in 1990
and Pounds 6.49bn in 1989 when the government's finances were in surplus.
Last week the trend of continued gilt purchasing was clear, with prices
edging up. The Treasury 9 per cent bond maturing in 2008 was quoted on
Friday night at 98 17/32 , a rise of just under 1 point on the week, while
the shorter-dated 10 per cent Treasury stock due in 1994 rose in price by
rather less. It was quoted at 100 21/32 on Friday, from 100 7/16 the
previous week.
The only stocks which fared poorly (with yields staying roughly unchanged)
were in the 10-year maturity range. This area of stock is to feature in a
Bank of England gilt auction on January 29, with the Bank due to announce
tomorrow further details, and the likelihood of up to Pounds 2bn of gilts in
this maturity range coming on to the market in the near future kept many
investors from buying.
Part of the reason for the price increases were a spate of data which were
favourable for bonds generally. They showed little sign of an imminent end
to the recession, and indicated inflationary pressures in the UK economy are
likely to remain low, a development which will probably tempt more investors
into bonds as opposed to other types of stock.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that in December the
year-on-year rate of increase in prices of goods at the factory gate - the
key measure of core inflation - was the lowest for 2 1/2 years. In December,
prices at the factory gate were only 5 per cent higher than in December
1990, against a rise of 5.1 per cent in the 12 months to November.
Meanwhile, the retail-prices index, which provides a measure of so-called
headline inflation, rose by just 0.1 per cent between November and December,
the lowest figure since July. Even though the year-on-year rate last month
rose to 4.5 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in November, behind the figures is a
large element of price cutting in shops and by companies offering consumer
services, underlining the weakness in the economy.
A continued fall in inflation is good news for the government. But a problem
for the Conservatives is that, due to the ERM factor, a cut in UK base rates
is likely only after the German Bundesbank decides its rate reduction. And
that may not be until well into the spring, or even later, a development
which may be delayed too long to boost the 'feel good' factor among voters
and so help the Tories' chances in the election.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Japanese Bonds: Optimists expect further discount rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROLONGED rally in the Japanese government bond market came to a halt
last week - though not for long. By Friday, with further official
confirmation of the sharp slowdown of the Japanese economy, prices seemed
back on their upward path. Bond market optimists were left once again
looking forward to a cut in Japan's official discount rate from its current
4.5 per cent.
The 15 basis point rise in the yield on the benchmark bond no 129 as the
week progressed may seem too meagre to constitute a significant reversal for
the market. But after a virtual one-way drive since last summer, which has
seen yields plummet from 6.9 per cent last June to 5.275 per cent earlier
this month, the switch in direction was a novelty.
Profit-taking was blamed in part for the move, but the more significant
reason was the fall in the yen, one of the casualties of the US dollar's
re-emergence so far this year. Before last week, the unstoppable rise of the
yen had mirrored the fall in bond yields, from Y143 to the dollar last June
to around Y123 soon after the new year.
But the gathering signs of confidence over the US economy helped to reverse
this, pushing the dollar up to Y128 during the week.
The inflationary implications of a weak yen may have knocked the steam out
of the bond market, but was it an over reaction? According to Mr Gerard
Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, a rate of around Y130
to the dollar would not necessarily prove inflationary - especially with oil
prices remaining soft. On this reading, the threat of imported inflation was
not as severe as the market seemed to indicate. Also, many market observers
predict the dollar rally has been too much, too soon: the bubble of optimism
which has driven the market will not last without early signs of US
recovery.
By Friday night a sharp reversal wiped Y3 off the value of the dollar,
thanks to disappointing industrial production figures in the US and reports
of co-ordinated intervention to support the yen.
The attention of the Japanese government bond market had already returned to
the domestic front. Earlier, reports of comments by Bank of Japan governor
Mr Yasuchi Mieno brought further confirmation the slowdown in the Japanese
economy was intensifying.
The market is now free to return to its familiar game of predicting the next
move in the Official Discount Rate. The general view: another 0.5 percentage
point cut, sometime in the spring.

FT  20 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries fall victim to Wall St
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE US Treasury bond market a victim of the current conviction on Wall
Street that a strong US recovery is coming sooner rather than later? That
would appear to be the case, given that bond prices fell for most of last
week (Friday was the exception) as optimistic equity investors continued to
push up the Dow Jones index.
The US stock market has been on a roll ever since the Federal Reserve's
one-point cut in the discount rate on December 20, but it is difficult to
find evidence of recovery to explain easily the 12 per cent rise in the Dow
Jones average that has come with the rally.
It cannot be said that the raft of recent macro-economic indicators has
provided a clear compass. Indeed, the only logical, albeit partial,
explanation for the rally is that lower yields in money market funds and
other instruments have persuaded investors to shift money into equities.
The stock market has convinced itself, however, that a big US recovery is
around the corner. And the bond market, which thrives on bad economic news,
has been hit by a sell-off. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond declined
last week, finally staging a comeback on Friday on the back of a reported
fall in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for December
and a decline in US industrial production for December.
By Friday evening the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond stood at 7.60 per
cent, up from 7.43 per cent a week earlier. The sell-off in Treasuries
reached its peak last Thursday, when the declining price of the 30-year
benchmark pushed the yield up to 7.67 per cent. The number that provides
perspective on current trading is the 7.35 per cent yield that came just
after the Fed's interest rate cut last December.
Mr Philp Braverman of DKB Securities called many of the credit market's
beliefs about an economic recovery 'an erroneous interpretation of
misleading evidence'.
The US economy, as Mr Braverman put it, 'is not in recovery - not in the
fourth quarter, and certainly not in the first quarter'. Like others, the
DKB economist feels the strength of the equity market (and the corollary
weakness of the bond market) primarily reflects a portfolio shift of
investment funds from debt because money funds and CDs pay much less than
depositors and investors are accustomed to receiving.
The declining money supply figures released last week also appear to reflect
the shift out of money market funds by investors seeking higher yields on
the back of the equity market's rally. One glimmer of hope for the bond
market is the likelihood of a further easing of monetary policy by the
Federal Reserve, a move many think will come by mid-February.
Fed policy is presently on hold, but several market watchers think Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, will support a modest further cut in the
discount rate and the Fed funds target as more data shows the weakness of
the US economy for the month of January 1992. On the other side of the
equation, the bond market may be unnerved again by the election year package
of tax cut plans President Bush will unveil in his State of the Union
message. Few serious economists believe the tax cuts are likely to be
approved in the short-term or that they will have a real impact on consumer
spending for many months, but worries over the future impact of such cuts on
the already bloated US budget deficit will almost certainly affect bond
market sentiment.
It looks, therefore, as though the Treasury market may be incapable of
taking a firm view in coming months. The analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette reckon an eventual recovery in the second half of 1992 will push
the yield on the 30-year bond up to 8.50 per cent, while the economy's
weakness in the short-term outlook remains reasonably constructive.
Economic data expected this week will include initial weekly jobless claims,
which are likely to be up slightly. On Thursday, the release of figures on
housing starts could offer a slight improvement on the previous month's 2.9
per cent fall in housing permits.
Neither of these statistics will be compelling proof of much, and therein
lies the problem. If the equity market keeps rallying - regardless of
whether such a rally is warranted or not - investors in Treasury bonds could
be in for a rocky ride.

FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Kellogg earnings advance 9%

<TEXT>
KELLOGG, the large US cereals group which has been fighting back against
intense competition in its domestic market, reported an 8.9 per cent profits
increase to Dollars 118.2m after tax in the final three months of 1991.
The fourth-quarter result came after a Dollars 15m one-time charge and
translated into earnings per share of 49 cents. This was broadly in line
with analysts' expectations, although the shares eased Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 59 3/4 on Friday.
Earnings for the full year stood at Dollars 606m, up by a fifth on the
previous year's Dollars 502.8m, on sales of Dollars 1.45bn (Dollars 1.36bn).
Mr Arnold Langbo, Kellogg's new chairman, said that there had been 'strong
volume increases in ready-to-eat cereal sales around the world' and was
optimistic both over growth for '1992 and the long-term'.
Kellogg came under intense pressure in its home market from both General
Mills, its big US rival, and private label producers in 1989 and 1990, but
it has been mounting a strong effort to regain market share.
Domestically, this had fallen from over 41 per cent to under 38 per cent; on
Friday, the company claimed that the figure had stabilised at around the 38
per cent level by end-1991.
ANHEUSER-Busch, the largest US brewer and best known for its 'Budweiser'
brand, claimed that it is 'on target' to gain a 50 per cent share of
domestic beer market by the mid-1990s.
It said that market share overall reached 44.1 per cent in 1991, an increase
of 0.7 of a percentage point during the year - and has already topped 50 per
cent in the light beer segment.
It added that the 1991 profits, to be reported in early-February, should
reach a new high.
In 1990, they were Dollars 842.4m after tax, and analysts have been
predicting around Dollars 930m-Dollars 940m for the year which has just
ended.

LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the water distribution and construction group,
estimates that net profits fell by up to 20 per cent to FFr1.13bn (Dollars
209m) last year, compared with FFr1.4bn in 1990.
The fall comes after heavy provisions for the impact of the economic
slowdown on the group's hotel and leisure industry construction businesses,
and for its part in the Channel tunnel, where a dispute over extra costs is
believed to be nearing settlement with Eurotunnel, the operator.
However, a large part of the provisions have been compensated for by capital
gains on asset sales over the past year, part of the strategy of group
chairman Mr Jerome Monod in focusing on the group's core businesses.
This meant the overall profit decline was less than the market had expected.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez expected net profits in the current year to recover
slightly, to at least equal the 1990 result.
Final 1991 results, due to be published in the next few months, will also be
hit by the poor performance of Westburne, the Canadian building materials
and electrical equipment distribution subsidiary, the group warned.
The Australian subsidiary of Paris-based bank Societe Generale has joined
the Sydney Futures Exchange as a floor member, Reuter reports.
Societe Generale Australia Futures joins 28 other Australian and
international financial institutions as a floor member.

FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: South Africa plans first Ecu
Eurobond offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa plans to follow up its return to the international capital
markets last September with its first Ecu Eurobond, possibly later this
week. The French bank, Paribas, is believed to have been awarded the mandate
to arrange the offering of five-year bonds.
Paribas was also involved in South Africa's DM400m (Dollars 250m) deal in
September. Swiss Bank Corporation is said to be joint lead manager.
Banks involved in the deal stand to lose the business of some Canadian state
borrowers, which have a strict policy on the matter.
Up to 80 per cent of South Africa's D-Mark issue was placed within Germany,
mainly with retail investors.
An Ecu offering would test South Africa's appeal to a wider investor base.
South Africa's return to the international capital markets has met some
opposition.
A Dollars 200m Eurobond for the Independent Development Trust, a
government-funded health, education and housing trust, had to be pulled last
November, when the African National Congress refused to back the deal. The
African National Congress's approval for this offering will not be sought,
banking sources said. The African National Congress opposes new
international borrowings by the present government and an African National
Congress-led administration may not honour new loans.

FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: UK fund to be distributed in
Germany and Holland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first UK unit trust to be approved for distribution in Germany and
Holland has been launched by private client stockbrokers Adams and Nevile,
and will invest in international equities.
The fund, to be known as Millenium International Fund, will hold a 35 to 45
per cent weighting in European equities, with specialisation in medium-sized
companies in growth sectors of the market. Funds will also be invested in
listed equities in the US and Asia.
The units will initially be priced at Dollars 10.55 each, with a minimum
holding of Dollars 5,000. The purchase price will include a preliminary
charge of 5.5 per cent.
While new so-called UCITS legislation on retail investment vehicles allows
funds in one EC country to be marketed in another, Millenium has not been
designed as an EC-wide vehicle, and permission is being sought for
distribution in Australia and the Far East as well.
The fund will be distributed in Germany through a German broker, CRM
Securities, a subsidiary of Amro Handelsbanken. In Germany, about 90 per
cent of retail investment products are distributed through banks which
largely sell their own products.
Non-domestic producers have had to rely on the new independent financial
advisory sector for distribution.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICROSOFT'S sales and earnings soared in the second quarter as the US
personal computers software company's 'Windows' operating system program
continued to be in demand.
Net income for the quarter to end-December was Dollars 175m, an increase of
55 per cent over the Dollars 136m in the corresponding period a year ago.
Earnings per share rose to 90 cents from 61 cents.
Revenues of Dollars 682m for the second quarter were up 48 per cent on the
Dollars 461m in the same period of fiscal 1991.
Strong demand for the Windows operating system and applications programs for
Windows, drove second-quarter sales, Microsoft said.
Since the launch of Windows in May 1990, more than 9m copies have been sold,
the company said. The program provides a graphical interface for users of
IBM-compatible personal computers, making the computers easier to use.
For the six-month period, revenues were Dollars 1.3bn, a 52 per cent
increase over the Dollars 830m recorded for the same period of fiscal 1991.
Net income for the half year rose 59 per cent to Dollars 319m from Dollars
201m in fiscal 1991. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.65 for the six-month
period, up from Dollars 1.08.
Microsoft's sales grew, despite a downturn in the personal computer market.
According to a study published today by Dataquest, the US market research
group, personal computer sales revenues fell by almost 8 per cent in 1991
from the previous year.
However, while the value of personal computer sales has declined, unit sales
continue to grow, expanding the market for Microsoft's widely used software
programs.

FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nasdaq keeps an early date with
Europe / A look at the launch in New York of a pre-dawn market in US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By 3.30 Eastern Standard Time this morning a handful of bleary-eyed dealers
will have struggled to their desks in New York. Nasdaq, the US
over-the-counter-market, is launching a pre-dawn market in US stocks.
Half a dozen people will have cut short their usual night's sleep, the
market's computers will be fired up and the market supervision division will
be staffed by a skeleton crew. The event is both banal and significant.
The pre-dawn dealers do not expect a flood of orders for US stocks: European
investors, at whom this new market is directly aimed, have not demanded a
market in US stocks during their trading morning before.
US shares account for only 5 per cent of the trading through Seaq
International, London's successful international equity marketplace - though
not all trades need to be reported to the London Stock Exchange, making the
official figures potentially misleading.
Nasdaq says it expects interest to be meagre at first. What demand there is,
is likely to come from continental Europe rather than London, it says - a
view confirmed by at least one marketmaker on the new market, which points
to what it says is already a fairly active market in US stocks among
continental European banks.
If, however, the new market proves a success, it could open the way for a
true transatlantic stock market. Nasdaq says it would then extend the system
to European stocks not already registered in the US, and take the market to
US institutional investors. Whether they will be awake at 3.30am to buy
European stocks is another matter.
Nasdaq International is the result of more than two years of effort, and
represents significant regulatory concessions by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission to allow a US market to compete internationally.
Normal market transparency rules have been relaxed: details of trades,
though reported to the market authorities, will not be published, save for
summary information after the international market closes (at 9am in New
York - or 2pm in London).
Also, the SEC has granted access to the market to broker-dealers who are not
members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, provided they are
linked to a member.
On one vital issue, however, Nasdaq has yet to get its way - and as a
result, most internationally traded US stocks will not appear on Nasdaq
International when it is launched today. In certain market conditions, US
securities rules forbid broker-dealers from going short in a listed stock in
off-market trading.
That makes marketmakers on the new Nasdaq International unwilling to quote
prices in New York Stock Exchange stocks. Instead, the handful of
internationally known Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks - among them Apple
Computer and Microsoft - will constitute the market at its launch. Only one
marketmaker, the US firm Sherwood Securities, has said it will quote prices
in a wide range of securities.
Most marketmakers plan to operate from London, not New York. Six - First
Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Madoff Securities, Morgan Stanley
and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - will input prices from their City offices today.
There will also be three in New York (Sherwood, Herzog Heine &amp; Geduld and
Castle Securities) and one in Dallas (Rauscher Pierce Refnes).
A handful of brokers will also have access to Nasdaq workstations, while
prices for the new markets will be carried by a number of leading quote
vendors, including Reuters, Quotron and ADP.

THE management boards of Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker, and its
steel-making subsidiaries Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahlwerke,
yesterday gave their blessing to a merger of the activities of the two
operations.
A brief announcement said the move was unanimously approved as 'the
appropriate answer to the current profit situation and to the likely market
development'.
The move follows several years of losses at Thyssen Edelstahl, the special
steels manufacturer, and inconclusive negotiations with Krupp, the rival
steelmaker, over a proposal for co-operation in special steel manufacture.
Results are to be produced at both subsidiaries later this month. Thyssen
Edelstahl lost DM176m (Dollars 110m) on turnover of DM3.9bn in 1990, while
Thyssen Stahl saw a 16 per cent drop in profits on turnover of DM10.5bn.
Both have been hit by low world prices and demand, and most recently by the
slowdown in the German metalworking and engineering industries.
The company statement said the merger plans would now be discussed with the
group's employees, before coming for a final decision to the supervisory
boards of the companies in June.

AIR FRANCE, the state-owned airline, broke even at the operating level, or
might even show a small profit in 1991, after making heavy losses in 1990,
said Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman, Reuters reports.
The improvement, plus cash from asset sales, meant its second half made up
for a disastrous first one. It should lead to a net loss for 1991 of about
FFr700m (Dollars 127m), Mr Attali said. He gave no exact figures, as the
1991 accounts are still being prepared.

HERTZ, the leading car rental company in the US, is facing legal action from
New York City and New York State over its decision to impose a daily
surcharge on renters in four of the five NYC boroughs, writes Nikki Tait.
The two authorities allege the surcharge represents illegal discrimination
and will weigh unfairly on areas where there are large ethnic groups.
Hertz claims its action reflects the underlying cost situation - with
rentals from these areas tending to result in more accidents and suits from
pedestrians and others injured.

<TEXT>
BRENT Chemicals International, the speciality chemicals group, said sales in
the last two months of 1991 were materially below expectations and warned
that annual profits would be below those previously anticipated. However,
they reiterated their intention to maintain the final dividend of 5.8p.
The market took the news badly, and on Friday the shares fell 18p to 117p.
The directors also said that they had implemented a further programme of
redundancies, which was expected to cost Pounds 800,000. It will be taken as
an additional exceptional item for 1991.
They added that the programme and other cost reductions made during the year
were expected to reduce operating costs by more than Pounds 2.5m in 1992.
For 1990 the group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m.

FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: The Temple plan moves into top gear - The
man chosen to bring IBM UK out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are dangerous times for top executives at International Business
Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer.
Their jobs are on the line if they fail to live up to the expectations of Mr
John Akers, the group's beleaguered chairman.
For encouragement, they have the example of Mr George Conrades, formerly
general manager of US operations, who was shifted publicly and brutally last
year out of line management as IBM's profitability continued to drain away.
Spare a thought, then, for Mr Nick Temple, chosen last week to take over
from Sir Anthony Cleaver as chief executive of International Business
Machines' UK subsidiary. The job has changed out of all recognition since
Sir Anthony, who retains the role of chairman, was appointed in 1986.
Then IBM had a leading share in the general expansion in data processing
investment which characterised the 1980s. However, the recession has
resulted in the UK company's performance lagging behind IBM as a whole -
poor as that has proved to be in 1991 with a loss of some Dollars 2.8bn
(Pounds 1.56bn). UK figures have not yet been broken out separately but they
will undoubtedly be dismal.
Mr Temple's head will equally undoubtedly be on the block if his efforts to
revitalise the company fail. His problems are made no easier by the fact
that the UK is possibly the toughest computer market in the world - a
natural cockpit for companies from the US, Japan and mainland Europe.
Chief executive at IBM UK now means presiding over the most profound
reorganisation the company has ever undergone as it attempts to come to
terms with falling hardware prices, customer resistance and a bloated
bureaucracy
Mr Temple's appointment came as a surprise only in its timing. He has been
the heir apparent since the beginning of 1991 when, with Sir Anthony's
encouragement, he was appointed general manager of IBM UK with the specific
responsibility of devising and implementing a plan to cut staff numbers and
improve efficiency in the company's marketing operations.
The two men are distinctly different in character and temperament. Sir
Anthony, 53, who was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours, is cool,
private, a strategist who has 'put together 15 of the last 16 business plans
for IBM UK'. A graduate of Trinity College, Oxford, he has maintained a
life-long interest in education and training.
Mr Temple, 44, is expansive and physically dominating; he is universally
recognised as an energetic and capable manager with the determination to
force through unpopular measures. He has held a number of senior jobs in IBM
including responsibility for all aspects of IBM banking and retail business
in Europe and responsibility for building IBM's trade with the newly
emerging economies of the eastern bloc.
Implementing the 'Temple plan' has meant enormous, frequently painful,
change, but both Mr Temple and Sir Anthony say that what has been achieved
in 1991 goes beyond their expectations. They agree, however, as Mr Temple
says, that it is 'only the first leg of a long journey'.
First, staff numbers have been cut through programmes of voluntary
redundancy. Mr Temple had hoped that 1,000 jobs would go by 1993; in fact,
2,500 people left the company in 1991 reducing total numbers from 17,548 to
14,909. The cost of such an enormous exodus will inevitably be reflected in
the annual figures, but Mr Temple argues that most restructuring charges
have been taken last year leaving the company with a much more competitive
structure for 1992. He does not expect staff numbers to fall much further.
IBM's redundancy package is generous and, cynically, it could be argued that
the numbers leaving reflect chiefly the state of morale within the company.
Mr Temple argues against this thesis, pointing out that regular opinion
polls indicate that staff have the measure of the changes and are reacting
positively.
Second, the proportion of staff having direct contact with customers has
been increased from about 50 per cent to 70 per cent; this change is in line
with the company's aim of switching to computer services as margins decline
on hardware sales.
Perhaps the most controversial move has been into consultancy where IBM
faces competition from the likes of Andersen Consulting and Computer
Sciences Corporation. Consultancy involves understanding a customer's data
processing problems and making recommendations to solve them.
For IBM, it has meant retraining staff on a large scale. Last year, the
company spent Pounds 34m on education and training. Competitors argue that
professional consultancy is a hard discipline and that IBM's attempts to
break into the market using 'retreads' is sheer cynicism. 'A philosophy of
despair,' one said.
Incoming chief executives traditionally are allowed a honeymoon period. Mr
Temple effectively had his in 1991: he will be judged by the quality of the
results in 1992.

</HEADLINE>

   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUTCLIFFE Speakman, the activated carbon company which had to be rescued by
shareholders after it ran into financial difficulties last year, reported an
interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.79m for the six months to September 30.
The result compared with a deficit of Pounds 11.18m in the nine months ended
December 30 1990.
The loss, which came on turnover of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 38.9m), included
those from discontinued businesses. In engineering fabrication which was
disposed of earlier this month for Pounds 600,000, the deficit was Pounds
700,000.
The group is trying to re-establish itself as a supplier of speciality
activated carbons and solvent recovery plants after a high level of debts
forced it to sell its water treatment and environmental engineering
companies in late 1990.
Last year, in spite of the disposals, it had to refinance its debts and Mr
John Bellak, non-executive chairman, who also headed Severn Trent Water at
the time, was forced to resign.
Sutcliffe hopes that the sale of high technology carbons, which are used in
environmental applications, will support its recovery as environmental
legislation is increased.
The loss per share was significantly reduced to 1.6p (49.1p).

Marina Developments, which operates 16 marinas and is involved in related
housing and commercial sites, is being taken over by Yattendon Investment
Trust, the Iliffe family's private company.
The recommended cash offer of 180p a share, announced after the market
closed Friday, values Marina at Pounds 31.2m. A full loan note alternative
will be available. Marina's share price was unchanged at 98p.
Yattendon, where Mr Robert Iliffe is chairman, had built up a 24.5 per cent
stake prior to the deal. It has acceptances for another 15 per cent.
Marina incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.3m in the half year to September
30.
Mr Philip Mason, the managing director, said it would have taken some time
to restore a realistic level of earnings and to return to paying a dividend.
Marina's net debt was about Pounds 50m, compared with net assets in March of
Pounds 118.5m.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Smaller Companies Investment Trust, a split capital trust, is aiming
to raise up to Pounds 72.1m after expenses, via an offer for subscription on
the main market.
The trust will have three classes of shares. The dividend shares will be
entitled to all the income from the trust, but will be repayable at only 1p
per share. The capital shares will receive no income but will be entitled to
all the income.
The two shares will be packaged together for the purposes of the offer and
will be sold as a unit at 100p each. Up to 75m packaged units are on offer.
The third class of share is a special share held by Lloyds. Should the trust
be taken over, or should the management contract be lost by Lloyds
Investment Managers, Lloyds will exercise the special share to ensure that
its name is removed from the trust.
The trust will invest in companies within the bottom 10 per cent of market
capitalisation of the London exchange, and expects to have a yield of 4.9
per cent.
The minimum application is for 1,000 packaged units and dealings are
expected to start on February 13. The trust is capable of being placed in a
Personal Equity Plan.

redundancies

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The troubles of National Home Loans, the loss-making mortgage lender, has
taken a new turn. Mr Christopher Slay, an executive director, and the five
heads of its management divisions were made redundant with immediate effect,
which will save about Pounds 500,000.
NHL has been in the doldrums since the summer when a Pounds 200m rescue
operation for its banking subsidiary had to be organised by the large
clearing banks after local authorities withdrew their deposits.
In November it reported a Pounds 47.9m pre-tax loss after bad debt
provisions of Pounds 88.7m.
The company said the six redundancies were part of moves to slim down the
group while talks go ahead with possible buyers. Two German banks have been
suggested as likely candidates to take a stake, in a rescue which would
probably also require a call on shareholders for new cash.

profits
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEEL Holdings, the property company that owns 68 per cent of the Manchester
Ship Canal Company, reported improved interim profits after heavy losses in
the latter half of the previous year.
It saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 269,000 to Pounds 1.64m in the six
months to September 30 1991, although turnover fell from Pounds 43.04m to
Pounds 29.8m, reflecting the ending of the group's housebuilding activities
and reduction in the value of trading companies sold.
After tax and the payment of preference dividends, there was a loss per
share of 0.39p (0.5p). The interim dividend is again 1p.
Despite the worst conditions in the property market for more than 50 years,
the group sold investment properties worth Pounds 51.45m at just above book
value.
But rental income held steady at Pounds 23.65m, partly reflecting the
contribution from Manchester Ship, so the group had achieved its
longstanding target of rental income exceeding debt charge.
Net borrowings, excluding Manchester Ship, continued to reduce and stood at
Pounds 359.69m at the half-year. They had since come down to Pounds 342.07m,
leaving the group Pounds 124m of undrawn banking facilities.
All banking covenants were being met by comfortable margins and cashflow was
therefore satisfactory, quite independent of Manchester Ship, the directors
said. The short-term aim was to reduce debt below Pounds 300m and then to
concentrate for future sales on lower yielding assets in order to improve
profitability.

<TEXT>
J HENRY Schroder Wagg has knocked SG Warburg from top place in the annual
merchant banks' league table, derived from the 1992 edition of Crawford's
Directory of City Connections.
In the league table, which is based on number of clients, Schroder pipped
Warburg for the top by picking up 25 new clients during 1991, giving it 126
to Warburg's 125.
NM Rothschild has overtaken Morgan Grenfell and pushed into third place,
while Hill Samuel, the loss-making merchant banking subsidiary of the TSB
group, has slipped from fifth to seventh.
The merchant banking arms of most of the large clearing banks have lost
clients: Barclays de Zoete Wedd has fallen by one place to ninth, pushing
Samuel Montagu, part of Midland, to tenth. County NatWest remains at
fourteenth, though its client numbers are down.
Among stockbroking advisers the blue-blooded Cazenove easily retains the
lead. With 256 clients, it is far ahead of the runner up, Rowe &amp; Pitman,
with 171. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew stands out as the main broker to take a
tumble. It lost 14 clients last year and fell to eighth place from fifth.
The directory also supports the argument that British business is still
overwhelmingly a male preserve. Women make up only 2 per cent of the top
executives in British companies listed by Crawford's.
Though there are five chairwoman among 1,300 quoted companies, Ms Anita
Roddick at Body Shop was the only female managing director and Ms Ruth
Henderson, at the Alexon Group, the only woman chief executive.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Economics Notebook: Town halls might drag the UK out of
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do Britain's local authorities hold the key to economic recovery?
It appears an unlikely question. But as City analysts have been scaling back
their forecasts of growth for this year, some economists and members of
Parliament have hit on increased local authority spending as a way of
promoting activity.
In particular, the influential all-party House of Commons Treasury and Civil
Service Committee (TCSC) believes local authorities should be allowed to
spend more of the receipts they accumulated, from the sale of council houses
and other property, on capital investment. At present, the use of such funds
is strictly controlled by the Treasury as part of the government's policy of
keeping a lid on public spending.
The TCSC is well qualified to comment on the issue. It reviews the
government's spending plans each year. In recent months it has also been
investigating the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
While scrutinising the losses of those local authorities which were unwise
enough to leave large deposits with BCCI, it also unearthed figures showing
that the sums placed by local authorities with financial institutions are
very large indeed.*
The committee heard that local authorities had 'just short of Pounds 8bn'
invested with financial institutions - against the Pounds 10.2bn of spending
that local authorities will determine for themselves and finance through
poll tax receipts in the current financial year.
While investigating BCCI, the TCSC carried out its regular inquiry into the
government's Autumn Statement**. This found that local authority capital
expenditure rose significantly in the years to 1989-90, when it totalled
Pounds 10.5bn, and then fell sharply to Pounds 7.7bn in 1990-91. Such
spending is due to amount to Pounds 7.8bn in the current financial year,
according to Mr Terry Ward, an economist and one of the committee's
specialist advisers.
The committee noted that 'an important element of public sector capital
spending' had therefore 'reached a peak when the economy has been at its
strongest and fallen when activity has reduced'. It recommended changes so
that local authority capital spending 'does not compete with the private
sector during years of higher growth, but assists its suppliers such as the
construction industry when growth is below trend'.
At first glance there seems nothing more sensible than using some of the
Pounds 8bn of local authority cash slumbering in the banks for public
spending projects that could boost the economy. Mr Terence Higgins MP, the
TCSC chairman and a former Treasury minister, has suggested such a course on
condition that any such spending should be for a limited period of perhaps
18 months.
He cites the case of his Worthing constituency, which needs to buy two
tractors to help remove seaweed from the beach but which, it seems, cannot
make the investment under current government rules on public spending.
Releasing funds for similar blocked spending by local authorities throughout
the country could make a difference to the economy, he believes.
Mr Higgins points out that the recession has gone on longer than the
chancellor hoped. All the evidence points to people taking advantage of
lower interest rates to pay off debt rather than increase their spending.
There is little to suggest that consumers will respond any differently to
last week's mortgage rate cuts or any income tax reductions in the Budget.
But public spending questions in Britain are rarely simple. According to the
Treasury, it is open to question whether the local authorities have a right
to spend much of the Pounds 8bn they have on deposit.
These deposits have arisen in spite of government restrictions which insist
that 75 per cent of receipts from the sale of housing and 50 per cent of
other capital receipts should be used for the redemption of debt or in lieu
of future borrowing.
It is unclear how much cash would be available for capital investment if all
local authority debts were paid. When asked last week, the Treasury said
that the amount could be 'between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 8bn'.
What the Treasury did make clear was its strong opposition to any extra
spending by local authorities beyond that agreed in the last annual public
expenditure round. A spokesman insisted last week that there were no grounds
at present to relax public spending policies by allowing the authorities to
spend some of their banked funds.
Such a move would loosen the government's fiscal stance. It would also risk
channelling funds into areas of low spending priority. Releasing local
authority funds could not boost the resources needed by British Rail or
London Transport, for example. 'Local authorities do little infrastructure
spending apart from housing,' the spokesman said, 'and would housing be a
government priority?'
So it looks as if there can be no unblocking of local authority funds to
stimulate growth without a change of heart by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor. But the large sums deposited by the local authorities with
financial institutions have helped focus attention on the oddities of
Britain's public spending policy. Even those who fear greater spending by
local authorities believe there is a case for the government to accelerate
some public spending.
Professor Douglas McWilliams, the economic adviser of the Confederation of
British Industry, says the public sector is quite likely to underspend its
overall budget for capital projects this year by about Pounds 500m because
the penalties for going over budget are severe. The government should
therefore do everything possible to make sure that spending plans are
carried out to the full.
Mr Higgins would like to see the chancellor adopt a more flexible approach
to fiscal policy and use the March Budget to raise public spending if
necessary rather than concentrate solely on taxation. 'If you find the
forecast has gone wrong, it may be more sensible to say let's use public
spending to correct it instead of tax,' he says.
Such a move would be a significant break with Conservative government
practice since 1979. But it might help Mr Lamont to fulfil his ambition of
entering the history books as a fiscal reformer.

<TEXT>
THE Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Foundation said yesterday that it was eager
to co-operate with investigations into the disappearance of Pounds 1.3bn
from the public companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr Werner Keicher, a director of the Foundation, confirmed that his firm,
Allgemeines Treuunternehmen (General Trust Co) of Vaduz, was involved with
all six Maxwell related foundations, Corry, Allandra, Baccano, AKIM, Kiara
and Jungo, named in a Financial Times article last Thursday.
The accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which is investigating the
disappearance of funds from the Maxwell public companies and pension funds,
believes these foundations were used to conceal the source of funds invested
in, among other things, propping up the share price of Maxwell
Communications Corporation (MCC) last year.
Allgemeines Treuunternehmen also has close ties with Verwaltungs und Privat
Bank in Vaduz.
The FT published portions of a statement of an account held at VP Bank by
Corry showing rapid transfers of large sums and purchases of MCC shares.
Mr Keicher said his firm had 'absolutely nothing to hide' and would
co-operate as much as it could with the investigations under way. However,
under Liechtenstein law, it could do so only if the beneficiaries or
mandatories of the foundations willingly waived their right to secrecy or if
the British authorities requested co-operation in connection with a criminal
inquiry.
At the moment, it could not reply to inquiries from Arthur Andersen. 'We
hope to be able to talk as soon as possible. We do not like to read in the
papers all this speculation,' Mr Keicher added.
Although it has a reputation for shielding shady financial operators,
Liechtenstein is concerned about its image and has shown its willingness
recently to co-operate in overseas criminal investigations.
In late 1989, it helped the US Securities and Exchange Commission track down
an insider trading offence when Mr Christian Norgren, then a director of
Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), routed a large purchase of shares and options of
Combustion Engineering of the US through a Liechtenstein company.
At the time, ABB was preparing a takeover offer for Combustion. 'We have to
play with open cards in cases like this,' a Liechtenstein based lawyer said
yesterday.
There have been suggestions that the use of the Maxwell foundations for
share price manipulation was in breach of Liechtenstein law which states
that the purpose of a foundation must be narrowly defined.
'In my opinion, there has not been an abuse of the law,' Mr Keicher said.
'We did not know if there was manipulation.'

FT  20 JAN 92 / Selling bottled dreams at a discount: An unpleasant
fragrance in the perfume industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unseemly outbreak of bargain basement competition in Britain's Pounds
600m-a-year fragrance market is sending ripples of apprehension through the
rarefied world of the luxury perfume industry.
Leading perfume houses have long commanded sky-high prices for products
which cost almost nothing to make by spending lavishly on marketing and
promotion calculated to create an aura of glamour and exclusivity.
As one industry executive candidly admits, the business is about selling
dreams in a bottle.
However, the highly profitable industry is increasingly threatened by heavy
discounting in the UK, where unauthorised distributors are selling top
brands such as Anais Anais, Chanel No. 5 and Opium for as much as 60 per
cent less than the recommended price.
Price-cutting was initiated by two small retail chains, the Glasgow-based
What Everyone Wants and Eau Zone, which operates eight outlets.
It has now been joined by three heavyweight store groups, Littlewoods, the
Superdrug chemists chain, and Tesco.
Most of the companies - except Tesco, which declines to comment - report
strong sales.
Their success has compelled some authorised distributors, which have all
previously charged similar prices for perfumes, to respond.
For instance, the John Lewis Partnership is matching discount prices at
selected stores.
The discounters are coy about their supply sources but are believed to buy
from middlemen on the international 'grey' market.
The big perfume houses are seeking strenuously to trace and plug the leaks.
'We are concerned. We have spent a lot of time trying to minimise the grey
market, but we have not been able to police it completely,' says a spokesman
for L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company which is the UK perfume market
leader.
Some manufacturers are now said to be experimenting with invisible package
markings which would identify the source of illicit supplies.
Critics argue that the perfume industry is out to protect immoderate profit
margins.
'At the end of the day there is a cartel, and it is looking to control
retail prices,' says Mr Philip Green, chairman of Amber Day, which owns What
Everyone Wants.
The manufacturers vehemently deny such accusations, insisting they only want
to ensure that retailers meet specified standards.
'In marketing up-market products, we provide support and services which
obviously cost a lot of money,' says L'Oreal.
'If the products are sold in a non-quality environment, over a period of
time there is a cheapening effect.'
A new front in the skirmishing has recently been opened up by Kingfisher,
Superdrug's parent company, which also owns the Woolworth and B&amp;Q chains.
It is threatening to involve UK and European Community competition
authorities in an attempt to force manufacturers to supply it directly.
Superdrug currently sells perfumes, at discounts of up to 30 per cent, at
two outlets in Newcastle and Epsom, Surrey.
It believes that by expanding distribution to its 650 chemists' stores
nationwide, it could quickly capture 10-20 per cent of the market. That
compares with the 35 per cent held by Boots, the market leader.
Mr Tim Clement-Jones, Kingfisher's company secretary, says direct supply
would be both cheaper and more reliable than buying on the grey market,
enabling Superdrug to raise its margins on perfume lines to 37 per cent from
27 per cent.
The company is basing its campaign on new distribution agreements negotiated
recently by the European Commission with Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent.
The agreements, expected to become a model for the industry, allow perfume
houses to limit distribution to outlets which offer satisfactory service and
quality standards, but require that retailers be left free to set their own
prices.
Kingfisher, which claims its two Superdrug outlets meet the EC criteria, has
set out to test the regulations by inviting 25 leading perfume houses to
supply it.
So far only one, unnamed, manufacturer has offered to do so.
Still, the campaign has won a small moral victory. Superdrug says Givenchy
has agreed to inspect its Newcastle and Epsom stores with a view to
considering them as authorised distributors.
As Superdrug points out with some relish, that marks an apparent volte-face
by the French company.
Only last year Mr Peter Norman, its UK managing director was reported to
have said that it would be 'appalling' if Givenchy perfumes were sold by the
chain.
Kingfisher has been working closely for some time with the Office of Fair
Trading and has also been in touch with the Brussels Commission.
Last week, the company turned over copies of its correspondence with the
perfume houses to the OFT, which has agreed to look into the matter.
If the campaign develops into a legal battle, much will hinge on the
interpretation of the EC agreements, which have yet to be tested in the
courts.
But there is little doubt that if Kingfisher won, the price-cutting door
would be opened wide to others, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.
Mr Green says that What Everything Wants plans to seek direct supplies
shortly, while Kingfisher's campaign is also being followed closely by
several large continental retailers, including Tengelmann of Germany and
Ahold of the Netherlands.
The stakes for the perfume houses are high.
Mr Peter McDougall, an analyst at BZW, the London securities house, argues
that the spread of discounting threatens to plunge the industry into a
vicious circle from which it would be difficult to escape.
'The more expensive a perfume is, the more exclusive it becomes, and the
more it attracts discounting, which erodes the exclusive image,' he says.
'The impact will be to shorten products' life cycles.
'That would mean the death of eternal brands like Chanel No. 5, which have
been around for decades.'

FT  20 JAN 92 / Peter Parker is chairman of Mirror MBO team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Parker, former chairman of British Rail, was yesterday named as
chairman of the management consortium hoping to buy Mirror Group Newspapers.
The appointment of a senior businessman such as Sir Peter, who until
recently was chairman of the Rockware Group, could add weight to the buy-out
team led by Mr Richard Stott, Daily Mirror editor.
'It is an utterly worthwhile thing and I have the time and space to do it,'
said Sir Peter yesterday. He is also chairman of Evered Bardon the quarry
and building products group, Whitehead Mann the London-based headhunters,
Mitsubishi Electric UK and of the governors of the London School of
Economics. Sir Peter, 67, is ideologically compatible with the
left-of-centre MGN group. He stood, unsuccessfully, as Labour candidate for
Bedford in 1951, although now he is a Liberal Democrat.
Like other potential bidders for MGN, the management buy-out team cannot
make a firm offer for the company until details of its assets and
liabilities are available, following the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
Large sums are missing from both MGN and its pension fund. The Maxwell
private interests which hold 51 per cent of MGN's shares are in
administration.
The options for financing the buy-out, which is being backed by Electra, the
venture group, include issuing a convertible bond and a straight cash
purchase.
Apart from the management team, Hambros Bank has said it is looking at the
possibility of putting a consortium together.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Move to avert Brussels 'own goals': Planned EC unit would be
watchdog to ensure smooth ratification of Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is planning to set up a unit to prevent Brussels
scoring damaging 'own goals' in an effort to smooth ratification of the
treaty on European Union agreed at the Maastricht summit in December.
The unit will seek to ensure that Eurocrats do not produce measures of
particular sensitivity in individual member states at moments when they
might cause political rows that could disrupt ratification of the treaty. A
senior Commission official said the ad hoc grouping would offer advice on
the timing of EC measures without attempting to alter their substance.
A less structured attempt to anticipate controversy operated in the run-up
to Maastricht itself. This was largely in response to UK sensitivities,
after Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, lambasted Brussels for
trying to 'exert its influence in every nook and cranny of daily life'.
The apparent spark for this row, amid much pre-summit posturing, was a
letter to the UK government from Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment
commissioner. This sought to delay work on seven big construction projects
until an environmental impact assessment had been completed and publicly
disseminated, as required by EC law.
Senior Commission officials confirm that a range of sensitive measures were
then taken off the Brussels agenda until after the summit. These included
the decision to prosecute the UK for the England and Wales Milk Marketing
Board's attempts to extend its monopoly over the purchase of liquid milk,
finally taken just before Christmas. Plans to extend environmental impact
assessment requirements from individual projects to national policies, and a
green paper on the liberalisation of postal services, were held over until
later this month.
Mr Ripa di Meana acknowledges 'that anguish was felt here before
Maastricht', adding that 'I have to recognise that there are tactical
moments when a slackening is requested.' He said he was not aware of any new
monitoring unit, but reasoned that the pressures on his office not to rock
the boat were sufficiently constant that he would not necessarily notice.
He repeated his remark during the pre-Maastricht controversy, that 'either
you're a troublemaker or you're useless as an environment commissioner'.
The Commission also intends to make life harder for 'nook and cranny'
guardians in other ways. It has issued its public relations front line with
a catalogue of rebuttals to charges that Brussels is bent on 'harmonising'
everything from condom standards to crisp flavouring. This document argues
that 'an immediate, simple and good-humoured reply to each and every
allegation of 'Euromadness' is our best line of defence'. While it is
passably simple and not without humour, its immediacy is somewhat blunted.
Most of the replies were sought by British journalists in the run-up to
Maastricht, following a rash of UK tabloid attacks on Eurocracy.
The current Portuguese presidency of the EC has scheduled the formal signing
of the political, economic and monetary union treaty for February 7. Even if
this deadline is met, ratification then requires the assent of 12
parliaments, and a referendum in Ireland and Denmark.

FT  20 JAN 92 / EC postal services face regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POST OFFICES throughout the European Community will have to publish detailed
information on the performance of their services as part of a tighter
regulatory framework proposed by the Commission.
The proposals are contained in the Commission's long-awaited green paper on
postal services, expected to be published by the end of the month.
Most of the proposed changes are designed to increase competition, but they
do not advocate the abolition of the national local letter delivery
monopolies.
However, a final draft of the paper, prepared by Mr Pieter Weltevreden,
director-general responsible for telecommunications, shows that the
Commission will seek a number of measures to increase liberalisation as the
price for supporting the monopolies.
Sir Leon Brittan, Competition Commissioner, has made it clear, according to
Commission officials, that 'monopolies are now the exception and not the
rule'.
The paper advocates an end to cross-subsidies from reserved letter areas to
express mail. If a post office props up its parcels division, for example,
by using revenue from its letters monopoly, this would be viewed as
anti-competitive.
Each member state is also urged to set up a regulatory body to ensure that
its national post office does not abuse its dominant position.
Cross-border competition is to be introduced by giving private postal
operators the right to send outward mail to other post offices - known as
remail. The Competition Directorate has insisted that private couriers
should also be able to receive international mail and deliver it within any
of the 12 member states.
The paper states that it is not about to sanction the extension of
monopolies. Neither will any member state be able to place restrictions on
services which are currently liberalised.
Mr Jim Campbell, special counsel on postal affairs for the International
Express Carriers Conference, said: 'The most important thing that could come
out of the green paper is for the Commission to open up cross-border mail to
competition.'
Commission officials say Sir Leon has made it clear that as postal services
make their transition from a long tradition of legal protection they will
continue to be pushed towards further liberalisation.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Exporters uncover Nigerian fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH exporters have discovered an elaborate fraud, apparently based in
Nigeria, in which counterfeit bankers' drafts and US letters of credit are
being used to get companies to ship goods to Lagos for which they will never
be paid.
The fraud was uncovered by Leeds Chamber of Commerce and Industry after
Farnell Electronics, a member, asked for a routine check on documentation
for a Pounds 46,000 order. Several other cases have since come to light in
Leeds and Birmingham. Orders range up to Pounds 120,000 in value.
Uninsured trade with Nigeria has long been hazardous. In the early 1980s,
uninsured trade arrears reached several billion dollars. Most of the debt
was eventually settled when Nigeria issued promissory notes worth some
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) on terms which were subsequently rescheduled.
Nigeria is notorious as a base for crude attempts to obtain money by fraud,
and last year the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Confederation of British
Industry warned businessmen to be on their guard. However, the latest
attempt seems more sophisticated. Mr Terry Richards, head of Leeds chamber's
international department, says it may have fooled companies throughout
Europe.
The perpetrators made contact with their victims more than 16 months ago.
Farnell was asked to quote to supply electronic components in September 1990
by sending a pro forma invoice to a company in Nigeria. It has been waiting
for confirmation ever since.
Normal procedure is for the would-be importer to use the pro forma invoice
to get Nigerian government approval to use foreign exchange for the
purchase. Nigeria, like several other African governments, then uses a
private inspection agency, to check on the quality and value of the goods
ordered. If all is in order, what is known as an M Form is issued.
Confirmation of orders should then be accompanied by a banker's draft and a
letter of credit guaranteeing funds.
As with all similar transactions, the exporter cannot bank the draft until
the goods have landed in Nigeria and the importer has obtained the bill of
lading.
The fraudsters are sending their victims confirmation of orders, based on
allegedly approved pro forma invoices, with an apparently certified draft
drawn on a fictitious branch of Nigeria's Wema Bank. Payment is 'guaranteed'
by a purported letter of credit from what appears to be a bogus finance
company in New York.
The orders do not include an M form, but they incorporate a request to send
the goods as soon as possible because the importer's own customers are
threatening to cancel. Mr Richards says companies not familiar with
Nigeria's procedures may respond if they have been waiting months to close
the sale. Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and Industry said three companies
had sought advice since Tuesday and it had alerted the Department of Trade
and Industry.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Post-Soviet market: how it could work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the time when centralised economic planning was fashionable in the
west, the more perceptive critics of the idea did not just throw the
economic textbooks at the interventionists.
They analysed the deeper flaws in the whole project for constructing a
rational society from the drawing board, which has beguiled humanity from
the time of the French Revolution: they gave the resulting fallacy big names
like 'constructivism' or 'rationalism'.
They pointed to the importance of dispersed unformulated knowledge and the
deep-seated influence of custom, habit and tradition. The moral drawn was
that successful reform should build on existing practices.
There is a danger that western advisers and well-wishers of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), which formerly made up the Soviet Union, will
make the same mistakes of constructivism and rationalism that their
predecessors made when moving in the opposite direction.
These remarks arise from Mr Boris Yeltsin's extremely brave experiment in
freeing prices, which deserves a much better press than it has had in the
west. Some of the wrong-headed criticisms made by western commentators echo
those made after Ludwig Erhard's lifting of German controls in 1948, when
there were, indeed, months of hardship, poverty and unstable prices before
the market-based system settled down.
There is, nevertheless, a crucial difference. Erhard's price liberalisation
came on the heels of a successful currency reform, which ensured that price
liberalisation would not degenerate into a hyper-inflation. There is no time
to wait for its equivalent in the Russian world.
The danger is that western reformers will pin all their hopes on a
successful currency reform in Russia and the other republics and not see
that there are already currencies in circulation which the Soviet population
trusts.
For even a distant observer can sense that the one incentive that will
motivate the Soviet peasant, trader or factory manager to bring products to
market is the offer of 'dollars'. The term covers almost any hard currency -
which all citizens recognise and which can draw tropical fruit out of the
Siberian tundra. In the remotest parts of Central Asia traders have always
known the going dollar price for a pair of jeans or a western radio. People
know how to deal with 'dollars', as they have existed side-by-side with
roubles throughout the Soviet period, when there were hard currency shops to
which the privileged had access.
Indeed hard currencies have penetrated on a black market basis into the
former Soviet bloc to such an extent that the Bundesbank has been criticised
for not taking enough account of these external holdings in measuring the
German money supply.
My suggestion is certainly not meant as a blanket proposal for all the
former communist countries. Poland, for instance, has had a remarkably
successful currency reform and fiscal retrenchment along approved IMF lines.
Other central European countries are moving in a similar direction; and the
Baltic states may launch viable independent currencies of their own. But the
distrust of the rouble and the disarray of the budgetary system in CIS
countries is so great that alternative paths need to be explored.
This is leading up to a very simple proposal. It is that part of any aid
given to the CIS should consist of hard currency which the Russian and other
governments should neither keep as a reserve nor use directly for western
imports, but put into circulation - most conveniently by using it for their
own purchases.
A modest amount will go a long way. For it is likely that a credit pyramid
will develop on the hard currency cash base and that deposits said to be
dollar-denominated will proliferate. The notes themselves will circulate
with a rapidity that will give new meaning to the words 'velocity of
circulation'.
There is nothing in my proposal which precludes Russia, or any other
republic, from eventually introducing a hard currency of its own. Indeed,
one way of defining any such new currency would be to fix its parity against
dollars or D-Marks and measure its success by the extent to which the
official exchange rate can be maintained in the free market.
There are endless possible variations. A new post-Soviet currency could be
defined in terms either of a currency basket or of the Ecu, D-Mark or
dollar. The authorities could offer convertibility at a fixed price; or they
might simply pursue sufficiently tight monetary policies to keep up its
value. If, on the other hand, the main CIS countries continued to use
western currencies for domestic circulation there would be important
implications for western monetary co-ordination. But to prescribe for these
matters now is to run before we can walk. Events themselves will give the
right hints.
My proposal is no substitute for providing urgently-needed aid; but it could
be one component. The aid package of Dollars 20bn suggested by Professor
Jeffrey Sachs is a tiny proportion of the western defence budget. It is less
than some of the packages of tax cuts now being discussed in the US alone.
Support for a vulnerable democratic system covering a sixth of the earth's
surface is surely a more satisfactory way of priming the world economy than
encouraging western governments or citizens to pile up yet more domestic
debts. And when it comes to giving help, there is much to be said for giving
it in the form that the recipient most wants.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Difficult to assert the electricity generators are
abusing their position at consumers' expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Andrew Cook (letters, November 28 and January 2) charges that the
electricity pool pricing system is 'arcane and secretive' and that the
generators are manipulating the market.
The pooling system is complex, but only because electricity cannot be
differentiated by source and is difficult to store. The pooling system is
nothing more than a means by which this commodity can be traded. Like other
commodity markets, customers can purchase at the 'spot' price, or they can
enter into contracts which stabilise prices. A 15 per cent rise in the
contract price offered to Cook's resulted from the removal of a cross
subsidy which had favoured certain classes of consumer, typically those with
effective lobbying power, to the detriment of other consumers. Cook's
decided to take a chance on pool prices and so suffered from the recent
price spikes. The rules by which pool prices are established may be complex
but are certainly not 'secretive'. Copies of the 'pool rules' are freely
available from any supplier and were surely studied by a company where
electricity accounts for 8 per cent of manufacturing costs.
More serious is the suggestion that the generators are manipulating the
market. Since National Power and PowerGen own most of the generating plant,
it is likely that they can control pool prices. However, the pertinent
question is whether they control the wholesale price of electricity which,
for the vast bulk of consumers, is determined by contracts. One guide is
that Cook's would be unable to find anyone to build a power station and
supply it with electricity at or below the present level of pool prices.
Moreover, the regulator was unable to determine whether present prices were
higher than expected for a competitive market with surplus capacity, ie were
higher than 'avoidable costs'. So it is difficult to assert that the
generators are abusing their dominant position at consumers' expense.
Indeed, during one of the price spikes, the recent report by OFFER suggested
that both companies probably lost money. In real markets, firms do not cut
their throats willingly, nor do they miss market opportunities.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Market profitability, not capital, the real issue
for Lloyd's to confront
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL EASTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As one of the dwindling number of Lloyd's Names, I have no small
interest in the work of the Lloyd's task force and in ensuring that the
flagship of the London market remains afloat. The report proved a good read
and represents a creditable assembly of the many facts and possible
proposals anyone responsible for governance at Lloyd's ought to know. None
the less, the report was a real disappointment, concentrating as it did on
suppressing the symptoms of Lloyd's problems rather than addressing their
causes.
For example, it is suggested that corporate membership should be introduced
to replace Lloyd's declining capital backing from individual Names. This
misses the point. Capital has been lost or withdrawn by Names owing to the
negative or unsatisfactory return they have suffered. It is difficult to see
how corporate members, required to have three times the capital backing of
individual Names, could be attracted at all in the current environment.
Moreover, even if corporations could be attracted, many of Lloyd's clients
will take little comfort from the experience of the ill-fated New York
Insurance Exchange, which collapsed on the back of corporate membership.
It is market profitability, rather than capital, which is the real issue.
The strength of Lloyd's does not lie in its absolute size, but rather in an
entrepreneurial and innovative system capable of attracting profitable
international business. It is true that the size and potential severity of
the business involved requires a collective market to syndicate each risk.
However, this market goes beyond Lloyd's and, consequently, so should the
task force's recommendations aimed at restoring profitability. Recommended
changes in tax treatment of reserves and in broker behaviour require the
support and involvement of the broader London market.
It is characteristic of its introspection that the Lloyd's task force report
focuses on complicated restructuring within Lloyd's, requiring many years
and parliamentary intervention to implement, rather than the broader issues
of market practices and profitability, where positive action could be taken
immediately.

FT  20 JAN 92 / A last chance to ring the changes: BT is about to come under
the most intense scrutiny since privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg has one final important task before he moves from the
Office of Telecommunications to the Office of Fair Trading in June: to
review BT's prices.
The review, due to start on January 30, is perhaps the most important in his
nearly eight years at the top of Oftel. This will be his final testament to
the telecommunications industry - his chance to draw together all the
regulatory techniques he has helped to pioneer since taking the job before
BT's privatisation.
It is not only BT's prices that will be under scrutiny, but also Sir Bryan's
actions. This is partly because the review is taking place in the run-up to
a general election. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman,
has called for cuts in BT's prices on the grounds that the company is
earning excessive profits.
Sir Bryan has always tried to avoid political pressure, arguing that
economic and accountancy theory should determine regulatory policy. But keen
political antennae will be required to steer a course between the competing
interests of BT's customers, shareholders and rivals.
Customers have an interest in lower prices, although there is a potential
conflict between what business and residential customers want. Shareholders
would like BT to keep its prices high.
Rivals, such as Mercury Communications and the cable television companies
which are moving into telephony, also have an interest in BT's prices
staying high. The higher they are, the easier it is for other companies to
compete.
Sir Bryan may wish to correct a perception that he was too soft on BT the
last time the company's prices were comprehensively reviewed in 1988. Since
then, profits have increased sharply to Pounds 3.1bn last financial year.
Sir Bryan has been criticised for failing to control its international
prices until last year.
The pressure on Sir Bryan to produce a regime that is seen to be fair is one
of the reasons that the consultative document, which will kick off the
review at the end of the month, will be more comprehensive than the one four
years ago. It also explains why Sir Bryan, who in the past has been
criticised for negotiating with BT behind closed doors, intends to be more
open about how he reaches his conclusions.
When BT was privatised in 1984, some ministers hoped that the need for price
regulation would diminish as competition developed.
But the group's continuing dominance of the industry - its market share is
more than 90 per cent - means that few now doubt that its prices need to be
controlled to protect customers from overcharging. BT claims that the
prospect of more competition - more than 20 companies have asked for
telecoms licences following the government's policy review last year -
should mean it has more flexibility in how it prices its services. But even
it accepts that price control will not be completely abandoned.
Sir Bryan will have decide whether the company's profits are 'reasonable'
before he decides how tightly BT's prices should be regulated.
A Financial Times analysis last year concluded that BT could cut its charges
to customers by Pounds 1bn and still earn profits comparable with telephone
companies elsewhere and with the rest of British industry. But BT's head of
UK regulation, Mr John Basgallop, says the company's profitability is within
the range of what was expected when prices were last reviewed.
Sir Bryan will also have to form a view on how much further BT, which has
been cutting about 15,000 jobs a year, can continue to improve effidirector
of public communications products, says: 'We would expect to be able to
maintain similar improvements as in recent years.'
But profits will not be the only determinant of price control. The UK
approach to regulating privatised utilities is designed to give them an
incentive to continue improving efficiency.
Instead of limiting BT's profits to what is judged to be a reasonable level,
in the past a price cap has been set which was expected to deliver
acceptable profits if the company made reasonable progress to improve
efficiency. This gave BT an incentive to over-achieve, because it kept any
extra profits.
Sir Bryan believes in this type of incentive regulation, but that does not
mean that the current procedures will remain unchanged. Last year might have
to pay back to customers part of any 'excess' profits.
Apart from general principles, the review is expected to examine the
following issues:
Should the price cap be tightened or loosened? At present, BT is required to
cut each year the price of a basket of its main domestic and international
services by 6.25 per cent less than inflation. A regime designed to reduce
the company's profitability substantially might tighten this to 10 per cent
or more. But BT argues that a relaxation in the price cap is needed to
maintain its profitability.
Should there be a one-off cut in BT's prices? Such a move would bring down
the company's profits immediately rather than phasing a reduction over
several years.
How much flexibility should BT have to move the prices of specific services
within the overall basket? The group is currently prevented from increasing
residential line rental charges by more than 2 per cent above inflation.
BT wants greater flexibility in order to be able to compete more effectively
against rivals. A Labour government might resist such a move on the grounds
that it would make it more difficult for poorer households - for which the
rental charge is a large portion of their bills - to afford a phone.
How should new services such as call diversion and messaging be priced?
Should BT be able to offer residential customers discounts if, for example,
they rent more than one line?
Should BT be restructured to help competition develop? The Liberal Democrats
have argued that long-distance and local operations should be split in much
the same way that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was broken up in 1984.
Should the 'wholesale' prices BT charges its competitors for using parts of
its network be cut? Mercury argues that, as retail prices come down, so
should wholesale prices. Otherwise, competitors will face a squeeze on
margins.
Should prices vary with the amount BT invests? Some observers argue that the
company does not need to keep prices high because investment has been
falling. But BT says prices should reflect past, not future, investment.
Should BT's core UK operations be 'ring-fenced' from new businesses into
which it has been diversifying? Robert Fleming Securities estimates that BT
has lost about Pounds 1bn as a result of overseas expansion. This figure is
calculated by combining the reduction of the value of BT's investments with
the cost of financing them.
Should prices vary with quality of service? One idea floated in the past has
been that, if quality falls, so should prices. But defining quality in a way
that could fit into a mathematical formula might prove impossible.
Whatever Sir Bryan decides, he will need the agreement of Mr Iain Vallance,
BT's chairman, to implement change. If he fails, he could refer the company
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Timing could be critical. If negotiations go well, a deal could be struck
before Sir Bryan moves jobs. However, he is aware of the dangers of getting
boxed in to an artificial timetable which could undermine his negotiating
position. BT itself might feel it has something to gain by spinning out the
negotiations until after Sir Bryan has left.
But even if the review - which will heavily influence BT's prices, profits
and business strategy for years to come - is not completed by June, most of
the parameters will be set by then. Sir Bryan will go, but his shadow will
linger.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Senior executives claimed to have no misgivings when
headhunting meets psychological testing in the cause of finding the right
candidate (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER SAMUEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was delighted to read the valid observation by William Gill (Letters,
January 11) that there is no conflict between the work of reputable
executive search consultancies and corporate psychologists.
He asserts, however, that very senior top managers would resent an
occupational psychological test. Our experience is totally to the contrary.
Most senior executives who have actually participated in psychological
assessment, particularly when changing their employer, recognise that it is
to their own advantage in reducing the inherent risks to their own career as
well as providing an opportunity to learn more about themselves. The
appointments section of your very same edition announced elections to the
board of two major plcs of externally recruited directors, for both of whom
psychological assessment was an integral part of the selection process.
There are two underlying reasons for Mr Gill's misconceptions. First, he
makes the assumption that psychological testing is synonymous with
psychological assessment. It isn't. The test component is, when used
correctly, only a part of the complete assessment process. The second more
fundamental error is his assertion that candidates are 'head-hunted on the
basis of their reputations and their indisputable records'. What such
emphasis on track record fails to recognise, however, is that simple
extrapolation from success in one organisation to another is fraught with
risk. I recall a line from Dryden: 'They rise, they shine, evaporate and
fall.' Experience suggests that client satisfaction is greater where the
search consultant concentrates on finding candidates who are rising and
shining, with the complementary guidance of the independent psychologist on
underlying capabilities, potential and capacity for company transfer. The
dual input thereby minimises the risks of evaporation and fall, both for the
candidate's career - and the client's bottom line.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL ACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article, 'Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted'' (Tuesday, January
7), disturbs me because:
it overstates the usefulness of psychological tests used in isolation;
it misrepresents the small group of headhunters concerned with finding
people for top jobs;
it portrays headhunters and occupational psychologists as competitors rather
than providers of complementary services.
Using psychological tests as though they can 'scientifically' predict job
success the way a tailor measures for a suit, fosters a false sense of
scientific confidence. Tests have a place, but only as a small part of the
assessment process.
The paper reported a survey of 365 search consultancies. It must have
spanned the good and the bad. Only about 20 headhunting firms can properly
be described as operating at the most senior levels.
Headhunters are reportedly reluctant to work with fully qualified
occupational psychologists, because they fear losing control of the
contract. This may be true of bad search consultants trying to pass off a
weak candidate, but respectable search consultants know that satisfied
clients return with repeat assignments.
Headhunters and psychologists have complementary skills. Headhunters know
how much the market is paying for people with specific skills, they can find
out which managers are most favoured by their peers and they can sell new
jobs to candidates who would not reply to advertised vacancies.
Psychologists can make finer discriminations between candidates and
companies. They can go further than saying 'this is a good candidate', and
identify how a candidate would undertake the job and fit into the
organisation.
Recommendations from a psychologist's assessment include how the company can
best support a candidate in terms of supervision, shifting the structure of
the client company, or adjusting the specifics of the job to be filled in
other ways.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: The quality of teacher training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALLEN SHEPPARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your criticism of Kenneth Clarke's plans to reform the teacher training
system ('Education and the election', January 6) as 'panicky electioneering'
is ill-founded. My company, employing some 29,000 people in the UK, has a
direct interest in the quality of our teachers. The inspectorate's report
shows very convincingly what can and should be done to equip schools to
invest their knowledge and skills in the next generation of teachers. Much
of the opposition to the plans smacks of self-interest and an elitist view
that education 'theory', taught by people who no longer teach children, is
more important than practical classroom skills; teachers must be able to
manage all the different modes of learning.
My company put some ideas to the education secretary on the need for such a
change of emphasis in teacher training. I am delighted to see this new
consensus, of which we are a part, has found such a practical and dynamic
response from the secretary of state.
Children and teachers themselves will benefit.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The appointment of a Central Statistical Office director (January 15)
with a policy of making economic data more useful to the commercial world
represents a welcome reversal of the apparent long-standing official view
that governments collect statistics for their own purposes and any benefit
to the taxpayer from their publication is purely incidental.
In this connection, the early reinstatement of the Commercial and industrial
floorspace statistics (which last appeared in 1986) and the full Census of
distribution (which has not appeared since 1971) would earn Mr McLennan the
approbation of planners, property developers, retailers and investors, to
list but a few.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: No mortgage rescue falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN DUCKWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your reports on the government's mortgage rescue scheme (January 14 and
15) have been exaggerated.
As the representative of the National Federation of Housing Associations
quoted in both your articles, I do not believe that the schemes are
faltering, nor that lenders and housing associations are at loggerheads.
Since before Christmas a number of lenders and associations have been in
negotiation on how the schemes might work, since none of the detail was
sorted out before the 'package' was announced.
Associations need to make sure that their finances are not put at risk and
that the households which become tenants are not confronted with
unaffordable rents. There is no merit in a scheme which simply converts
mortgage arrears into rent arrears.
To make the schemes work, lenders will need to be very flexible, but
indications are that they accept this.

Sir, We hacks must surely bow to Howard Davies's idea (Personal View,
January 15) that newspaper reports be judged for accuracy by the government
or corporate press officers involved. Who is paid to tell the truth if not
they? Why rely on some wretched political editor when the unvarnished facts
are available from a Bernard Ingham?
But Mr Davies does not cast his net wide enough. Newspapers are not the only
publishers. His own Audit Commission - just for example - puts out numerous
reports on local government. These could be judged by an objective committee
of council press officers from, say, Liverpool, Hammersmith and West
Wiltshire (plus, maybe, to add some Scottish financial acumen, Western
Isles).
Couldn't they?

FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Continued growth of the socially aware banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MALCOLM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported ('Swiss bank capitalises on green sentiments', January 7)
that the Zurcher Kantonal Bank, a more traditional Swiss Bank, has decided
to follow the Alternative Bank Schweiz by offering an account to customers
which pays less interest than usual current accounts. The lower rate would
allow the bank to reduce the rate charged to environmentally friendly
business customers.
The establishment of new socially aware banks and finance organisations has
been growing in the last 30 years. More than 30 of them, including five UK
finance companies and the Alternative Bank Schweiz, have, since 1989, become
members of the International Association of Investors in the Social Economy.
The financing techniques for socially and environmentally friendly
development which they all use are at the forefront of capital strategies
for a sustainable economy. Capital funds, for example, for wind farms,
organic farming and co-operative ownership have all been copied some years
later by traditional banks.
It is important to recognise at a time of big is beautiful in the banking
world that room should be left to establish new and small social economy
banks which combine innovative banking operations within appropriate
standards of banking practice.

Sir, I note from today's Financial Times that transport secretary Malcolm
Rifkind's top priority on railway privatisation is to get the right solution
not a rushed one (Parliament and Politics, January 15). As this work started
under his predecessor, Paul Channon, in May 1988, and was described as
'urgent' at the time, one wonders just how much longer the government can
keep on going round the same four options before accepting that none of them

FT  20 JAN 92 / The Gatt makes its last stand: The draft final act of the
Uruguay Round offers a unique chance to liberalise trade / It must not fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have never faltered, and I will never falter, in my belief that enduring
peace and the welfare of nations are indissolubly connected with
friendliness, fairness, equality and the maximum practicable degree of
freedom in international trade.
How remote did achievement of Cordell Hull's dream seem when he published
these words in 1937. How fortunate that the US secretary of state, the
father of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, persisted. For now, in
1992, his dream is on the verge of achievement. With the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations reaching its climax, a liberal trading
order, covering virtually all countries and almost all trade flows, is
within the world's grasp.
Yet some who should know better seem incapable of seeing what is at stake.
Others who do know better seem incapable of meeting the challenge. But
without a dynamic trading system neither the prosperity of the rich nor the
hopes for prosperity of the poor can be ensured.
Never have the fundamental principles of the Gatt - liberalism,
non-discrimination and the international rule of law - been more
enthusiastically embraced. From Mexico City to Moscow, liberalisation is the
order of the day. The Gatt secretariat announced last April that at least 45
countries had liberalised their trade policies since the start of the
Uruguay Round, which has also seen active participation by many developing
countries that had previously insisted on unreciprocated benefits.
Unfortunately, a comparable commitment is not being shown where it matters
most: in the US, the European Community and Japan, which account for over
half of world exports. Having lectured so long on the need for all countries
to participate in the liberal international trading system, these countries
seem unwilling to do what is needed to stop it foundering.
The US has abandoned its long-standing commitment to non-discrimination and,
as was demonstrated by President Bush's sales trip to Japan earlier this
month, is increasingly addicted to bilateralism and managed trade. The EC
has failed to rise above the twin imperatives of its corrupt farm politics
and incompetent farm policies. The Japanese seem incapable of putting aside
their attachment to geriatric farmers and gerrymandered politics.
Yet it is on these hobbled giants that success depends. Faced with the
demarche from the Gatt's director-general, Mr Arthur Dunkel - the Draft
Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade
Negotiations, released just before Christmas - they must now choose between
a draft that all find unsatisfactory and no conclusion at all. Mr Dunkel has
proposed Easter 1992 as the date for a conclusion, including to the market
access negotiations. While that deadline could be broken, as too many have
been before, the price would be US ratification after the forthcoming
elections. The outcome agreed in Geneva would then become a political
football.
Contrary to some unscrupulous comment, Mr Dunkel's draft was not the product
of his fevered imagination. Except for central parts of the proposal on
agriculture, where no agreement could be reached, it is the fruit of five
years of painstaking negotiations among 108 participating countries. It is
attractive fruit. In its scope and in the principles that animate it, this
document would bring to fruition the dream embodied in the Havana Charter of
1947, which called for the creation of the still-born International Trade
Organisation.
Combined with success in the negotiations to liberalise market access in
goods and services, due to finish by March 1 1992, the final act would:
bring within the Gatt framework two long-established and embarrassing
exceptions - agriculture, and textiles and clothing - which accounted for
10.1 and 5.3 per cent of total world trade in 1990, respectively;
create a general agreement on trade in services, which would extend the
scope of the rules on multilateral trade to activities that account for
another 18.9 per cent of world trade;
establish an 'agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property
rights' that would for the first time provide multilaterally agreed
protection of intellectual property;
strengthen the rules of the Gatt system to prevent abuse of existing
provisions, remove the temptation to adopt 'grey area measures' outside the
Gatt and increase the transparency of procedures used by national
authorities to grant Gatt-legal protection to private supplicants; and
establish a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO), which would serve as an
umbrella for the new agreements, end the long-standing anomaly of the
provisional application of the Gatt, allow cross-retaliation within all
areas of trade, and create both a uniform and far more binding system of
dispute settlement.
These are big advances. Not least among them is the strengthening of the
rules of the system. The Gatt is a contract whose value depends on the
effectiveness of its rules. The draft final act would eliminate a number of
important anomalies. It would:
elaborate and strengthen several articles, including the one dealing with
emergency protection (Article XIX). This would limit the duration of
emergency protection and, with a few temporary exceptions, eliminate
'voluntary' export restraints; and
elaborate and strengthen a number of the codes agreed in the Tokyo round,
notably those on subsidies, dumping and standards, as well as through a
parallel negotiation on public procurement. Compromises have had to be made.
But even in the case of the most sensitive of all, dumping, the rules have
been tightened in ways that should limit the current tendency towards
arbitrary decisions.
Unfortunately, there is a dauntingly long way to go, while little time
appears to be left. Yet timetables alone should not be allowed to destroy an
agreement of such importance. The more important questions are those of
substance.
Agriculture is pivotal, not because of an American whim, as many in the EC
seem to believe, but because it is the sine qua non for many other
participants, both developed and developing. With the principle of reform of
the common agricultural policy conceded by the EC, the agricultural
negotiations are now over points of detail. The detail is important, but it
is still detail and, as such, insufficient to justify derailment of the
exercise.
The outstanding issues are in ascending order of sensitivity:
the 'tariffication' of existing barriers and concomitant commitments to
improved market access;
the EC's demand to 'rebalance' its protective regime, with less protection
for cereals offset by greater protection against cereal substitutes,
especially oilseeds;
the American demand for quantitative limits on the volume of subsidised
exports; and
the EC's demand that the compensation payments proposed as the centre-piece
of CAP reform by Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's agricultural commissioner,
should be included in the 'green box', as subsidies that do not distort
production and trade.
Mr MacSharry's payments do not get into the green box for a simple reason:
they are not decoupled from production. The relevant text states that 'no
production shall be required in order to receive . . . payments', while the
EC's payments make that requirement. The possible solutions are two: either
the EC separates its payments from the requirement for continued production,
or the proposed payments could be put in yet another box ('blue' and
'two-speed amber' being under discussion), which would then differentiate
the EC's proposals from the far more distorting American deficiency
payments.
The other agricultural issues are not as difficult. A limit on the volume of
subsidised exports cannot be out of the question for a trading bloc that is
itself so sensitive to dumping. Meanwhile, rebalancing is anathema to many
agricultural exporters and has no hope of being agreed.
Agricultural tariffication falls within the broader area of market access. A
huge volume of work remains here - other issues being the bilateral
tariff-line negotiations in manufactures and market access in services. But
these negotiations are an opportunity, as much as an obstacle.
Chances to re-open the draft final document itself must be limited, if it is
not to unravel entirely. The best way to pay countries that have not
obtained what they want in the existing texts, or are asked to concede more
than they judge reasonable, is through the market access negotiations, the
goal here being a one third average cut in tariffs on manufactures. The US,
for example, may obtain more than is at present offered to it in
intellectual property by making generous offers on market access.
The immediate question is whether agricultural exporting countries decide
that the EC's negative reaction to Mr Dunkel's agricultural text, which
includes a proposal for reductions of 36 per cent in customs duties, makes
the prospects for liberalisation too uncertain for them to engage in
across-the-board market access negotiations. They should take the plunge,
however, even if their offers remain conditional on agreed reductions in
agricultural support.
The private interests that need to fight for the results of this round in
the US include service providers and the pharmaceutical industry. For this
reason, offers on market access are also important in services. US service
providers will not fight for an agreement that gives all foreign companies
equal access to the relatively liberal US market, while US companies are
merely promised access to relatively illiberal foreign markets.
Meanwhile, the US pharmaceutical industry is making intellectual property an
important obstacle to final agreement. It is concerned that the developing
countries would have a transitional period of 10 years for the introduction
of product patents. While some protection would be granted to products to be
patented between the agreement's coming into force and the end of this
transition period, no protection would be granted to existing patents. But
since the US is isolated on the issue, it will have to pay a high price
elsewhere, if it is to obtain agreement to retrospective application of
patent protection.
These obstacles are important. But far more significant is the goal to be
reached. As a result of past trade liberalisation - both through seven
previous rounds of Gatt negotiations as well as in the regional context,
above all within Europe - trade has led the growth of output through each
successive economic cycle (see chart). The world economy has grown
progressively more integrated, with this integration being a principal
source of growth for the market economies.
Regional blocs provide no alternative to multilateral liberalisation.
European countries do, it is true, do three quarters of their trade with one
another and might consider the world well lost. But the countries of the
Americas and of Asia send more than half of their exports outside their
respective regions (see chart). Almost 40 per cent of all word trade, even
including the huge volume of trade within Europe, is inter-regional.
Regional blocs are not a sensible alternative to the multilateral framework.
They are at best a complement.
Whatever happens, the last hour of the Gatt has arrived. If the round
succeeds, a new MTO will provide a secure foundation for extension of the
trading system into such new areas as global competition and the
environment. It will also underpin the global market economy and, no less
important, help stabilise global political relations. But if the round
fails, a gallant attempt at global co-operation will go out with a whimper.
The big powers must make their choice. It is between the rule of the jungle
and the rule of international law, between the belated slaughter of their
sacred political cows and a dynamic world economy.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Easing the German pain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's influence on monetary conditions throughout Europe is
reasonably clear-cut; but the way in which it makes its decisions can be
more obscure. The headline-making  1/2 percentage point increase in the
German Lombard rate before Christmas was pushed through by the regional
members of the Bundesbank council. This was against the advice of its
president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who - more alive to the international
sensitivities - favoured a more restrained increase of just  1/4 per cent.
Not merely because of the Bundesbank's occasional ability to surprise, there
is nervous speculation about when it will start to reduce rates again.
Having helped bolster European growth during 1989-91 as a by-product of its
unification-induced boom, Germany is now accused of choking neighbouring
economies with its tight monetary grip. In the wake of the recent easing of
US and Japanese monetary policy, the pressure on the Germans to cut rates
will increase at this weekend's meeting of finance ministers of the seven
largest industrialised countries.
As the German economy slows over the next few months, the Bundesbank will
certainly have leeway to lower interest rates. First, however, some crucial
conditions will have to be fulfilled. After last year's pay settlements of 7
per cent or more, the Bundesbank is right to be worried about high 1992 pay
claims. The interest rate hike was partly an attempt to call the trade
unions to order, and there are small signs that it may be working. The IG
Metall metal-workers' union last week acknowledged the inappropriateness of
10 per cent-plus pay claims, and a 5 to 6 per cent pay deal looks just
possible in the steel sector, without the threatened strike.
Exaggerated deals
Of still greater significance will be the outcome in the public sector,
where unions have lodged double-digit claims reminiscent of the exaggerated
deals at the beginning of the 1970s, which sparked off the Bundesbank's most
savage post-war tightening to date.
Aggressive demands of employees in the public sector may be an
understandable reaction to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's botched handling of last
year's tax increases. But the unions must understand that, unless they
moderate their behaviour, they will bear a good deal of the responsibility
for prolonging the Bundesbank's squeeze. For the public service workers
union, OTV, putting workers out of jobs in interest-rate sensitive
industries both within and outside Germany is hardly a contribution to
international solidarity.
Basic criticism
Yet the main blame for Germany's monetary strains falls on the government.
The Bundesbank has recently scaled back its carping at Bonn's failure to put
post-unity financing on to a sounder footing through spending and subsidy
cuts, partly because its rhetoric had so little effect during 1990-91. But
distressingly little has happened to invalidate its basic criticism: that
large public sector deficits are forcing the central bank to make too much
of the running in the bid to control inflation.
The core public sector deficit - running at 4 per cent of gross national
product - is still too high, especially as the economy is slowing
significantly. Of still greater concern is the proliferation of debt
accumulating in off-budget financing vehicles such as the Unity Fund, as
well as heavy burdens caused by support for exports to the former Soviet
Union. Once the temporary 12-month income tax surcharge runs out this
summer, Bonn is relying on a VAT rise next year to restrain the deficit. But
tougher action will be required to meet the challenge.
In post-war economic cycles, the Bundesbank has waited on average seven
months before easing interest rates from their peaks. This time round, the
rest of Europe has good reason to expect that the Bundesbank will want to
move sooner. But foreigners' demands for action should be lodged with Mr
Kohl, not Mr Schlesinger. Unless Germany brings its newly enlarged economy
into better balance, it will not only punish its neighbours, but will also
suffer itself.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Competition in electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK electricity industry has borne out the predictions made at its
privatisation a year ago. Both the two generating companies and the regional
distributors stand accused of anti-competitive behaviour.
National Power and PowerGen, it is persuasively argued, are using their
dominant market position to manipulate prices in the wholesale market for
spot electricity, known as the pool. Regional distribution companies are
accused of making excess profits, and of showing insensitivity in awarding
large salary increases to their directors. The Labour party, which has on
the whole avoided promises to renationalise utilities, recently said it
would renationalise the national grid and reimpose a measure of government
control over the power market.
Do these rumblings suggest that outside intervention is required, or are
they merely teething problems, as a large and complex industry adjusts to
its new existence?
The answer is the former. The two large generators account for 65 per cent
of the country's capacity, which is too much. This stems from the
government's original wish to create generating companies large enough to
own the nuclear power industry - which it no longer proposes to privatise.
The big two have decisive leverage over the price of electricity set in the
pool. They will also in future have a critical influence on the price of UK
coal, and thus the shape and size of British Coal.
Since the power generators are not directly regulated, Britain in effect has
a largely unchecked duopoly, with too much power both over consumers and
related industries, such as coal.
Sceptical
At the distribution end of the market, the case is less clear-cut. Although
the regional companies enjoy monopolies in their local franchise markets
which are providing them with a strong cash flow, the intention is that
these monopolies will be steadily whittled away over the next six years.
Consumers, however, are right to be sceptical whether these powerful
regional bodies will ever face sufficient real competition to justify their
release from anything but the tightest regulation.
But what action should be taken? Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity
regulator, says the industry should be given five years to settle down
before dramatic changes are made. Accordingly, he has proposed mild reforms
in the pool arrangements, while reserving the right to make a reference to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Running dogfight
Some think that Prof Littlechild should bare his knuckles, as his
counterpart in the gas industry has done in recent months. The problem, as
we have seen in the telecommunications and gas industries, is that a running
dogfight between regulator and utility may produce ad hoc improvements in
competitive conditions, but does not automatically lead to considered
structural reforms of the kind needed in the electricity industry.
Apart from the central questions of prices and investment criteria, the
electric power industry involves a particularly complex mix of issues. What
allowance should be made for environmental requirements in pricing regimes?
Should the need for a diverse fuel supply modify economic calculations in
the case of coal and nuclear power? What is the correct framework for
setting the contract price of UK coal when British Coal's contract with the
generators comes up for renewal next year? Is the recent 'dash for gas' by
generators likely to look as wise at the end of the decade as it does today?
Because the UK's power industries were privatised in such a muddled and
piecemeal fashion, and because of the gaping holes in the regulatory regime,
it is entirely unclear on what basis these and other questions are to be
answered. The danger is that they will be determined by the instincts of
politicians, which is how most of the problems were created in the first
place. A full MMC investigation is becoming a matter of some urgency.

Sanwa Bank officials advising on the deal were worried that Adel and Richard

'They are here for life,' purred Mrs Rootstein, adding that when Yoshichu's

Alex, the yuppie cartoon-character who makes his debut in the Daily
Telegraph this morning, ought to be proud of his latest deal.
Having been given his first big break at The Independent, the City spiv
didn't hesitate to sell out for a hefty pay increase elsewhere. He has also
earned a bonus by rubbishing his old employer in newspaper and poster ads.
The Telegraph, besides paying Pounds 85,000 a year for the cartoon strip, is
spending a further Pounds 250,000 boasting of Alex's defection. The
Independent's boss Andreas Whittam Smith is a trifle pained by the knocking
copy, but the Telegraph says it is just in fun.
Will it work? The Daily Telegraph, Britain's biggest selling heavy paper,
has an elderly readership and is heading down market in pursuit of the
ruthless young types who admire everything Alex stands for. It is
nevertheless giving the Independent, now spending nothing on advertising
itself, much free publicity.
Whittam Smith, for his part, professes himself convinced that Alex has
passed his heyday. His conviction would be more convincing, however, if he
hadn't replaced the cartoon with a third-rate strip about a TV celebrity.

Mind you, even Dinkins's PR is out-marzipanned by the puffers of a block of
serviced flats Britain's newly formed Heritage Trust partnership hopes to be
allowed to build in green-belt Surrey.
As if it wasn't a schmaltzy enough idea to house the flats in the first
British castle to be built for 60 years, the publicity blurb kicks off with
a poem beginning: What spires are these amongst the trees,
Is Camelot to Cobham come?'
Whatever answer King Arthur and his rotary club might have given, the
project is of concern to present royalty. While the partnership believes its
Pointers Castle is of such merit as to rise above the green-belt planning
rules, Prince Charles might think differently. For, if built, it will be in
sight of the landscape gardens at Painshill Park of which he is patron.
The castle's designer Paul Nadhar, who claims it accords with the Prince's
book A Vision of Britain, says he has been kept informed of the project.
'Regrettably, he hasn't at this stage shown an active interest,' Nadhar
adds.

Next June's Earth Summit in Brazil, billed as humanity's last chance to
avert ecological catastrophe, already promises to be a diplomatic disaster.
The pressing problem, it seems, is not surplus of toxins but shortage of
bedrooms.
Of the 41 nations to request accommodation so far, 80 per cent stipulated
the same three hotels. So, as befits the new world order, they have gone
respectively to the Americans, the Japanese and the Germans, leaving the
rest of the world enviously scattered around lesser hotels.
The Canadians are not speaking to the Germans, having lost to them in the
battle for the Intercontinental even though Canada was the only country to
give money for the conference's organisation. Some Canadians suspect their
ousting is connected with Chancellor Kohl's Dollars 180m handout towards
environment projects in Brazil.
No one is speaking to the Americans, who simply faced the Brazilians with
the ultimatum: 'Give us what we want or we don't come'.
As for the Brits, although 1,994 rooms have now been allocated, the UK
delegation still has nowhere to stay. That, say the organisers, is their
punishment for wanting all 160 members of the party to be in suites.
But it might also strike at least four of them - Premier John Major and
three other ministers - as scant reward for Britain's being the earliest
country to request accommodation in the first place.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Arts: The spontaneity of 'Cher Poupoule' / Review of
Poulenc's other writings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Writing letters was almost as much a part of Poulenc's life as composing
music. 'He wrote' said his great friend, exact contemporary and recital
partner, the singer Pierre Bernac, 'with disconcerting speed, and his style
was as alive, personal, unpredictable and spontaneous as his conversation'.
And one might add, as his music.
Not unnaturally his friends were eager for letters from their 'cher
Poupoule'. Even when he was doing little more than provide charming
entertainment, his music was never impersonal or pretentious. After 1936,
when he underwent some kind of mystical experience at Rocamadour (which led
to the choral Litanies a la Vierge Noire), he wrote on a deeper level not
always recognised because he so blithely ignored current fashions. The
impudent cheerfulness of the earlier years, however, was not banished.
The letters here printed, most satisfyingly translated and edited, with
admirable notes, by Sidney Buckland, continues a project started by the
singer Winifred Radford, who knew Bernac and Poulenc well. In 1967 a smaller
selection edited by Helene de Wendel was published in Paris. This is now out
of print. Mrs Buckland has added many unpublished letters, increasing the
total from 224 to 350, restoring passages formerly omitted. Soon after
Poulenc's death it was understandable that some references to his private
life should be cut out, less so that passages should disappear in which he
endearingly described the pleasure his new works gave him. Like many
artists, Poulenc was inclined to prefer his latest work above all the
others. He was not always right, but the childish enthusiasm was part of the
man.
The private disclosures hold little joy for the prurient. He confided in
certain friends, male and female, with unaffected frankness and candour. A
young mechanic, Raymond, became his driver and his lover, and remained (with
his wife) as a valued part of Poulenc's entourage at Noizay in Touraine.
Later there was a young man from the Midi called Lucien who caused much
emotional distress, increasing to breakdown-point when Lucien died of
tuberculosis. At this stage Poulenc's grief became so obsessive as to draw a
sharp but dignified rebuke from the long-suffering Bernac, as always
'counsellor and conscience'.
These friendships (later still there was Louis, a dashing regular Army
sergeant) were, whether they knew it or not, intimately bound up with the
composition of various works - Raymond was 'the secret', as Poulenc put it,
of the opera-bouffe Les Mamelles de Tiresias and of the Eluard cantata
Figure humaine; Lucien of the Stabat Mater and the Dialogues des Carmelites;
and Louis of the Cocteau opera La Voix humaine. In 1946 Poulenc had a
daughter, whose mother was a friend of many years' standing.
Mostly, but by no means solely, in letters to Bernac, observations about
music and musicians are many and fascinating. Poulenc's generosity to
younger colleagues is striking. His appreciation of two composers of very
different stamp, Messiaen and Boulez, is genuine if qualified (it did not
necessarily extent to their acolytes). There is a surprising reaction to a
usually admired senior figure, Paul Dukas, whose influence on Messiaen
Poulenc found 'irritating' - 'Saint-Saens's method could guide a Ravel, for
example. But what Dukas uses is a method based on other methods.' He
preferred Prokofiev to Shostakovich, whom he likened to 'Brahms: everywhere
and all the time'. In the background there is the wise, benign figure of
Darius Milhaud and the less positive, sympathy-demanding form of Henri
Sauguet.
Prompt as he was to express pleasure in his own music, he waited urgently
for the opinion of friends he trusted (Bernac most of all). When Charles
Koechlin, his former and greatly respected teacher, compared the new ballet
Les animaux modeles unfavourably with the much earlier Les Biches, Poulenc
was hurt. Judging from the concert suite, Koechlin surely had a point. Les
Biches, so successful in blending near-pastiche with 'modern' (1924)
sophistication and syncopation, so disarmingly, insidiously tuneful and yet
so sad, is a small-scale masterpiece which in its own kind Poulenc could not
surpass (it needs the rowdy chorus parts, not often I think done in the
theatre but included in the Markevitch/Monte Carlo and Pretre/Philharmonia
recordings).
There is plenty about singers, singing and the setting of words.
'Essentially I am a man of song in all its forms'. He preferred contemporary
poets, Apollinaire and, above all, Paul Eluard - 'It is really Eluard who
has brought out the best in me'. He liked to hear poets read aloud their own
work and to recall, when it came to setting their words, the cadence of
their voice. He had a gift for describing singers, Bernac of course but
others too, amateur as well as professional, among them the beloved Denise
Duval who did much to cheer Poulenc's later years.
Throughout the letters one senses an unresolved question - Paris or the
country? Though he often enjoyed his house in Touraine he insisted he was
not a Tourangeau - his childhood was spent happily at Nogent on the Marne on
the Eastern outskirts of Paris, where the bal musette music had an enduring
influence on his style. Was he ever, except through his social life, in the
fullest sense a Parisian? Of his religion he said 'I have the faith of a
country priest'. There remained something countrified, even doggy, about him
 -in his features, in his way of barking stories and sallies, in the
tail-wagging, trotting allegros and the lyrical-sentimental effusions
interrupted by gruff, canine explosions.
Yet he loved New York and he seemed at home in England. He would have come
to Aldeburgh more often to perform with Benjamin Britten if he hadn't
disliked the sea air. In the programme of a Festival tribute after his
death, Britten and Peter Pears wrote the following - 'One of his most
adorable qualities was that he was incapable of being anything but himself -
a delightful friend and a lovable musician.'

FT  20 JAN 92 / Arts: New life for old buildings / Discussing the Georgian
Group's plans - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Change at the expense of character in England's smaller towns was the theme
of a symposium held in London last week under the auspices of the Georgian
Group. The Group has spent the last two years carrying out photographic
surveys of market towns with the object of presenting a clear picture of
their architectural condition as they cope with the arrival of by-passes,
shopping malls, supermarkets, and businesses.
The fruit of these photographic labours can be seen in an exhibition, The
Future of the English Town sponsored by the Department of the Environment
and the Monument Trust. The exhibition, which will travel, can currently be
seen at The Nash Room, 12, Carlton House Terrace, London, SW1 until February
9 (10am to 5pm Monday to Saturday).
Naturally you would expect an outfit like the Georgian Group to be concerned
with conservation and preservation, but the Group has recently effectively
widened its concerns to cover planning and the architectural debate. It was
something of a breakthrough to have at the symposium the incumbent President
of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Richard MacCormac, who spoke
effectively to the gathered conservation officers about new buildings.
It was John Fidler, the head of architecture and conservation at English
Heritage, who presented the facts about the state of protection of historic
towns. Although developers may feel otherwise, it is worth noting that there
are only 438,000 listed buildings in England and some 7,500 conservation
areas. The total number of listed buildings represents only six per cent of
the whole national building stock. As Fidler very wisely said, these listed
buildings represent a finite cultural resource, and one that cannot be
placed in a museum. In each of the 951 recognised historic towns in England
we see a palimpsest of the nation's history. As three listed buildings a
week are quite legally demolished it can be seen how vulnerable our historic
towns are. At this particular time it is the edges of towns that are easily
eroded for car parks, supermarkets and roads.
So often it is the multi-storey car park that delivers the coup de grace to
the historic town but there are also more subtle threats. The decline of
residential occupancy at the centres of small and large towns causes
considerable loss and damage. There are many provincial towns where the
betting shop, the building society and the estate agent are practically the
only occupants - and the estate agents are waning fast.
There is one project which is not well enough known that is trying to do
something to increase residential occupancy in town centres. The 'Living
over the Shop' project funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the
Department of the Environment aims to encourage the residential use of
vacant space above shops. It was a change in the law in the 1988 Housing Act
that made it possible for Housing Associations to to own part-commercial
property. This important change means that owners of commercial properties
with vacant upper floors can now grant business tenancies to housing
associations which will allow vacant possession to return the owner by a
specific date. The Project offers an information service to local
authorities and owners and is working closely with the Housing Corporation.
A pioneer project will open soon in Stamford, Lincolnshire where four upper
stories of a 1790 listed building, which have been empty for 20 years, will
be let through a housing association as studios for single people on the
local authority housing waiting list. One small change in the law; one
benevolent charity and some lateral thinking, shows how a small start can be
made to rejuvenate historic town centres.
We are at the end of a decade of market led redevelopment and the symposium
concluded that now is a good time to stand back and consider the best ways
of achieving a solution to the deteriorating condition of town and city
centres. Is it true that the state of our cities is a direct result of the
rural bias of the planning system? There are also a multitude of
organisations for the protection and preservation of the countryside but, as
a speaker from the Civic Trust said, 'there is no Council for the Protection
of Urban England.' Urban England is not an image that comforts any
Englishman abroad in the way that he dreams of the Cotswolds when he is in
the Sahara. Is anti-urban sentiment so strong in England that there is no
intellectual impulse behind the whole subject of urban design ?
It was gratifying to hear the President of the Royal Institute of British
Architects say that the beginning of an urban renaissance depended on
analysing towns in terms of organisation, use and scale. There is no point
in looking at towns as places for the uncontrolled debate about
architectural style. Towns have every opportunity today of being places
where people live to enjoy the virtues of civilisation. We can drive to shop
just once a week to the out of town stores while our historic town centres
are rejuvenated for residential use. The corner shop and the specialist
store could occupy refurbished historic buildings with low tech businesses
with computer networks occupying the formerly unused upper floors.
The present slow period of recession and lack of redevelopment offers a
wonderful chance gradually to enhance our historic towns. Newbury, Frome,
Melbourne, Castle Donnington, Cirencester, Beverley, Truro, Berwick,
Wisbech, Kendal,Chesham, Newark, Farnham, Knutsford, Chippenham, Richmond
and Wotton - the litany of names of towns in the exhibition is just the tip
of the glorious urban vision waiting to be rediscovered.

At the weekend, the BBC mounted an almost compendious survey of Alban Berg's
music in four concerts. 'Almost compendious', because his operas Wozzeck and
Lulu were represented here only by the concert-suites Berg drew from them;
but nothing else of significance was omitted. Writing at half-time in this
mini-festival, I can say already that it is a signal success: excellently
planned and beautifully performed, with the great bonus (for the audience in
the hall) of George Perle's searching programme-notes.
Among major composers of any period, there is scarcely another whose oeuvre
adds up to so few hours and minutes ' except, of course, Anton von Webern,
Berg's own colleague and fellow Schoenberg-disciple. Webern, however, took
early to 'miniature' forms, or more exactly to composing atonal pieces of
extreme, stripped-down concision. Berg wasn't a natural miniaturist at all;
as we heard on Friday and Saturday, his experiments with very brief pieces
went no further than those for clarinet and piano, op. 5, and his op. 4
songs (with a disproportionately huge orchestra) on tiny poems by Peter
Altenberg.
When Webern came to embrace Schoenberg's method of composing with
'twelve-note rows', his music expanded just a little: movements a few
minutes long, instead of a few seconds. Meanwhile Berg was developing his
own idiom in works on a much more substantial scale, in which gingerly
Schoenbergian experiments figured only here and there. Except for a single
song from 1925, only his very last works ' he died in 1935, in his
fifty-first year ' are committedly 'twelve-note' music, and then in a style
that constantly infringes the austere ground-rules of the Schoenberg method.
What really happened, as the first two BBC concerts let us hear quite
clearly, was that Berg developed his own musical language ' highly
chromatic, highly calculated, potent and poignant ' without forcing it into
Schoenberg's mould. He espoused a version of 'twelve-note' composing, quite
individual, only when it could accommodate his own expressive idiom without
cramping it.
There is no sharp break between the hyper-sensitive, post-Romantic songs of
his earliest, pre-Schoenberg years (which Arleen Auger and Alan Opie sang on
Friday with acute sympathy) and the intricate density of his mature works,
but merely a steady acquisition of technique and a unique composer's voice.
After Friday's little banquet of early songs, the clarinet pieces (in which
Antony Pay and Ian Brown were impeccably subtle) and Berg's reduced version
of the Adagio from his later Chamber Concerto, Saturday's BBC Symphony
concert was a sumptuous affair. Each work bore the marks of superb
preparation by the conductor Andrew Davis. We had the 1912 Altenberg songs
ravishingly sung by Yvonne Kenny, their monster orchestra handled with the
utmost delicacy; and the orchestral Three Pieces op. 6, the Wozzeck Suite
and the great Violin Concerto, Berg's last completed work.
All the performances were rich in insights, and they were precisely
exquisite ' almost to a fault. Davis dwelt lovingly over the concerto, in
perfect tune with Ulf Hoelscher's chaste, tender account of the solo role,
at some cost to the dramatic muscle of the score; but for once, at least,
the result was so lovely to hear that one barely missed a tougher thrust.
If the climactic 'catastrophe' in the third movement was under-powered, the
final Adagio was still extraordinarily moving, and rendered transparent far
beyond any run-of-the-mill treatment. In the Wozzeck movements, the innate
gentility of Miss Kenny's soprano did not make her a natural Marie (the
ruined heroine of Buchner's text), but she captured the felt anguish
marvellously, and Davis brought off the famous summing-up 'interlude' with
searing conviction. The Three Pieces ended the concert with all the right
baleful force, still with refined control and sharp understanding.

When American steel millionaire Lawrence Thaw and his wife Peggy toured
India in 1939 they went in a huge motor caravan, taking with them a leading
cinematographer to record the event on 35 mm Magnacolor film stock. The
resulting holiday films provide the material for today's Voices From The
Past (7.40 BBC2). Horizon, which follows at 8.10, tells the story of
Buckminsterfullerene, a type of carbon discovered by two physicists in 1990
and named after the architect who was so keen on geodesic domes.
It seems that the discovery 'revolutionised chemistry overnight', and
industrialists are now talking about new polymers, lubricants, and
nano-technology, but the two physicists are wondering whether
Buckminsterfullerene is the solution to one of the great mysteries of
astronomy.
The second programme in the four-part Falklands War (9.00 C4) deals with the
sailing of the task force and the sinking of the General Belgrano. BBC2
screens the last part of its drama Goodbye Cruel World (9.00) about 'Way's
Disease' and the politics of medical charities. Panorama (9.30 BBC1)
investigates the disappearance of long-stay geriatric beds from NHS
hospitals.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Arts: Giselle - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday night, Viviana Durante made her debut as Giselle and, fortunate
young ballerina, had the inestimable advantage of Irek Mukhamedov as her
Albrecht. It is in no way to diminish the merits of Durante's performance to
say that, without Mukhamedov, her interpretation would have seemed less
touching, for he, more than the staging, established the world in which
Giselle must love and suffer and become a protective wraith.
Mukhamedov, as we know from his Bolshoy appearances, is a great Albrecht.
The sustaining thread of his reading is a passion for Giselle. This Albrecht
is not playing with Giselle's feelings: his every moment with her - as
peasant girl or wili - reasserts that intensity of feeling which he shows
her (and us) early in Act 1. Soon after their first tender greetings,
Albrecht looks intently at Giselle and, miraculously, Mukhamedov conveys the
gust of passionate love that sweeps over the heedless aristocrat at this
moment, justifying for him this village dalliance. He raises his arm and
swears fidelity (Giselle, instead, proposes the flower test) and the rest of
the drama is explained thereby.
Because Mukhamedov is a totally expressive artist - no step meaningless, no
gesture unfeeling - every least nuance of emotion is made clear, ardent,
poetically beautiful. Remorse, despair at his own folly in the mad scene -
to which Mukhamedov gives intense pathos by his involvement in Giselle's
torment - and his ability to suggest that each appearance by the wili
Giselle deepens his love for her, establish a world of emotion which
sustained Durante's reading as surely as did his partnering. The dance
blazed in the forest scene, noble and grand in outline as in expressivity.
Mukhamedov's Albrecht is a peerless incarnation of Romanticism. His exit in
Act 1 - turning back to gaze at the dead Giselle - was worthy of Gericault.
His pose,flower held aloft, as the ballet ends, would have inspired Berlioz.
And in nothing is this marvellous interpretation selfish. The generosity and
dedication that have marked Mukhamedov's every role gave Viviana Durante an
ideal framework. Her playing was, not surprisingly for so gifted a dancer,
whole-hearted, intelligent. She already commands much of the role: her
account of both acts was technically fluent, felicitous, and her view of the
peasant girl was quickly responsive to feeling. A young ballerina's first
mad-scene is often burdened with too much drama - the Opera House
production, with its concern for detailed ensemble playing, encourages this
 -and Durante will soon be able to find simpler means, but the lines of her
reading are true, and the wili was given a vaporous and touching gravity,
the dance floating, delicately poised. We have much to expect from this
first performance.

RESULTS DUE
ALL EYES this week will be on the results of Lonrho on Thursday. Shares in
the conglomerate, which has wide ranging agricultural, manufacturing and
leisure interests, have dropped from 230p in late November to 150p last
night.
Concern centres around the 'tycoon factor' - ie. what would happen to the
company when it loses its driving force, Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, 74.
There are also worries about its high level of debt, difficulties in
generating organic growth, and falling mineral prices. Its pre-tax profits
for the year ended last September have probably fallen to about Pounds 245m,
from Pounds 273m a year earlier. Some analysts think the dividend may be cut
this year from last year's 16p a share.
Interim results from Budgens on tomorrow will be the first news on how
things are progressing at the food retailer, where institutional investors
installed a new management team last April.
Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1m, and will be
interested to hear how Sunday trading is holding up, now that other food
retailers have clambered aboard the bandwagon which Budgens was one of the
first to get rolling.
Newman Tonks, Europe's largest maker of architectural hardware, will report
on Wednesday a steep drop in pre-tax profits for the year ended October.
They are likely to fall to about Pounds 15m, from Pounds 23.2m a year
earlier.
The decline is no surprise given the abysmal UK housing market. The group's
strength abroad, coupled with tight management, will have helped minimise
the blow. Analysts are pencilling in a slight pick up for the present year.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Economics: Spotlight picks out UK activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST will focus upon the state of UK economic activity and upon price
pressures in Germany this week. There is little sign, however, that
economists in major financial markets expect any convincing evidence of
economic recovery in Britain or that the Bundesbank has German inflation
under control.
In Britain, Wednesday's industrial production figures for November will come
under close scrutiny.
News last month of a fall in manufacturing output in October raised fears
that Britain might be heading for a 'double dip' recession and generated
much pre-Christmas gloom about the economy.
The median of City forecasts from MMS International, the financial services
company, suggests that manufacturing output will be flat in November and 2.6
per cent lower than in November last year.
The provisional retail sales figures for December are expected to be
similarly uninspiring, following today's report from the Confederation of
British Industry that the Christmas trade was better than a year ago but
that it nevertheless fell far short of shopkeepers' expectations.
German figures this week are expected to show an acceleration in consumer
price inflation and money supply growth.
The figures are likely to stiffen Germany's determination to maintain a
tight monetary policy when the Group of Seven finance ministers meet in the
US on Saturday.
Among the economic highlights of the week ahead, with the median of city
forecasts indicated in brackets from MMS International, are the following:
Today: UK, December provisional retail sales (unchanged on month, up 0.5 per
cent on year). France, November industrial production (down 0.5 per cent).
Germany, Bundesbank publishes monthly report.
Tomorrow: UK, December M0 narrow money (up 0.2 per cent on month, 2.8 per
cent on year), M4 broad money (up 0.2 per cent on month, 5.7 per cent on
year), December bank and building society (M4) lending (Pounds 2bn). Japan,
November machinery orders, December trade balance (Dollars 9bn surplus,
customs cleared). Canada, December consumer price index non-seasonally
adjusted (unchanged on month, up 4.2 per cent on year), CPI seasonally
adjusted (up 0.2 per cent on month), November adjusted retail sales (up 0.8
per cent).
Wednesday: US, Western foreign ministers confer in Washington concerning
humanitarian aid for states of the former Soviet Union. Fed releases the
'tan book' on economy for February 4-5 meeting of the open market committee.
December housing starts (1.09m), building permits. UK, November
manufacturing output (unchanged on the month, down 2.6 per cent on the
year), industrial production (down 0.3 per cent on month), unit labour costs
(3 months to November up 5 per cent on year), release of the British
Chambers of Commerce Q4 1991 economic survey. Japan, release of the revised
November industrial production figures. Canada, November department store
sales figures (flat).
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank council meeting takes place. US, December
Treasury budget (Dollars 5.5bn deficit), January 11-20 auto sales figures
(5.8m), money supply for week to Jan 13, initial claims for the week to Jan
11 (450,000). Japan, November personal consumption expenditure, income.
Australia, November housing finance (up adjusted 3 per cent). Canada,
November wholesale trade (down 0.1 per cent).
Friday: US, Q4 housing vacancies. December bank credit, commercial &amp;
industrial loans figures. France, December trade balance (FF1.5bn deficit).
Saturday: Group of Seven finance ministers are due to meet in US.
During the week: Germany, preliminary January cost of living (up 0.8 per
cent on month, 4.3 per cent on year). December producer price index (down
0.2 per cent), December M3 from Q4 base (up 5.2 per cent), December import
prices (down 0.5 per cent on month, down 1.7 per cent on year). Japan,
December money supply figures (up 2.5 per cent on year).

FT  20 JAN 92 / Management: Why the kissing has got to stop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers are trained to believe that cliches about national characteristics
are as misleading as they are pernicious.
But it may just be that the old caricature of Latin races as highly-sexed
contains a spark of truth. Sexual harassment at work has caused such a
headache for French employers and their staff that the government has
recently seen fit to act.
Veronique Neiertz, state secretary for women's rights and daily life, is
planning to introduce new penalties in the spring parliamentary session.
These will come on top of criminal sanctions due to come into effect
shortly, which will make sexual harassment a crime in French law for the
first time.
According to a survey of 1,300 people, commissioned from Louis Harris by the
government at the end of last year, the problem is growing fast. One-in-five
French citizens of both sexes have encountered sexual harassment at work, up
from 7 per cent in 1984. Blackmail, repeated advances and obscene language
were the most common problems.
Neiertz aims to strike a balance between giving victims protection and
avoiding what she sees as the excessive regulation in the US, where the mere
creation of a 'hostile environment' is punishable.
As an illustration of French attitudes to sex at work, the Judge Clarence
Thomas saga in the US was met with general bafflement in France. The public
takes little or no interest in the sexual habits of public figures, whether
they are business people, judges or politicians.
Demonstrations of personal sexuality are in some ways less controversial in
France than the US or the UK. But France's relaxed attitude to the
boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable conduct is changing. The
criminal penalty against harassment, agreed by the French parliament last
summer, sets a fine of up to FFr100,000 (Pounds 10,300) plus up to a year in
prison for anyone who, 'abusing the authority conferred on them by their
position, uses pressure to obtain favours of a sexual nature'.
The latest proposals put this general idea into labour law, describing the
offence as 'a word, gesture, attitude or behaviour by a hierarchical
superior with a view to compel an employee to respond to a solicitation of a
sexual nature'.
Employers would be obliged to establish in-house rules against harassment
and would be forbidden from discriminating against victims or witnesses or
resorting to other means to hush up cases. Often the 'victim is more
punished than the person guilty of harassment', says Neiertz.
What is most striking about the new rules - and what sets France apart from
other countries - is that they apply only to harassment by superiors and
offer no remedy for people who are abused in this way by colleagues or
inferiors.
It could be that harassment by colleagues is too widespread in France to be
controlled by legislation. 'I do not say there is not sexual harassment
between colleagues, but when there is no link of power or economic
dependence, the woman or man being harassed can defend themselves,' Neiertz
told a French newspaper. She added: 'We must not end up with the excesses of
the US, where the slightest glance can be misinterpreted'.

<TEXT>
John Holmes, once head of one of the City's biggest integrated securities
operations at Morgan Grenfell Securities, has returned to basics: the small
institutional broking business of Credit Lyonnais Laing.
For the French-owned broking firm, Holmes is a significant catch; his move
underlines CLL's progress over the past year (market share in UK equities
has risen by around half - though it is still modest). For Holmes, the move
represents a return to what he considers his main strengths - research and
sales. From today he is heading the firm's 25-strong institutional sales
team.
Having become a managing director of another integrated house in London  -
Morgan Stanley - after the demise of Morgan Grenfell Securities, Holmes left
to start an agency broking firm with Peter Quinnen, former head of James

FT  20 JAN 92 / Management: Plugged into the quality circuit / Investigation
into one company's experience - Customer care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Casley calls it the 'Quest for Quality' and as Southern Electric's
managing director, he has been pursuing it with all the enthusiasm and zeal
of a Arthurian knight.
Casley's determination to follow a quality improvement programme at the
regional electricity company is based on common sense and pragmatism - and
significantly not on a management consultant's blueprint.
'Satisfied customers mean a satisfactorily profitable business,' he says. He
firmly rejects the notion that improving quality means higher costs. 'In our
view, quality is really getting it right first time, identifying what a
customer wants and then making sure the customer gets it. Quality is
productivity and efficiency by a much more acceptable name.'
When it was privatised in December 1990, Southern inherited a huge business
franchise covering 16,500 square kilometres with more than 2.5m customers,
8,200 employees and an annual turnover of about Pounds 1.6bn.
But the prospect of privatisation had already provided the crucial catalyst
for change. The roots of Southern's quality programme go back five years to
when the company's management embarked upon a drive to become the most
successful of all the - then - area electricity boards.
As part of this effort, the business was reorganised into six operating
divisions, each led by a divisional manager and management team. These new
teams were asked to come up with proposals for overcoming problems - like
staff attitudes and image - which had been identified as 'obstacles to
success'. What emerged was a plan for team building and team briefings which
started in February 1987.
By the autumn of 1990, Casley says the company had 'reached a stage when we
were ready for the next leap forward'. He had become convinced that
improving the quality of service provided to customers - internal as well as
external - was the next challenge.
In September that year, Casley contacted all 900 team briefers inviting them
to ask their teams to name the two or three things 'that drive our customers
crazy'. The response was overwhelming.
'It was obvious that people were bursting at the seams to do something,'
says Casley. He was then able to announce that in response to the
suggestions, a 'quality manager' would be appointed, a quality improvement
programme would be adopted and the company would seek registration with
Marketing Quality Assurance, the independent UK body which assesses and
designates compliance with BS 5750-type quality standards for marketing,
sales and customer service activities.
Casley believes strongly that it is important that the workforce 'own the
quality programme' rather than having it imposed on them from either above
or outside.
At the start of December 1990, Edward Hyams, one of Southern's field
managers, was appointed quality director. He reports directly to the
managing director, makes regular presentations to the executive, and attends
the monthly management meeting which always has quality on agenda.
Casley said he decided to seek MQA registration because its approach was
'practical, sane, sensible and realistic'. Adopting this route provided a
framework for the quality programme while Casely exploited an existing
friendship with Southern California Edison, the US electric utility, to
provide a benchmark and role model.
MQA conducted an initial assessment - asking searching questions about
Southern's systems and procedures - an experience Casley describes as like
'holding up a mirror to expose the holes'. But it was up to Southern to plan
and execute its own quality improvement programme.
The 'master plan' for the project remains the company's 48-page quality
manual which embodies the 'mission' or 'ultimate quality goal'. This aims to
ensure that all Southern Electric employees work together to provide a
quality service which:
is profitable
satisfies our customers
we are proud to present.
Wall posters and Quest for Quality leaflets introducing the programme
carried the mission message while employees were encouraged to join or set
up odd-sounding committees like Quigs - Quality Improvement Groups  - to
tackle problems affecting quality.
To ensure the message got through, there were presentations to all managers
and employees on quality, a corporate quality video and articles in the
staff newspaper which is sent to everyone's home. Meanwhile the quality
management department produced a set of customer service guidelines.
So how were customers made aware of Southern's quality drive?
Among measures adopted to improve the quality of customer service, telephone
bureau operators answering customer calls now give their names and, on a
sampling basis, customers are called back afterwards to find out if they are
satisfied with the results. Service engineers use their mobile telephones to
tell customers if they will be late for an appointment.
At the same time, Southern has successfully managed to better the nine
guaranteed service standards which Offer, the industry regulator, imposes on
the privatised regionals. For example, the regulator requires that customers
be given two days notice of disconnection for maintainance but Southern
gives a full week.
The company monitors and scrutinises its compliance with the externally
imposed standards and with its own 39 business indicators. 'Unless an
organisation keeps score, it does not know whether it is succeeding,' says
Casley.
Southern also draws up a comparative league table for its six divisions.
'People are very competitive and quality is about being competitive as
well,' says Casley. Each month a performance report is presented to the
management meeting.
Casley has no doubt the quality programme has produced gains, although he
emphasises that it is a continuing process. Nevertheless, Southern can
already claim some real successes. Symbolising the progress so far, the
company was recently presented with only the second registration certificate
issued by MQA.
Henry Casley is particularly proud of the comment made by MQA's six
assessors who spent a week at Southern preparing their final report: 'The
considerable progress evidently achieved by the company since the initial
assesment carried out by MQA in April 91 appeared to be the result of
considerable effective effort by southern electric directors, management and
staff at all levels in the organisation, who displayed a high level of
commitment to Southern Electric and its quest for quality,' the assessors
said.
Casley believes that Southern's continuing quest will provide real benefits
for customers and shareholders alike, and ensure his company stays
competitive in an increasingly deregulated market.
'We are pursuing quality for a good business reason,' he says. 'People unite
behind quality, it is very proactive. It sounds a bit tough but you can use
quality as the key driver within the organisation because it brings the
people who provide the service face to face with the real world - with what
the customer wants.

<TEXT>
At British Telecom there are 5,000, at Philips 4,500, not to mention the
1,000 at BP. All over the country, middle managers are being laid off. Those
who still have jobs face challenges through new information technology,
quality programmes and fashionable flat management structures.
Yet you would not know it from talking to them. In a survey* of the middle
ranks of British management, some 80 per cent say future restructuring would
pose no threat to their jobs and 75 per cent complacently expected to remain
as managers for their entire careers.
The survey, published today by the British Institute of Management, shows
middle managers to be an optimistic lot: three quarters were expecting a
promotion shortly, and not one of the 1,000 asked saw demotion as likely.
Almost none of the managers expected their jobs to be changed much by trends
towards sub-contracting or greater use of computers. By far the biggest
change in work practices was expected to come through Total Quality
Management, but even in this area, two thirds of middle managers expected no
change.
These replies are sharply out of line with the responses given to the same
questions by the employers. Most of them said that middle managers would be
bearing a greater burden in the future, but that the work would be done
differently, with more emphasis on teams. Pay would increasingly be tied to
performance, they said. Employers also expected middle managers to become
generalists rather than specialists. As work practices changed, they would
no longer be line managers but would start managing specific projects.
The report urges managers to keep their skills up to date, to put emphasis
on team work and to press for more career guidance.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Growth in managers' pay slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES in total pay for managers slowed last year to an average of less
than 10 per cent, according to a pay index from the Noble Lowndes group of
management consultants and actuaries.
The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well
as salaries and bonuses. It is based on the group's regular pay surveys, and
is calculated each quarter for the Financial Times.
The latest survey, which covered 5,304 executives in 417 companies in the
UK, shows that on January 1 the average for managers of all ranks was Pounds
75,794, 9.3 per cent up on the Pounds 69,345 average at the beginning of
1991. The corresponding increase in 1990-91 was 13.8 per cent. Although the
total rose, the bonus element fell slightly last year to Pounds 4,290
compared with Pounds 4,369 in 1990.
In general, the 'all-ranks' rises were lowest in companies with sales
turnovers of less than Pounds 100m, where they averaged just over 8.5 per
cent. The corresponding figures for larger companies were 10.2 per cent for
those in the Pounds 101m-Pounds 600m range and 10 per cent for those
turnovers of Pounds 600m or more.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S commercial farmers, facing compulsory land acquisition by
government, have been told they will have no right of appeal to the High
Court over compensation.
The latest draft of the Land Acquisition Bill, which sets out government
proposals, may be opposed by western donors who are likely to tie future aid
pledges to a demand that farmers be allowed recourse to the court should
they believe compensation to be inadequate.
The government is expected, at a meeting scheduled for mid-February in
Paris, to seek aid pledges of USDollars 1bn (Pounds 571m) required to see it
through the next two years of its economic structural adjustment programme.
The draft provides for a six-man compensation committee, chaired by the
permanent secretary for agriculture, which will decide how much to pay a
farmer whose land is being ac-quired.
The draft also provides for appeal to the Administrative Court, but this
will not have the authority to set aside the committee's decisions, unless
the committee has failed to observe the principles laid down in the bill or
has awarded excessive compensation.
President Robert Mugabe has promised the bill will come before parliament
during its next session, opening towards the end of February.
There has been no official comment from the Commercial Farmers Union, but
individual farmers who have seen the draft say it is 'as bad, if not worse,'
than the original.
Ten years ago the government committed itself to resettling 162,000 families
by 1985; to date it has relocated fewer than 60,000, and even the
government-owned media have described some resettlement schemes as a
failure.
Farmers are particularly upset at the reported existence of maps targeting
farms to be acquired, including some prime tobacco growing areas. Tobacco is
the country's leading export, worth more than USDollars 500m last year.
Compulsory land acquisition is politically popular with the black majority.
Political analysts believe Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party sees the land
bill as its best hope of recapturing grassroots support, which has crumbled
over the last year.

AUSTRALIA'S most populous state, New South Wales, faces increased political
instability after a weekend by-election defeat for the governing
Liberal/National party coalition.
The opposition Labor party won 55 per cent of the votes cast in the coastal
seat of The Entrance, in spite of a strong campaign by Mr Nick Greiner, the
state premier, and Mr John Hewson, leader of the coalition at the federal
level.
The result leaves Labor and the coalition with 47 seats each in the
99-member state parliament, with the balance of power held by five
independents.
It is unlikely to lead to an early state general election because the
independents have agreed not to support a vote of no-confidence unless the
government proves grossly incompetent or corrupt.
However, the result will increase the government's reliance on the
independents and encourage Labor to step up its efforts to force a general
election or a parliamentary re-alignment. The result is also a setback for
the coalition at the federal level. This used to see Mr Greiner's government
as a launching pad for its campaign to oust Labor from the federal
government in Canberra.
The Entrance was one of 49 seats won by the coalition in a NSW state-wide
general election in May. Labor took 46 seats, leaving the balance of power
in the hands of four independents. The result in The Entrance was declared
void after a court challenge by Labor.

<TEXT>
ARAB states have been asked by the Palestine Liberation Organisation to
review their decision to participate in multilateral Middle East peace talks
due to be held in Moscow late this month.
This follows a decision by Syria and Lebanon to boycott the talks, aimed at
broadening the peace process to include all Middle East states, because of
alleged Israeli intransigence. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, said in
Tunis yesterday that Arab participation would be discussed in Morocco on
Friday at an Arab League session. on Jerusalem.
The US and the former Soviet Union, co-sponsors of the latest attempt to
promote Middle East peace, believe a regional forum to discuss such issues
as disarmament, water and the environment would promote confidence among
participants, including Israel.
Most Arab states, including those from the Gulf and North Africa, had agreed
in principle to attend the Moscow session. Iraq and Libya are among the
exceptions.
Three rounds of bilateral talks between Israel and its immediate neighbours,
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, have yielded little progress
since the meetings began in Madrid last November.
The Palestinians have also been threatening to boycott the Moscow round in
protest at US plans to provide up to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan
guarantees to Israel.
Palestinian representatives claim the money will facilitate Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories.
Egypt yesterday halted a planned 30 per cent price rise for butane gas
cylinders, in a clear sign of government nervousness over the impact of
policies inspired by the International Monetary Fund. The change of heart
over gas, used for cooking and heating by most Egyptians, follows strikes
against sharp rises in the cost of living. The decision also reflects
government concern about public order in the light of Algerian developments.

<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA is urging the US to organise a large covert campaign to help
Kurdish and Shia rebels overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq,
according to US newspaper reports.
The New York Times said Saudi Arabia wanted to provide air support as well
as missiles and arms to help rebels against Mr Saddam's helicopters and
tanks.
Mr Richard Cheney, US secretary of defence, yesterday described the report
as 'overblown,' arguing that Mr Saddam, although still in power, no longer
posed much of a threat to his neighbours or to the world.
'How many American lives is toppling Saddam Hussein worth? My answer to that
is not very damn many,' he said in a television interview, adding he
believed the Iraqi leader would eventually be ousted.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, added: 'So long as we
maintain the sanction as we have and as our allies have and as the UN has, I
do not think he's a danger outside his country.'
But other Bush administration officials have sought to step up support for
the Iraqi opposition, in a debate that has intensified with the anniversary
of Operation Desert Storm.
President George Bush's political opponents have seized on Mr Saddam's
continuing grip on power to criticise his proudest foreign policy
achievement, at the time when his prospects of re-election have begun to be
shaken by the US recession.
General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, is reported
to have argued that increased US intervention could only be successful if it
involved at least as large a ground force as that used in Desert Storm.
Saudi officials, according to the New York Times, believe the allies would
not have to commit ground troops, but could limit their role to supplying
missiles and munitions to the rebels and providing air cover against the
helicopters and armoured units of Mr Saddam's Republican Guard.

FT  20 JAN 92 / La Defense developer chargedin crackdown on corruption

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF France's leading property developers, Mr Christian Pellerin, has been
charged with financial irregularities, in the latest move in a judicial
crackdown on alleged corruption in the property industry.
Mr Pellerin, who handled the development of a large part of La Defense, the
prestigious office district west of Paris, has been charged, after two days
of police questioning, with 'aiding and abetting' both the 'abuse of
corporate property and falsification'. He denies both charges.
He is the sixth person to be charged over FFr12.5m (Pounds 1.3m) of
commissions paid during the purchase and resale of an office block in La
Defense three years ago. It was acquired in 1988 from British Petroleum by a
consortium of developers - including Mr Pellerin's company - for an
estimated FFr530m and resold at a FFr230m profit to Banque Indosuez a year
later.
Mr Pellerin (47) is an establishment figure, as chairman of Societe
d'Administration et de Realisation d'Investissement (Sari), a subsidiary of
the water distribution utility, Compagnie Generale des Eaux. He was also one
of the original backers of Mr Georges Pebereau, the financier, in his failed
attempt to gain control of Societe Generale, the privatised bank, in 1988.
The developer claimed in television and radio interviews over the weekend
that he was the victim of a plot to distract attention from a wider scandal,
possibly involving the police. Sari was 'the tree which hides the forest',
claimed Mr Pellerin.
The charges, the climax of a series of financial scandals, are being taken
by Paris property developers as confirmation of the seriousness of a
campaign to clean up the commissions paid by developers to middlemen, often
in local government, to help win important deals.
Such commissions are accepted practice in most cases. But the government
decentralisation of powers to local authorities over the past six years has
created fertile ground for corruption, as shown by a separate scandal over
political party financing, which climaxed recently with a police raid on the
Paris headquarters of the governing Socialist party.
Charges have also been brought against Mr Yves Rohou, president of PII, the
original member of the consortium that set up the BP office block deal. Mr
Rohou is accused of abuse of corporate property. Four others have been
charged in recent months over the same transaction, including Mr Christian
Schwartz, director general of PII.
The inquiry has been going on for more than two years, and was given impetus
by the two suicides in 1990 of a senior police officer and an insurance
agent, shortly before they were due to be interviewed over their alleged
involvement in the transaction. Mr Pellerin has denied knowing the dead
policeman.

FT  20 JAN 92 / The European Market: EC television ownership rules - a fuzzy
picture / Little sign of a single market when it comes to buying a TV
station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY

<TEXT>
MR LESLIE HILL, chairman and chief executive of Central Independent
Television, is not a Little Englander of the television business trying to
build barricades around Birmingham and his Midlands franchise. Central,
after all, is the company that won awards with 'Auf Wiedersehen Pet', a
comedy series about British building workers in Germany.
He insists that he welcomes competition from the rest of the European
Community but would like there to be something approaching a level playing
field.
In the year the single European market is due to be completed, he has drawn
attention to a series of anomalies in the ownership of commercial television
companies. While a Community citizen or company can in theory take over a
commercial television company, there are often government restrictions
preventing this. In some cases these restrictions apply to everyone, in
others just to foreign owners.
Some appear to be clear breaches of the Treaty of Rome and of any concept of
a single market. This year, the British government will formally lodge a
complaint with the Commission against apparent, very public cases of
discrimination against British and other EC television companies.
'We are in uncharted territory here,' said one senior Eurocrat contemplating
the imminent arrival of yet another piece of Community awkwardness from the
UK. The facts are relatively straightforward. Research carried for Central
shows a maze of differing television ownership rules and restrictions
throughout the EC.
In Germany where commercial channels have to be licensed by each regional
government, preference can be given to channels with 50 per cent or more
German ownership. Non-German controlled channels are not considered for
traditional terrestrial, as opposed to satellite, frequencies. In Greece,
foreign ownership of a commercial television station is limited to 25 per
cent; in Portugal, the limit in the new commercial channel TV1 is 15 per
cent.
Belgian legislation stipulates that 51 per cent of the private station
broadcasting to the Flemish community must be owned by the publishers of
Dutch-language daily or weekly newspapers.
In France and Spain there are rules setting maximum ownership limits of 25
per cent for commercial stations, although these limits apply to everyone,
including French and Spanish nationals. The principal aim is to prevent
concentrations of media power.
In the UK, by contrast, the government was advised when drawing up the 1990
Broadcasting Act that it would be a breach of the Rome Treaty to try to
exclude other EC nationals. As a result, after a temporary restriction - a
two-year moratorium on hostile takeovers of Independent Television (ITV)
companies which runs out at the beginning of 1994 - any Community company
will be able to own 100 per cent of an ITV company.
The imbalance between the position in the UK and in some other Community
countries, says Mr Hill, is 'unfair and wrong'. Central is particularly
concerned because it is more vulnerable to foreign takeover than most. Not
only is it the second largest ITV company, broadcasting to 9m people, but it
retained its franchise unopposed with a bid of just Pounds 2,000 a year.
More fundamentally, however, the Central chairman believes that in the
longer term the world media could be dominated by half a dozen companies,
two of which would probably be American, two Japanese and two European. In
such a scenario Britain's tiny ITV companies could be sidelined if they were
effectively prevented from expanding at home or into the rest of Europe.
There are understandable sensitivities among smaller nations trying to
defend minority languages and cultures that they should have some say over
who owns and operates the dominant mass medium - television. It is also
impossible to address the issue of television ownership rules in the
Community without considering the dangers of media concentration.
There are already at least four significant cross-border operators in
European television: Mr Leo Kirch of Germany, Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest, CLT of Luxembourg, and Canal Plus of France.
Even if exceptions on cultural grounds have to be granted there is surely a
case for trying to remove some of the distortions and introduce some harmony
into ownership rules within what is supposed to be developing as a single
market.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Publishers fight for their advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING European publishers have drawn up a declaration on press rights and
freedoms to put to the European Commission in the face of proposed
regulations threatening to affect advertising of everything from tobacco and
alcohol to pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs.
It will form the basis of talks between Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president, and the European Publishers Council (EPC) next month.
The publishers, including Axel Springer and Burda of Germany, Elsevier of
the Netherlands, and News Corporation and the Daily Telegraph group of the
UK, are stressing how the viability of an independent press depends on
advertising revenues. 'Advertising revenues therefore support pluralism,
diversity and the freedom of the press,' the declaration argues.
The publishers, who spell out the importance of an independent written press
to political democracies, also want newsprint tariffs abolished.
A survey of EPC members by consultants Touche Ross found that revenues from
tobacco and alcohol advertising amounted to almost 18 per cent of net
profits of newspapers and magazines combined - 40 per cent for magazines
alone. Advertising of foodstuffs, and pharmaceuticals as well as tobacco and
alcohol together represent 22 per cent of magazine display advertising and
10 per cent of total magazine revenue.
In the longer term a reduction of advertising revenues could lead to smaller
publications or even the closure of titles.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Energy market plans scaled down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE industrial users of gas and electricity should be the principal
beneficiaries of controversial plans to open up the European energy market
to greater competition.
The plans, which are likely to be approved by the European Commission on
Wednesday, have been watered down since last summer, partly to win the
support of some sceptical commissioners and member states. However, they
will be fiercely opposed by the gas and electricity industries.
If approved, the draft directives will enable users of more than 100
GW/hours of electricity a year, or more than 25m cubic metres of gas
annually, to buy their energy from suppliers anywhere in the Community from
January 1, 1993, subject to capacity being available.
The threshold should apply to heavy users of gas, such as fertiliser and
chemical plants, and electricity consumers ranging from the largest
aluminium and steel factories down to glass-making.
In theory, larger energy distributors would also be able to pick suppliers
outside their home country, thus passing on the benefits of competition to
smaller consumers.
The plans would also allow competing companies to generate electricity and
build power lines and gas pipelines, and would insist on separating the
management and accounting of integrated production, transmission and
distribution operations. Regulation would largely be left to each state.
The first stage of energy liberalisation has already been introduced, in the
form of two directives forcing utilities to allow the transport of gas and
electricity across EC borders. Brussels officials hope this second stage
will prompt industrial users not covered by the new directives to press for
further opening of access to energy networks.
Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, decided to adopt a
phased approach last autumn, dropping more aggressive plans to use special
legal powers to break energy monopolies. He has now discussed the new ideas
with all 12 EC energy ministers. 'It was much easier to sell the idea in
this form; and in three or four countries we were surprised to receive a
favourable reception when beforehand it was more difficult,' he said last
week.
But some member states - most notably the Netherlands and Germany which are
protective of their gas producers - and the industries themselves will fight
attempts to push for increased third party access to networks.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Brussels targets poorest states: Draft budget would double
aid to four countries over five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community aid to its four poorest members - Spain, Portugal,
Ireland and Greece - would double over the next five years under budget
proposals broadly agreed by the European Commission at the weekend.
The overall EC budget, set at Ecu66bn (Pounds 47.38bn) for this year, would
rise from its current statutory limit of 1.2 per cent of Community gross
domestic product to between 1.35 per cent and 1.45 per cent for 1993-7,
according to senior officials. The Commission intends to finalise these
proposals on February 11 and announce them to the European parliament the
following day. The final decision rests with the 12 heads of government,
either at a special summit - probably in May - or at the Lisbon summit in
June.
However, the larger part of Saturday's special Commission meeting was
devoted to the EC's fast-growing financial obligations abroad, particularly
towards eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Officials say there is
as yet no consensus on external aid, or on the wish of Mr Jacques Delors,
Commission president, for an industrial restructuring fund to help the EC's
defence, car, electronics and textiles industries.
The doubling of fiscal transfers to the four poorest countries would be done
though big increases in the so-called structural funds, aimed at helping
laggard and industrially stricken regions catch up, and through the
'cohesion fund' agreed at December's Maastricht summit. This fund,
introduced at Spain's insistence, is to help these countries meet EC
environmental standards and improve transport links.
The structural funds were doubled in 1988 to Ecu63bn for the 1989-93 period,
to help poorer EC areas prepare for next year's single market. The new
effort is a shock absorber for economic and monetary union, for which
Maastricht set 1999 as the latest date.
What has not yet been decided, officials say, is whether the doubling would
be for the four countries overall, or each of them individually. 'There is
still a lot to play for,' one remarked. Ireland, for instance, receives per
capita about double the EC aid Spain receives. The final overall size of the
budget will also determine whether industrially declining regions - like
Tyneside and Scotland in the UK - have their level of aid increased by a
third or a half.
There were no clear conclusions, or numbers, attached to the external aid
policy debate. According to one official, the Commission is moving towards
placing foreign aid as a separate line in the budget, rather than as now, in
a miscellany which makes setting priorities difficult. Such a line would
have a permanent reserve, enabling Brussels to respond much to emergencies
more quickly. Officials say there is little backing so far for any
industrial restructuring fund, which would in part regroup existing spending
on research and development, training and long-term unemployment.
The new budget package has yet to deal with the common agricultural policy,
which absorbs nearly three-fifths of EC spending. Well-advanced reform plans
envisage higher short-term farm outlays, but the impasse over farm subsidies
in the Uruguay Round trade talks has led to doubts whether the reform will
survive intact.

FINLAND'S prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, and his cabinet colleagues from the
Centre party have been given full power by their divided party MPs to
'examine the conditions for Finland's eventual membership' of the European
Community.
The final decision on whether to apply to join the EC is still expected to
be made next month by the centre-right coalition government. However, unless
he can carry a majority of his party with him, Mr Aho will be unable to
agree to an application. So far, he has not indicated what he wants to do
although he is believed to be sympathetic to joining.
Both the Conservatives, who are the Centre's main coalition partner, and the
main opposition Social Democrats have come out strongly in support of an EC
application by Finland.
Some in the Centre party want to make any entry application conditional on
Brussels treating Finland as a special case in sensitive areas like farm
support. Other party leaders argue the EC will not accept such an approach.
In the end, whether Finland joins the EC will be determined by a national
referendum.

high hopes

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S expanding far-right parties are preparing a springtime blitz to
carry forward their assault on the bastions of political power. Elections in
France, Germany and Italy in March and April seem likely to deliver fresh
gains for the ultra-right, following successes in Austria, Switzerland and
Belgium at the end of last year.
Support for radical parties in the prosperous half of Europe has been fed by
problems caused by immigration, high unemployment and housing pressures, as
well as by disillusionment with the established parties.
It is a social as well as a political malaise - and it looks unlikely to
disappear quickly. 'People are rebelling against a world which turns them
into mere helpless consumers, and where immigration makes them feel
strangers in their own land,' according to Mr Michael Sturmer, head of the
Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, the German government-backed think-tank.
The treaty for European union agreed at the Maastricht summit could in some
cases give the right an additional boost when it goes to parliaments for
ratification this year. The deal is likely to raise hackles among voters
concerned about the effects of opening borders and diluting national
decision-making.
The exact mix of issues behind increased right-wing strength varies between
regions. In Italy, the Lega Lombarda (Lombard League), with its roots in the
north, has now spread its organisation across the whole of the country under
its energetic leader Mr Umberto Bossi. He suffered a heart attack before
Christmas but is now back in action. The party looks set to garner a
sizeable protest vote in Italy's general election in April - profiting above
all from voters' exasperation with the established parties' squabbling.
Similar protests at bickering by traditional parties were the main reason -
with immigration concerns - behind the surge in support for Vlaams Blok, the
Flemish nationalist right-wing party, in Belgium's general election in
November. In Switzerland and Austria, the radical right has also profited
from dissatisfaction with the established government parties to deal with
problems like immigration, housing, crime and inflation. The Swiss
government recently voiced fears that the rising tide of protest voting
could disrupt its efforts to join the EC in the mid-1990s.
In the Netherlands, another well-off country where right-wing resentment has
bubbled to the surface, Mr Hans Janmaat, the member of parliament for the
far-right Centre Democrats, cites the Vlaams Blok victory to justify
confidence about his own party's prospects: 'Our present support level is
around 5 per cent, which would give us eight or nine seats in parliament.'
Mr Janmaat has done his best to puncture satisfaction in the Dutch
parliament about the results of the Maastricht summit, hitting out at
'reckless' European integration which threatened to submerge Dutch national
interests.
The Maastricht accord is looming particularly large in the strategies of
right-wing parties in France and Germany. It is in these countries that
potential for a right-wing backlash against the EC deal appears greatest.
This could severely hamper the traditional role of the Paris and Bonn
governments as sponsors of European integration.
In France, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the one-eyed former paratrooper who heads
the National Front (FN), has been shrugging off attacks from Mrs Edith
Cresson, the prime minister, claiming he is an 'enemy of democracy'. Opinion
pollsters say he stands a good chance of winning the region of
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur for his party in the regional elections in March.
The FN is fielding candidates in all 22 French regions. Victory for the FN
on the Cote d'Azur, which would propel Mr Le Pen to the position of
president of the regional council, would give him a prestigious new
platform.
The FN is doing well in industrially depressed suburban areas north and west
of Paris, and in southern towns, which can be highly exposed to immigration.
Mr Le Pen has promised a vigorous campaign against the Maastricht deal,
which he complains will lead to a European 'super-state' signifying France's
'political suicide'.
Success on the French Riviera would increase the chances that the
established parties on the right will adopt policies similar to Mr Le Pen's
to prevent voters turning to the fringes. This could herald a tougher French
line in defence of national sovereignty. Mr Alain Peyrefitte, the Gaullist
former justice minister, warned pointedly at the end of last year that
pressing on towards a 'Europe without frontiers' could spark 'aggressive
nationalism' as a counter-reaction.
In Germany, the last few months have seen a spate of attacks on immigrants
by far-right youths, as well as 1930s-style marches by neo-Nazi groups. The
Bonn Interior Ministry registered 950 attacks against foreigners in October,
534 in November and 187 in December. As well as taking aim at the
government's failure to lower the inflows of asylum-seekers into Germany,
the far right has hit out strongly at the Maastricht accord. In particular,
they have lambasted Chancellor Helmut Kohl's assent to monetary union later
in the 1990s, which effectively delivers the death sentence for the D-Mark.
The neo-Nazi National Democrats (NPD), the xenophobic German People's party
(DVU) and the slightly less extreme Republican party are separately fighting
the state election in Germany in Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wurttemberg on
April 5. Mr Bruno Wetzel, one of the DVU's top organisers, promises efforts
to combat the abolition of the D-Mark and transfer of sovereignty abroad.
'If you mix together strong currencies and weak ones, you give up
stability.'
After gaining six parliamentary seats in the northern state of Bremen in
October, the DVU is confident of passing the 5 per cent hurdle necessary for
parliamentary representation in Schleswig-Holstein. In Baden-Wurttemberg, Mr
Gunter Deckert, the NPD's national leader, says he believes the NPD together
with the Republicans will comfortably exceed the 5 per cent score.
Mr Deckert, a schoolteacher sacked three years ago because of his right-wing
tendencies, likes to spend his holidays at Worthing on England's south
coast. But he has no great love of foreigners in his own country: the NPD
campaigns to send them home, as well as to protect the environment and
maintain the sanctity of the D-Mark.
Mr Deckert calls German unification simply 'partial' because Germany has not
yet won back its former territories in Poland. Somewhat ominously, he claims
the NPD is picking up a significant amount of youthful support.
An intensified debate in Germany about the future of the D-Mark will almost
automatically add to the NPD's following, Mr Deckert says. In a remark
indicating the political problems which could ensue for Mr Kohl in the event
of a full-scale German recession, the NPD leader adds: 'Once there are
anxieties about the economy, we gain support from middle-aged people, and
not just the young.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS EDITH CRESSON, French prime minister, has taken legal action against Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, for
allegedly insulting her government.
She has issued an official complaint over a speech in Brittany last week, in
which Mr Le Pen called the Socialist administration 'a pack of robbers,
racketeers and gangsters'. Mr Le Pen, who was referring to a police inquiry
into Socialist party finances, said over the weekend he stuck by his words.
The government's action is believed to be the first of its type. It is based
on a 111-year-old law outlawing slander against administrations, on pain of
between six days and three months in prison plus a fine of FFr150 to
FFr80,000 (Pounds 8,300).
Mrs Cresson's attack won support yesterday from some opposition politicians
as well as from her own party. 'She not only had the right to do it, but she
was right to do it,' said Mrs Monique Pelletier, a former government
minister and member of the UDF centre-right grouping.
This is the latest skirmish in the political activity building up in France
ahead of the March regional elections. The National Front is expected to
come out as an important minority, while the respectable right is expected
to hold on to its large majority in regional government.
The row comes just as the RPR and the UDF, the two main opposition parties,
are making progress in their attempts to form an alliance for the
presidential elections, due in 1995. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, UDF
president, and Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR president, agreed at the weekend to
speed work on forming a single party of the right.
However, they remained divided on the important issue of how to choose a
single presidential candidate, for which post they are fierce rivals.

SERB leaders from Croatia yesterday promised that Serbs would not remain in
an independent Croatian state. Mr Goran Hadzic, leader of the
self-proclaimed Serb region in eastern Croatia, said: 'Serbs from our
region, at the price of our lives, will not remain in independent Croatia.'
His remarks coincide with heightened tensions in Bosnia-Hercegovina over
plans to hold a referendum on independence for the republic of 4.4m people.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, said parliament would approve
the proposed referendum later this week.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs, who oppose independence,
said: 'The referendum will be for Bosnia's Moslems and Croats, because the
Serbs have already chosen to remain in Yugoslavia.'
The federal military, which has substantial munitions and air force
industries in Bosnia, sharply opposes the referendum. A letter signed by the
'officers and soldiers' of the Banja Luka corps, western Bosnia, at the
weekend 'demanded' that the 'only acceptable question was: are you for a
sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina within the framework of a new Yugoslavia?'
The Serb-dominated army and Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, are
planning to form a rump Yugoslavia which would include Bosnia and
Montenegro, Serbia's closest ally. But Mr Momir Bulatovic, Montenegro's
president, said at the weekend: 'It is realistic that only Serbia and
Montenegro would remain together in a common state.'
Meanwhile, both Croatian and Serbian media yesterday reported sporadic
violations of the latest ceasefire, brokered by the UN on January 3.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Black Sea fleet becomes post-Soviet battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more than two centuries of defending the Russian empire and the Soviet
Union which succeeded it, the Black Sea fleet has itself become a
battleground. From its Sebastopol headquarters, perched on the tip of the
Crimean peninsula, the Black Sea fleet has become one of the most fiercely
contested standards in the contest over the political shape of what was once
the Soviet Union.
Ukraine's campaign to take over the fleet has sparked passionate resistance
from Russian leaders and the Soviet Admiralty. Unlike the Baltic republics,
which seek the withdrawal of the Soviet 'occupation' army, Ukraine has moved
steadily to transform the troops on its soil into a Ukrainian national army.
In Sebastopol much more is at stake than the Black Sea fleet's 90,000
personnel, 300 small ships, 45 warships, 28 submarines, and 159 aircraft.
The fierce objections to the Ukrainian takeover are a rearguard effort to
preserve some shadow of the Soviet Union by maintaining a united military
and beefing up the authority of the Commonwealth.
Founded by Catherine the Great in the 18th century, the fleet is also a
touchstone for Russian nationalism and a symbol of Russia's striving to
become a world power. It is a proxy for the contested Crimean peninsula,
which was only transferred to Ukraine in 1954 and which many Russians would
like back.
Fleet press attache Captain Andrei Graichov is bitter. 'They took away our
homeland and in its place they gave us an open economic zone,' he said. 'How
can I take an oath to an individual republic? My mother is Ukrainian, my
father is Russian: whose people should I serve?'
Captain Graichov's confusion echoes his commander's. Admiral Igor Kasatonov
 -an ethnic Russian who was only transferred to Ukraine last autumn - would
not describe himself as a citizen either of Ukraine or Russia. Instead, he
said he was a citizen of the Commonwealth, a classification which has no
legal status.
Admiral Kasatonov argued that the fleet should not be divided, citing the
need to counterbalance the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. But, while
the commanders of the fleet make a point of taking their orders only from
Moscow, a slim majority of officers seem to be swaying towards Kiev, as
suggested by the fleet's 75 per cent endorsement of independence in
Ukraine's referendum.
Sailing through the choppy Sebastopol harbour on a civilian ferry, Volodia,
a captain who teaches at one of the city's famed naval academies, says there
is a rift between the vertushka, or command, and the officer corps.
An ethnic Russian, Volodia says he is ready to swear allegiance to Ukraine.
Like many of his comrades, he is concerned more about tensions than about
politics and feels Ukraine promises greater material security.
The geopolitical and ideological struggle has now been thinly disguised as a
quarrel over semantics. On January 12, Russia and Ukraine agreed 'strategic
forces' should be under central control, but the definition of these is
hotly disputed. Western experts say the fleet currently carries no nuclear
weapons but can be armed with tactical nuclear missiles now in storage.
Ukraine's endgame is to push the pace of disarmament - all tactical warheads
are to be gone by July - and thus qualify for control of a greater part of
the fleet.

FT  20 JAN 92 / Stolpe admits Stasi links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democrat prime minister of the German state of
Brandenburg, has admitted to more than 30 years of regular and extensive
contacts with the Stasi, the former East German state security service - but
denied ever being an informer.
His explanation was published this weekend in the weekly magazine Der
Spiegel, at a time when the opening of all the Stasi files from 40 years of
Communist rule is leading to almost daily revelations of co-operation by
prominent east German citizens.
His action brought both instant but isolated condemnation, including one
call for his resignation, and widespread support from all parts of the
political spectrum in the former East Germany.
Mr Stolpe, the most senior lay official in the Evangelical Church in his own
province since 1982, co-founder of the reformed Social Democrats in the
east, and probably the outstanding political figure to emerge in eastern
public life since unification, defended his admission as an attempt to
explain how life worked in the Communist state, not to protect himself
against possible criticism.
He already admitted more than a year ago to regular contacts with the Stasi,
dealing above all with aspects of church-state relations. The latest
publication, an extended excerpt from a book to be published in March,
spells out much more detail.
In his article he suggests that the collapse of the Soviet empire, and the
rapid reintegration of East Germany into the west, have left only the most
'consistent anti-Communists, those who opted to wait and see, and those who
went into hibernation' as the only victors of the process.
Yet the aim of his own contacts with the authorities, and of other
honourable people like him, was 'to outwit the Communist state through its
own instruments of power'.
Mr Stolpe's confession brought defences from fellow churchmen such as Pastor
Rainer Eppelmann, now a leading member of the rival Christian Democrats, and
senior figures in the SPD. Mr Eppelmann said Mr Stolpe's confession rang
true: 'There is no logical motive for (him to have been) an informer.'
However the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria, the sister
party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, called for his
resignation.
Mr Stolpe's article coincided with a call from President Richard von
Weizsacker, the respected German head of state, for caution to be exercised
in the use of the Stasi files. 'We must learn to use them carefully and
cautiously,' he told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper. 'We are talking
about the fate of human beings.'

FT  20 JAN 92 / EC unit planned to help avert Brussels 'own goals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is planning to set up a unit to prevent Brussels
scoring damaging 'own goals' in an effort to smooth ratification of the
treaty on European Union agreed at the Maastricht summit in December.
The unit will seek to ensure that Eurocrats do not produce measures of
particular sensitivity in individual member states at moments when they
might cause political rows that could disrupt ratification of the treaty. A
senior Commission official said the ad hoc grouping would offer advice on
the timing of EC measures without attempting to alter their substance.
A less structured attempt to anticipate controversy operated in the run-up
to Maastricht itself. This was largely in response to UK sensitivities,
after Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, lambasted Brussels for
trying to 'exert its influence in every nook and cranny of daily life'.
The apparent spark for this row, amid much pre-summit posturing, was a
letter to the UK government from Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment
commissioner. This sought to delay work on seven big construction projects
until an environmental impact assessment had been completed and publicly
disseminated, as required by EC law.
Senior Commission officials confirm that a range of sensitive measures were
then taken off the Brussels agenda until after the summit. These included
the decision to prosecute the UK for the England and Wales Milk Marketing
Board's attempts to extend its monopoly over the purchase of liquid milk,
finally taken just before Christmas.
Plans to extend environmental impact assessment requirements from individual
projects to national policies, and a green paper on the liberalisation of
postal services, were held over until later this month.
Mr Ripa di Meana acknowledges 'that anguish was felt here before
Maastricht', adding that 'I have to recognise that there are tactical
moments when a slackening is requested.' He said he was not aware of any new
monitoring unit, but reasoned that the pressures on his office not to rock
the boat were sufficiently constant that he would not necessarily notice.
He repeated his remark he made during the pre-Maastricht controversy, that
'either you're a troublemaker or you're useless as an environment
commissioner'.
The current Portuguese presidency of the EC has scheduled the formal signing
of the political, economic and monetary union treaty for February 7. Even if
this deadline is met, ratification then requires the assent of 12
parliaments, and a referendum in Ireland and Denmark.

The US plans to reduce shark fishing in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of
Mexico, to try to preserve species threatened by a rising demand for
shark-fin soup, George Graham writes from Washington.
The US National Marine Fisheries Service plans to impose commercial fishing
quotas for 29 species of coastal shark, including the tiger shark, the great
white shark and the hammerhead. Ten species of pelagic shark will also be
protected, with particular safeguards placed around the mako shark, much
sought after for its meat. Makos less than 66 inches long may not be killed.
US officials said overfishing had threatened the survival of some species,
although none were yet listed as endangered.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Travel: A view from the river - Christian Tyler finds a lazy
and satisfying way to soak up Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NOSTALGIC traveller feels a sharp sense of loss when he retraces his
steps. Treasured images of the past are irretrievably altered, like muzzy
black-and-white photographs overlaid with modern colour transparencies. Old
impressions are obliterated by new ones, leaving only the memory of a
memory.
Yet to follow one's own tracks is irresistible. The pleasure of a visit to a
half-remembered past is as intense as the thrill of a new encounter. And
sometimes the modern picture turns out to be an improvement on the old
print.
Or so I reflected as I stood on the rainy deck of a Danube cruise ship one
evening last year, scanning the north bank for the tall, bare rock that
marks the Austrian-Czech border. I had last crossed this border 25 years
before in a wood-and-canvas canoe, drifting by the rock in the early
morning, unobserved and undocumented. I recalled a watch-tower on its
summit, a barrack block half way up its face and a wire fence running at
right angles to the river.
This time the rock loomed up in the last flicker of twilight. The
watch-tower and the wire were gone and the barrack block was empty. The Iron
Curtain had been rolled up and taken away. Behind me, in a glow of
artificial candlelight, 180 passengers aboard the Danube Princess were
raising their forks for the first stab of herring fillet, the overture to a
gastronomic ordeal comprising consomme with goose liver dumplings,
Indonesian noodles, mixed salad, roast suckling pig and Bavarian cabbage,
sauteed slices of calves' liver, tiramisu fiorentina, cheese, fruit and
coffee.
The slab-sided cruise ships on the Danube are really motorised restaurants,
German, Austrian or Russian-owned, in which you may eat your way the length
of old Europe, from Passau to Vienna, to Bratislava, Budapest and down as
far as the Black Sea.
Outside the window the scenery - fields and forests for the most part - is
slowly and silently unreeled like the studio backdrop to an old film. Tugs
and motorised barges from the Russian port of Izmail in the delta struggle
by; the captain's bicycle is on the roof of the bridge and his wife's
underwear flaps from the the aerial. Herons stand in the shallows as
motionless as table lamps. For the well-fed observer it is a lazy and
satisfying way of soaking up some history.
The river provides a romantic perspective on Europe. The first thing I saw
in the Danube valley this time was a vintage Rolls-Royce lying on its side
in the ditch. It looked as if it had been abandoned by one of those
swashbuckling baronets in a Dornford Yates novel.
Durnstein in the Wachau region of Austria brought Grimm's fairy tales to
life: an old woman with an apple-doll's complexion sold us three bottles of
local wine from her house on the river bank, a dwelling which last saw the
builders in about 1400.
At Grein, a village built in the fantasy-kitsch style of early Walt Disney,
the elderly guide led us up the back stairs of the Rathaus to see a 60-seat
theatre built in 1791. This time it was she, not the visitor, who suffered
the flashback. She mentioned the name of a lady in Yorkshire who had
employed her in 1937: it was my great-grandmother.
When we docked outside Vienna, I took my wife in search of the heuriges
weinhaus where years before, with co-canoeist Andro Linklater, I had stopped
for a drink or three on the way to Belgrade.
The place had evaporated; but we found a substitute on the edge of Nussdorf.
We sat at a table with three witches, very friendly and very drunk. Our
conversation was obscure. First Witch leaned forward and whispered:
'Cricklevood]'. Second Witch passed a jar of horseradish sauce and cackled:
'Take it easy]'. Third Witch had forgotten her lines, so First Witch started
up again: 'Cricklevood Lane]'
A day in Vienna is long enough - long enough in our case to hear Haydn's
Mariazeller mass performed by choir and orchestra from the gallery of the
Augustinian church, a sound more beautiful than any professional recording;
to be treated to a gourmet lunch at the Bristol Hotel; to saunter through
the holiday crowds with the shops mercifully shut; to race back to the boat
to change and to re-emerge in the evening for a performance of Mozart's
Idomeneo conducted by Harnoncourt at the Staatsoper.
In Budapest we were able to take a rest from our fellow-passengers. All but
nine of us on the boat were Germans from the north. They were docile,
punctual and impassive. If you opened a door for them or smiled a good
morning you were met with a blank stare. If you complained about the barking
of the ship's tannoy - a device for murdering sleep as well as for imparting
such vital statistics as the weight of the Vienna TV tower - they looked at
you askance. Few responded as amiably as the one-legged man whom we met
swinging down the steep path from the castle at Durnstein where Blondel is
supposed to have found his master, Richard the Lionheart.
When the clouds parted one day there was a stampede for the sundeck and I
witnessed what others have testified to the world over: the jealous
desperation of the middle-aged German tourist in possession of a sunbed. On
the very last morning of the voyage my wife reported that one particularly
aggressive pair of sunbed-snatchers had deigned finally to acknowledge her
existence. 'But it's too late now,' she said. 'I cut them dead.'
River cruising has this great advantage. You are never far from land, never
too close to your shipmates, never more than a few hours from the next port
of call. Away from the roads, the cities, the crowds, stuffing yourself like
a Strasbourg goose or reclining in your cabin as the green-brown Danube
foams along the hull, waking at night to watch the ship sink out of sight of
the moon into the black depths of a lock, you wonder whether there is any
other way to travel.
Christian Tyler travelled from Passau to Budapest and back on the Danube
Princess, run by Peter Deilmann Cruises and available in the UK through Fred
Olsen Travel of Crown St, Ipswich, Suffolk. His return flight to Munich was
c/o Lufthansa.

NOBODY was decapitated, but it was a close shave. On deck on the Nile
Rhapsody was a valuable cargo - 45 Weekend FT readers on a pre-Christmas
exploration of Egypt. The boat raced towards a bridge over the Nile. With
just sixinches to spare between the bridge girders and the boat's railing,
we shot through - the passengers lying flat on deck.
Boat manager Hany Selim later explained this triumph of the helmsman. 'He
does it all by eye, from where the watermark is on the bridge piers. If it
is all right to go, he has to keep up speed as the Nile does rise and fall a
little. If he slows down, there's a danger the water will suddenly push the
boat up and we hit the bridge.'
The immortal Nile held us captive as firmly as any of the conquered princes
in the days of the pharoahs, who loved to show their prisoners on monuments
with a noose round their necks, hands tied behind their backs and
hieroglyphs to identify them - just like mug shots. Our hieroglyphs would
have indicated that we were from the far reaches of the FT's empire: readers
of ten nationalities living between California and Norway.
Most were businessmen and their wives, several recently retired. We also had
five engineers, two people in financial services, a leading US antiquarian
book dealer and a man from the Foreign Office delighted to be out of reach
of Whitehall. Children waved from the banks and fishermen cast their nets.
Minarets and coptic churches fell behind as the boat progressed through a
dreamworld of river life.
We began to see how the Nile means everything to Egypt. It is the main
highway, uniting a long ribbon of a country where the desert always
threatenes to absorb the green land hugging the river.
The start in Cairo was hectic: three days of pyramids, coptic churches,
mosques, the museum, the bazaar and traffic jams. Once on the boat, the
group began to gell and the river took hold. When the evening mist came down
or the helmsman thought it time to stop, he pulled into the bank and sent a
man ashore with two large iron mooring-spikes and a sledgehammer. Often we
bumped the bottom. I had not realised that the Nile is so shallow, presaging
problems ahead.
The first stops were a special treat, as we had the sites to ourselves.
Helmy el Assar, our guide and protector, who taught the past history and
present aspirations of Egypt with quiet passion, led us to lively pictures
of acrobats, war and wine-making. Here Howard Carter, aged 17, started his
career in archeology in November 1891, copying the paintings.
By 10am we were back on board. Then it was time to laze and look at the
river, and perhaps hear a lecture, until an afternoon visit to a catacomb of
mummified ibises.
Bridge parties formed; readers found they had been to the same school; the
lecturer ploughed through Egyptian history. On the excursions Mohamet, our
tour manager, rounded up strays with the cry: 'FT] FT]', and we grew used to
getting up early for the best view of the sites and to let the boat do as
much as possible by daylight.
At Amarna, green trailers pulled by tractors waited to take us across the
desert plain that was briefly Egypt's capital city 3,300 years ago but is
now desolated to see tombs with pictures of the heretic king, Akhenaten, and
his wife, Nefertiti. Policemen with rifles rode shotgun at the rear of the
wagons.
The Nile struck at the lock below Luxor.
There was not enough water to get through, even if other boats came up
behind, sterns to our stern, to race their propellers and whip up a wash to
lift us over the bar. We left the boats to it and went to see the fabulous
temple of Seti I at Abydos, its fine relief carvings illuminated by the
blessing of cheap electricity from the high dam. Here was the raciest scene
in Egyptian art, which on the whole is pure as driven sand - the conception
of Horuf, which our guide told us to see for ourselves. It made him 'shy and
blushy.'
Next day we had to change boats, but the temples of Dendera, Luxor and
Karnak helped dispel the blues. So to Aswan, a town with terrific shopping
and a good restaurant (el Maasri) in the bazaar, and then by air to Abu
Simbel.
These 13th century BC rock-cut temples of Ramesses II are staggering, with
colossal statues of the pharoah. They would have terrified any African
approaching Egypt - as they were meant to do at this frontier site. He would
have had no doubt of the might and ability to mobilise labour of the world's
first superpower.
Forty-five Weekend FT readers went out, and 45 returned. Who could ask for
more? Gerald Cadogan

FT  18 JAN 92 / Soviet officers call for a united army: Two students die in
protest over food price rises as defence minister warns of chaos

<TEXT>
DISGRUNTLED Soviet army officers emerged yesterday as a political force in
their own right. They demanded that the unity of the armed forces be
preserved in spite of the break-up of the USSR.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the defence minister and commander in chief,
described the armed forces as 'our last barrier against disintegration'.
His warning came as the drastic economic reforms in the republics of the
former Soviet Union claimed their first victims yesterday. Two students were
reported by Tass news agency to have been killed in the Uzbek capital
Tashkent when a protest over the sharp price rises that followed the freeing
of state prices turned violent.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, warning of dire consequences if the future of the army
was not settled quickly, said: 'The course of events has reached the border
beyond which lie feuding, chaos and national if not global tragedy.'
He was addressing a meeting of 5,000 officers in Moscow, the first such
conference since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The meeting voted to set
up a co-ordinating council to represent the officers at talks with leaders
of the new Commonwealth of Independent States.
President Boris Yeltsin appealed to the officers to 'help preserve civic
calm'. He said: 'It is easy enough to start a fire. It is far more difficult
to extinguish it.'
Mr Yeltsin also announced that Russia was taking over the armed forces
stationed in non-commonwealth republics - the Baltics and Georgia. The
proceeds of arms sales would go to finance officers' welfare and personnel
costs.
The military officers voted unanimously to appeal to the Commonwealth
leaders to retain a single armed force and to refrain from unilateral
actions until an overall solution is found. Commonwealth leaders have put
off a decision on the future of the military until a summit meeting in Minsk
on February 14.
The conference was called in response to republican leaders' difficulties in
agreeing what to do about the armed forces. Broadcast live on television,
the delegates from all over the former Soviet Union angrily vented demands
for better living standards and an end to attempts by republics to dismantle
the 3m-strong army.
Ukraine's decision to make officers and men swear an oath of allegiance to
the newly-independent state, along with its attempts to take over the Black
Sea fleet, have been a particular source of anger.
The assembly also saw the political comeback of Colonel Viktor Alksnis, the
arch-conservative former Communist who led a persistent campaign against the
break-up of the Soviet Union. The popular colonel is to be a member of the
officer's co-ordinating council.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Lager group thirsts for real ale

<TEXT>
LOVERS of traditional ale are facing the possibility that a famous British
brewer could be taken over by a fashionable Dutch lager company.
Grolsch, the Dutch brewer of the premium lager, is in talks with Courage
about the acquisition of Ruddles, the Leicestershire-based brewer of real
ale founded in 1858.
The deal could be worth about Pounds 40m, according to industry estimates.
Ruddles, based in Langham, Leicestershire, was acquired by Courage, the UK
arm of Fosters Brewing, the Australian group, in a pubs-for-breweries swap
with Grand Metropolitan last year. It has estimated national sales of
300,000 barrels a year.
Courage said yesterday: 'Grolsch have put forward an interesting proposal
which may offer us mutual benefits.'
Grolsch, which dates back even further than Ruddles to 1615, said it planned
to preserve the Ruddles brand name and to protect the interests of
employees.
The acquisition is part of Grolsch's aim of establishing a strong presence
across north-west Europe from Britain to Germany and Poland. It entered the
UK market in 1979. Its lager brand, supported by advertising campaigns
featuring its distinctive bottle and the slogan 'you can't top a Grolsch',
rapidly gained a niche in the packaged beer sector. During the past 14
months, Grolsch has signed agreements to supply the lager on draught.
Total sales in 1991 grew by about 20 per cent to 165,000 barrels and account
for 40 per cent of exports. The purchase of Ruddles would boost sales by
nearly 15 per cent to more than Fl 800m (Pounds 250m).
Trading in Grolsch shares was suspended on the Amsterdam stock exchange
prior to the announcement yesterday. The shares closed on Thursday, up Fl
2.50 to Fl 185, near their 12-month high.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Weak UK finances may limit tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAK STATE of the UK government's finances, which may limit room for tax
cuts in the Budget, has been underlined by a figure for public- sector
borrowing last month which far exceeded City expectations.
The Treasury said yesterday it needed to borrow Pounds 1.2bn in December to
meet spending commitments, despite raising Pounds 1.8bn from the sale of BT
shares.
Last month's high figure can be explained partly by weak economic activity
reducing government tax revenues. In addition, the recession has increased
government spending on measures such as unemployment benefit.
The financial pressures are likely to reduce the options open to Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, as he considers possible cuts in income tax in the
March Budget. Some believe a package of this kind could turn out to be a
vote winner for the Conservatives.
Better news for Mr Lamont came with separate figures showing only a 0.1 per
cent increase in the retail-prices index between November and December, the
lowest figure since July.
Although the headline inflation rate last month rose to 4.5 per cent, from
4.3 per cent, the scale of the rise suggests inflationary pressures are
weak. Mr Lamont believes the decline of such pressures could aid a recovery
later this year.
Last month's public-sector borrowing requirement contrasted with the surplus
of Pounds 800m that the City had expected. It followed a low PSBR of Pounds
536m in November, and contrasts with a Pounds 244m surplus in December 1990.
The PSBR for the first nine months of the financial year ending in March now
stands at Pounds 10.5bn, the same as the Treasury's forecast for the full
year. Many economists believe the government may face a PSBR for the full
year of about Pounds 12bn, and with a figure of perhaps twice this in
1992-93.
The Inland Revenue collected Pounds 5.89bn in taxes last month, against
Pounds 6.76bn in December 1990. Corporation-tax income, payable on
companies' profits, was Pounds 690m in December, compared with Pounds 622m
in November and Pounds 1.19bn in December 1990.

Wall Street
A VOLATILE day for US stock markets ended on a positive note yesterday as
higher bond prices and a recovery in IBM's share price following a
disappointing set of quarterly earnings lifted the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to another record high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 15.43 at 3,264.98. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 0.64 at 418.85, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks slipped 0.60 at 626.74. NYSE turnover was 286m
shares, and rises marginally outpaced declines by 905 to 814.
There were a few titbits of fresh economic news to give the market
direction. The announcement of a 0.2 per cent reduction in December
industrial production, and a decline in the University of Michigan's
consumer sentiment index for early January should have injected a sour note
at the end of what was generally a good week for stocks. The market,
however, was able to draw comfort from a rise in bond prices, which prompted
a much-needed reduction in long-term interest rates.
Most eyes were on IBM, which announced a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars
1.38bn after taking a slightly bigger-than-expected charge of Dollars 3.4bn
to cover restructuring costs. The stock fell more than Dollars 2 on the
release of the figures, which were deemed by analysts to be disappointing,
but later recovered to end Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 96 3/4 in
turnover of 2.6m shares as investors reacted positively to reports of upbeat
comments from IBM's management.
Other big computer stocks were mixed in the wake of IBM's results. Compaq
rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 , Digital Equipment fell Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 53, Hewlett-Packard slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 62, Unisys
held firm at Dollars 5 1/2 and Motorola rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 79 7/8
.
Reebok climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 on earnings in line with
market estimates. Reebok had been heavily sold on Thursday in anticipation
of poor results.
Citicorp ran into profit-taking for the second day running, dropping Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 14 5/8 in turnover of 3.4m shares. The stock has enjoyed a
remarkable ride in recent days, buoyed up by heavy demand from investors who
believe the worst may be over for the troubled banking group. Since
Thursday, however, some investors have been taking profits on the assumption
that Citicorp's rally may have stalled for now.
On the over-the-counter market, Apple jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 on
news of fiscal first quarter net income of Dollars 1.36 a share, up from
Dollars 1.28 a share a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed mixed in heavy trading.
According to preliminary figures, the composite index fell 7.67 points, or
0.21 per cent, to close at 3,658.29, but advancing issues outnumbered
declines 380 to 252. Volume was 34.941m shares, down from yesterday's
39.983m shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 456.8m from CDollars
487.3m. The index finished the hectic week up about 65 points, or about 1.8
per cent.
Euro-Nevada fell  1/4 to 18 3/4 on news it will issue 1.5m special
convertible warrants at CDollars 18.75 a warrant. Ocelot Industries was
unchanged at 11 7/8 . The company said it will sell to an underwiting group
4m special warrants at CDollars 11.50 a warrant, each of which is
exercisable for one common share.

red

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday unveiled its worst ever annual
result. The world's largest computer manufacturer reported a Dollars 2.8bn
loss for the year to the end of December, after huge restructuring and
retirement benefit charges, and its first annual revenue decline since the
end of the Second World War. Worldwide revenue for the year was Dollars
64.8bn, down 6.1 per cent from Dollars 69bn in 1990.
IBM's net losses of Dollars 2.8bn included a restructuring charge of Dollars
3.4bn and an additional charge of Dollars 2.3bn for the future cost of
health care benefits for IBM pensioners. In 1990 IBM made net profits of
Dollars 6.02bn.
The net loss per share was Dollars 4.95, after charges, compared with net
earnings of Dollars 10.51 per share in 1990. The dismal results from one of
the world's top manufacturing companies, reflect weak economic conditions
and a major transition in computer technology that has taken a heavy toll on
all of the industry's established leaders.
Earlier this week Digital Equipment, the second largest computer maker, also
reported heavy losses.
'1991 was a disappointing year,' acknowledged Mr John Akers, IBM chairman.
'We were adversely affected by protracted worldwide economic weakness,
competitive pressures and transitions within our product lines.'
IBM's fourth-quarter results were even worse than Wall Street's pessimistic
forecasts. Worldwide revenues of Dollars 22.1bn fell by 4.2 per cent from
the previous year's Dollars 23.1bn. After a Dollars 3.4bn restructuring
charge, which was higher than expected, there was a net loss for the quarter
of Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.42 a share, compared with net earnings of
Dollars 2.5bn, or Dollars 4.38 in the last quarter of 1990.
IBM reduced its workforce by about 29,000 people last year, primarily
through voluntary redundancies and early retirement programmes, Mr Akers
said. This year it plans to continue to cut jobs at a similar pace.
In December, IBM announced a broad restructuring of its worldwide operations
that will give individual business units greater autonomy and
accountability. However, it will be some time before IBM can realise any
benefits from these changes, analysts said.
Although it was difficult to find much good news in IBM's 1991 results, Mr
Akers noted that the company's service business grew by 35 per cent. 'That
portion of our revenue that is less subject to year-to-year fluctuations -
services, software, rentals and financing - is 43 per cent of our 1991
revenue.
IBM's computer equipment sales declined by over 11 per cent in the fourth
quarter to Dollars 13.7bn. Software revenues rose 8.5 per cent to Dollars
3.4bn. Revenues from maintenance agreements, rentals and financing were
relatively flat.
IBM told analysts it expected improved performance in 1992, with revenue
growth 'in the mid-single digits'. Operating expenses and capital spending
would decline from 1991 levels .
'Assuming some improvement in the current difficult and uncertain economic
environment, we expect to increase revenue and improve cash flow and returns
as the year goes on,' said Mr Akers.
IBM's stock price fluctuated wildly on news of the results, plunging to a
low of Dollars 92 5/8 from Thursday's close of Dollars 95 1/2 , rebounding
to Dollars 98 1/8 and closing at Dollars 96 3/4 .

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Trustee acts to safeguard contributors'
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRUSTEE of the Maxwell Communication Corporation pension fund is taking
steps to protect the interests of MCC employees who are still making
contributions to the fund.
The pension fund was looted by Mr Robert Maxwell and faces losses of about
Pounds 50m.
MCC employees have become concerned that their current contributions would
benefit those already drawing a pension, rather than being invested to
secure their own future pensions.
To prevent this, Law Debenture, the independent trustee is seeking the
Inland Revenue's approval to set up a 'limpet trust', which would receive
all future contributions of MCC employees and ensure that all such
contributions were earmarked for the paying members' benefit.
Until the limpet trust is set up, employees' contributions will be paid into
a newly opened deposit account, in the joint names of Law Debenture and
Price Waterhouse, the administrators of MCC under UK insolvency law.
If the limpet trust is approved the money in the deposit account will be
transferred to the trust. If not the cash will be returned to the
contributing employees.
Law Debenture also confirmed that it has issued instructions to the pension
plan managers restricting the rights of potential pensioners. It has, for
the time being, prohibited transfers into or out of the plan and forbidden
the payment of lump sums on retirement. Refunds of members' contributions
and early retirement pensions have also been proscribed.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kunick tumbles 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUNICK, the fruit machine and nursing homes group, more than halved its
final dividend as pre-tax profits plunged 29 per cent to Pounds 12.4m in the
year to September 30.
Although the results were in line with warnings issued by the group in
October, the sharp dividend cut from 1.4p to 0.6p took most analysts by
surprise. The total pay-out for the year was 1.4p, 30 per cent down on the
previous year.
In May, Kunick anticipated paying a final dividend of 1.2p, barring
'unforeseen circumstances'. Mr Russell Smith, chairman, said that the
unforeseen circumstance had been 'very poor trading', with 'no prospect of
an upturn'.
The chairman blamed the hard-pressed pub sector for many of Kunick's
troubles in the game machine business. During the recession some 10,000 to
15,000 pubs had ceased trading, he said.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the brewing industry was
also blamed for creating unfavourable turbulence.
The leisure division, which claims 43,000 amusement machines as opposed to
46,000 at the end of last year, posted a 28 per cent decline in profits.
Political uncertainty was affecting the care services division, which
reported an 83 per cent rise in operating profits.
Kunick's visitor attractions division - including the waxwork dungeons in
London and Paris - suffered badly last year although it continued to make
profits.
Following the Pounds 17.6m rights issue in May, a debt restructuring and the
Pounds 2.5m sale of a minority stake in the French holding company, Amira,
Kunick's gearing fell from 73 to 50 per cent.
Fully-diluted earnings per share tumbled from 4.93p to 3.1p. Turnover rose
from Pounds 108m to Pounds 116m.
COMMENT
Kunick's theory that fruit machines can fund its nursing homes took a
thorough drubbing last year. So did shareholders who have seen the stock
fall from 45p less than a year ago to last night's 13 1/2 p. That unhappy
shareholder base might be one reason to avoid the shares, while the outlook
for pub trading this year makes an even stronger case against. Forecasts of
Pounds 10.5m, with a prospective p/e of 8.5 might make the shares look
cheap, but only the most daring would risk it right now. Still, with such an
operationally geared business as fruit machines, and a sound long-term
strategy for the care services side, the shares are certainly not a sell.
Hang on for the eventual upturn.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet sells its 20% stake in Remy
Cointreau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan, the drinks, food and retailing group, is to sell its 20
per cent stake in Remy Martin and Cointreau, the French cognac and liqueur
companies, acquired two years ago for Pounds 100m.
GrandMet announced that it was exercising its option to sell the equity to
the controlling shareholders, Remy Cointreau, after a review of the
worldwide distribution strategies of both groups.
No price was disclosed but GrandMet is expected to show a profit. The
holding was acquired by International Distillers &amp; Vintners (IDV), the
drinks division, with a view to cementing and possibly extending its trading
relationship with Remy Cointreau.
IDV, Cointreau and Cinzano, the Italian wines company, have joint venture
distribution companies in France, Germany, Spain and Italy. And the IDV
drinks portfolio would have been strengthened by the addition of leading
cognac and champagne brands.
But Mr George Bull, IDV's chairman, said: 'It became apparent that within
the exactly matching strategies of the two companies to control their own
distribution networks, the retention of the shareholding no longer served a
useful purpose.'
Since the merger of the family-controlled businesses in 1990, Remy Cointreau
has also been rationalising and extending its own distribution system.
European sales of most Cointreau products will be integrated into the
group's network within the next three months.
Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, was paid a total of Pounds 713,391
last year, a rise of Pounds 74,266 or 12 per cent.
The group's annual report also reveals that, apart from Sir Allen, 28 per
cent of the pay of the group's executive directors was in the form of
performance-related bonuses.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Primary colours: Lionel Barber on George Bush's electoral
opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Patrick Buchanan, the right-wing Republican challenger in the US election
campaign, has a great strength: he knows how to get under President Bush's
skin.
This skill will not be enough to overcome glaring weaknesses in Mr
Buchanan's guerrilla campaign; but it lends an unpredictability to the New
Hampshire primary election on February 18, the first critical test of the
1992 campaign.
Mr Buchanan calls the globe-trotting Mr Bush 'President of the World'. He
accuses him of 'breaking faith' with the Republican party by raising taxes;
and he ridicules his preppy background. 'The only unemployed person he knows
here is John Sununu,' says Mr Buchanan, referring to the former New
Hampshire governor who was fired from his job as White House chief-of-staff
two months ago.
Mr Bush would love to ignore these jibes. Mr Buchanan is, after all, a
simple television pundit and former speech writer to presidents Nixon and
Reagan who has never held elected office. But if there were any lingering
doubts about the folly of this approach, they evaporated this week when Mr
Bush made his first campaign trip to New Hampshire. Early on Wednesday
morning, the president received a first-hand account of the economic
disaster which has struck the once-thriving New England state and which is
driving the protest vote behind Mr Buchanan.
At Pease Air Force base, business and community leaders told Mr Bush the
same grim story: 55,000 jobs lost; 22m sq ft of unleased industrial real
estate; five of the top seven banks closed; and a 33 per cent drop in home
values.
Mr Bush responded gingerly: 'I think I've known this economy is in free
fall, maybe I've not conveyed it as well as I should. But I do understand.'
These penitent tones sound familiar. Four years ago, when he was
vice-president, Mr Bush arrived in Iowa to compete in the caucus vote,
offered sympathy to stricken farmers and was soundly thrashed. His bid for
the White House barely alive, Mr Bush was rescued by a victory in the New
Hampshire primary, largely because of his pledge not to raise taxes.
Mr Buchanan pounds away at this broken promise (part of the 1990 budget
agreement with Congress which Mr Bush backed in order to cut the Federal
budget deficit by Dollars 500bn over five years). And he replays the same
slogan which Mr Ronald Reagan used to defeat President Jimmy Carter in 1980:
'Are you better off four years ago than you are now?'
The six Democratic candidates are toying with similar themes in their own
primary race here, particularly with their appeal to middle-class Americans
who have watched their real incomes stagnate over the past 10 years.
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a centrist who has deliberately shunned
the liberal activist vote, has emerged as an early front runner. He faces a
tough challenge from former senator Paul Tsongas from neighbouring
Massachusetts - and is certain to be attacked during tomorrow's televised
debate by Senator Bob Kerrey, the Vietnam war hero whose campaign has
curiously failed to ignite. (Another potential weakness centres on the Gary
Hart-style rumours about Mr Clinton's past).
This week, Mr Bush offered a glimpse of his re-election strategy. Apologies
aside, he wants to lean on his strengths: the Gulf war victory and the
esteem in which the public holds his wife Barbara. He will also count on a
favourable response to his forthcoming state of the Union address to
Congress.
Without offering details, the president promised to avoid quick fixes in the
economy, focusing instead on long-term measures such as investment tax
credits, saving incentives, possible tax credit for first-time home buyers
and a plan to reform the hugely expensive US health care system.
These plans underline the power of incumbency in which Mr Bush faces a
dilemma. He needs the support of the Democratic Congress to turn his plan
into action. If he compromises too much, he will be accused by Mr Buchanan
of being a collaborator with the Democrats.
This could prove the true significance of the Buchanan challenge. Almost no
one expects him to win in New Hampshire; but he could easily gain 30-40 per
cent of the vote because voters may calculate they can afford the luxury of
a protest vote in February before supporting Mr Bush in November.
A huge protest vote against Mr Bush would not be enough to make him drop out
of the race as President Lyndon Johnson did in 1968 after the strong showing
of Senator Eugene McCarthy. But Mr Bush would likely have to tack to the
right, adopting some of Mr Buchanan's 'America first' rhetoric and making
ever more partisan attacks against the Democratic majority in Congress. This
runs against Mr Bush's nature, and could leave the middle ground exposed to
a Democratic challenger in November. No wonder the Bush camp is worried.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Trial by committee: Ivo Dawnay on the work of the Commons
select committees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been times this week when it has seemed as if the political
clamour in the House of Commons was being reduced to a sideshow by events
elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster.
Twice the battle of party leaders across the dispatch box had to compete on
the TV news with dramas in Commons committee rooms: on Monday, the eloquent
silence of the sons of the late Robert Maxwell before the social security
committee, which had called them to testify on missing pension money; and on
Wednesday, allegations of government skulduggery surrounding the Iraqi
'supergun' affair. More and more, it seems, parliament's all-party select
committees are moving from the margins of politics to the mainstream.
Yet how genuinely powerful are these newly-prominent backbench scrutineers
of government? Are they as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary,
suggested last month, a waste of time and money, serving largely as
publicity vehicles for second-rate MPs jealous of ministerial power? Or are
the select committees - boosted by television - steadily extending their
reach to become a newly significant organism in Britain's political ecology?
Enhancing parliament's role as a watchdog was certainly the intention of
Lord St John of Fawsley when as Leader of the Commons (and Mr Norman St John
Stevas) in 1979 he created a new, comprehensive network of 14 select
committees - for the first time specifically linked to the work of
government departments, and empowered to call for 'persons and papers'
including civil servants and ministers.
Lord St John insists today on describing this as 'one of the greatest
constitutional changes this century'. Yet even he admits that the
performance of the select committees leaves something to be desired.
Some committees stand accused of failing to make maximum use of the powers
at their disposal. Many MPs also acknowledge that the adversarial nature of
parliamentary debate, the role of party whips, and the lure of ministerial
office have all hampered the development of a fully effective system of
scrutiny by committee.
Nevertheless, most MPs would also argue that there has been significant
progress during the 11 years that the committees have been functioning. They
have, for one thing, unearthed huge amounts of hitherto undisclosed
information.
The committees have gained in authority, educating their members on issues
and increasing the quality of debate on the Commons floor. Furthermore,
their two-hour interrogations - far more rigorous than pro forma
question-time skirmishes - can pose a genuinely daunting challenge to
ministers.
In 1983-84, the committees produced 73 reports. Two years later Mrs Margaret
Thatcher reported that 150 of their recommendations in a single session had
been acted on. Last year, the number of reports had doubled to 150.
The audacity of committees is also growing, their defenders claim. Despite
their built-in government majorities, some committees have recently taken
stands at embarrassing variance with Conservative policy. Last year the
Treasury committee called for government action to stimulate the economy -
at a time when the chancellor was arguing that no such action was needed -
while the defence committee was strongly critical of the reasoning behind
the government's Options for Change defence review.
Added to this, Mr Michael Ryle, a former clerk of committees, says the
committees have broadened the range of parliament's concerns, given a new
platform to well informed pressure groups and steadily eroded MPs natural
deference to government. 'Ten years ago this close to an election, the
committees would have dropped anything controversial,' he said.
If that is the positive side of the balance-sheet, critics of the committees
are more than ready to point up their failings. The investigation into the
Westland scandal in 1986, for example, vividly illustrated the limits on the
power of committee inquiries when faced with government stonewalling.
Even in a case often cited as a committee success - the investigation of
'sweeteners' allowed by the government to encourage British Aerospace to
acquire a stake in Rover, the car-maker - the main evidence was revealed
first in a leak to The Guardian. An earlier inquest had failed to uncover
the scandal and even the trade committee's critical final report was toned
down under pressure from its Tory majority.
The committees have often been susceptible to pressure from government
whips, notwithstanding protestations to the contrary from the whips
themselves. Mr Nicholas Winterton, health committee chairman and a thorn in
the government's flesh, owes his job entirely to the support of Labour
committee members and an Ulster unionist; his Tory colleagues all voted
loyally at the last committee election in 1987 for the whips' candidate, Sir
David Price.
This illustrates a more general problem, stemming from parliament's
conformist traditions. Mr Brian Sedgemore, the left-wing Labour MP who
serves on the Treasury committee, complains that members who display
independence of spirit are frequently dismissed as 'mavericks', 'obsessed'
or 'over the top'.
As a result of this and of the limited time at committee members' disposal,
he claims, committees often voluntarily circumscribe their activities. He
cites the Treasury committee's inquiry into the collapse of Bank of Credit
and Commerce International: 'BCCI is an example of a case where you should
be questioning lawyers, ministers and the governor of the Bank of England
for days on end. In fact, you get a few minutes.'
Other Treasury committee members, such as Mr Terence Higgins, the chairman,
argue that Mr Sedgemore is mistakenly comparing the UK system with the more
powerful US congressional committees whose influence - especially their
rights to initiate legislation - enormously increase their leverage on the
executive. The separation of powers in the US - with departmental
responsibilities divorced from Congress - means that party political
hostilities are often submerged in the shared struggle with the executive.
Many MPs stress that the real strengths and weaknesses of committees depend
on the quality of their chairmen. While Mr Higgins, of the Treasury
committee, Mr Frank Field of social security and Mr Winterton are admired,
there are many others regarded as mere government placemen.
So how might the committees' work be improved? If a self-congratulatory
report produced by the Commons Procedure Committee last year is to be
believed, no significant changes are needed - a conclusion described by Lord
St John as 'extremely feeble'.
Mr Graham Allen, a Labour dissenter from the report and rare advocate of
radical change, believes that there must be free, secret-ballot elections of
committee members by MPs - freeing them from the whips. Other proposals
include substantially increased financial and research resources and salary
payments to members; this might create an incentive for MPs to make a career
in government scrutiny as opposed to government itself.
Perhaps the real problem goes deeper - to the 'poverty of aspirations' of
the British parliament as a watchdog. The teeth are there, but the readiness
to bite is lacking.
As Lord St John put it this week: 'The trouble with British politicians of
all parties is that they are the most conservative people in the world.'

EMERGENCY and long-term measures costing up to Pounds 1m to prevent polluted

The rivers watchdog said it had not so far affected tap water, but owners of
private bore-holes had been warned to use bottled water.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Bank criticised by DTI report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED Bank has been strongly criticised in a Department of
Trade and Industry report into events at Milford Docks Company between 1983
and 1987 for the 'astonishing ease' with which the company was able to
borrow a total of Pounds 2.3m from the bank in 1985 and 1986.
Government inspectors reported on Thursday that much of the money loaned by
Standard Chartered had gone towards servicing the company's losses. They
also criticised a number of directors of Milford Docks of the period, saying
there had been breaches of Stock Exchange rules and fiduciary duty.

MR TAM DALYELL, Labour MP for Linlithgow, has linked Mr Roger Windsor, a
former National Union of Mineworkers official who was a leading figure in
the 1984-85 pit strike, with Mrs Stella Rimington, the recently appointed
head of MI5, the security service.
He used business questions in the Commons to claim that he had heard
statements linking Mrs Rimington with Mr Windsor since tabling a motion
inquiring into the MI5 official's activities during the strike.
The motion called on the government to make a full statement on connections
between Mrs Rimington and Mr David Hart, an adviser to Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, the former prime minister, and Sir Ian MacGregor, the former Coal
Board chairman who was closely involved with opponents of the strike.

</HEADLINE>

THE STOCK Exchange has appointed Andersen Consulting to examine the
operations and future role of its trading and settlement computer systems.
The Stock Exchange said yesterday that the contract did not include work on
Taurus, the new settlement system, and that there would be no redundancies
during the three months of the contract.
However, it is thought that contracting out the department's operations
would be favoured after that point.
The contract is believed to be worth several hundred thousand pounds,
although the Exchange said the cost would be covered by savings identified
during the work and would require no new expenditure.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Lottery fails to win government support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government put a national lottery firmly on the backburner yesterday by
declining to back a bill even though it saw 'attractions' in the idea.
It pledged to 'examine further' issues that a lottery would raise. Mr Peter
Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister, said: 'We shall put that work in hand
immediately and announce our conclusions as soon as possible.'
Without government support, fewer than 100 MPs voted for the bill in a
closure motion. The measure therefore stands only a slender chance of
becoming law.
Mr Ivan Lawrence, Conservative MP for Burton, who introduced the bill, said
its aim was 'nothing less than to raise the quality of life in Britain to
even higher levels'. He added that Albania was the only other European
country not to have a lottery and reminded MPs that lottery money had paid
for construction of the British Museum.
Mr Terry Dicks, Conservative MP for Hayes and Harlington, said he would
oppose the bill unless proposals to use some of the proceeds to support the
arts were withdrawn.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, said: 'We have enough
gambling outlets without the government going into gambling sponsorship.'
Ladbroke is offering 2-1 against a national lottery bill being passed in the
lifetime of the next government.

<TEXT>
THE BRITISH and Irish governments agreed yesterday that there is little hope
of reviving the stalled all-party talks on Northern Ireland before the UK
general election. They reached that conclusion about the talks, broken off
in July, in spite of a recent flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at
persuading the parties back to the negotiating table.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, met Mr Gerry Collins, the Irish
foreign minister, in Dublin yesterday. Mr Brooke said later that prospects
of an election 'have highlighted the tensions and are creating their own
momentum'. He added: 'We have faced difficulties in the past weeks, and we
continue to confront them.'
Unionist leaders in Northern Ireland have made it clear that they are not
prepared to renew the talks unconditionally if the Labour party wins the
election.
They say they will first have to 'assess' Labour's position. Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, argues that
this is unacceptable and amounts to a 'precondition'. He said in a radio
interview yesterday that constructive talks could not be carried out on such
a basis.
An additional concern of the SDLP, echoed in Dublin, is that a close
election result may give the Unionists an opportunity to hold the balance of
power, resulting in a hardening of positions on both sides of the sectarian
divide.
After meeting Mr Brooke, Mr Collins gave the strongest hint yet that hopes
for an early renewal of talks were lost. He said: 'Once the general
elections are out of the way, we must once again make a determined effort to
move ahead.'
Mr Brooke later told the Dublin Chamber of Commerce: 'The uncertainties of
the outcome of the election . . . and the need for a process of this kind to
have a reasonable chance of continuing to a conclusion provide
understandable obstacles to progress now.'
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, was yesterday urged by Mr Dick Spring,
leader of the Irish Labour Party, to reiterate Opposition policy on moves
towards Irish unification.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Sharp drop seen in spending on tourism projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT in new tourist facilities in England has fallen to its lowest
level since the mid 1980s in spite of the competitive threat posed by the
new Euro Disney park near Paris.
The opening of Euro Disney in April will put particular pressure on the
providers of short-break holidays in England, according to a report to be
published next week by the English Tourist Board. The board warns that
tourists might visit Euro Disney instead of taking short breaks in the UK.
Euro Disney believes that more than 1m UK residents will visit the park in
its first year. The board warns: 'The displacement effect could be
substantial.'
The value of new tourism and leisure projects in England fell to Pounds 873m
last year, the lowest level since the board began compiling statistics in
1985. Last year's figure was down 19.5 per cent on 1990 and 49.7 per cent on
1989.
Investment in theme parks and similar attractions in England amounted to
only Pounds 23m last year compared with Pounds 32m in 1990, Pounds 60m in
1989 and Pounds 123m in 1988.
The board says some English theme parks are planning additional investment.
Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey is to extend its facilities, and
Alton Towers in Staffordshire plans to spend Pounds 10m on a haunted house
and other attractions. Both parks are owned by Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times. Blackpool is to build a Pounds 6m rollercoaster at the
Pleasure Beach. These sums contrast with the Pounds 15m that Euro Disney is
expected to spend on marketing alone.
The board says that English theme parks tend to attract day visitors who
live up to three hours' drive away, so some parks believe they will not be
directly affected by Euro Disney. It warns, however, that the large number
of British tourists visiting Euro Disney will result in higher standards
being expected of English attractions. The board has launched a code of
practice to encourage tourist attractions to raise their standards of
cleanliness and courtesy.
Investment in new hotels was one area which held up reasonably well last
year compared with the rest of the industry. Projects worth Pounds 337m were
started last year, down 16.6 per cent on 1990 and 18.6 per cent on 1989.
Projects worth Pounds 772m were completed last year, the second-highest
amount on record. They include the Pounds 30m Sainsbury Wing at the National
Gallery in London.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Lender to help on home arrears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MORTGAGE Corporation yesterday became the first centralised mortgage
lender to offer customers with mortgage arrears the chance to avoid losing
their homes by becoming tenants.
TMC, the UK mortgage arm of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, is to
rescue 150 homes by launching a Pounds 15m Business Expansion Scheme in a
joint venture with Smith &amp; Williamson Securities. It said the scheme would
enable some of its most hard-pressed borrowers to stay in their homes for a
rent well below their monthly mortgage payments.
They may be offered the chance to buy back their homes at the end of the
assured tenancy period if their circumstances have improved.
Otherwise TMC will buy back the properties at the end of five years at a
price calculated to give investors in the business expansion scheme a return
of 137p on each 100p share before tax relief.
Customers of the centralised lenders - the specialist mortgage companies
with no branch networks which entered the mortgage markets during the 1980s
housing boom - have been among those with the worst arrears and repossession
problems.
Other lenders came up with more than Pounds 800m for schemes to help their
borrowers avoid losing their homes as a result of talks with the government
late last year, but the centralised lenders were unable to follow suit
because of legal and practical difficulties.
TMC said yesterday it is talking to housing associations to see whether
repossessed properties can be rented to homeless families.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Inflation rises to 4.5% despite price cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADLINE inflation rate increased last month, even though weak demand
led to price reductions for a broad range of retail goods and services.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the year-on-year increase in
December in the retail prices index (RPI) was 4.5 per cent, compared with
4.3 per cent in November. Between the two months the index rose by 0.1 per
cent, the smallest increase since July.
There were price cuts in a varied group of items used in calculating the
RPI, including petrol, processed fish, sherry, bicycles, clothing and estate
agents' fees.
Another factor was that prices of non-seasonal foods such as fruit increased
last month by just 1.2 per cent compared with November, the smallest
December rise since 1984.
The figures indicate that the government's goal of achieving a further
slowing in inflation this year is on target. It hopes that an easing in
price pressures on consumers and industry will provide a springboard for
sustained growth.
Behind the statistics was widespread price-cutting in shops, especially for
alcoholic drinks, clothing, furniture and personal goods, as retailers
sought to tempt shoppers with bargains in the run-up to Christmas.
It is expected that the effects of the widespread discounting will continue
to show through in the January RPI figure.
A gallon of 4-star petrol fell in price by 3p to Pounds 2.22 last month
compared with November, leading to a 0.3 per cent fall on the month for
motoring costs.
Overall, the RPI rose from 135.6 in November to 135.7 last month - based on
a weighting of 100 in January 1987.
The increase between November and December in the year-on-year RPI rate was
due to the effect of a 0.1 per cent fall in the index between the same
months in 1990. That decrease had been triggered by large cuts in petrol and
mortgage costs 13 months ago.
Underlying retail-price inflation - the RPI without mortgage costs - showed
a year-on-year rise last month of 5.8 per cent, up from 5.7 per cent in
November.
Many economists believe inflationary pressures will continue to ease over
the next six months, as a result of a slowdown in the increase in wage costs
and underlying weak demand.
According to a price index calculated by Greenwell Montagu, the stockbroking
firm, the yearly rise in 'core inflation' last month was 5.7 per cent, the
same as in November. The index takes into account the RPI, without volatile
items such as petrol, seasonal foods, electricity prices and the poll tax.
Greenwell Montagu predicts the rate will slow to 5 per cent by June.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Kinnock gambles on the numbers game: Philip Stephens on the
electoral impact of Labour's National Insurance proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANYTHING more was needed to explain the anxiety of the Labour leadership
over the election impact of its planned abolition of the ceiling on National
Insurance contributions it was provided yesterday by the Institute for
Fiscal Studies.
The independent think tank with a reputation for rigorous and unbiased
analysis of taxation published figures showing that 20 per cent of
households in London and 18 per cent in the south-east would pay more if the
present Pounds 20,280 ceiling were abolished. That means one in five
households would pay higher National Insurance contributions in the swathe
of marginal seats in those areas on which the outcome of the election will
to a large degree depend. Across the country as a whole the figure is 11.8
per cent, while it falls sharply in the north to about 8 per cent.
The proportion of taxpayers affected, however, would be higher as the
institute's figures include households - such as those with pensioners and
those on benefit - which do not pay National Insurance contributions. Other
experts say that if those households were excluded the proportion of losers
in London would be closer to 30 per cent.
As the tables show, there is good as well as bad news for Labour in the
report. It shows that if the party's planned increases in child benefit,
pensions and related means-tested benefits are netted out against the
abolition of the contributions ceiling there are many more winners than
losers.
Because the additional money from abolition of the contributions ceiling is
raised from a relatively small number of people while increases in child
benefits and pensions would affect many more, the institute calculates that
in net terms 8.7 per cent would lose from the Labour package while 46 per
cent would gain.
Those figures almost certainly overstate the number of gainers because they
exclude the self-employed. But there is no doubt that Labour has a powerful
case for saying that more would win than lose under the whole package.
Its problem, however, is that voters tend to be convinced that politicians
will meet pledges to raise taxes, but they are less persuaded that the same
politicians will deliver on offsetting promises.
As one leading opinion pollster said yesterday: 'People need no convincing
that Labour will push up their taxes. They are much less certain that it
will deliver on child benefit and pensions.'
The overall figures for winners and losers also disguise some other weak
spots for Mr Neil Kinnock. Even if in London more than twice as many
households are shown as winners than losers, the question is: are they the
right people?
The gainers from higher child benefit and pensions are heavily concentrated
among traditional Labour voters. If Mr Kinnock is to win he must attract
support in the south-east from greater numbers of relatively affluent
voters.
The institute's breakdown by age of losers from the National Insurance
contributions reform shows the largest segment concentrated in the 35 to 44
age group. About one-in-four are affected nationwide, with a much higher
proportion in the key marginal seats in London and the south-east.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Rolls-Royce rejects millions to keep its last Phantom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE Motors has turned down offers 'running into several million
pounds' so that it can keep the last Phantom VI it has produced, the company
announced yesterday.
As the Phantom (pictured left) was displayed in London, Mr Mike Donovan,
Rolls-Royce commercial managing director, said: 'Phantoms can cost anything
from Pounds 300,000 upwards. We have had offers running into several
millions for this one. It is virtually impossible to put a price on it as
it's the very last.'
Because of new safety and exhaust emission rules Rolls-Royce has decided
that the 6,749th Phantom produced since the model's debut in 1925 will be
the last. The company has also moved much of the work at its Mulliner Park
Ward coachbuilding plant at Willesden, north London, where the Phantom was
the last vehicle made, to its main factory at Crewe.
Phantom limousines were notable for their time-consuming hand-built
construction. It could take 300 hours to make the cocktail cabinet alone.
One of the Phantom's successors, the Crewe-built Silver Spur touring
limousine, is pictured on the right.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Lord Rootes: car industry leader - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD ROOTES, who has died at the age of 74 after a long illness, was one of
the central figures in the post-Second World War development, and later
decline, of the UK motor industry.
Educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, William Geoffrey Rootes joined
the family business in 1946. He increasingly took the helm of the Rootes
Group, the motor vehicles concern founded in a Sussex bicycle shop by his
grandfather, William.
The group embraced such names as Humber, Hillman, Sunbeam, Talbot and
Singer.
Lord Rootes, who inherited the title in 1964, was the principal driving
force of the intensive modernisation which took place at the group in the
1950s.
But the group's vigour began to be sapped by its inability to confront
competition from domestic and newly emerged foreign rivals.
By the time Lord Rootes became chairman in 1967 it was apparent that even
the Pounds 12.3m put into the group by US carmaker Chrysler three years
earlier, in return for a 46 per cent stake, was unlikely to ensure long-term
survival.
With market share fading and losses growing, Lord Rootes had to sell the
remainder of the business to Chrysler in 1973 for Pounds 20m. It was
subsequently sold to Peugeot-Talbot.
He died at his home in Hungerford, Berkshire and is survived by his widow,
Marian, a daughter and a son.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Perkins wins Dollars 1bn Caterpillar order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERKINS GROUP, the Peterborough-based diesel engine manufacturer, has won a
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 568m) 10-year contract to supply engines to US-based
Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment group.
The deal, won against stiff competition from the Far East and continental
Europe, is a big boost for Perkins, and comes during a recession that has
hit the diesel industry's sales across the world.
Perkins said yesterday that the deal would help safeguard jobs at
Peterborough, where the engines will be built for export to Caterpillar
plants worldwide. The workforce has been cut by about 300 to 3,200 over the
past year because of difficult trading conditions.
Perkins, which has supplied power units to Caterpillar for nearly 20 years,
will provide Caterpillar with special versions of its high-technology
four-cylinder and six-cylinder 1000 Series industrial range. The engines
will carry the Caterpillar name, and will be used on smaller earthmoving and
other equipment as well as for sale to customers.
Caterpillar said the engines filled a gap at the smaller end of its product
line which would have been too expensive to fill by developing its own
range.
Mr Tony Gilroy, Perkins Group managing director, said the deal represented a
big customer's expression of confidence in Perkins' ability to meet
increasingly stringent environmental and performance standards.

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT forces yesterday tightened their clampdown on Algeria's Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), surrounding an Algiers mosque during prayers and
manning road blocks on routes into the city.
The weekly prayer services were the first since an army-dominated security
council cancelled elections that were expected to give the FIS control of
Parliament.
FIS leaders claimed that 500 party supporters had been arrested since
Tuesday. Although witnesses reported several arrests during a day which
passed peacefully, there is no independent verification of the opposition
claim.
Special units of the Algerian army surrounded the Es Sunna mosque in the Bab
El Oued district, one of the FIS strongholds, armed soldiers standing a few
yards apart.
Speaking during prayers, the provisional FIS leader, Mr Abdelkader Hachani,
called for calm, urged followers to resist provocation, and reminded the
government that the Front had won an election conducted under the
authorities' own rules.
'They want to make us rise up, but they won't succeed,' he said. 'If they
want to arrest us, arrest us. If they want to kill us, kill us. . . But the
Islamic state will triumph.'
With an irony that would not have been lost on followers who have heard
their leaders denounce the constitution in the past, Mr Hachani told
Algeria's new administration: 'We respected your constitution. . . You were
the ones who violated it.'
He also dismissed Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, who returned on Thursday after a
27-year exile in Morocco, to preside over a five-man collegiate presidency,
as a 'foreign import'.
The clampdown came just a day after Mr Boudiaf and the defence minister. Mr
Khaled Nezzar, warned people not to use Islam for self-interest.
Yesterday political parties continued yesterday to conduct a series of
formal and informal exchanges.
It emerged that late on Thursday evening Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, the leader of
one of the lay opposition parties, the Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS),
met FIS leaders. He did not consult the party's ruling council before doing
so, and three of its members promptly denounced their leader's action. Many
of Mr Aid Ahmed's supporters appear dismayed by such contacts.
Mr Abdelhamid Mehri, the secretary general of the National Liberation Front
(FLN), one of the main losers of the events of the past few days, has also
met FIS leaders.
Several FLN militants have denounced such contacts, but the party which has
enjoyed office for nearly 30 years seems prepared to go to great lengths to
retain a share of power.
But most observers doubt that the three main parties - the FLN, FIS and FFS
 -could form any lasting alliance, given their very different aims and
constituencies.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Port police lose fight on sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Port of London Police Federation failed yesterday to win a judicial
review of the government's decision to privatise the port's force as part of
the sell-off of Tilbury Docks.
The High Court ruled that although the 1991 Ports Act contained no specific
provisions for transfer of the police to a private company, it allowed Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, to approve privatisation of the force
as part of the port authority's scheme for the docks' sale.
Mr Justice Pill said: 'I am unable to hold that it is arguable that the
nature of police functions is such that specific provision was required, on
constitutional or any other grounds, for the transfer of the police force.'
Counsel for the federation had argued that the force should remain under the
control of the port authority and that its constables should keep existing
rights, privileges and powers.
The federation, which has 47 members in the port's force, fears that
independence and constitutional functions will be compromised under a
private company. It will consider an appeal.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Poll tax dilemma that is a matter of records: Robert Rice on
the implications of a legal loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE adjournment by magistrates in the past two weeks of nearly 4,000 cases
involving alleged poll tax defaulters leaves the government in a quandary.
The adjournments expose an apparent loophole over the admissability of
computerised records as evidence in civil proceedings in magistrates'
courts.
If the government acts to close this loophole it will in effect invalidate
almost 5m liability orders made against non-payers since April 1990 by
admitting that the law is faulty. If it fails to act, it risks depriving
local authorities of any realistic possibility of recovering outstanding
poll tax.
The government response yesterday was that it was still 'urgently'
considering the matter. The Home Office gives every indication of having
been taken by surprise over the issue.
This is in spite of the fact that lawyers acting for anti-poll tax groups
have been arguing for months that computer records are inadmissible in
magistrates' courts because of a loophole in the 1968 Civil Evidence Act.
Most magistrates' courts have rejected this argument, but the problem was
highlighted when the argument was accepted by magistrates at Bury St
Edmunds, Suffolk, two weeks ago.
Their decision prompted magistrates at Gravesend in Kent, Camberwell in
south London and Liverpool to halt all their poll tax cases until the matter
has been clarified. Other courts are expected to follow suit.
Leaving aside the specific concerns about the ease with which
computer-generated records can be altered without detection, lawyers
defending in poll tax cases claim that before 1968 no written records of any
kind were admissible as evidence on their own.
In support of their argument they cite a 1965 Appeal Court case which ruled
that written records were equivalent to hearsay evidence, and that only oral
evidence could be accepted as proof of what a written record said.
That case led the government to introduce the 1968 act which changed the law
to allow written records to be put in evidence in the High Court and county
courts. The act omits any specific reference to the change being applicable
to magistrates' courts.
The government knows that it could easily close the loophole by
parliamentary order. But to do so would be to admit that the loophole exists
and cast doubt on the validity not just of the poll tax cases decided since
April 1990, but of an unquantifiable number of other cases decided on the
basis of written and computer-generated records in magistrates' courts since
1968.
Making such an order retroactive is a possibility, but is thought to be both
too politically sensitive and too vulnerable to challenge by judicial
review.
The government's best hope of a quick solution to its predicament may lie in
trying to persuade the High Court to rule that, although the 1968 Act makes
no specific reference to magistrates' courts, by applying the change in the
law to the High Court parliament must have intended it to be binding on
lower courts.
If the default cases heard so far are eventually declared invalid, local
authorities are unlikely to have to repay the money recovered so far. But
the government may face claims for wrongful imprisonment from the 170 people
who have been jailed for non-payment.
Whatever the outcome, the issue needs to be clarified soon. In Liverpool
alone, magistrates are scheduled to deal with a further 130,000 cases next
month.

Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner for the Democratic

extramarital affairs with several women, including a former Miss America,
writes Lionel Barber from Boston.
Charges of infidelity surfaced in a US tabloid magazine this week. The
charges stem from a 1990 lawsuit brought by a former aide to the governor.
Mr Clinton said: 'I got into this race in the aftermath of those things,
knowing that they would probably be resurfaced, but they've been exposed for
the trash they are. The American people have an innate sense of fairness and
I feel good about it.'

FT  18 JAN 92 / Eight-year low for US trade deficit as imports fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BOSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US trade deficit tumbled to its lowest level for more than eight years
in November as recessionary forces curbed US demand for imports, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The merchandise trade deficit fell to Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2bn), far below
analysts' expectations of a shortfall of about Dollars 6bn. The 40 per cent
drop from October's deficit of Dollars 6.3bn mainly reflected a 5.5 per cent
decline in imports.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial production fell
0.2 per cent in December to register its third consecutive monthly decline
since the economy began to turn down in the autumn.
For 1991 as a whole industrial production fell 1.9 per cent, the first
annual decline since 1982.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment was also reported
to have fallen to 67.1 per cent in early January after 68.2 per cent in
December, a sign that consumers remain in low spirits.
The decline in the trade deficit reflected a Dollars 2.4bn decline in
imports to Dollars 41.0bn and a Dollars 0.3bn increase in exports to Dollars
37.5bn, a record in cash terms.
The deficit was running at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of Dollars
64.7bn in the first 11 months of last year, a sharp improvement from the
annual shortfall of Dollars 101.7bn in 1990. However, many economists expect
the deficit to begin rising again later this year if the economy stages its
expected recovery from recession.
Officals said the fall in industrial production last month partly reflected
lower output from utilities because of warmer than usual weather.
The total was also depressed by a 1 per cent decline in the production of
motor vehicles and parts. Overall manufacturing output, however, rose by a
marginal 0.1 per cent, reflecting an increase in output of non-durable
goods.
The operating rate of factories, mines and utilities fell 0.3 percentage
points to 79.0 per cent, the lowest level since April and only fractionally
above the trough reached last winter.

But a French offer to supply Pakistan with a 900MW nuclear power station has

be subject to inspection under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The protocols were agreed during the visit to Paris of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the

FT  18 JAN 92 / Georgia edges closer to renewed civil conflict
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIA edged towards renewed civil conflict yesterday as ousted President
Zviad Gamsakhurdia was reported to be gathering his forces in the western
city of Zugdidi and opposition troops occupied Kutaisi, only 80km to the
east.
Reports from Tbilisi and Kutaisi of thousands of unarmed demonstrators being
dispersed with overhead gunfire were unconfirmed.
In Moscow, Mr Georgy Chanturia, leader of Georgia's National Democratic
party and the figurehead of the opposition to the Georgian president before
being imprisoned last September, said he was deeply concerned about the
consequences of Mr Gamsakhurdia's return.
Mr Chanturia said he did not believe Mr Gamsakhurdia would succeed in
re-establishing power, and thought he would be defeated in a maximum of two
weeks.
'But the tragedy is that there may be more bloodshed among innocent people,'
he added.
He said Kutaisi had been occupied by opposition troops commanded by Mr Jaba
Ioseliani, one of the leaders of the military council currently running the
country, in order to block any march on Tbilisi by Mr Gamsakhurdia's forces.
The opposition leader said he did not believe that Mr Gamsakhurdia enjoyed
widespread popularity even among his own Mingrel people, but was supported
mainly by the 'Gamsakhurdia establishment' - local officials who risked
losing their jobs following the ousting of the president.
Local reports, however, said that Mr Gamsakhurdia had arrived in Zugdidi
with more than 5,000 supporters in 26 buses.
The situation in Georgia was further complicated yesterday by the
announcement that South Ossetia, formerly an autonomous region in the north
of the republic, planned to hold a referendum tomorrow on possible
unification with Northern Ossetia, part of the Russian Federation.
Sporadic fighting has raged between Ossetians and Georgians for more than a
year.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil last night sacked two of his ministers,
replacing them with federal deputies in an attempt to reduce his political
isolation, writes Christina Lamb from Rio de Janeiro.
The surprise move came after the government failed to secure Congressional
approval of emergency legislation to increase social security payments to
fund rises in pensions.
The two new ministers are both from parties which support the government but
voted against it this week.
Mr Ricardo Fiuza, the new minister for social affairs, and Mr Reinold
Stefanis, the new labour minister, both said Mr Collor had explained that he
needed to increase his base in Congress.
They will now have the task of trying to find the Dollars 10bn (Pounds
5.5bn) which the goverment says it needs for the increased pensions.
The International Monetary Fund has delayed a decision over the approval of
a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) loan to Brazil.
Brazilian officials said the meeting, due to take place next Wednesday, has
been delayed because it would clash with a meeting of heads of state from
the former Soviet Union which Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF chief, is to
attend.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Tighter pension fund law planned in next two weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to bring in legislation in the next fortnight to tighten
the law on the use of pension funds by employers for investment in their own
or related companies.
The measures on self-investment are being hastened through in the face of
mounting pressure from MPs and a number of pensions organisations after the
disclosures that as much as Pounds 400m may have been plundered from six
Maxwell company pension funds.
The regulations, which will become effective by the end of next month at the
latest, will reduce self-investment to 5 per cent of a pension fund's
resources.
Schemes currently above the 5 per cent limit will be required to cut their
level of self-investment, but only for certain types of investment. Two
years will be allowed to unload loans and equities listed on the stock
exchange and five years for equities traded on the unlisted securities
market.
Most small self-administered schemes and individual insured schemes will be
exempted from the regulations in cases where written agreement by all the
members is provided to each act of self-investment. Where schemes currently
have holdings of property or equity in private companies, they will not be
required to take action to disinvest, but no further self-investment will be
allowed.
The property exemption from divestment is designed to avoid further damage
to the depressed property market.
While the new restrictions will be welcomed, they are certain to mean that
Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, is pressed to bring in
broader controls to strengthen pensions and trust law.
Some organisations representing employees have argued that government
concern in recent years has been weighted on the side of employers seeking
ways to utilise surpluses in pension funds. The surpluses accumulated during
the '80s in a strong investment market while possible beneficiaries were
diluted by redundancies.
Mr Newton faced calls yesterday from Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social
security secretary, to safeguard the pension funds of companies in
liquidation by using their assets to protect their pension funds. There are
also likely to be renewed demands for action from the all-party social
security committee of MPs.
The Department of Social Security is already considering a proposal put by
Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the committee, in a letter to Mr
Newton, to initiate a system of self-regulation of pension funds. In
addition the National Association of Pension Funds is lobbying for equal
representation between employers and employees on funds with independent
trustees in some cases.

FT  18 JAN 92 / IRA kills seven civilians in Ulster bomb attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MASSIVE IRA bomb killed seven men last night as they returned from work on
an Ulster security force base in Co Tyrone.
Seven others were hurt, one critically, when the 1,500lb-bomb ripped apart
their transit van on the main Omagh to Cookstown road. They were at a place
known locally as Teebane crossroads, a few miles from the Republican village
of Carrickmore.
It was the highest civilian death toll in the province since the IRA Poppy
Day massacre at Enniskillen in 1987.
The bombing followed warnings by the IRA that terrorist activity is set to
increase, both in Ulster and on the UK mainland.
In particular, the IRA said two weeks ago that it intended to step up its
military activities in Ulster in 1992. It hopes to prevent effective
political talks on the future of the province between the UK and Irish
governments and between political parties in Northern Ireland. The failure
so far by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland Secretary, to stimulate
cross-party dialogue ahead of the UK general election has enabled the
terrorists to thrive in a political vacuum.
Unionist politicians, outraged by the atrocity, called for an all-out
military offensive against the terrorists.
As tension rose in the province last night, there were fears that Loyalist
paramilitary organisations would mount retaliatory attacks on Republicans.
The Rev William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for mid-Ulster, said he had
no doubt that the bombing was a carefully planned IRA operation. He said
that the security forces should be given the scope to combat the IRA free
from political interference.
It emerged last night that the dead men had been carrying out work at the
Lisanelly army base in Omagh.
The IRA has carried out attacks on workers supplying or working with the
security forces since 1985. Executives have been murdered, several firms
have been forced out of business, while others have publicly withdrawn from
security force contracts.
The bombing will have far-reaching political implications. It is certain to
re-open the debate about reintroducing internment, or detention without
trial, of terrorist suspects.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist security spokesman and a former major in
the Ulster Defence Regiment, said internment should be brought back
immediately.
Senior army commanders are understood to favour the move as one of the most
effective methods of disrupting the IRA's command structure.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Tory attack on Labour tax planfuelled by report: More
gainers overall says think-tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT analysis showing that Labour's proposed National Insurance
changes would push up the contributions of one in five households in London
and the south-east yesterday fuelled the intense Conservative attack on
opposition tax policies.
But Labour seized on figures in the report - produced by the independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies - which showed that if Labour pledges to
increase pensions and child benefit were included in the calculation the
number of gainers far outstripped losers.
The Conservative strategy of shifting the general election battleground to
issues such as tax, spending and economic competence also received a setback
from official figures showing higher public borrowing and another rise in
inflation. The borrowing figures underlined the problems that Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, faces in finding money for tax cuts that cabinet
colleagues see as an essential ingredient in a pre-election Budget.
The headline inflation rate rose from 4.3 per cent in November to 4.5 per
cent in December, prompting a strong Labour attack on the government's
economic performance.
But at the end of a frenetic week in which Labour confusion over tax policy
gave the Conservatives the campaign initiative, the IFS highlighted the
potentially damaging impact of Labour's planned abolition of the present
ceiling on NI contributions. In a report that helped to explain why Mr Neil
Kinnock indicated this week that he is now ready to phase in the change, the
IFS calculated that 20 per cent of households in London and 18 per cent in
the south-east would pay more if the ceiling of Pounds 20,280 were removed.
Across the country 11.8 per cent would lose. The IFS also agreed that if
pensioners and the unemployed were excluded from the calculations, the
proportion paying more would be significantly higher.
The IFS praised the economic logic behind the Labour policy. It produced
detailed figures to show that if the party's planned increases in child
benefit and pensions were set against the abolition of the NI contribution
ceiling, 46 per cent of households across the country would gain and only
8.7 per cent would lose.
However, the losers would be heavily concentrated among potentially floating
voters in a swathe of marginal constituencies in London and the south-east
which Mr Kinnock must win if he is to form a government after the election.
As the IFS figures came under the spotlight, the Conservatives broadened
their attack on Labour policies with a new document entitled Labour in
Limbo. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, said the party was 'stuck in a no
man's land' between the socialist policies it had abandoned and a coherent
vision of the future. Conservative Central Office also announced the
postponement of a string of annual party conferences, including that of the
Tory Trades unionists in April, the Scottish and Women Conservatives in May
and the Welsh conference in June to avoid potential clashes with the
election date.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Halifax to set new charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society with 3.6m savers, is to charge
some customers for each withdrawal from their savings accounts, including
instant access, if they have a low balance.
The move comes as banks and building societies have acted to impose charges
on millions of their personal customers to offset the squeeze on their
profitability caused by the recession.
National Westminster Bank wrote to its 3.5m Access and Visa credit card
customers this week informing them that from April 1 they will have to pay
for several services which until now they have probably taken for granted.
Halifax, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 593m last year, said it would
send letters to individual customers 'where appropriate' to inform them of
the change on February 1. It was not clear if the move would apply to
children's accounts. Halifax staff were informed of the policy on Thursday.
One customer with a low balance in an Instant Extra Account was told she
would be allowed two free withdrawals from her instant access account every
month - subsequent withdrawals would incur a 60p charge. There would be a
fee levied on customers with a balance of less than Pounds 50. The customer
was told that the move was designed to encourage people to save and that
other building societies would follow.
This was strongly denied by the other four of the UK's top five building
societies. Leeds said it had 'absolutely no plans to do such a thing'.
Nationwide, Woolwich and Alliance and Leicester said it was not their policy
to impose charges on customers wishing to make withdrawals from instant
access savings accounts.
Last year the Halifax withdrew interest on accounts with a balance of less
than Pounds 50, unless the account holder was under 21 years of age.
Another of the top 10 building societies, Cheltenham and Gloucester, decided
in October 1990 to impose a Pounds 100 minimum on its Gold account in
October 1990. 'It was not worth maintaining these accounts,' it said. 'C&amp;G
has gone for larger investors.'
Abbey National, the former building society and Halifax's main rival in the
savings market, said: 'We would never penalise a customer for just having a
pound in their balance.'
The Building Societies Commission, the industry's regulatory body, said it
was up to individual building societies to set the terms and conditions for
operating their accounts.
NatWest will be charging for services such as re-advising a customer of his
personal identification number for cash machines at a cost of Pounds 5.
Customers will pay Pounds 5 for duplicate monthly statements and Pounds 10
to change their statement date. Acknowledgement of a postal payment will
cost Pounds 2. Copies of paper vouchers on disputed transactions will cost
Pounds 5 for UK and Pounds 10 for international transactions.
NatWest is also quietly changing the date from which it charges interest on
monthly credit card balances not paid off in full.
By charging interest from the date an item was charged to the account,
rather than from the statement date, the bank will substantially increase
the interest it earns on credit cards. Barclaycard, the largest UK credit
card issuer, adopted this method two years ago when it introduced annual
card fees.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Private View: Portrait of the artist as moral campaigner -
Victoria Gillick is a single-minded self-appointed campaigner against sexual
licence and the Progressive Establishment. She explains her views to
Christian Tyler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'EITHER I'M mad, or I do have a point,' said Victoria Gillick. She was
sitting in the scruffy living room of her house, rubbing her arms and
explaining why she campaigns against sexual licence.
'I am under no illusion that what I am doing is fruitless. But it has to be
done. It's a war of attrition. In the end, even if I did nothing the thing
would resolve itself - because history always does.'
Victoria Gillick has the singleminded boldness of the revolutionary. Her
enemy is the Progressive Establishment, which she sees as a conspiracy of
social engineers with discredited theories who are undermining parents and
damaging their children.
Although she claims the support of a silent majority she runs no
organisation. Consequently, she has left herself, her artist husband Gordon
and their ten children vulnerable to derision, abuse and the obsessive
attention of the prurient Press.
I travelled to the foggy fenland town of Wisbech where the Gillicks live
after reading last week that Mrs Gillick had reported the head doctor at the
Brook Advisory Centre in Birmingham to the General Medical Council.
She alleges that the clinic is flouting a 1985 ruling of the Law Lords in a
famous case which she herself brought that only in exceptional circumstances
could doctors give contraceptive advice or treatment to girls under 16
without their parents' consent.
Victoria Gillick is not quite the militant earth-mother I had expected from
reading her book, A Mother's Tale, an apologia by turns trenchant and
sentimental. I found a strong, feminine woman, gentle-voiced with a husky
laugh. Occasionally her eyes had the fey look one imagines in a Thomas Hardy
heroine. She was serious enough, but her suspicion of me and my trade made
her skittish.
Her first explanation of her motives came as a surprise. She said it was her
training as a painter.
'I've often worried why one felt so ill at ease in this society, and I can
only think it's for the same reason as someone like Mary Whitehouse (the
veteran broadcasting campaigner). She, too, was art trained.
'All your instincts are to try and make harmony and order and sense. All
one's training is for that purpose. I feel ill at ease when I find the moral
images, the way people behave, out of kilter. The colours are wrong, the
balance has gone, the composition is all out.'
I ventured to suggest it was more psychological than that - perhaps to do
with the fact that her own parents separated.
She would have none of it. 'That's what the New Statesman said. They said I
actually didn't like children: that's why I went on having lots and lots of
them, to try and demonstrate that I did like them.'
Wife and husband are Catholics, and Gordon - a strong-minded and articulate
man - appears to support his wife on every point. They told me that as
Catholics they belonged to a critical, non-conformist, tradition more truly
English than Protestant puritanism. They are proud to be non-joiners,
outsiders, who have no social status and therefore none to lose.
Isn't it moral or religious fervour that drives you?
'No', she said, quietly. 'I have a strong faith, but I'm not a very good
Christian. I'm a practising Catholic, but I'm not a very good one.'
What is it that you're bad at?
'That's my business.' Then she conceded: 'It's not believing in God that's
difficult, but day-to-day living.'
I pressed. You could be seen as some sort of religious nutter, couldn't you?
'Well, only because for some reason or other we tolerate journalists
exposing their own religious prejudices, to the extent that I am always
referred to as 'a Roman Catholic mother-of-ten.' I have a theory that this
is what one person referred to as up-market, middle-class Paki-bashing. I
notice that when Enoch Powell brought in his Embryo Bill nobody ever
referred to him as an Anglican father-of-two. That would have been an insult
against the monarchy, an attack on the State itself.'
I suggested that it was disingenuous of her not to recognise that being a
Catholic and against artificial contraception had got something to do with
it.
'It's not got something to do with it for me. It might for those who look
on.'
Where does your being a Catholic come into this?
'The Catholics are used to being at the sharp end of moral issues. They have
a history and tradition of radicalism. I believe that the individual
conscience has to take precedence over everything.'
Aren't you asserting your views at other people's expense?
'Yes. But that is my democratic right. There's nothing wrong in that. People
only think you are exerting your views over them when they disagree with
you.
'I have not introduced any law allowing the unborn to be destroyed. But for
criticising politicians for introducing that law I am called undemocratic. I
haven't taken away anybody's life. You see, it's a peculiar reversal. If I
criticise doctors for doing something, they ask by what right do I try and
impose my views on them. But they are already actually doing the thing.'
Are you a self-appointed champion?
'I don't even think in terms of champion. This is journalese.'
You tell me what you call it.
'I call myself a ratcatcher, actually.'
You do it with distaste?
'No. That's not true.'
How is it, then?
'Like, I believe, some men feel when they are in the heat of battle. They
don't do it with distaste, they do it because it's a job that's got to be
done.
'I just get so boiled up and angry that other people should have an
opportunity to promote their views in the papers and I can't be heard when
mine is as valid as theirs.
'I'm a big mouth that speaks for other people. The media need a voice. I'll
be the voice. I'm only sad when they try to hit the person behind the voice,
or, even worse, hit the children of the person behind the voice. That's when
I wonder whether it was worth it.'
You feel the family has paid too high a price?
'I know the family's paid too high a price.'
In what ways?
'Exposure. The feeling of being tailed, dogged, taunted by the media.'
Do you lie awake at night?
'Only when the children have suffered. I do consider that grossly unfair
that women who have children can be shot down through their children. Men
are protected. Politicians are not attacked for that.'
Half-way through the interview, Victoria Gillick broke off suddenly and
said: 'Here comes scum on legs.' She had seen a Sun reporter crossing the
road. A photographer waited in the car. 'They hang about for days. Then you
get the telephoto lens on the house, day after day after day. You end up
having to shut the shutters up. You can't go out. What a disgusting job to
do.' She laughed bitterly.
I turned to the subject of her opponents, suggesting that they, too, might
be well-intentioned ratcatchers. No, she said. Her targets were not doctors
and other professionals but 'those who are actually creating policy. They
know precisely what they are about.'
Why are they doing it?
'I don't know. I know I am following the Ten Commandments. I don't know what
they are following.'
When you meet them don't you find well-meaning people who have just got it
wrong?
'No - and I am not just saying this - I feel like some kind of rumbustious
anarchist. I feel like someone who's alive. They always strike me as being
intensely puritanical.
'That is a peculiarity about people who are intensely involved in sexual
matters, which I'm not, funnily enough. I'm just an observer. They always
strike me as cool to the point of being semi-dead - the most inappropriate
people to talk about these subjects to youngsters. Curious.
'If I showed you some of the books they've written, you'd say they must be
really raunchy, I mean they must be Wow] Then you meet them and they're the
most tight, quiet, intense little people. And you think they actually don't
like their own bodies.
'I get the feeling they don't like procreation. There's something that
disgusts them. They're the first to condemn me for having ten children, as
though I had committed some heinous sexual sin. They've been thrown into a
dilemma: they've said because I'm a Catholic I have most terribly repressive
ideas about sex, and then they say 'she's a sex maniac because she's got ten
children.' They can't sort it out.'
Why did you have ten children?
'I'm very good at having children. In the past women couldn't easily have
them. This is a golden age for having children. I wanted lots of children.'
She denied that any special sacrifice was involved. If the family was
relatively poor, that was because as artists she and her husband were 'not
very good at earning a living.'
'I consider that we live very well, because we live in a big house, though
by most people's standards probably battered and dirty. But we are energetic
about it and Gordon can build and make things. And what we prize - anyone
with a large family would prize - is a certain degree of space and time with
the children.'
It wouldn't suit everybody, I said.
'No. It's your free choice. My choice was to have children.'
I suggested to her that people would inevitably judge her by her children,
five girls and five boys, ranging from 23-year-old Ben to nine-year-old
Clemmie.
'Well, they misunderstood me. I brought the case against the government not
because I thought that I was inviolate - one or two of the judges
misunderstood this too - but because I felt as vulnerable as everybody
else.'
Parents, she said, were exceptionally vulnerable. 'They don't have any trade
union to defend them. A parent can end up in court far faster than a doctor
can or a teacher. I've always believed that being a parent was not a
difficult job provided others in the community supported it.' Only a
minority, she argued, had abdicated to the extent that state intervention
was needed.
Victoria Gillick thinks she will be proved right in the long run, like those
who have campaigned against environmental pollution. 'In time we will look
back on this age, in which we drugged women, daily drugged them, in order to
make them infertile, as insane.
'What people do is between them and their Maker. All I know is that what
contraception was supposed to cure it hasn't cured. There is the same
poverty. It hasn't improved living accommodation. It hasn't made men more
caring and thoughtful and responsible towards their wives. When anything
goes wrong with the relationship they simply walk away.'
She thinks we have not yet recovered from the shock of two world wars and an
acceptance of then-necessary state intervention and mobilisation. 'People
have not learned really how to assert themselves.'
Moral teaching had been forgotten. 'Your average youngster doesn't know what
you are talking about when you talk about traditional Christian behaviour.
They don't know where they have gone wrong. It's tragic. It's like looking
at people who are sitting down to a complicated game of chess, and though
they know the general idea is to enjoy yourself and to win something at the
end of it, they haven't got a clue what the rules are. They are what has
been called technological giants and moral pygmies.
'Being of an older tradition than the humanist, I am not surprised to find,
when you legislate against the Ten Commandments - which are so very simple
and basic to the smooth running of society - that you end up with an
epidemic of killing disease, a level of rape and child abuse and the general
dishonesty that we have.
'Why did we have the Ten Commandments in the first place? We don't impose
such things to make life difficult, but to make life easy. The government
has tried to make life easy. It's in fact made it very, very difficult.'
Victoria Gillick may never see the code she lives by legislated back into
our secular state. But the moral tide may, after all, be turning. Shortly
after meeting her I read that Marks &amp; Spencer was withdrawing some
children's clothes after complaints that they were sexually provocative.
Victoria Gillick is not mad. Personally, I think she has a point.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Vote for double-digit inflation]: John Willman says Labour
does not need big ideas to win the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I FIND it hard not to feel sorry for Neil Kinnock. Whatever he does, he
cannot please his critics.
He has spent the past nine years purging the Labour party of ideology. Out
have gone unilateral nuclear disarmament, nationalisation of the top 200
monopolies and free television licences for pensioners. In have come reams
of worthy papers setting out plans for making the trains run on time,
tightening company law and improving reading standards in schools.
The result? Kinnock's critics say that he lacks a 'big idea,' that no one
knows what he stands for.
Newspapers which used to declare Labour unelectable because of its policies
now claim that it cannot be trusted for changing them.
Personally, I think that Labour needs a big idea like it needs a hole in the
head. After 11 years of Thatcherism, I am sure that not having an axe to
grind is worth a few million votes.
But Labour does need to assemble a few simple themes which give people
something to latch on to. I cannot be the only voter who is unclear about
just how life would be different under a Labour government. So, in the
spirit of improving what looks otherwise to be a lacklustre election
campaign, I offer three election-winning policies for an ambitious prime
minister-in-waiting.
The first is to bring back double-digit inflation at the earliest
opportunity. Since it will almost certainly happen under a Labour
government, anyway, Kinnock might as well claim the credit for its
beneficial effects now.
Weekend FT readers who are owner-occupiers will need little reminding of
those beneficial effects. Rising nominal house prices shrink away mortgage
debts, avoiding the sort of misery caused by the present decline in house
prices.
They make people feel good. They make people spend money which creates jobs.
And since most people get pay rises in excess of inflation (or are on
index-linked benefits), burdensome mortgage payments swiftly dwindle away to
affordable proportions.
Indeed, I predict that the double-digit inflation rates of the 1970s will
soon join regional railway companies and learning by rote on the political
nostalgia Top Ten.
My second election-winner is a promise to bring back the grammar schools and
direct grants. This would be hugely popular - their abolition provoked
widespread 'save our schools' campaigns because of the esteem they enjoyed
locally.
It would also be recognisably a socialist policy. Parents who can afford it
now buy a grammar school education for their children from the independent
schools. Children whose families cannot afford the fees are denied the
quality of education which the grammar schools provided.
I cannot be the only voter who finds this unacceptable in a society which
claims to offer equality of opportunity. It is also a waste of talent if
children from working-class families find it harder to get into tertiary
education.
My third suggestion is a confiscatory inheritance tax extended to include
all lifetime gifts.
I would exclude gifts and bequests between husband and wife, as at present.
And I would introduce complete exemptions for small businesses so long as
they remained in the family - to encourage the development of a Mittelstand
on German lines.
But I would rake off anything else other than a few thousand pounds of gifts
and bequests and the cost of a decent burial. The proceeds of such a tax
would allow Labour to give every 18-year-old an endowment of Pounds 10,000.
To stop them spending it all on sex, drugs and rock'n'roll, this endowment
would be encashable only for a limited range of uses.
At the top of the list would be vocational training and higher education (a
beneficial side-effect would be that universities would then get their
income from their students, not the state). It could also be used to buy a
house, start up a business or for long-term investments - with provisions to
stop it being cashed in.
A massive step towards greater equality of opportunity, it would empower
young people to make real choices about their lives. It would also be in
sharp contrast to the Conservatives' plans to reduce inheritance tax, which
could be lampooned as encouraging the sons and daughters of the rich to
become idle layabouts.
So, there we are. Three unbeatable policies - and none of them costs a bean
in extra spending. Is anyone listening out there?

FT  18 JAN 92 / Machiavelli's view of John Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE AMONG the congested news offices at Westminster, the Tory and Labour
skirmishing is looking too seraphic and scrappy.
Attempts to seize the 'political initiative' blur in my mind. Who is more
dedicated to public transport? Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, or his
brash shadow, John Prescott? Which party is more enthusiastic about the
National Health Service?
It is time for someone to inject a little order, devilish malice and
ruthlessness.
Niccolo Machiavelli, the earliest and so far unsurpassed political
commentator, must have felt similarly frustrated as he penned a note to The
Magnificent Lorenzo De Medici, Duke of Urbino in the 16th century, on his
new book, The Prince.
Like him, my humble status as a political observer instills a sense of awe.
The likely ferocity of the 1992 UK election campaign would impress a Borgia,
in vindictiveness if not debauchery. Election press conferences will start
at 7.15am to hit breakfast TV. Insults will flow like water. But awe should
not stop pundits preaching to the potentates.
As Machiavelli wrote: 'Just as men who are sketching the landscape put
themselves down in the plain to study the nature of the mountains and the
highlands . . . so, to comprehend fully the nature of the people, one must
be a prince, and to comprehend fully the nature of princes one must be an
ordinary citizen.'
Machiavelli's writing plays heavily on the baser human motives, to which
only the reckless of political leaders would admit. There are handy election
tips. But burn this article after reading.
The Prince is most applicable to Tories, partly because it is about holding
or consolidating power. Machiavelli himself was an unreconstructed
Conservative. Socialism and liberal democracy were not big swingers in
turbulent late medieval Italy.
Parts could have been written by the Treasury. A Prince spending generously
'will soon squander all his resources only to be forced in the end, if he
wants to maintain his reputation, to lay excessive burdens on the people, to
impose extortionate taxes,' Machiavelli warns. 'This will start to make his
subjects hate him.'
John Major is tilting in the wrong direction, positively boasting about the
amounts being spent on the NHS. Such largesse will eventually backfire.
There needs to be less of this 'honest guy' image. It may have brought
credit in Major's first year as prime minister, but callousness will bring
still greater dividends. 'A prudent ruler cannot, and must not, honour his
word when it places him at a disadvantage and when the reasons for which he
made his promise no longer exist.'
Major needs to stamp authority on his cabinet. Men must either be pampered
or crushed if a Prince is to survive. Rifkind described the row among
ministers over rail privatisation as cabinet government 'working properly'.
Machiavelli is spinning in his grave.
What lessons are there for the usurpers, Kinnock and Ashdown? Machiavelli
does not say how power is seized. But the best tactics must be to play to
the incumbent's weaknesses. Outbid his prowess and promises. Lie liberally.
It may not win an election, but it would inject of bit of demonic fun into
my job.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS CHANCE would have it, January 18 is the one day a year when I observe a
ban on jokes about bookmakers. In my experience bookies are such a grasping,
conniving group that it is fair to make jokes about them throughout the
year, particularly if you understand the slick mechanics - the immensely
profitable maths - of their parasitic business.
But on January 18 I hold myself in check and tell myself: no bookie jokes.
However, sticking to the ban is difficult. For example, this week I have
been fossicking for value among the bookies' quoted odds on the UK general
election. But my rummaging has been rebuffed. I rang one of the Big Three
bookmakers. I won't say which one, except that its name includes an L, an a,
a d, a b, an r, an o, a k and an e. The odds it quoted were as follows:
Conservatives 5-6, Labour 5-6, hung parliament 1-2.
You do not need a degree in cosmography to see that those odds are just a
tiny bit cramped: an exemplum of the difficulty of locking horns with the
bookies.
What you should do when you see odds like those is walk away. So I did. I
walked into Mayfair, to the home of my friend Jack Hillbrooke, Europe's
richest bookmaker. You may not have heard of Jack. I am the only reporter he
ever sees, which is why I am privy to most of the schemes cooked up by Jack
and his North Korean-built computer, GREENGOD-VI.
Jack was away. He is negotiating the formation of a chain of betting shops
in Croatia and Slovenia. But Boris, Jack's minder, was there. Boris is
ex-KGB. He invited me in and ushered me upstairs, into the perpetual video
night-time (banks of computers, flashing TV screens) of Jack's private
office. The only painting in the room is an incandescent nude by Piero
Bellotti.
I admired the painting, then passed through an unmarked door into a
carnation-coloured room where GREENGOD-VI lives. (Of course he lives there.
He has a mind. He passes all Turing tests with scandalous ease. In addition
to a mind he also has a lisp, though it is a bit like mine: virtually
undetectable except in showery periods).
'Hi, GREENGOD,' I said.
'Hi, Mike,' he said, flashing his coloured lights and greeting my arrival
with an improvised version of the theme from ET. 'How is your luck?'
'Not good,' I said. 'The horses are killing me. I've been losing since
Boxing Day. Flick-flick, snick-snick. I am bleeding, GREENGOD. I can't
adjust to changes in the going.' (Among thousands of subjects, GREENGOD-VI
is an expert on climatological change and the problems for horseracing, such
as ruptured form lines, posed by global warming).
'I'll see what I can do,' said GREENGOD-VI.
'Otherwise,' I said, 'I've been trying to find value in the election odds,
but they are horribly cramped: 5-6 the Tories, 5-6 Labour, a hung parliament
at 1-2.'
'Flaky,' agreed GREENGOD-VI. 'Have no twuck' (I imagine he meant truck).
'What you must do is look for value in the odds quoted against the name of
the prime minister at the end of the year. That ought to be fun. Also
profitable. How much do you want to win?'
'Pounds 2m.'
There was silence for a moment while the computer played with his lights,
absent-mindedly composing a tone-poem of indigo, cobalt, coral and
malachite. Then he started to hum ET again. I knew he was happy.
'The trouble is,' I said, 'that the bookies, again, are being ultra cautious
with their prime minister odds. There may be two general elections. Possibly
three. There could be fighting in the streets. Or else a riot of apathy.
Either way, predicting who will be PM at the end of the year is not an easy
task. But can I get satisfaction? I phoned L,a,d,b,r,o,k,e. They were
charming but quivery, shook like jellies. They said that computing these
odds was extremely difficult. Finally, they offered 5-6 John Major, 5-6 Neil
Kinnock and 10-1 anyone else.'
'Flaky,' agreed GREENGOD-VI. 'Have no twuck. The man you should concentwate
on is Gordon Bwown.'
'The shadow trade secretary?' I said. 'Labour's secret weapon? The man
famous for his ability to cheer up a room just by leaving it?'
'You are out of date, Michael. They've been working on Gordon Bwown. As you
know, I monitor every TV channel in Europe. I have been studying him
closely. Gordon Bwown is now smiling. That is a singular development. The
other night on Channel 4 he smiled at Michael Heseltine. Smiled, and then
rubbished him. Absolutely singular. If you shop awound you'll get 20-1
against Gordon Bwown. Then you could move to Tawoudannt. In return, you'd
take me with you. Just think what we could do.'

FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Modern artist of the Renaissance - Patricia Morison
reviews the Mantegna exhibition at the Royal Academy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANDREA Mantegna was the most famous modern artist of 15th-century Italy.
Contemporaries hailed his 'Camera degli Sposi' in Mantua Castle as 'the most
beautiful room in the world'. In the 'Triumphs of Caesar', Mantegna's
passion for antiquity combined so powerfully with his dazzling artistic
technique that Rome's victorious legions seemed once again to shake the
ground with their tread.
Andrea Mantegna at the Royal Academy in London until April 5(sponsored by
Olivetti) is a miracle of an exhibition. Through it we rediscover an artist
whose work lights a path back to the excitement and the intellectual
ambitions of the early Renaissance.
Many people would have said the day had gone when there could be a major
exhibition devoted to one of the greatest names of the 15th-century
Renaissance. And yet room after room of the Academy - painted a rather
surprising damson-purple - is hung with paintings, drawings and prints
either by Mantegna or his circle. Separating the former from the latter is
part of the exhibition's scholarly raison d'etre, without which far fewer
treasures could have been prised away from their owners.
Admittedly, Mantegna made things easier by his preference, unusual before
1500, for painting on canvas. As he pointed out to a client, paintings on
canvas were so convenient to transport; you simply furled them round a rod.
In Padua, city of Mantegna's youth, fresco was the natural choice for grand
decorative schemes. The precocious artist proved his mastery of fresco in
the Ovetari chapel in the church of the Hermit Friars. Destroyed by an
Allied bomb in 1944, the chapel was perhaps the most tragic artistic loss of
the War. One surviving seraph appears in the exhibition. The way the
seraph's white tunic clings to his well-modelled body, as if he had just
stepped from a celestial bath, shows the extraordinary importance of
Donatello's example for the art of Mantegna.
Mantegna at Padua quickly became the darling of a group of bankers, lawyers,
physicians and the bishop. However, he was wooed away by the blandishments
of the duke of Mantua, the highly cultivated but, as Mantegna was to
discover, not always solvent Ludovico Gonzaga. Mantegna's adopted city was
damp, thanks to Lake Garda, which made fresco painting something of a battle
 -one which, technically but not artistically speaking, Mantegna lost in his
'Camera degli Sposi'. Canvas proved the solution for large-scale works such
as the 'Triumphs of Caesar'.
Lake Garda itself inspired Mantegna's restrained and poignant 'Death of the
Virgin' from the Prado, one of a number of paintings on panel which, quite
exceptionally, have been loaned to this exhibition. This lovely view, half
water and half sky, is so spacious and tranquil that it recalls landscapes
by Giovanni Bellini, his brother-in-law. What a contrast there is between
the simplicity of this painting and the obsessively detailed world of
Mantegna's earlier devotional panel-paintings, the rock-strewn landscapes of
the 'Adoration of the Shepherds' from the Met and 'St Jerome in the
Wilderness' from the museum at Sao Paolo.
What a contrast, equally, with the National Gallery's 'Agony in the Garden'.
Perfectly reasonably, this great early painting has stayed in the Gallery
where, if any strength remains after this demanding exhibition, you should
see both it and the brilliantly-coloured altarpiece of the Virgin and Child
with Saints on your way home.
At the Academy, we have a fascinating opportunity to compare Giovanni
Bellini and Mantegna in their treatment of another deeply affecting theme,
Christ's 'Descent into Limbo'. Mantegna's interpretation (from the Barbara
Piasecka Johnson collection) is shown with his drawings and engravings, and
with the painting by Bellini from Bristol. Mantegna's is the more dramatic;
indeed, in all of Renaissance art I doubt there is a more eloquent back view
than that of Christ standing at the gates of Hell, his red robe fluttering
in the infernal draught.
I cannot begin to describe the other extraordinary masterpieces now gathered
together. From the Louvre comes 'Pallas expelling the Vices from the Garden
of Virtue', Mantegna in his late years creating the most complex allegories
any humanist scholar could devise. Turn from that to contemplate Mantegna
the great religious artist, above all in the Copenhagen 'Man of Sorrows with
Two Angels'. This important painting is so well-preserved that it allows us
to imagine how many less fortunate paintings would once have looked.
If time or strength is limited, however, I would suggest starting at the end
with the 'Triumphs of Caesar' from Hampton Court. Could any exhibition have
a more blazing finale? Eight canvases are displayed, the whole series save
for the severely damaged scene of the Gallic captives. The 'Triumphs'
entered the Royal Collection in 1629 when Charles I bought them from the
Gonzagas. Not for five centuries has it been possible to see the series more
or less as Mantegna intended, separated only by pilasters as they were in
the palace of San Sebastiano.
Over the centuries restorers from Laguerre to Roger Fry have inflicted
terrible wounds on this masterpiece. Mantegna's rapturous evocation of the
civilised aspects of conquest, of proud cities captured and their statues
carted off to grace the conqueror's home, is a wreck of its former self.
Even so, the 'Triumphs' keeps its incredible beauty of design. From the
first musician blasting away on his curved trumpet the procession moves to a
rhythm so entrancing it may well hold you spell-bound for an hour.
Not surprisingly, the 'Triumphs' will not be travelling with the show to the
Metropolitan Museum in New York, where it runs from May 9 to July 12. There
will be other gaps, too, but the New Yorkers will have their own
compensations, such as the portrait from Berlin of the memorably
stoney-faced, brooding Cardinal Ludovico Trevisan.
Mantegna's paintings are not as familiar today as many by contemporaries
such as Uccello, Giovanni Bellini or Piero della Francesca. Rather oddly, to
my mind, there seems to be a feeling that Mantegna is a difficult artist,
characterised by a streak of harshness, something discordant and even
repellent. Unfortunately, this was due to contemporary gossip about the man.
Mantegna was a genius who was proud, prickly, and more than a little spoilt.
The duke of Mantua himself had to step in to solve his painter's quarrels
with his tailor. He could even be downright vicious. There is a well-known
story, rather unclear in detail, of how he hired thugs to beat up the artist
who made illicit copies of his engravings, and then hounded him from Mantua
with allegations of sodomy.
But since when has it been necessary for a great artist also to be a noble
character? However, no less a connoisseur than Sir Lawrence Gowing takes a
curiously wary approach to Mantegna as an artist in his preface to the
catalogue - which is beautifully written throughout and quite indispensable.
For Gowing, Mantegna is a difficult artist whom he describes as ferocious,
stony-hearted. 'There was no pity in Mantegna', he writes, and nothing
'heroic or idyllic in (his) evocation of the ancient world'.
Well, this was not previously my view of Mantegna and is still less so,
thanks to this memorable exhibition. Time and again it is the gracefulness
of his figures which astounds, something especially well seen in his
preparatory drawings. For all the variety of poses and human types which
Mantegna delighted to paint, he never caricatures them. Roman soldiers in
their fantastic armour appear as personifications of ideal male types; and
yet in his later works - for example in the fascinating grisaille, 'The
Introduction of the Cult of Cybele to Rome' - we marvel that he could depict
men who are bald and ageing, the stuffed shirts of the Senate, and yet give
them dignity and even beauty.
Mantegna stands out for his extraordinary gift for individualising
characters. We can still see it in the 'Triumphs' and with wonderful skill
in even the most rapid sketches, for example in his Saints Andrew and
Longinus. His painting of St George from the Accademia in Venice shows this
passion for the living, breathing, and above all thinking man, particularly
well. Here is no vacuous Christian pin-up. Instead we see a thoughtful youth
reminiscent of Donatello's St George, both warriors for whom conquering a
dragon seems to be only one step in a spiritual journey.
As Paul Kristeller noted in his magnificent book on the artist published in
1901, 'even those of his characters who seem peaceful and happy, betray a
touch of sad melancholy, as though they felt the weight of a supernatural
power hanging over them.' But like so many truly great artists, no one
characterisation will quite fit. Look at Mantegna's exquisitely tender
engraving of the Virgin and Child, and there is no wistfulness. Instead here
is the magical intimacy of a mother who is, after all, only a simple peasant
who bends in a transport of tenderness over her baby. Mantegna is an artist
who takes a lifetime to discover in all his variety. This exhibition will
put its visitors several decades further along that path.

THE TOUR to which this devised double bill at the Gate Theatre, Notting Hill
acts as guide is of female relationships. In the first piece, Slight
Possession, which won the Guardian International Student Drama Award, the
relationship that is explored is a passionate
one. The journey is from infatuation through rejection to a reconciliation
that styles itself a happy ending against the evidence of the two
personalities involved.
They torment and torture each other, then kiss and make up, spouting
romantic cliches while subverting them through behaviour which is
choreographed into metronomic repetitions. Their neuroses converge on a
step-ladder, which is clacked open and shut, mounted, leapt from and cowered
behind.
In the second piece, The Detour, the trip is more abstract. Two women are
walking along a road. As they go, they accumulate the baggage of a lifetime
 -an unwanted gift, a chair, a corpse, an infernal blue boa which becomes an
icon of a certain sort of female sexuality.
What precisely is their destination? A washing line at the front of the
stage on which they peg out their luggage as they peer over our heads to a
distant horizon. They have arrived. Yes, but where? By this stage I'm afraid
I neither knew nor cared.
Talking Tongues have found themselves a lively performance style, but they
have as yet to develop the common touch that can woo an ordinary audience. A
sense of humour helps, and narrative is important, even if one chooses to
ignore its more obvious manifestations.
In Slight Possession, Kim Walter and Rachel Weisz at least create the
continuity of two characters in a given situation. In the episodic Detour,
they abandon themselves to their imaginations in a way that is at once
self-indulgently studenty and prohibitively difficult to follow. David Farr
directs.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Modern operas built to last - Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMMERMANN'S only opera has become something of a virility symbol among
opera Intendants eager to display their credentials. Of all the significant
operas written in the last 30 years Die Soldaten makes the most extravagant
demands, with its multiple stage levels and three film screens, as well as
cruelly taxing vocal parts - the role of Marie outstrips that of Lulu in its
high-lying lines, while there are no less than six high tenors of various
kinds specified in the score. So finding the resources and the rehearsal
time necessary to mount Die Soldaten has become required proof of a genuine
commitment to contemporary opera. In the autumn Andrew Porter reported here
enthusiastically on the New York premiere at the City Opera, while both
Opera North and the Royal Opera have pencilled productions into their
schedules in recent years, only to abandon them when economic stringency was
enforced. The only British performances remain those brought to the
Edinburgh Festival by the Cassel Opera in 1972.
Perhaps when it was first performed in 1965 Die Soldaten did appear to be a
modern masterpiece, the long-awaited reconciliation between the post-war
avant-garde and traditional opera, directly descended from Wozzeck and Lulu.
A quarter of a century later it seems much less convincing, and distasteful.
However humane Zimmermann's intentions in setting Lenz's brutal drama his
treatment comes over as sensationalist and exploitative: the concern for
society's victims, so affecting in Berg's operas on similar themes, seems
merely schematic. Musically, too, the opera appears dated; though
dramatically the pace is sure and tight enough, the language is
self-consciously modish, the cliches of total serialism laced generously
with quotation and pastiche.
Such shortcomings may come over more strongly in a recording than they would
in the theatre, where the sheer scope of Zimmermann's scheme doubtless
carries a great deal before it. The new studio recording from Stuttgart
(based upon a production there in 1988) is a superb one. Bernhard Kontarsky
has been associated with Die Soldaten since its premiere and obtains a
degree of accuracy and control from his players and singers that is often
astonishing, while the insurmountable problems of containing all the musical
effects and multi-layerings within a mere two-channel mix have been taken on
more rigorously than could have dared hope. The cast is led by Nancy Shade's
impressive Marie and Zoltan Kelemen's eloquent Wesener; every part though,
is strongly cast, and many of the roles are more lovingly detailed than
Zimmermann's cardboard characterisations deserve.
Le Grand Macabre belongs with Soldaten (and Reimann's Lear) in the select
band of recent operas that promise to lodge themselves firmly in the
European repertory. The Wergo recording appeared first on LP, and the
transfer on CD is very welcome. It is a fine performance with a multilingual
cast singing in German, which originated at Austrian Radio and is conducted
by Elgar Howarth, who was in charge of both the first performance, in
Stockholm in 1978, and the British premiere four years later.
No one would make great claims for the dramaturgy of Grand Macabre. Ligeti's
version of the Ghelderode play is a simple fable that targets the weaknesses
of the human appetite for power, wealth and particularly sex. It is a frieze
of absurdist jokes, musical and verbal, which orbits constantly about the
biggest absurdity of all, death, and which along the way affectionately
parodies and pays homage to much of the Western operatic tradition. One
experiences enchantment rather than deep emotion in Grand Macabre, there is
delight in its musical dexterity, its fond vocal writing and extravagant
conceits, and marvellously unbuttoned humour. There is nothing else remotely
like it, and it was to be both a summation of Ligeti's achievement and a
leavetaking: the pieces that emerged in the wake of Grand Macabre were to be
utterly different.
In two significant respects at least both Soldaten and Grand Macabre are
entirely traditional: they both take as given the frame of the opera-house
stage (even if Zimmermann stretches it a good deal) and the imperative of a
linear narrative. Wolfgang Rihm's Hamletmaschine, based upon Heiner Muller's
theatre piece is far more radical in its basic conception - less perfectly
realised, and sometimes badly miscalculated, but often thrilling, fresh and
full of striking ideas. Rihm cites Schoenberg's Erwartung and Gluckliche
Hand as the jumping-off point for his 'music theatre in five movements', but
he throws Antonin Artaud into the mix too, to yield a result that deifes
accurate description and straddles any number of formal boundaries.
The text is a sequence of discursions around the Hamlet story; Rihm says it
is not his business to explain Muller, but that 'the drama is presented
through the constantly shifting layers of projection in the music'. Like the
words, the music coheres through an obscure network of pathways; one senses
their wholeness long before beginning to tease out all the connections and
meanings. The recording, made at the premiere in Mannheim in 1987, has its
roughnesses but the power and originality of Rihm's writing are never
obscured. It makes for a fascinating preface to his new opera Die Eroberung
von Mexiko, scheduled for Hamburg in three weeks' time.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Controller takes the hot seat - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A TRUE democrat, Michael Green, Controller of Radio 4, submitted himself on
Sunday to half an hour's telephoned comment on his network. The lines had
already been open for two hours, so no doubt the comments we heard were only
a few of those made. How else account for a mere two criticisms of the
morning-timed Woman's Hour? One of them complained simply of inability to
hear it at its new time, or even at the evening repeat at 7.20 pm to be
tried for six months. The other reckoned that the programme had begun to
deal with women's general, ie feminist, rather than domestic, interests.
The most important complaint made was surely the inability to receive FM
signals in some areas. Things would be better during the 1990s, Mr Green
promised. Or perhaps we must wait half a decade for DAB, or digital audio
broadcasting. Most of the other complaints were matters of taste. Reporters'
voices in the news bulletins were too 'magazine-y', there were too many old
comedy items like quizzes, there was too much nostalgia, there should be
more listener-involvement (like phone-ins), there was too much background
music in the plays, there were too many repeats, too much obsession with
politics.
The Controller kept his end up well enough and promised to take notes of
what was raised. Hardly had he ended than a violin began the background
music for the repeat of Planche's play The Garrick Fever, a delightful
comedy about an ambitious young Irishman playing Hamlet in place of the
absent star (there was no more music, though). Then followed the first of a
political series, The Power and the Glory, in which James Naughtie examines
American leadership. Two excellent programmes.
Nostalgia followed almost at once, in a series on the Gulf fighting, The
Desert War, and in Concerto, a reminiscent interview with Moura Lympany; but
I doubt if the objection was meant to include all such memories. For serious
nostalgia we had to wait for the first programme in Never the Same Again on
Tuesday (a repeat), and the second programme on Thursday morning. The series
deals with 'critical periods in family life', and the general sentiment is
self-pity. I find this an unattractive sentiment, however accountable,
especially when flaunted as a sort of entertainment.
With respect to Mr Green, I find the best drama on Radio 3 as a rule, but
this week they repeated two plays about which I have already written fairly
lately. On Sunday we had the interesting Much Ado about Nothing directed by
Clive Brill, with its cultural range of voices - Afro-Caribbean sounds for
the Fairies and RADA sounds for the Greeks, well worth its second hearing.
On Tuesday came a repeat of Anthony Burgess's A Meeting in Valladolid, a
fantasy about a meeting between Shakespeare and Cervantes, which has already
been broadcast all over Europe in 13 languages, and I would have thought
that enough.
By way of total contrast, Radio 4 gave us Chris Galer's Manikudlak and the
Bear on Thursday, part of the channel's current Northern Lights Festival.
Set in Greenland, this was about an Inuit (Meredith Edwards) and his young
nephew (Marc Heatley), who go hunting together. Manikudlak hears voices, of
the Sea-mother who lives at the bottom of the sea waiting for men to come
and comb her hair, and of the days of his youth. The boy is not interested
in such old stories and goes home on his own after a bear has been sighted
but Manikudlak has jammed his rifle. The bear is in fact a revival of the
bear that Manikudlak and his brother had killed years before, and in whose
gutted body he had sheltered from an ice-storm. Now the brothers are
reunited. The play mixes fact and folk-tale throughout in this pleasant if
not always expert way. The director was Jane Dauncey.
There were more Inuits elsewhere in the week, with more to come, dealing
with the cultures of the peoples living on the Arctic rim - all pretty new
to most of us, I suspect.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Rumours, rules and 'antique women'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS THAT Mark Fisher, the assiduous shadow Arts Minister, might not come
into his inheritance if Labour win the Election seem wide of the mark. An
attractive scenario is painted of Neil Kinnock grabbing some populist
headlines by creating an ennobled Melvyn Bragg as a high profile arts
supremo. The alternative theory from insiders was that he might please the
women's lobby by catapulting Joyce Quinn, an obscure backbencher, into the
portfolio.
But the official line still is that all the shadows will take over their
scheduled portfolios - at least for the first six months. Then Fisher might
get promotion to the cabinet while Bragg, or perhaps Baronness (Tessa)
Blackstone, also thought to be keen on the job, or Quinn (with Glenda
Jackson as a possible PPS) is hauled in to pep up a labouring Government.
There is little to choose between the parties' declared programmes for the
arts. Labour might force local authorities to allocate a set percentage of
their revenues to the arts, and is likely to raise additional money by
imposing a tax on blank tapes - audio and video.
But talk of enlarging the arts ministry by giving it responsibility for film
and television seems doomed to disappointment in post-Election political
horse trading. To a great extent the Government has already carried out much
of Labour's policy - notably by slimming down the Arts Council and pushing
funding decisions to the regional arts boards.
The Connoisseur, the respected British art journal which turned itself into
an American life style magazine, has closed down. So has The Art Journal, a
more recent candidate for the collector's eye. There are reports that Herr
Flick, owner of Apollo, is wearying of his vehicle. The advertising
recession has badly hit the financial viability of the plethora of art and
antiques magazines.
Against the odds the one success is Antique, the latest edition of which
appeared this week bursting with advertisments and controversy. Antique
started life as Antiques Across the World, a give-away to dealers from
Michael Davis, shippers of antiques. Michael Davis went out of business but
the team that ran the magazine persevered, shortened the name, and now
publish the only journal in the market making a reasonable profit.
The secret is an odd one - humour, plus the lavish use of big names.
Everyone from Harold Wilson to Spike Milligan has written for it, which, in
contrast to the oh, so serious, tone of its competitors, has an
undergraduate desire to shock.
The current issue is typical. It is devoted to women, and, along with
predictable articles on the chauvinism of London auction houses in
comparison with New York, contains a virulent attack by the critic Brian
Sewell on women artists. He claims that 'if all the paintings ever painted
by every woman were thrown into the Atlantic the history of art would not be
a jot disrupted'.
So it was bravery beyond belief which drove Sewell, famous for his dislike
of social occasions, to accept an invitation to address the lunch of
'antique women' yesterday, the jolly annual occasion when Women in Art and
Antiques, an influential but mysterious body of around 100 women working in
the art world as PRs, journalists, or dealers, let in the men. However,
Sewell was let off the hook since his mother fell ill and he had to cancel
at the last moment.
Until recently it seemed that the Single European Market would come into
being next January leaving the art world in the UK to go its old, sweet,
lightly regulated, way. Countries like Italy and Greece were hardly prepared
to allow the free movement abroad of what's left of their art treasures so
the status quo seemed on the cards.
Now dealers and auction houses are less sanguine. Brussels might be holding
back on an open market but recent EC proposals in other areas could totally
transform the business if they become law. It seems that the French, who
destroyed Paris as an arts centre by bureaucratic controls, are jealous of
the way London dominates the market and wants to cut back its pre-eminence.
The new initiatives up for discussion include the standardisation of VAT on
works of art across Europe; the adoption of the French practice of droite de
suite, which enables artists, and their descendants, to claim a royalty when
a work is sold; the introduction of passports for works of art to combat
smuggling; and the return to the country of origin of works of art illegally
taken, and acquired, abroad. This could cause Sotheby's and Christie's
nightmares in supervision, particularly in sensitive areas like antiquities.
Obviously the single market will in time affect the art world and, in all
probability, the liberal British system will not become the EC norm. There
will be more controls, more taxes. In a timely move Country Life has
produced a report on 1992 and the Art Market in Europe which, for the first
time, brings together information on continental auction houses and the
export law on works of art in the Twelve. It will be a publication much
fingered over by worried dealers and auction house directors in the next few
months.
How fares the art market in '92? There is no reason at all to think that it
will be in any better shape than in 1991, at least for the next few months.
Despite brave talk of an autumn recovery, most dealers are just about
surviving the worst sales patch of their careers.
If there is a revival imminent it might just be apparent by next weekend
through the level of activity at two of the most popular specialist fairs.
On Wednesday The World of Drawings and Watercolours opens at London's Park
Lane Hotel, and Art 92, the London Contemporary Art Fair, is at the Business
Design Centre in Islington from Thursday.
The fairs share popular appeal, in their price range - you can buy something
for as little as Pounds 50 - and because they both attract committed
enthusiasts. The British have always loved watercolours and it remains the
preferred home decoration for many traditionally-inclined collectors,
whereas contemporary art is exercising an ever stronger pull over the young,
inspired perhaps by the high international reputation of some British
artists.
From its start six years ago the Watercolour Fair touched a nerve. It has
attempted, with some success, to limit the space given over to whimsical
Victorian watercolours of cottages and children clutching cats in favour of
18th century watercolours - an under-appreciated and under-valued (ie cheap)
collecting field; contemporary work; and drawings. With 50 dealers, and over
2,000 items on offer, this is the place to cheer yourself up with an
affordable picture.
London's largest Old Master dealer, Richard Green, is showing at Park Lane
for the first time, with a Pounds 200,000 Turner among his offerings, while
Art 92 has lured in the largest 20th century dealer, Leslie Waddington,
whose stand is devoted to the work of the hare-mad Barry Flanagan.
There are two distinctive features at Art 92, a Starter's Corner, aimed at
new collectors, to which most of the 60 dealers taking part have contributed
works priced at under Pounds 250, and a Touch Tour for blind and partially
sighted art lovers.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: A violinist to treasure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN FOR seasoned concert-goers this recital climaxed with a moment to
treasure. Nobody in the audience at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Thursday
could have predicted the unique surprise with which the evening was to end,
though they might have had an informed guess at the quality of the rest,
given that Lydia Mordkovitch has a fine reputation as a recitalist.
With the Wigmore Hall closed for renovation, the administrators of London's
other concert-halls only now seem to be waking up to the dearth of recitals
at the moment. The South Bank is starting a vocal series in the Purcell Room
and the QEH will also host a few more solo events. The problem there is that
a recitalist has to be able to project not only the sound but also the
personality into a far larger hall.
On both counts Lydia Mordkovitch succeeds admirably. Among today's
violinists she is one of the bigger players in terms of her tone quality, a
heart-warming Russian bear-hug of a sound. There is no danger that quiet
playing will sound thin or the loud become strident. A range of warm colours
is always ready to embrace the music, almost too much of a good thing in her
opening Beethoven sonata, where one sensed the full musical personality
biding its time.
With Szymanowski's extravagantly romantic Sonata its time came - a splendid
performance. In this piece the composer is ever turning up the heat to more
ecstatic heights of lyricism. It is easy to imagine some violinists paling
at the thought of being asked to raise their playing one more degree up the
thermometer's passion scale, but Mordkovitch manages to do so and suggest
that she has capacity to spare. She also brought some authority to the
finale, a showy piece of rabble-rousing on Szymanowski's part.
The second half opened with five minutes pause for reflection in
Rakhmaninov's Romance Op. 6 No. 1 (the very special tone quality the
violinist found for this I can only describe as the sound of tears). After
which Mordkovitch and her fine accompanist, Marina Gusak-Grin, closed their
programme with Saint-Saens's First Sonata, Op. 75.
In the lyrical music Mordkovitch carefully corseted her tone to form a
slimmer and more stylish sound, but it is the dexterity of the finale that
suits her best. With the semiquavers racing past, clouds of resin started to
rise in the air. And then, just as the violinist reached the last bar, the
bow flew out of her hand and away over her shoulder, leaving the pianist
aghast to play the final chords.
That is just the sort of player Miss Mordkovitch is - generous, giving the
music unabashedly her all, which is why her recitals are becoming such a
pleasure to attend.

DETECTIVES with wonky or failed marriages are a staple of crime fiction, as
are little old ladies confined to their rooms and glued to their windows. In
Thief Taker (Macmillan Pounds 12.99, 224 pages), second adventure of the
unhappily uxorious DS Macrae and his happily paired sergeant Leopold Silver,
the crafty Alan Scholefield makes good use of both stock elements, turning
them into original and sympathetic characters. There is also a Rendell-style
nutcase, with an even nuttier mother; and a sad girl who works as the sexy
voice on a chatline. Well begun with the previous Dirty Weekend, the
Macrae-Silver series now seems solidly established.
Simon Brett's loser-actor Charles Paris is almost too solidly established.
His perpetual yearning for a double Bells, like his repeated, lacklustre
efforts to recapture his wife's affections are beginning to pall, and even
faithful fans may wish he would shape up, join AA and remarry. Still, his
acting career involves him in some odd and readable complexities. The
latest, Corporate Bodies (Gollancz Pounds 13.99, 189 pages), finds him
playing a minor role in a corporate video but, of course, he is the major
contributor to solving the inevitable crime. Brett, and Charles, have a
tendency to laugh at their own jokes, but, often enough, the reader will
laugh with them.
Kay Mitchell's In Stony Places (Barrie &amp; Jenkins Pounds 12.99, 204 pages) is
also the second in a new series. A solid if not exciting performance in
which the standard ingredients - Chief Inspector forgets his wedding
anniversary, teenage daughter is threatened by a serial killer - are
conventionally handled, but the actual detection process is slyly-paced and
convincing.
Churches, like theatres and boys' schools, are loci classici for murders,
from Edwin Drood's murky cathedral to Miss Marples' deceptively cheery
vicarage. But DM Greenwood writes about ecclesiastic life (and death) from
the inside; and her second novel, Unholy Ghosts (Headline Pounds 13.95, 215
pages), is a knowledgeable account of social and clerical conflict in an
affectionately, tellingly described rural Norfolk. The author's special
viewpoint, devout but also wryly detached, gives the novel an unusual and
welcome tang, which should last through the other volumes that will
obviously continue this series.
Ellis Peters, in The House of Green Turf (Macdonald Pounds 12.95, 192
pages), writes not about her endearing and happily enduring Brother Cadfael,
but about her other protagonist, Inspector Felse. Clearly the author is more
at home in the Middle Ages than in the present, and this volume is just
about impossible to read to the end. Also, if you decide to write about an
opera singer, you should know that Cherubini is not a character in Figaro
but the composer of Medea.

GOD'S POLITICIAN: JOHN PAUL AT THE VATICAN by David Willey Faber &amp; Faber
Pounds 14.99, 258 pages
IF ANY single individual can claim to have done most to undermine the Soviet
Communist Empire, that person is Karol Wojtyla, better known as Pope John
Paul II. Unbelievers may scoff at the notion that the Holy Spirit guided the
cardinals to choose the relatively unknown Archbishop of Krakow to be
successor to Peter and John Paul I; if not, it was surely an act of devilish
political cunning by the princes of the Roman Church to choose a Polish
Pope.
His determination to revisit his homeland, his support for Lech Walesa and
Solidarity - apart from one tactical retreat in 1983 - helped bring down
Jaruzelski and install Walesa as Poland's president. Indeed, David Willey
reports that at a 1983 mass at Warsaw football stadium John Paul behaved
'more like the King of Poland than the Vicar of Christ and Bishop of Rome.'
Poland was the key example to the rest of the erstwhile Soviet empire.
In the Soviet Union itself, there were manifold pressures on Mikhail
Gorbachev. The pope, with no battalions and only a small minority of
followers, used his moral authority and the diplomatic clout of the Holy See
to good effect to appeal to the better nature of the Soviet leader in the
constant crises of the 1980s.
Through his travels to every continent and to more than 80 countries, John
Paul II has made the church more visible than ever before. Through his
encyclical letters, notably the 1988 Sollicitudo Rei Socialis, dealing with
capitalism and communism, he has reminded the world that, though capitalism
today seems triumphant, our civilisation still has to demonstrate that it
can provide for the poor of the world.
Not everyone applauds. Inside the Catholic Church itself the pope's critics
are legion, accusing him of an autocratic style of rule that has destroyed
the hopes of collegiality of the Second Vatican Council and has imposed a
narrow Slav view of the world on a global church of 900m believers. Willey
himself admits his doubts: 'My faith in God is intact, but my allegiance to
the Roman Church has been suspended while I examine this brief Polish
interlude in its long history.'
The author's knowledge of Rome, as the BBC correspondent there, and of the
often devious and Machiavellian ways of the Vatican give him a good vantage
point. He has supplemented this by observations collected in accompanying
the pope on his travels. The book is packed with fascinating facts from the
'Trivial Pursuit' type - like when a pope first started to wear white
garments - to more substantial points, like the decline in recruitment to
the priesthood.
His chapters on the population explosion and on the poor state of the
church's finances raise important awkward questions which the pope,
sheltered from the grubby real world by his bullet-proof Popemobile, has
refused to face squarely and honestly.
But the size and very variety of the Catholic world means that Willey treats
many issues, notably the church in the Third World and the church and Islam,
skimpily. The book is also spoilt by its poor organisation. It bears the
marks of being edited by too many pairs of hands, so that it is heavy-going
through the Soviet pages, which should have been its keynote.
All this means that, when the definitive biography of John Paul II is
written, Willey's work will be an important reference source; it falls a
long way short of being the seminal work on the pope.

DESERT SHIELD TO DESERT STORM: THE SECOND GULF WAR by Dilip Hiro
HarperCollins Pounds 25/Pounds 9.99, 590 pages
IN THE middle of the 1990-1 Gulf Crisis I had the dubious pleasure of
listening to an established moral philosopher expatiate on 'the eternal
righteousness of giving Saddam Hussein a bloodied nose'.
Other people were making similar noises, reflecting a general unwillingness
to comprehend the realities that govern the Middle East: a series of
artificial boundaries created, largely by Britain, with scant regard for
either cultural or tribal homogenity, in the wake of the dissolution of the
Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War. Without its vast but
unequally distributed oil reserves, and without the further creation of
Israel after the second war, carved out of Palestine, the Arab Middle East
might by now have set its house in order. As it is the oil has guaranteed
continued interference by outside powers.
The spectre that haunts the West is a coalescence of 'local' interests that
would establish autonomous control of oil flow and oil prices. To this
outcome there are two possible avenues: Pan-Arab nationalism, and Islamic
solidarity. Both are fraught with difficulties. The first runs counter to
the entrenched interests of the seven royal families who between them rule
the Gulf, and who have invested their wealth in the West. The second must
also cope with religious differences within the Moslem world, notably
Shia/Sunni sectarian rivalry.
These cross-currents form both the background and theme of Dilip Hiro's
admirable account of the Gulf War, or, as he most properly calls it, the
Second Gulf War: Desert Shield to Desert Storm. While Hiro by no means
attempts to whitewash Saddam Hussein, he does show that, for all his
cut-throat megalomania, the Iraqi leader deserves to be considered as much
the product as a would-be controller of the forces of his times. Conversely,
Hiro also allows the rape of Kuwait to expose the rapacity of western
intentions and the hollowness of George Bush's New World Order.
The first Gulf War was fought between Iraq and Iran, where Ayatollah
Khomeini's Islamic fundamentalist revolution produced precisely the kind of
seismic phenomenon dreaded by the West. In tackling Iran, Saddam was
supported by many of those Gulf states, including Kuwait, which later joined
the anti-Iraq alliance masterminded by Washington. Indeed, during the period
1984-8, the US itself increasingly supplied Saddam, then perceived by the
State Department as a stabilising factor, with arms and economic aid.
The motives for Saddam's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990 were hybrid. The
immediate pretext was Kuwait's collusion with the Saudis in depressing oil
prices, thus reducing Iraq's revenues. But Saddam also promulgated other
reasons, among them the venality of the al Sabah emirate, and its dependence
on America, ultimately perceived as part of an 'imperialist-Zionist plot' to
control the Middle East.
How much of this was conviction, and how much the opportunist rhetoric of a
natural bellicosity, is arguable. Where Saddam came unstuck was in his
misreading of international affairs. He underestimated the will of the
western powers to defend their material interests, and overestimated the
will of a crumbling USSR to take a stand against Washington. He also failed
to force Israel into the ensuing conflict - an event which would certainly
have spoiled the US-led alliance.
At the end of the war Bush, media-awkward wimp turned media-slick crusader,
exceeded his UN mandate by directing Schwarzkopf to inflict punishment on
Iraq's retreating divisions. This included an awful slaughter at Mitla
Ridge. And it emerges that he was only dissuaded from destroying Iraq as a
political entity by his Arab allies' apprehensions of the benefits that
might accrue to Iran in the resultant turmoil. A crippled Saddam was
preferable to no Saddam.
Desert Shield to Desert Storm tells the story as it should be told, from all
sides without prejudice. Hiro writes dispassionately, methodically,
painstakingly, accumulatively. He neither trades nor pulls punches, but
constantly underlines the specificity of any given viewpoint. For these
reasons his book deserves to be regarded as the first good serious study of
its subject, though it needs be said that Hiro's interests are primarily
political rather than military. While the air-war is handled skilfully and
in some detail, the land-war is dealt with perfunctorily. Hiro also fails to
address the question of Saddam's non-use of his chemical weapons, although
in the light of the 700 American nuclear warheads in situ and Washington's
determination to avoid any repeat of its Vietnam ignominy, the answer is
perhaps clear enough. It was Saddam's restraint, not just Israel's, that
averted an absolute holocaust.

TOBACCO: A HISTORY by VG Kiernan Hutchinson Radius Pounds 18.99, 250 pages
DURING late Roman times, Boethius wrote his celebrated Consolations of
Philosophy; a millennium-and-a-half on, the Scottish historian, VG Kiernan,
has written a stimulating, amusing account of the consolations of tobacco,
that palliative for our more troubled times.
Tobacco was unknown outside the Americas until five centuries ago and it was
Sir Walter Raleigh who was said to have popularised its introduction to
these shores, smoking stoically as he witnessed the execution of Essex in
1601. The Indians of the Americas regarded smoking as a form of prayer; the
mild intoxication that the drug induced brought one to the very threshold of
the divine and - pipe-sharing being common amongst them - also served to
promote a sense of primitive bondage.
By the 18th century, snuff-taking had temporarily supplanted tobacco in
popularity. According to our author, this quaint practice of drawing snuff
up into the nasal passages lent itself to niceties of deportment; one
contemporary writer even prescribed 14 separate movements of the hand,
wrist, arm and nose. As further evidence of its popularity, the author cites
Marie Antoinette, whose corbeille of wedding presents was said to have
contained no fewer than 52 snuff boxes. And perhaps the fact that George
III's consort was nicknamed 'Snuffy Charlotte' was more than the mere insult
that it appears to be.
By the time of the Napoleonic Wars, cigarettes had come into circulation,
but they were long viewed with suspicion. One popular writer had a
tellingly-simple explanation for the German victories of 1870: the
philosophical Germans smoked pipes, the effeminate French their filthy
little cigarettes.
It is perhaps fighting men who owe their greatest debt to tobacco. Peter the
Great, Frederick the Great, Napoleon; all these heroes smoked furiously as
they fought and plotted. As the Sudan gradually fell into the hands of the
Mahdi, Gordon, governor-general of Khartoum, stuff of schoolboy legend,
'chain-smoked fat cigarettes, rolled by a cavasse, standing behind his chair
with one ready to slip between his fingers when he silently held up a hand
for it.' Like many another man of action, Gordon smoked much and ate little.
Of Napoleon, too, it was said by a contemporary: 'beaucoup de tabac,
beaucoup de cafe.' And during the 1914-18 War the British public subscribed
enough money to provide the men at the front with 232,599,191 cigarettes.
This fact is almost as remarkable as the survival of this ridiculous
statistic.
But many writers, too, have insisted that there is a link between smoking
and creative exertions. Bertolt Brecht advocated a 'smoking theatre' on the
grounds that an audience could be got to think if it were allowed to smoke.
Tennyson smoked and drank heavily throughout his long life and believed that
his finest poetical moments were experienced when that massive, grey head
was wreathed in impenetrable spumes of smoke. Anthony Trollop wrote in his
autobiography that 'it has been the companionship of smoking that I have
loved rather than the habit.'
But tobacco has had as many detractors as champions. James I was a fanatical
opponent of the habit and prelates down the ages have regarded smoking as a
peril to health and morals. It is, of course, the poor who have sought most
consolation in tobacco; anything that might help to soothe the ills that
their fellow men have heaped upon their heads. Perhaps tobacco barons are
acting philanthropically when they off-load cigarettes by the million upon
the poor of the Third World.

SIGNS OF THE TIMES: DECONSTRUCTION AND THE FALL OF MAN by David Lehman Andre
Deutsch Pounds 19.99, 318 pages
SIGNS OF the Times is the title of an essay by Thomas Carlyle which David
Lehman has appropriated for his attack on Deconstruction in general and Paul
de Man in particular. One of the 'Signs of the Times' which worried Carlyle
was the rise of what he called 'theory' and the decline of 'wonder'.
For 'theory' substitute 'Deconstruction' which means, literally, what it
says, ie the critical act of taking apart or dismantling a text or cultural
phenomenon - what we used to call 'analysis'.
Why then is Deconstruction so admired by some and feared by others? Because
the assumptions underlying this kind of analysis are totally different from
those of the critics we admired in the past - for example, IA Richards, FR
Leavis, Cleanth Brooks and Lionel Trilling. They believed that a literary
text had meaning in relation to life as we know it and that one piece of
literature could be more valuable than another. Deconstructionists believe
no such thing.
Though it has become so fashionable in the US, Deconstruction is a French
phenomenon. Its fundamental iconoclasm goes back to the literary revolution
of 'Ubu Roi' and 'Dada'. Existentialism was part of this same general
movement, the last manifestation of which was the upheaval of the 1960s when
French students manned the barricades and French thinkers drew on the
linguistic theories of Saussure and the anthropological studies of
Levi-Strauss to formulate the doctrine of Structuralism.
Roland Barthes and others maintained that the ideas within a particular text
or 'structure' - sometimes called 'pictures' or 'signifiers' - had relevance
only to other signifiers. Reference to a 'meaning' outside the text or to
someone laughingly called 'the author' was old-fashioned and 'humanistic'.
Post-structuralism and its latest manifestation 'Deconstruction' took these
ideas a stage further. For the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and the
philosopher Jacques Derrida the reading of a text was a purely subjective,
rhetorical act. Allowing the 'free play' of signifiers implied that the
critic could assert that a piece of literature meant anything he liked - a
heady prospect indeed.
In Britain, Deconstruction has not yet got the hold it has in America,
except for the example of Christopher Norris who, as Frank Kermode pointed
out, has never shown the slightest interest in literature unless it could be
fitted in to a philosophical or political argument. Kermode should know. He
used to hold a special seminar on the new French ideas at University
College, London, in the 1960s and when he was Regius Professor ar Cambridge
bravely defended McCabe against the Fogies. But he eventually became
disenchanted, as his current writings show. Geoffrey Hartman,
Deconstruction's most influential proselytiser at Yale, scathingly refers to
Kermode as a 'public critic', whereas he sees himself as a 'learned
specialist'.
Just so. Hartman, J. Hillis Miller and, until 1983, Paul de Man, have been
kings of the castle at Yale, sending shock waves through other universities,
and pouring out reams of jargon-filled prose which graduate students in
search of jobs struggle to understand.
Imagine the consternation, therefore, when in 1987, four years after de
Man's death, a Belgian researcher discovered in the archives of Le Soir 180
articles written for the paper when it was under German direction during the
Second World War. And who, pray, you may ask, was Paul de Man that he should
cause such a furore? De Man was a young Belgian intellectual who emigrated
to the US after the war. While a teacher at Bard College he married
(bigamously) one of his students. The extraordinary ability shown in his
writing got him a place in the Society of Fellows at Harvard and he ended up
as Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale. In his day he was far more
influential than Hartman, for he had not only a powerful intellect but also
something of the elegance of Derrida.
David Lehman is right to sound the alarm, but it would have been more
helpful to play down the caddishness and perfidy of de Man and concentrate
on the main issue. The fact is that a number of influential academics in
America have propounded theories which are being used by activists to
further the cause of 'political correctness'. But there is worse.
Indifferent to literary values themselves, there are many who maintain that
any old piece of rubbish is as valid as great art because a lot of people
prefer the rubbish. In the past dedicated teachers tried to open the eyes of
those who had little or no awareness of the nobility of literature. They
believed, with William Faulkner, that at its best literature helped man
endure by reminding him of 'the courage and honour and hope and pride and
compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past'.
Tocqueville warned us not to let democracy debase cultural standards and
Julien Benda spoke of la trahison des clercs. Neither could have had any
idea of the seriousness of the problem we are now facing.

THE LIVES OF ELSA TRIOLET by Lachlan Mackinnon Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18,
216 page
IN THE middle of the Second World War there appeared in Occupied France a
slim volume, Le Creve Coeur, containing a collection of poems by Louis
Aragon, a one-time surrealist who had joined the French Communist Party. The
poems had been written on active service, and several reflected the mood of
the phoney war in France. A companion volume was called Les Yeux d'Elsa; in
his dedication the poet greeted the Elsa of the title as 'chaque battement
de mon coeur'. Aragon fought in the first war as well as the second, in
which he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his command of a medical unit
in 1940.
The two books were published over here in 1944 under an imprint called La
France Libre. In an England starved of contemporary French writing, they
enjoyed rapid currency and for the remainder of the war Aragon became a
cult-figure among the literati.
Aragon was also a prolific novelist, author of a fiction-cycle Le Monde
reel. As a prominent member of the PCF he had visited Russia before the war,
and edited the party's evening newspaper Ce Soir. After the Fall of France
Aragon became active in the Resistance under a number of code-names, working
especially on the literary front, while continuing to write and publish.
Aragon's part in the bloody purges of those who had collaborated with the
Nazis, which occurred immediately after the Liberation, remains a matter of
controversy. Jean Cocteau said he owed his life to Aragon and Eluard during
that horrendous time.
In spite of the passion inspired by his love for Elsa, expressed in limpid
lyric poetry that reads well even today, Aragon had a 'homoerotic' side to
him that has emerged in recent studies. He seems in his surrealist days to
have loved Andre Breton and later Drieu La Rochelle, the collaborator and
writer-editor who committed suicide after the war.
Despite a rather messy private life, Aragon always remained devoted to Elsa,
whom he married in 1939 after her divorce from her first husband. Aragon
continued to write poetry celebrating her long after the war was over, even
after her death in 1970. Le Fou d'Elsa appeared in 1963 and Il ne m'est
Paris que d'Elsa in 1975.
But who was Elsa? And who for that matter was Louis Aragon? These questions
are fascinating but, as Lachlan Mackinnon's The Lives of Elsa Triolet
interestingly demonstrates, they are not at all easy to answer. It is not
merely that Elsa and Aragon assumed false names and identities for the
purpose of wartime undercover activity. It is much deeper than that. The
process of self-realisation in the 1920s and 1930s was one of deepening
political engagement as the betrayal of appeasement became plain to them.
Writing articles and fiction was combined with frequent sexual adventures on
both sides. They made some violent shifts of gear and fundamental
refashionings of their personalities. Mackinnon tracks these two ferocious
leopards to their lairs and from time to time catches them changing their
spots.
Both suffered identity crises in their youth. As a child Aragon had been
brought up by three older so-called sisters. He was told one day that the
oldest was in fact his unmarried mother and that his godfather and tutor was
his father. Elsa was born Ella Alexandrovitch Kagan in 1896 in Moscow, the
younger of two daughters of a Lithuanian-born Jewish lawyer and his musical
wife. The story of this assimilated progressive Russian Jewish family's life
up to the First World War, with its two beautiful nubile daughters
attracting the attentions of a group of futurist artists and poets,
including Mayakovsky, is a crowded and happy one.
After their father's death the Kagan clan scattered. Ella's first marriage
to Triolet, a well-to-do French dandy and Lothario, took her briefly to
Tahiti to live. It was after she returned from there that Gorky, who had
read some letters she had written about the island, told her she should
become a writer.
At that moment Ella Kagan disappears and Elsa Triolet was born, living among
Dadaists and Surrealists in a Left Bank hotel in Paris. In her subsequent
relations with Aragon, already established in literature, her literary
ambitions were at first entirely subordinate to his. She made jewellery to
earn some money and wrote a novel Colliers which was only published after
her death. Like Beckett she decided to write from now on in French and
produced a self-revelatory novel Fraises-des-Bois (Wild Strawberry was her
nickname as a girl).
In 1930 she accompanied Aragon to the Writers' Congress in Kharkov. He was
welcomed in the Soviet Union as a celebrity and signed a document
repudiating Surrealism and his former colleagues - this was his most
shameful moment - while Elsa became thereafter a fellow traveller in more
senses than one.
Then her transformation began - first as a wartime icon in his verse, a
metaphor of separation; then as a novelist herself who in 1945 was awarded
the Prix Goncourt for Le Cheval Blanc. Little of her work has appeared in
English. Mackinnon finds it, at its autobiographical best, most deserving of
our attention. He compares the wartime and post-war fortunes of Elsa and
Aragon with those of Sartre and De Beauvoir. Why did the younger couple
achieve such wide international fame while Aragon and Elsa dwindled outside
France into obscurity?
He has no simple answer but points out that the more famous pair of writers
remained in Paris during the Occupation and to an extent difficult now to
determine played along with the regime. Aragon and Elsa were living mainly
in the south in Nice and Lyon, doing dangerous work, and they had no
ready-made Existentialism to market after the war. They were also, it must
be said, less gifted. This provocative comparison is one of many such to
emerge from a stimulating, sparely written biography of a woman whose
extraordinary life may be seen to summarise much contemporary history.

tower, Robin Lane Fox observes a sparkling display of cold-season blooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE in the middle of an extraordinary flowering which some of you may not
have noticed. This weekend, you have a chance to notice it, pleasurably.
Naturally, it has not escaped my ivory tower: how, indeed, could it?
Historians in ivory towers are so wonderfully broad-minded. They rise above
petty differences, the world is their horizon, and they look to and fro
behind the misty clouds of everyday life.
Or so it should be; but it is not because of these fine ideals that I have
noticed what is going on. The reason is that my view of it is very narrow.
Through two small windows of academic proportions, I look out on a cloud of
cherry blossom in January. Even a genius would probably not miss it but,
through these particular windows, it appears in an unintended light.
They are set in dark, damaged panelling which was stripped by two kind souls
last year in return for a modest bribe. After stripping it, they said they
ought to preserve it. This sounded sensible but took me by surprise when I
found they had painted it with a coat of transparent gloss. As a result, the
world outside is reflected in a mirror of dark, stained walls which gleam
like burnt toffee just removed from an oven.
Through these two toffee-brown mirrors, I keep up with the news of the
world. Empires collapse and so do heads of state at smart dinners. I see it
all, along with these clouds of blossom which hang on the air as if some
gentle person is breathing into a cold morning. From the front line, I can
report that it is a fabulous year for winter-flowering plants and that
winter-flowering cherry is having the time of its life.
Perhaps you mistrust the breadth of my narrow view: if so, you can verify it
today and tomorrow by a special trip to Hampshire. At Ampfield, near Romsey,
the Hillier Arboretum is marking the mild weather with a special weekend for
visitors.
The arboretum leaves happy memories in crazy weather. I will never forget a
strange day in March 1989 when the garden's gold magnolias beamed happily in
the sunshine before an audience of myself and some canny old-age pensioners.
Unless there has been a sudden frost in the small hours, you have a good
chance of an experience that will be just as memorable. The garden will be
open to visitors from 10.30 until dusk, charging Pounds 2 for admission.
Visitors ought to see why the winter-flowering cherry, Prunus subhirtella
autumnalis, remains my first choice among flowering trees for the garden,
the Glaxo of tree-planters during my adult lifetime. It will fit into front
gardens of modest size and it is a wonderful performer from an early age,
giving you quantities of buds which can be brought indoors.
This year, the sweet scent of the sarcoccas is all around; the viburnums are
fantastic, especially the white bodnamtense and its pink variant, Dawn,
which are showing more heads of peppery-sweet flowers than I can remember.
The winter suite is flowering crazily with that wonderful scent on those
pale yellow petals which look as if they, too, have been treated with
transparent gloss; while in one of its long borders, Hilliers has a
Himalayan honeysuckle, Lonicera setifera, which I have never seen before. It
also has bewitching witch hazels and some daphnes which need serious study.
In the family of witch hazels, I know what I like: my favourite is the pale
lemon-yellow form called pallida, but I suppose that this certainty needs to
be checked. Modern breeders have introduced shades of red, orange and copper
into the witch hazel's petals and my immediate response is to dislike all of
them when I see them on young plants.
They might, perhaps, look prettier at maturity but it takes so long for a
witch hazel to develop that I would not take the risk without hard evidence.
This weekend, hard evidence is available in the arboretum where some of
these hybrids have now grown into decent little trees and you can decide if
you really like a red variety called Diane or a copper-orange one called
Jelena. I much prefer the pale yellow, but all of them are scented
charmingly on a mild afternoon.
The winter-flowering daphnes will also be worth visiting. Some of them are
European natives but there are also some taller, pale-flowered varieties
which have a heavenly scent and are at home from India eastwards through
Katmandu to China.
Daphne bholua is the most tantalising and in the arboretum you will,
perhaps, see why daphne-fanciers have been excited. In Britain, the ordinary
form was never very hardy or free-flowering.
Instead, we needed to look for a named variety which had been collected by
keen botanists or found by sharp-eyed army colonels at a height in the
mountains where hardiness is more certain.
One of the best is a pink-flowered form called Gurkha, which was found by an
alert major in the field. The arboretum also has Jaqueline Postill, a deep
pink daphne which I have always envied but never pleased on a stony lime
soil.
The Cotswolds are not exactly Katmandu and witch hazels also dislike my part
of the country. Hence, the pleasure of a visit.
Go and see what you cannot grow, enjoying the second-hand gardening which
has always been a national pastime. Gardening, too, is a spectator sport and
there are certain things which are much too rare to be seen from a narrow
window.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Gardening: The unpredictable primrose - Arthur Hellyer finds
that there is more to a common flower than meets the eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT ONE time, I thought of primroses and polyanthuses as simple flowers which
did predictable things; but that is no longer completely true. These plants
have been cross-bred so much, and so many fine hybrids have been produced,
that a good many ifs and buts have crept into their cultivation and even
their naming.
Basically, the difference between a primrose and a polyanthus is that the
first has just one flower per stem and the second a cluster. . This could
mean a greater number of flowers per plant - although not necessarily since
there are some extremely prolific primroses.
Some varieties make a habit of producing both types of flower and seem
capable of passing from one to the other style during a season.
One theory is that they do this in response to stress, producing only the
multi-flowered stems when things are going well and reverting to the typical
primrose flowering when conditions get tough, perhaps because of lack of
food or moisture. I find this highly probable.
These days, it is customary to have primroses and polyanthuses on sale in
full flower in pots throughout the winter, but very few seed catalogues
suggest that home gardeners should grow them for November or December
flowering. February is about the earliest date recommended, with March to
May the generally-stated flowering period. This certainly is right outdoors
but seems a little unambitious under glass.
I used to think that the commercial growers of pot plants gave their
polyanthus or primrose plants special chemical treatment to bring them into
flower early, but I am assured that this is not so. They are too cheap a
plant for such expense, and they are simply grown in successive batches,
mostly in polythene houses, with little or no artificial heat until they are
wanted for market. At this stage, they are moved to a slightly higher
temperature.
I am also told that commercial growers use some varieties for which seed is
not available regularly for the home market - not because there is any
embargo but because few of the retail seedsmen have thought it worthwhile to
market it.
Saga and Eve are two such varieties that are very popular with trade
growers, and one way to get hold of them is to buy plants in garden centres
or florists' shops and either grow them on or save seed from them. There are
hazards in this, though; first, that these super-varieties are not reliable
perennials and tend to die after a year or so; second, that they are hybrids
which need to be recreated each generation from parents that are not
themselves ever distributed. There is, in effect, a built-in copyright on
them.
Many of these new primrose and polyanthus varieties are not so winter-hardy
as the old ones, mainly because much of the early breeding was done in New
Zealand and California, where the climate did not put the seedlings on trial
under any stress from cold winters.
So, undesirable characteristics - for Britain's colder climate, at any rate
 -crept in and have not been eliminated completely, although some efforts
have been, and still are being, made to do so. But the new polyanthus
Crescendo Mix is said to be completely reliable in British gardens under
average conditions, and it certainly does produce high-quality flowers in a
fine range of clear colours.
Primrose and polyanthus plants also can be affected adversely by heat and
the seed actually becomes dormant in temperatures above 21C (70F). This is
why many gardeners have difficulty in germinating it, since they sow in
heated propagators that can run well above this maximum. The ideal for which
to aim is 15-20C (60-68F).
The seed also needs light for germination, so should be sown on the surface
of the seed compost and covered with a light sprinkling of sifted compost
only when it can be seen to be sprouting. Also, there are chemicals present
naturally in the seeds that prevent germination until they have been leached
out by water, so the compost must be kept adequately moist.
Seed can be sown from March to May but the later sowing is left, the harder
it gets to keep the temperature down. It can also be sown early in autumn so
the seedlings can over-winter in a frame or unheated greenhouse before being
planted out the following spring.
Primroses and polyanthuses do not like high temperatures or a dry
atmosphere; because of this, they do not make very good house plants. They
are much more satisfactory in an unheated or very slightly heated
conservatory or on a veranda.
Many varieties are completely hardy and can be grown outdoors in beds,
borders and rock gardens. But there are exceptions, and it is probable that
those bought now in flower will be of this more tender type.
Strictly speaking, all are perennials; but there is a considerable
difference in their longevity and there is some correlation between size of
flower and the length of time a variety will survive. Very large-flowered
polyanthus types are apt to behave as biennials, blooming in the second year
and then fading away.
It is, however, always worthwhile to give them a chance to grow on. Vigour
can be maintained by splitting up the old plants into several pieces, each
with roots attached, and replanting in fairly rich, rather moist soil in a
semi-shady place. This should be done early in June. Some at least are
likely to make sturdy plants that will flower again the following year.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week -(Hamamellis Mollis Pallida)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a variety of the Chinese witch hazel, one of the best of a small
genus of winter flowering deciduous shrubs. It starts to flower in December
and continues for many weeks as it is quite hardy, even the apparently
fragile flowers being undamaged by frost.
It differs from ordinary Hamamellis Mollis in having paler yellow, larger
flowers which make a better display. Both have a sweet scent which is
carried for a considerable distance on a still mild day. Like other species
of witch hazel it dislikes lime in the soil but is happy in neutral or
moderately acid soils not liable to dry out severely in summer. It makes a
big shrub which looks superficially like a hazel and the foliage colours
well before it falls in the autumn.
Some thinning of stems can be done in spring but care should be taken to
preserve the natural rather widely-branched character of the shrub.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Property: Positive vetting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS A few years since one of the 96 chambers at the Albany in London came
on to the open market. In offering the 'freehold' on one seven-room
apartment in the buildings, Richard Crosthwaite of the Mayfair office of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) explains that it is an executors' sale.
Otherwise, outsiders would be unlikely to hear of it.
'There is a strong tradition of owners making private arrangements,
assigning leases, renting apartments; keeping it in the family wherever
possible,' says Crosthwaite.
Albany, lying behind private courtyards off Piccadilly and Savile Row, has
strong claim to be the most exclusive of London's apartment blocks.
Historically, the main house on Piccadilly dates from 1774 when it was
completed, to Sir William Chambers' designs, for the first Viscount
Melbourne. It was not until 1802 that the building was converted into
bachelor apartments, and substantially extended at the back on each side of
the garden.
Two centuries on, and the Albany's residents' lists groan with the weight of
the Great and the Good, ranging wide across the talents. Gladstone and
Graham Green, Dame Edith Evans and Aldous Huxley, Sir Thomas Beecham and JB
Priestley have, at various times, enjoyed the quiet of what Crosthwaite
describes as 'a very club-like atmosphere.'
A freehold asking price of Pounds 475,000 for 'Set E5', on the second and
third floors of one of the rear garden buildings, does not look too
demanding given the rarity of the sale. Servants' and storage space on floor
three have been converted into a dining room and kitchen, leaving a drawing
room, master bedroom and bathroom plus a potential second bedroom or
dressing room on the lower floor.
It may take more than money to buy at Albany. As in a New York condominium,
residents' trustees have to vet and approve the purchaser. Even then they
have to accept rules accumulated since the Regency, including no resident
children under 13 and no pets. The current estate charge is Pounds 2,994 a
year.
The freehold rights of individual apartment owners predate Commonhold by two
centuries. The system applied here, of a freehold and a parallel Deed of
Covenant committing purchasers to the usual common costs of a multi-occupied
block, clearly works with occupier-selection of prospective new residents.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Property: Better to sit than to squat - John Brennan looks
at two special aspects of 'the housing problem'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WELL-WORN but still potent homeowners' nightmare is a return from holiday
to find that squatters have got there first.
Even rumours of such cases provoke generous publicity. There is no news as
gripping as a story about families locked out of their own homes, their
sympathetic but legally impotent local police looking on.
The other side of this story - an estimated 50,000 homeless people squatting
within the law in otherwise disused and part-derelict properties - has no
such headline appeal.
In practice, when you try to put the two sides of this story together, the
distance between the popular myth and the truth about squatting is far
enough to show that they have precious little in common. One side of the
story is revealed as a classic middle class terror backed by few real real
problems. The other remains a tragic but straightforward consequence of the
housing crisis - and its image is not helped by the myth-making.
As far as the myth of widespread home-squatting dramas is concerned,
examples of hi-jacking temporarily vacant private homes are rare. The
practice was formally made illegal under section seven of the Criminal Law
Act 1977: a provision which has hardly ever had to be applied.
So the police are not legally impotent in such situations, and squatters
rarely form queues for houses vacated by families on holiday. What helps to
give the idea its powerful horror is that it is regularly refuelled by
commercial organisations with an interest in making homeowners aware of
every extra risk, no matter how remote.
Naturally, even the best-promoted worries need occasional hard evidence to
justify them. Real homeowner/squatter clashes are, therefore, meticulously
recorded.
One example is Christopher Cox and his family, of Ryde on the Isle of Wight,
whose experience is enough to confirm all an owner's worst fears. Cox found
squatters in his flat when he returned from holiday. It took him eight
weeks, and an outlay of Pounds 2,000 in legal costs, to get back into his
home - reputedly after he had refused to pay Pounds 1,000 demanded by the
squatters in return for a promise to leave.
The Cox case gives excellent reason to review what is likely to be limited
'household legal expenses' insurance cover. It follows, too, that such a
case adds much to an insurance brokers' sales pitch.
But equally, sorting out the ambiguities that can come to light in household
insurance cover in the event of a squatting incident justifies a close look
at existing home policies. By no means all household policies have a
consistent policy on squatting. Squatting problems are such a rarity that
insurers rarely include reference to them in a policy's explanatory notes.
The Cox case, along with recent well-publicised instances of squatters
taking over and damaging large, unsold and vacant houses, sends shivers down
the spines of owners with potential target homes (thereby helping to sell
more insurance). What these examples do not do is create proper evidence of
any shift of squatting activity which might add to the existing minimal
threat to owner-occupiers.
SQUASH - Squatters' Action for Secure Homes (c/o 2 St Paul's Road, London,
N1) - has been formed by existing squatting organisations to challenge the
UK government's current consultation paper on the criminalisation of
squatting.
SQUASH members' arguments boil down to the hard-to-dispute thesis that
homelessness, not squatting, is 'the problem.'
A survey of SQUASH member agencies reveals that, far from the notion that
gangs of brigands are terrorising the holiday-making classes, the largest
group of squatters is made up of single people on low (or no) salaries,
needing to stay near actual (or potential) jobs. Such people - low-paid
workers living in squatted properties - include public service employees,
transport staff, nurses, and catering staff.
Families with children - some of them former owner-occupiers unable to keep
up mortgage payments - form the next largest group. Evidence accumulated
from calls received by the SQUASH agencies suggests that as many as one
third of squatters in London may now fall into this category. The effect has
been to raise the age of the adult squatting population.
Of course this kind of sampling means that reviews of squatting activity
must be rough and ready. Nevertheless, London squat figures drawn from many
directions indicate that over 90 per cent of squatters go no further than
into unused public sector property. This does not match the home-owner's
terror of a readily mobile army of house-takers or flat-wreckers. (Not that
this helps to improve the image of squatting - an almost universally
negative one.)
The occasional squatting scare does no harm for one company, which gets paid
to put strangers into empty houses. Homesitters Limited (Aylesbury,
Buckinghamshire, tel: 0296.630730) has completed 9,000 home-sits over the
past 11 years.
The company aimed initially at establishing a regular client base of private
owners who were keen to have their houses attended to, and pets fed, while
they were away. That remains a core activity. But the business now also
includes commercial work for estate agents, dealing with unoccupied
re-possessed properties, and for the owners of larger unsold properties,
where regular occupation can deter vandals.
The 'homesitters' entrusted with these jobs are, for the most part, retired
people. Their minimum age is 40, their maximum 68. Within that range there
are plenty of active, experienced homeowners who can safely be left in
charge of another owner's home.
'All of our homesitters are asked for three references, and all three are
taken up,' says Adele Barclay, a director of Homesitters. The vetting is
critical for both sides. From the beginning, the company has employed all
its registered homesitters directly, rather than on a casual basis. That
adds up to 440 sitters (plus partner, usually) available to house-sit for a
few weeks, or months.
'It obviously depends on their availability,' Adele Barclay says, 'but we
would normally say that each homesitter might expect four to six house sits
each year, averaging two weeks, so they might expect to be out for eight to
12 weeks each year.'
Two weeks is an average homesit, but the company does run to long-term
sittings: the longest so far has been a 32-month occupation of a property
awaiting probate clearance. (In that case, successive teams of homesitters
had to be used, to make up the time.) Other commercial jobs can include
'sitting' in - or, rather, by - part-finished or otherwise uninhabitable
houses. In those cases the company can offer a sitter with a caravan.
As a standard rule, homesitters must not leave the home in their charge
unoccupied for more than three hours in daylight and an hour at dark. But
owners can stipulate 24 hour cover if they want. If a sitter cannot complete
an assignment, if he or she becomes ill, or has to go home for whatever
reason, the company provides immediate cover.
So far as private sittings are concerned, wherever possible homesitters meet
the owners first - to see if they get on all right, and to learn any quirks
of a house. Much of the company's repeat business is from owners having the
same sitters look after their home each year; so it is of value that an
owner is comfortable with the choice of sitter. It is also critical that
arrangements are made for any pets.
Over the years there has evolved a distinct price scale for looking after
pets. 'Children's household pets - stick insects, fish, gerbils and
such-like - we wouldn't normally make any extra charge for,' says Barclay.
But cats cost 65 pence a day, and a small dog would be Pounds 1.70. Bigger
animals are a matter for discussion.
As for the cost of the sitting itself: owners pay an initial one-off
registration fee of Pounds 25.00, and reimburse homesitters for travelling
costs if they visit the premises at the outset. After that, costs are Pounds
15.50 a day plus basic food and travel costs for the sitter. If - as is
likely - the registered sitter brings his or her partner, there is no extra
expense for the owner, either in fees or expenses.

Kings Farm, above, nestled in the village of Lower Wield, in Hampshire,
southern England, has the classic triple combination of rural seclusion,
comparatively easy access to London (the property is nine miles from
Basingstoke, with a regular 45-minute rail service to the capital) and

FT  18 JAN 92 / Switch off, in silence: Kieran Cooke recharges his spiritual
batteries during a retreat at a Benedictine monestary in Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANTING of the monks washed through the church, a mesmerising, hypnotic
melody, waves of sound falling, lapping, withdrawing and returning. My feet,
at 6.30am, were blocks of ice. Thermal underwear could not keep out the
chill.
The abbot said the final prayer. The novice collected stray missals and
extinguished the candles. In silence we all withdrew.
Some go to Indian ashrams. Some lock themselves in Highland cottages. Some
visit Outward Bound schools. Others, more simply satisfied, light the fire,
uncork the claret, puff a Cuban, put the feet up - and stare into space.
It is called switching off, a time to let the mind wander, a time to reflect
 -what a philosopher friend describes as 'Having a good look at your
fundamentals'.
Glenstal Abbey is a Benedictine monastery in the depths of County Tipperary
in Ireland. 'Yes,' said Brother Michael on the phone, 'We do take in guests.
Of course we would be happy to have you.'
Going up the long driveway I panicked and almost turned back. It was like
popping in to Balmoral for Christmas dinner. How was one supposed to act?
What could one talk about? I had booked in for two days. How would I fill
the time? Brother Michael, the guest master, put me at ease. 'Now there's
your room, there's tea downstairs and vespers is at 6.20pm.' He saw my
nervousness. 'Don't worry,' he said with a big wink, 'we'll have you drummed
in in no time.'
The Benedictines take their name from their founder, St Benedict, born in
Italy at the end of the 5th century. It is not a strict or enclosed monastic
order: life is built around the rule of St Benedict, which emphasises the
community life, daily work, the daily round of common prayer and
hospitality.
'All guests who present themselves are to be welcomed as Christ,' says the
rule of Benedict. There is no charge for staying at a Benedictine monastery.
Guests are merely expected to make some contribution, according to their
means.
Fr Bernard, a remarkably agile 82-year-old with a ready line in wit and
wisdom, shepherds me into church. 'We allow our guests to sit with the monks
but you needn't bother yourself. We're relatively harmless.' A nun is the
only other visitor. We sit in the monastic misericordia by the altar. I am
shown how to follow the psalms, in English, and the rest of the service, in
Latin.
To sit among monks while the liturgical office is chanted back and forth is
rather like suddenly finding yourself given a seat in the New York
Philharmonic. Or being handed a paint brush by Leonardo da Vinci and asked
to do a spot of touching up on the Sistine chapel while he nips out for a
plate of pasta.
It is a great privilege. It is embracing. But it is also at first slightly
nerve-wracking; you wonder when to bow or bob, where to look.
After vespers there is what is described as a period of silence, then
supper. Fr Bernard ushers the nun and me into the monks' dining room. The
meal, we are told, takes place in silence. At first this seems very strange.
How do you ask for another slice of bread? How do you get hold of the sugar
at the other end of the long table. The monks on each side are extremely
attentive.
'The first time I had a meal with them I had a fit of giggles,' said the
nun. 'But you quickly get used to it.'
The food is wholesome: chicken stew and brown rice with as much bread and
jam as you want. Tea is drunk from large bowls. Two monks rush about
serving: with delicate hand gestures they ask if you have finished.
No talking means that the meal passes within minutes. Then you sit back and
listen to the monk who is doing the reading. He starts with some scripture
but then continues with a book about recent events in Moscow. Monks, one
realises, are very worldly-wise. Some laugh or nod sagely as the reading
goes on.
Life in a monastery is ruled by the tolling of the bell. At 8.40pm it rings
for compline. By 9.30pm you are in your 'cell,' reading or writing or
praying - or preparing yourself for a 6am start.
At breakfast, which the guests take separately, Fr Bernard explains the
steps to becoming a monk. First, you enter as a postulant for a year. Then
you take simple vows for a minimum of three years during which time you
cannot leave without a dispensation from the order.
'When you're a novice it's a trial run if you like. At the end of your
simple vows you are as free as a lark to go. If you decide to stay then you
take your final vows for life.'
Glenstal has a community of 40 monks, from all manner of backgrounds and
together possessed of a bewildering array of qualifications and talents.
There are seven PhD's landscape gardener who has exhibited at the Chelsea
flower show and is also a scholar of Russian icons. A number are talented
musicians. One is an expert on Byzantine liturgy. Another produces
historical text books for schools and specialises in modern Russia.
Fr Paddy is monastery bursar, in charge of finances. A theologian who was a
parish priest for years before entering the monastery, he organises an
annual ecumenical conference at Glenstal, tends the monastery's 17th century
walled garden and is a member of the core group of monks who lead the
chanting of the liturgy.
Fr Paddy is concerned about what work the monks should and should not be
doing in order to support the monastery. 'There is an ongoing debate here
and at other monasteries about how monks should support themselves. We can
no longer remain entirely dependent on the traditional ways.'
The Glenstal community has a school of 200 pupils and a farm. At present
both are profitable: there is a 12-year waiting list for the school, which
benefits from a large measure of state aid. Glenstal has also managed to
continue to attract one or two novices each year.
The situation is radically different at many other Benedictine monasteries
and other religious orders in England and elsewhere. In those, there is a
serious shortage of novices and a battle to remain self sufficient with an
increasingly ageing community. The monastery schools are short of pupils
while costs are rising. If alternative forms of income are not found, some
communities could be forced to close.
'We are fortunate at the moment but we realise that we, too, must look at
other ways of surviving,' says Fr Paddy. 'We could perhaps make a liqueur,
as some of the older monasteries have done. But then there is the opinion
that we should be producing goods for which there is a need and not simply
producing something to suit the jaded palates of the rich.'
Some suggest that monks should do more secular activities, even take jobs
outside the monastery. But this would threaten the stability of the
community and inevitably mean that the monks could not abide by one of their
main tenets - the saying together of the daily round of prayer.
Many monks object to the thought of working outside. After all, they joined
to be part of a community and not to spend the majority of their time in the
secular world.
The bell for midday mass interrupts discussions. The Abbot, Fr Celestine,
co-celebrates with the community. Again there is that feeling of taking part
in a timeless ritual, following the liturgy in the way monks have done for
centuries.
After a buffet-style lunch, this time with talking allowed, Fr Paddy and I
take a walk in Glenstal's rolling grounds. Glenstal was built for an
Anglo-Irish merchant family in the middle of the last century. A gangling,
impressive folly, the house and grounds were laid out in the style of a 12th
century castle.
'We are discussing various ways of ensuring our survival as a community,'
says Fr Paddy. 'There are those who feel that the modern equivalent of monks
working on illuminated manuscripts is designing on a computer. I think that
in the modern world there is a great need for adult counselling or the more
broadly-based education we can offer here. We have the teaching expertise
and the perfect environment.'
With the rain sweeping through the mock turrets and battlements, it is
already time to leave. We stroll through the monks' graveyard, neat,
unadorned tomb stones laid out like a soldier's cemetery.
Before going, a look at the visitor's book. It is full of praise for the
monks for providing such a haven in a busy world. One visitor was obviously
greatly uplifted by it all, but found the Tipperary weather difficult: 'I
found spiritual peace - next time I'll bring my wellingtons.'
Perhaps the priest from Northern Ireland summed things up best of all.
'Every wise virgin needs a regular oil change. Thanks for a great retreat.'

<TEXT>
EVENTS IN Algeria were dutifully followed in the serious British papers but
their treatment reflected a lack of passionate involvement. However, there
was a general feeling that parties which gain most votes in an election
should be allowed to take power, however undesirable the victors may be. The
British have a long experience of elections with unfortunate outcomes and
have not resorted to tanks to show their displeasure.
This facile approach did not prevail elsewhere. With millions of Algerians
at home and the threat of more to come the French papers agonised over the
election and its failure to be consummated. Le Monde, of course, had to
bring a dead philosopher into it: 'Addressing the Jesuits, Pascal had, in
his time, already posed the problem clearly: 'You demand in the name of our
principles, liberties which you refuse in the name of yours.' Doesn't that
formula apply marvellously to the Islamic Salvation Front?'
The Algerian army is also seen as 'Jesuits' by the standards of Pascal. It
gets muddling, but one can see the point. The paper concluded hesitantly
that in fact what the army had done was just not acceptable, however horrid
an Islamic fundamentalist regime might turn out to be. 'Perhaps one ought to
take the risk of allowing the FIS to take power - and probably waste it -
and face up to harsh economic realities.'
Now, the Jesuits started life in Spain and the Madrid daily El Pais seems to
have been through their mill. It thought the Algerian army had done the
right thing. 'In a fully democratic country, with regular mechanisms to
guarantee and control procedures, such a course could be criticised from the
point of view of its evident finality. But it is in fact a question of
creating those very same structures. In such conditions the chosen course is
the least bad of those available.'
Curiously, back in Paris, Le Figaro pondered those same words: 'The lesser
evil?' was the interrogative headline over Thierry Desjardins' editorial.
'For the first time in contemporary history, democrats everywhere welcome a
coup d'etat with evident satisfaction,' he confidently asserted, adding
that, had the elections gone ahead, the FIS would have won and Algeria would
have adopted the 'lifestyle of seventh century Medina.' Surely the point is
that the Algerians might want to live in seventh century Medina?
Brushing that problem aside, Desjardins concluded: 'What attitude should we
adopt? Nothing obliges us to choose between the two evils and rejoice in
'the lesser evil.' In this case the famous 'neither-nor' is forced on us.
Neither the dictatorship of the mullahs, nor that of the military. But,
after all, it is not our business.'
This is very important, for Desjardins has signed a death warrant for leader
writers. He is too good a journalist to show it.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also avoided commiting itself and
retreated into an historical analysis, but the implication is the same.
It is not just Algeria where we can no longer take sides, there is Russia
versus Ukraine, the Georgian civil war, South Africa and a dozen other
quarrels which, as my employers put it, 'lack ideological resonance.' Where
have all the good guys gone? As a result we are in for a frightful period of
fair mindedness, fence-sitting and statements of the obvious as papers try
to clarify the minds of their readers and forsake the Manichaean struggles
of the past.

Many may be unfamiliar with the New Banality. Fortunately, two examples are
to hand. They both dealt with President Bush's trip to Japan and read like
'George catches Tokyo tummy on his holidays.' The Hamburg Welt am Sonntag
wrote: 'Presumably it was only an attack of intestinal 'flu which rendered
Bush unconscious for a few seconds. But the video pictures of the collapsing
President have made an impression on the American electorate.'
A Flemish daily, De Standaard, of Antwerp, went still further in the quest
for even-handedness: 'Because his trip had electoral implications, his
gastro-enteritis took on an added electoral significance. Admittedly a
democrat can also get gastro-enteritis, as Bush said afterwards, but his
fainting shown on all televisions during a foreign trip demonstrated clearly
that the President, who aspires to a second term in office, at 67, in spite
of his healthy appearance, is not the youngest of persons any more.'
Well, you can't say fairer than that.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Small ships that face a future on the rocks: Keith Wheatley
braves a winter gale to sail cross-Channel on a British coaster with its
owner-skipper, one of a rapidly-vanishing breed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPLENDID Georgian sea-front of Weymouth, a small port in Dorset on
England's south coast, was hardly visible as the final 32-tonne lorry tipped
its load of builders' sand for the Port Soif. Winter dusk had descended.
Wind shrieked through the crane wires. On the bridge of the 429-tonne
coaster there was a gloomy print-out: 'Gale warning. 0925 Dover.
South-westerly gale expected soon.'
Owner-skipper Derick Goubert, 44, expected to meet the gale just south of
Portland Bill. He was right. With the Dorset cliffs barely a mile astern,
the little ship began to roll heavily in the considerable swell. Green seas
and spray obscured the bow and cargo deck for much of the time. Goubert
needed to be alert, crossing the main west-bound Channel shipping lane at a
bare seven knots. Guernsey, our destination in the reef-girdled Channel
islands, was 10 hours distant.
In his cabin below the bridge, mate Dave Lower grabbed a few hours' sleep.
Next door, in the battered but spotless galley, the Port Soif's two
Portuguese able seamen, Alex and Mario, prepared an excellent spaghetti
bolognese.
Goubert ate enthusiastically, his round, mobile features animated by the
welcome change of having a guest for supper. He faced a long night of bad
weather and heavy shipping traffic. Next morning we would be unloading,
followed by some cash-flow work and dealing with the bank and insurance
company fallout from a near-catastrophic engine breakdown late in the
summer. By tea-time, the ship would probably be loading general cargo for
nearby Alderney.
Every economic statistic shows that the past decade has inclined towards the
small business, the self-motivated entrepreneur. Perhaps. Yet, in one sector
traditionally strong in individualists, British coastal shipping, the
owner-skipper has turned from being the norm to a vanishing species in less
than a generation.
The National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers
(NUMAST) published a report recently quantifying the decline. British-owned
and registered ships of the category into which Goubert and his Port Soif
would fit had dropped from 546 in 1975 to 249 in 1983 and just 42 in 1991.
'These skippers are now a rare and unusual breed,' said Weymouth
harbourmaster Captain Peter Tambling as he signed-off the Port Soif's
paperwork. 'If Derick was a house, he'd be a listed building.'
Goubert's little coaster, capable of carrying a 600-ton load, is worth
perhaps Pounds 150,000 - about the same as a semi-detached house in one of
the leafier London suburbs. She was built by a Dutch yard 20 years ago and
Goubert bought her at the beginning of 1990, run-down and neglected. Since
then she has been spruced-up, re-engined after the major breakdown (luckily
the insurance company paid, or the Pounds 60,000 bill would have sunk the
Port Soif) and, most noticeably, re-painted.
'I am fond of orange,' Goubert said, with a chuckle. He is a long way from
anyone's idea of a sea-dog. 'People say I must have got a job lot cheap but
you have to order the paint specially from Denmark.' The hull is dented and
battered but liveried immaculately in jaffa. The two company vans in St
Peter Port are in the same shade.
'Being the owner of the ship, you do take more care about the whole
operation,' said Goubert, snuggling deeper into a chair in the port corner
of the bridge. In mid-Channel, at midnight, the weather was abysmal.
'Everything operates from here because I'm here. We haven't had a holiday in
three years. The one we'd planned for August was lost when the engine fell
down.
'Regrets? Every day. You think you'll sell up, give the money back to the
bank and go and work for somebody else. But it wouldn't be the same. At
least I'm doing what I want to, even if it doesn't make any sense.
Everything I've earned since the day we bought Port Soif has gone back into
the ship, bar wages and so forth.'
Goubert is not wealthy, or even comfortably off. He lives in a modern
semi-detached house on Guernsey but sleeps in his cabin more often than his
own bed. A coaster makes no money tied up to a jetty.
Sailing 52 weeks of the year, the Port Soif earns around Pounds 175,000
gross. Wages for skipper, mate and two seamen come to around Pounds 50,000
annually: lean enough for any management analyst with a warm office and a
6pm finish. Overheads are high, though. On top of a large bank loan at 15
per cent, insurance alone costs Pounds 16,000 a year.
At present, the Port Soif is on time charter. It means regular money and no
commissions to pay. If Goubert was back tramping the North Sea - which he
has done plenty of times - relying on agents and sub-agents to find the next
cargo, then total commission can run to as much as 10 per cent of the ship's
income.
With freight rates dropping and less work around in a major world-wide
recession, it is small wonder that many coastal trade ship-owners have
forsaken British registration and chosen to fly the ensigns of Panama,
Liberia or Gibraltar from their sterns.
'The surveys are less rigorous, there are no restrictions on the areas of
trade and wage rates are lower,' explains Arnold Williams, now a NUMAST
industrial officer but once a coasting skipper. 'They are usually older
ships and the salaries that they can afford don't attract British officers.
Anyone operating a single ship is likely to be under considerable financial
pressure nowadays.'
Flagging-out is not an option that appeals to Captain Goubert. 'There are
only three reasons, really, for doing that,' he says. 'Lower standards,
cheaper insurance, less tax. This ship will always be up to survey while I
own her. I'm not interested in running a rust-bucket.' Nevertheless, Goubert
knows personally of only one other owner-skipper trading, as he does, under
a London registration.
Before the second world war, owner-skippers were the norm, wives and kids
often aboard, moving millions of tons of freight around Britain's coast.
Now, they seem only a year or so from disappearing altogether. But who,
apart from anthropologists, should care? Cargo will still be moved, albeit
in bigger ships owned by bigger companies. It will also come in through
bigger ports, although some have regrets about that.
'I'm a great believer in small ports. They feed local economic
infrastructures,' said Tambling, watching the sand pour into the Port Soif's
hold. 'Weymouth is extremely competitive, with some of the lowest rates on
the south coast. This loading will cost the ship about Pounds 200, a quarter
of what it would be at Southampton.'
Some weeks, Tambling sees only a single coaster. Without revenue, the
wharves have no future. In 1947, Weymouth handled more than 1m tons of
freight; the present volume would be less than 5 per cent of that.
The progress to ever bigger ships and ports seems inexorable. The smallest
coasters now built are over 1,000 tonnes. Ships that size and bigger often
cannot use the smaller ports; even when they can, conglomerate owners often
prefer bigger harbours where they have negotiated rates on a yearly basis.
'Take a harbour like Colchester, in Essex, that you just can't get these
bigger ships into,' says Arnold Williams. 'A terrific little cargo facility
and well-liked on the east coast, but a lot of these little ports are
starting to close down.'
Derek Goubert is in no doubt that his competitors for business are not other
coasters but bigger ships, ferries and road transport. 'The smaller the
ship, the more you're competing with lorries.' he said. 'And I'll tell you -
ships are a lot more environmentally friendly than lorries.'
The only small ships are old ships - Goubert reckons that nothing as small
as the Port Soif has been built since 1974. Bigger companies want to run new
ships, which are cheaper to operate through economies of scale but which
cannot enter the myriad small ports around Britain's coast. So, the harbours
close and each year it becomes harder for the minnows to survive.
'The biggest worry is not today but tomorrow,' said Goubert. 'If I sell this
ship, I've got to buy another or I'm going backwards. New building rates are
about Pounds 2,000 a tonne, so any ship of around 1,000 tonnes (the smallest
now available) that is under 10 years old is going to cost over Pounds 1m.
Bernard McCall, author of several books on the coasting trade, agrees that
the days of the owner-skipper are fast running out. 'As coasters get bigger
and more specialised, they're increasingly beyond the pocket of an
individual owner/skipper. There are, literally, only a handful left and
there won't be any more,' he says.
Goubert is resigned to enjoying the twilight of a nearly-extinct species. 'I
left school at 16 and bullied the skipper of a little tanker into giving me
a job,' he recalled. 'I went to sea because I was interested in ships. Now,
you don't see any coasters and the big ships all look the same.'
Outside the bridge windows it was dark, wet and cold. The Channel was doing
its considerable worst. John Masefield would have understood our situation
when he wrote: 'Butting through the Channel in the mad March days.'
Unfortunately, there aren't too many 'dirty British coasters' left.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Food: Top Italian tips - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three chefs from London's top Italian restaurants - Maddalena Bonino from
192, Francesco Zanchettta from Riva and Claudio Pecorari from Cibo  - will
be your teachers if you decide to join one of seven cookery courses to be
run later this year by 'Tasting Italy'.
The courses will take place at La Chiara di Prumiano, a country hotel in
Chianti. Mornings only will be spent in the kitchen.
The one-week courses, limited to 20, begin on May 4, 11, 18 and 25 and
October 12, 19 and 26 and cost Pounds 795 per person including scheduled
flights, accommodation, tuition and meals. Contact Sara Schwartz, Tasting
Italy, 5, Stockwell Avenue, London SW9 5SY. Tel: 071-627-0475.
Sadly, more culinary casualties. Frith's in Soho's Frith Street has closed
its doors and, in the next street along, La Bastide has also shut.
Gloom, too, on the news-stands. Taste magazine, which had risen from the
ashes of A la Carte, folds. With Taste's demise there can be little hope of
a British magazine to rival America's Gourmet or Bon Appetit, France's Gault
Millau or Cuisine et Vins de France. Even New Zealand, with a population of
only 3m, boasts the successful Cuisine.
Fortunately, there have been a number of restaurant openings; Les Saveurs at
37a Curzon Street, W1 (071-491-8919) offers a three-course lunch menu at
Pounds 21 and a six-course dinner menu at Pounds 39.50. Cooking is French,
strongly influenced by the Orient.
And a French 'takeover' of a former jewel in the Indian gastronomic crown
has quietly been completed at 34 Charlotte Street, W1 (071-636-1178) where
Pied a Terre has replaced Jamdani. Set lunch Pounds 17.50, dinner Pounds 36.
The Khun Akorn, a Thai restaurant in Old Brompton Road, SW3 has opened a
sister restaurant at 121, Earl's Court Road, SW5 (071-373-3018).
Above the Grouse and Claret pub in Little Chester Street, Belgravia, SW3
(071-245-1224) is another Thai restaurant, the Oriental Brasserie, which
serves a lunchtime buffet (Pounds 14.95) and set price menus from Pounds
19.95. Above the Black Bull pub at 358 Fulham Road, SW10 (071-352-0625)
Harvey's Cafe serves interesting and well-priced food.
Restaurants that offer good value and are in the right location have been
able to benefit from the property glut.
Management at The Tall House at 134 Southwark Street, SE1 (071-401-2929)
could not believe their luck when the company next door decided to relocate
outside London. They have been able to expand sideways, increase the size of
the kitchen, give their tables more space and develop their wine bar.
London's most authentic Turkish restaurant, Istanbul Iskembecisi, has moved
across the road from 4 to 9 Stoke Newington Road, N16, increasing its size
three-fold (071-254-7291). Open all week, noon to 5am.
The Square at 32 King Street, SW1 (071-839-8787) opened just as 1992 was
being ushered in. Any restaurant which opens with such a broad, easy-to-read
and keenly-priced wine list should be worthwhile.
However, the cooking does not yet match the wine list in value. Although it
may quickly improve, our meal was marked by a singular lack of generosity.
The bill of Pounds 75 for two included a half bottle of excellent Sicilian
white (Terre de Ginestra 1990 Pounds 5.50) and three glasses of champagne.
But the main courses came without vegetables, salad or potatoes and there
were no amuses-gueules or petits fours.
Wine merchants' special deals abound. The bin ends of Lay &amp; Wheeler, of
Colchester, Essex, look more tempting than most and from January 27 even
Oddbins, arguably the most successful chain, is discounting 300 wines
including lopping Pounds 2.50 off five top champagnes and Pounds 5 off
Chateau Pichon Lalande 1985 to bring it under Pounds 20 a bottle.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Food: Italy's gift to Wales - Giles MacDonogh visits
Taruschios in their Welsh eyrie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CELTS generally are not noted for their ability in the kitchen. With the
possible exception of Brittany, the one region of France I do not know well,
no one would travel to a Celtic region for the food. In all but a few
well-charted restaurants, Ireland is a gastronomic nightmare; Scotland has a
few more good tables, but this new wisdom has not filtered down to the
housewife or housekeeper; and then there is Wales.
Wales: leaks and laver bread, lamb (with terrible mint sauce), cockles and
sewin (salmon trout), and hearty teas of bara brith, tarts and scones.
One thing which all the Celtic regions have in common is access to excellent
raw ingredients. Wales is no exception: the lambs graze on particularly
rich, verdant pastures and the same grass provides the cream for Welsh
cheeses. The coast is not just a source for cockles and laver bread - Wales
also offers lobsters, crabs and oysters as well as fish. Its fertile market
gardens grow good fruit and vegetables.
This is how the marketing organisation, A Taste of Wales, would like us to
see the principality: good local ingredients to be combined whatever way you
will. Traditions largely are played down. Wales certainly has a culinary
past, such as the cawl lamb stew (which turns out to be a close cousin of
its Irish counterpart) or the now rare Carmarthen ham; or faggots, even. One
notably Welsh practice, born of poverty, is the replacement of meat by
cheese, as in Welsh rabbit (not rarebit, but an allusion to the fact that
the Welshman had to content himself with a bogus bunny). Glamorgan sausages
are another meatless dish.
Providing you select well, you may eat well in Wales at virtually any level.
On a recent visit I was introduced to Meudwen Stephens, a Breconshire
farmer's wife who takes her cake-making talents all over the world to
promote Welsh tourism. She rents out three rooms in her farmhouse in the
Black Mountains and sends her 'guests' home well-nourished on plain Welsh
cookIng.
Teas and puddings clearly are what she enjoys most, and it was she who
explained to me that a Welsh 'tart' was, in fact, a flattened pie -
presumably a corruption of the French tourte. (Tel: 0814-711349).
A local pub with decent food is the Griffin at Llyswen, in the beautiful Wye
Valley (0874-754-241). I visited the Griffin at lunchtime and was able to
choose from an adventurous menu which included dishes such as jugged hare
for Pounds 8.50. A lack of selection when it came to Welsh beer absolved me
of my responsibility to drink Welsh (why no Brains?). I had a pint of
Murphy's Irish stout instead.
Not far from the Griffin is the Lake Country House Hotel, in Llangammarch
Wells (05912-202), owned by Pierre and Jan Mifsud. The Lake is as lovely an
hotel as any I know in Britain with 50 acres of valley, stream and lake in a
particularly secluded part of the countryside. The kitchen, however, could
do with a mite more attention to detail. Dishes tend to be over-elaborate
while sauces lack concentration. Deficiencies in the cooking are to a degree
offset by the compendious wine list.
It is accepted generally that the Walnut Tree Inn in Llandewi Skirrid, near
Abergavenny, is the best restaurant in Wales. Given its many accolades
(including being cookery writer Elizabeth David's favourite), the
informality of the place comes as a surprise. It is, as its chef Franco
Taruschio says, a pub; but the best sort of pub, for all that.
There is a busy bar, a 'bistro' and a restaurant; but the restaurant is
deeply informal and the menu is the same in all three places. Most of the
clients are local, due no doubt to the enormous warmth exuded by Franco and
his wife, Ann, and their success in fitting into this remote community.
Franco's food is not exactly Welsh, but it does contain Welsh elements. The
amuse-gueules, for example, are deep-fried laver bread, Glamorgan sausages
and little fish cakes. The latter betray a slight Thai influence; a tribute,
perhaps, to Ann and Franco's adopted daughter.
Another Welsh dish is Lady Llanover's salt duck which is served in rare,
juicy strips with damsons. Franco is happiest using Welsh ingredients to
recreate the food of his native central Italy, such as his papardelle with
hare sauce. It is not exactly a sauce, as the pasta comes with large chunks
of hare in a sauce on top of parmigiano-reggiano.
At this time of year, game plays a major role in menus at the Walnut Tree:
main courses included some perfectly-cooked local venison fillet and
partridge with lentils and celeriac.
The portions are huge and that goes for the puddings, too. Somehow, Franco
contrived to serve me three: a wonderful Christmas pudding ice (by far the
best of the three I have had this year); a sticky toffee pudding; and a
mince pie wrapped in thin pastry leaves. The Walnut Tree also has an
exemplary wine list.
It is touchingly ironic that an Italian should make Wales worth the visit.
But do not expect to pay under Pounds 35 a head.

FT  18 JAN 92 / The latest salvo from Bordeaux's artillery: Jancis Robinson
tries an unusual new white wine from the heart of Bordeaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT MANY people would have the winemaking confidence to launch their new dry
white immediately after serving Krug 1955 champagne.
Come to think of it, not many people nowadays have the financial confidence
needed to open even one magnum of Krug, let alone the six or so that
preceded the lunchtime launch of Blanc de Lynch-Bages. But then its patron,
Jean-Michel Cazes, is in an exceptional position.
He is one of the few Bordeaux growers who has been gaining rather than
losing control of what he produces and - possibly thanks to his early
working life in the US - is one of a handful who seem part of a world larger
than Bordeaux. He took over the family properties, notably Chateau
Lynch-Bages, the Pauillac fifth growth widely regarded as a second, back in
1973 when he was in his 30s and has made sure that it has more than kept
pace with soaring wine quality since then.
But nowadays much of his time is taken in directing the strikingly ambitious
wine interests of the French insurance group AXA, built up by his old
classmate Claude Bebear. Across the road from Chateaux Latour and
Pichon-Lalande, the Pauillac second growth Chateau Pichon-Longueville has
been rapidly transformed from dangerously derelict to dangerously decadent
(the only place where I have climbed a little set of wooden steps into a
canopied bath - and was rather surprised not to find a raft of nymphs there
offering to scrub my back). The luxurious chateau building is still
surrounded by a sea of mud from which bulldozers and cranes are attempting
to create the reality of Cazes' decidedly un-Medocain vision of a winery and
visitors' centre.
The interior decorators have moved down the road to Margaux's Chateau
Cantenac-Brown, another property that AXA Millesimes is in the process of
restoring to its former glory (although this one was cleverly bought just
after its vat room had been entirely modernised). As well as Burgundy's Clos
de l'Arlot and a clutch of Bordeaux second wines, AXA controls Chateaux
Franc-Mayne in St Emilion, Petit-Village in Pomerol and, scarcely worth
mentioning, the 'bourgeois' Pibran in Pauillac, more convenient than most
from the point of view of Cazes' own family domain.
That this domain exists at all in Bordeaux's keenly stratified society is
something of a miracle. Cazes' great-grandfather was a montagnol, an
itinerant agricultural worker from one of the poorest parts of the Pyrenees
who set up an early sort of youth opportunities programme in Pauillac for
the lads back home.
His son, Jean-Charles, did well enough to acquire Lynch-Bages in 1933
(although none of today's glamour attached to the wine business then) and he
then ran it for 40 years. Jean-Michel's father Andre, still very much a
presence at Lynch-Bages, ran the local co-op and was Pauillac's insurance
broker.
The evening after his new white's debut, Jean-Michel Cazes was particularly
relaxed. Playing with a glass of Roederer Cristal this time, he gazed into
one of three scented wood fires that had been lit to give the white shell of
Chateau Cantenac-Brown that lived-in feeling and reflected: 'I remember my
great-grandfather. He wore sheepskin and hardly spoke French. The Medoc has
always been colonised by outsiders; it has no history of its own.'
But hang on a minute. The wines of the Medoc are supposed to be red, aren't
they? Well only up to a point. Some white grapes have always been grown in
among the more famous red ones, or more accurately ink-blue ones, of
Bordeaux's northern outcrop of the most famous names in the wine world.
Historically they were either thrown in with the red and their existence
barely recognised or, like those inherited at Lynch-Bages, they were made
into white wine for the personal consumption of those who grew them. More
recently, however, the odd white wine has been sent forth into the world to
make a statement.
Those of Chateau Loudenne (GrandMet's isolated wine investment in the outer
reaches of the Medoc) and Chateau Talbot (called Caillou Blanc) are designed
to demonstrate the white wine making expertise of the international
companies that own them. When the Mentzelopoulos family took over Chateau
Margaux in the late 1970s it deliberately relaunched the domain's white
rarity Pavillon Blanc as an early signal of its honourable intentions for
this world-famous red wine property.
Blanc de Lynch-Bages is simply the latest salvo from the man who has the
most impressive range of artillery in Bordeaux. His increasingly hardworked
adjutant is winemaker Daniel Llose. Like Cazes, he has roots in the
Pyrenees, having been brought up in Banyuls. He has made some great red
wines, apparently the princess who kissed the once frog-like wines of
Pichon-Longueville and Cantenac-Brown. At Lynch-Bages the 1989, 1985, 1988
and 1986 were all stunning in a blind vertical tasting for which the Krug
1955 was the reward.
But, having once done a stage in white wine country near Bergerac, Llose was
keen to show what he could do with white grapes. Eleven acres of vineyard
that did not qualify for the Pauillac appellation were accordingly planted
in 1987 with equal portions of Sauvignon, Semillon - 'because it ages well'
 -and almost 20 per cent of the traditional Bordelais white Muscadelle. The
result is 1800 cases of 1990 Blanc de Lynch-Bages, a perfectly competent
oak-fermented white that reflects current fashion and the men behind it
considerably more than its Medoc roots. A useful, if rather expensive, first
course wine for a Medoc dinner.
Blanc de Lynch Bages 1990 was allocated to four UK merchants and is still
available at Pounds 16.50 from Corney &amp; Barrow of London EC1. Tel:
071-251-4051.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Food: Chalet girls who aim for a touch of class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER HAVING been on a skiing holiday, I must confess to a jaundiced view of
what it must be like: too much organised exercise, garish colours ruining an
otherwise sleek white landscape, and that thing they call apres-ski -
over-excited people telling boring stories about their triumphs and
disasters on the piste over cups of mulled wine and plates of nasty food.
The food is a big consideration. On chalet holidays, this is the
responsibility of 'chalet girls', a genus which gives rise to many jokes but
which is, to the best of my knowledge, meant to cook and keep house for the
skiing parties.
Given the usual age, sex and social class of chalet girls, I would have
assumed that the food they cooked would resemble the sort of thing prepared
by well brought up girls in the West End of London: fish cakes, fish pie,
shepherds' pie and, if you are really unlucky, overcooked roasts. Everything
ineffably English, and boring to boot.
My eyes, however, have been opened - not to skiing, I should make clear, but
to the culinary abilities of chalet staff - by attending a training course
at Ombremont, a Michelin-starred hotel and restaurant on the shores of lac
du Bourget near Chambery.
All the chalet persons (there was one boy) had been engaged by a travel
company called Ski Whizz, which operates skiing holidays all over the Alps.
Of the group attending the three-day course, all had some type of cookery
diploma and many had further experience; in short, all were capable of
rolling out something more interesting than a fish-cake.
The star of the show was the chef, Gilles Vernisse, responsible for
inculcating Savoyard cuisine into the heads of young cooks more used to an
international vocabulary.
The menus were ambitious. They included a rustic Savoyard soup enlivened by
triangles of tangy Beaufort cheese; a rabbit civet served with a polenta
enhanced with bacon (it should be recalled that Savoy remained part of Italy
until 1860); chicken quenelles; a potato gratin with Reblochon cheese; pork
fillet served in a sauce made from Chambery vermouth; a pork ragout; a
Beaufort souffle; Savoy cake, and grape clafoutis.
Most impressive was the enthusiasm with which the trainees grasped each
technique. Even a vegetarian went to work with gusto and seemed to take a
special pride in trimming pork fillets, while the chalet boy seemed the
obvious candidate to smash up a great many rabbits into their constituent
parts.
The students learnt about local products, especially the great local cheeses
made from the Alpine Abondance cow: the dense Beaufort and Abondance
cheeses, and the creamier Reblochons and Vacherins, and local wines such as
Apremont, Abymes and Mondeuse, as well as the local vermouth. At the
students' insistance Gilles Vernisse showed them how to put together a
couple of vegetarian menus using local produce.
In the evening there was the chance to try out Gilles' inventions, such as
his duck magret filled with foie gras and served with a truffle vinaigrette;
a superb dish of snail ravioli with spinach and ceps; or a mussel soup with
saffron and baby clams. For the fish, pollan had been brought from Lake
Geneva and was served on a bed of leeks with the local, gentian-flavoured
liqueur. Perch came marinated in basil.
Among the meat courses, lamb was served under an olive crust; a sausage of
sweetbreads was arranged around leeks and morel mushrooms; and pigeon
breasts came with minute Royans ravioli filled with Comte cheese. The
puddings featured pear ravioli on a chocolate sauce, a brace of souffles -
one of Grand Marnier, the other of bananas - and a delicious nougat glace.
Now, I think that if Gilles Vernisse would consent to become a chalet girl,
I would go to the mountain.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Cookery: Old-fashioned is high fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LAST WEEK I made out that roast meat was de rigueur for Sunday lunch.
Correction. A joint was and is the first choice but there are other options
well worth consideration.
I have a personal love of boiled meats such as gammon, chicken pot au feu,
silverside and leg of lamb (or, better still, mutton) served with a fennel,
onion or caper sauce.
Another dish that allows the cook to treat Sunday pretty much as a day of
rest is braised oxtail. This has to be cooked in advance in order to shrug
off surplus fat.
Few meats are more lip-smackingly sticky and satisfying on a cold winter's
day, and to eat such a dish now will please twice over those who like to
keep abreast of the latest culinary trends, for oxtail is very much a meat
of the moment. Old fashioned is high fashion in 1992.
BRAISED OXTAIL (serves 6 or more)
The dumplings and prunes are optional extras here but I think it is a
mistake to leave out the prunes as their spicy liquor makes a fine
contribution to the gravy, and the fruits themselves are easy to avoid by
those who dislike them.
For the basic braise: at least 4 lb of oxtail, cut into 2 in lengths (I use
2 whole large oxtail or the meaty parts from 3 smaller ones, saving the bony
ends for soup-making); 1 onion; 2 celery stalks; 2 carrots; the juice of an
orange; a glass of port; 1 pt beef stock or consomme; a bouquet garni; a
spoonful of olive oil; 1 oz flour; a little chopped parsley.
For the spiced prunes: 6 oz large prunes;  3/4 pt tea; 5 tablespoons port;
the peel of a large orange, thinly shaved in long curls (the skin of the
fruit whose juice is used in the basic braise); 1 bay leaf; 4 inches
cinnamon stick, 5 cloves and 5 allspice berries, all bruised.
For the dumplings:  1/4 lb wholemeal flour mixed with 1 teaspoon baking
powder; a great deal of freshly grated nutmeg, coarsely ground black pepper
and salt; 1 oz butter; 2 eggs.
First prepare the prunes as they will benefit from several days soaking.
Measure the tea and port into a small saucepan. Add the orange peel, bay,
cinnamon, cloves and allspice. Bring slowly to a rolling boil. Away from the
heat, add the prunes. Cover and set aside in a cold place until needed.
A day before you plan to serve it, trim all visible fat from the oxtail.
Dust the meat with flour and brown it all over in a little hot oil in a
large heavy-based flameproof casserole.
Chop the onion, celery and carrots. Add them to the pot, pushing them down
between the pieces of meat. Sprinkle on the rest of the flour, pour on the
liquids and bring to simmering point, stirring occasionally.
When the liquid is simmering steadily, add the bouquet garni, some salt and
pepper. Cover tightly, if necessary laying a sheet of greaseproof paper
between the pot and its lid to make a good fit.
Put the casserole into an oven heated to 300'F (150'C) gas mark 2 and cook
for 1 hour. Turn the pieces of oxtail over in the gravy, reduce oven
temperature to 275'F (140'C) gas mark 1 and cook for 2 hours more.
Turn the meat again, switch off the oven and let the casserole rest in the
residue heat for 1 hour. Then chill overnight.
Next day lift off and discard the surface fat. Place the casserole over a
low flame and heat until the beautifully jellied gravy has liquified.
Remove and discard the bouquet garni, lift out the pieces of oxtail and
reserve them, then whizz the remaining contents of the casserole in a food
processor to puree the vegetables and so thicken the gravy a little. Return
the gravy to the casserole.
Set the swollen prunes aside on a plate, discard their flavourings and
fast-boil their liquor until reduced to a few sticky and well spiced
spoonfuls. Stir this elixir into the gravy and return the oxtail to the
casserole.
Cover and reheat gently in a low oven for about one hour or until the meat
is very hot and meltingly tender. Turn or baste the oxtail occasionally
during this time.
Fifteen minutes or so before serving, check the gravy for seasoning, add the
swollen prunes to the pot, pushing them well down into the liquid, and make
the dumplings.
For the dumplings, season the flour mixture lavishly and rub in the butter
(these tasks can be done a day ahead). Then add the beaten eggs and mix
until smooth. Shape with teaspoons into about 3 dozen baby dumplings. Drop
each one as prepared into a shallow pan of barely simmering salted water and
poach for 8-10 minutes, flipping them over at half time.
Drain the dumplings well, scatter them over the oxtail and sprinkle with
parsley. Serve with a dish of floury potatoes, and cabbage, carrots or an
undressed bitter leafy green salad.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A basic post modern look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IF DESIGNER labels were all the rage in the 1980s, basics are what the '90s
seem to be about. No more razzmatazz, no more over-the-top glitz and glamour
 -sweatshirts and plain cotton shirts, chinos and singlets, leather belts
and loafers are what the retailing gurus see as the way to fame and fortune.
Who says so? Well, David Krantz, for one; and if his name does not mean much
to you, then Blazer, the chain he founded, probably does.
Blazer started as one shop in Golders Green in north London in 1979. By the
late 1980s there were 25 stores, all purveying a well-bred Anglicised
version of the 'preppy' look that was then all the rage but hard to find.
Blazer's reputation and influence spread. Krantz sold out to the Storehouse
Group for Pounds 5.4m in 1987 and spent a few years enjoying the money and
musing on what to do next.
Basics, sold by mail order, is the result. He chose basics because he
believes that 'people are fed-up with over-the-top fashion. They want
comfortable and reasonably-priced clothes in good quality fabrics and great
colours.' And he opted for mail order because: 'With rising high street
rents and staffing costs, that is the best way to deliver value for money to
the customer.'
This weekend sees the launch of his collection of casual, dress-down clothes
for men and women called Racing Green. In his splendid, full-colour
catalogue there are all the classics we have come to expect  - vat-dyed
cotton twill shirts (Pounds 32), button-down Oxfords (Pounds 35), polo
shirts (cotton double pique, in masses of colours, Pounds 19), cotton chinos
(Pounds 39 for men and women), crew-neck jumpers and so on through the the
staples of most modern wardrobes.
Items like these used to come cheap but now they do not. In one of those
strange evolutions of attitudes, the modern consumer seems to demand more in
the way of quality, finish and detailing from basics than from fancier gear.
There is more snobbism attached to wearing the right pair of jeans, the
just-so polo neck and the real leather belt than there is to party wear.
I am all in favour of basics, and wear them often myself, but, as the
fashion industry makes a synchronised turn away from distinctive, look-at-me
status clothing towards high-quality basics, is there not a danger of
conformity? Can the market-place support so many companies doing the same
sort of thing, no matter how well they do them?
Perhaps this is the time for the sartorial version of contra-cyclical
buying. There are investors who sell as everybody buys, and buy when
everyone sells. The really clever designers could be those who, even now,
are sewing the sequins on their glitziest, fanciest, most outrageous range
ever.
For a catalogue telephone 051-707 2020, fax 051-708 8803 or write to Racing
Green, Heming Way, Liverpool X, L70 1RX. Lines are open 24 hours a day,
every day. Krantz says orders will be delivered within days in a sturdy box
with the clothes wrapped in Racing Green tissue paper.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Couture in a cold climate - Lucia
van der Post on the task facing Marc Bohan as he tries to lift the House of
Hartnell on his elegant shoulders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS exactly a year since Marc Bohan, hired by Manny Silverman to breathe
new life and commercial health into the House of Hartnell, launched his
first collection for Hartnell. The timing could hardly have been worse. The
Gulf war was about to start, the recession was well under way. Americans
stayed at home in their droves and nobody was in a mood to shop at all, let
alone to spend thousands at couture houses.
Marc Bohan, in his lugubrious French way, is straightforwardly honest about
it all. 'It was a perfectly dreadful start,' he admits. 'Couture needs big
social occasions, parties, weddings. Nobody dresses up just to sit by
themselves. When we took the collection to New York in March it was just at
the end of the war and nobody was in an optimistic mood. There was no
dressing-up, no jewels. But,' he says, brightening, 'we have survived all
that. Now I have an excellent team in place who understand how to work my
way. That has been a struggle because the way I worked in Paris was very
different from how people work here. We just have to go up.'
However, Manny Silverman, the man who rescued the house from the brink of
bankruptcy, sounds surprisingly buoyant. 'It has been one of the worst
season's for women's retailing that any of us can remember and yet we have
still done a potful of business. We have seen new people in here that we
would never have seen before. Marc has also taken us on a steep learning
curve - it has been almost vertical - building up the salon more or less
from scratch. But now we have a team that Marc approves of in place we are
much more efficient and that should make us more competitive. If we can
maintain the progress that we are currently making then I am confident that
in about 18 months we shall start to see a positive return on our
investments.'
The plans are the same ones he spelled out to me when he first rescued
Hartnell from the brink of receivership. 'We did not go into this business
just in order to be couturiers,' he told me then. 'We went into it in order
to establish a brand which we then hope to licence around the world, but in
order to do that we need to be very, very good at couture.'
He feels that with Bohan at the design helm he has somebody who is good
enough at couture to establish a brand big enough to begin to expand. Next
week Bohan's latest couture numbers go down the catwalk before press and
customers. Waiting in the wings, ready to go into some 60 top stores, will
be the first of Bohan's ready-to-wear lines for Hartnell.
Anybody who falls for one of Bohan's couture numbers can expect the price to
run to thousands but now, for a fraction of the price, they will be able to
buy the same handwriting, the same Bohan look, for Pounds 500 to Pounds 600
for the suits and from Pounds 200 for the dresses. What they will not get,
of course, is the personal service, the hours of handwork, the fittings, the
luxurious fabrics, the total exclusivity. The designs stem from the same
source, but the end product is made in a different way.
There are those to whom Pounds 500 for a suit, Pounds 200 for a dress may
still seem a lot to pay but bear in mind that this is no more than many
designers without a couture house and a huge international following behind
them command and considerably less than Chanel, Valentino, Karl Lagerfeld
and the like expect to get.
The first ready-to-wear spring/summer collection (three designs from which
are sketched exclusively for us here by Marc Bohan) features some 40
different garments - everything from day suits, pantsuits, jackets, coats
and dresses through to After Six and evening dresses. Deliveries will start
next week and by the end of January they should be in a whole range of the
best stores, including Harvey Nichols, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Selfridges, Beale &amp;
Inman, Jenners of Edinburgh and others.
The look is short and sassy, with long jackets worn over full or pleated
skirts. Fabrics are very light, very floaty with lots of organdie and
chiffon and Bohan uses a lot of blue, every shade from navy through to
palest aquamarine.
Silverman, quite rightly, attaches enormous importance to this collection:
'In terms of brand-building and of everything we hope eventually to do,
ready-to-wear is absolutely vital.'
Amanda Verdan, fashion director at Harvey Nichols, is excited about the new
range. 'It is lovely. It is also important to us because it is an
established brand-name which under Marc Bohan now has a fresher, more
updated style. I can see it appealing to our fashion-minded customers, who
need special occasion clothes to take them through the spring and summer
events.'
But there is no stopping Manny. A de luxe range of ready-to-wear at
intermediate prices - Pounds 850 to Pounds 1,750 - and including everything
from day-dresses to glamorous evening will be on sale by the end of January
exclusively (for the moment) at 26 Bruton Street, London W1. In the
pipeline, already designed and just waiting for the autumn, is a range of
cashmere and lambwool knitwear, all designed and coloured by Bohan and all
of which work with the ready-to-wear collection.
Wedding dresses have traditionally been important to the House of Hartnell -
through this last difficult year it is the British habit of making an effort
for events such as polo, Ascot and weddings that has seen couture houses
through - and a line of 12 to 15 ready-to-wear wedding-gowns is on the
drawing-board.
Vogue Patterns has bought the rights to three of Bohan's last year's spring
collection. Discussions about a men's shirt agreement are under way, a range
of designer ties being pondered. Menswear, which Bohan did so successfully
for Christian Dior, is possibly next in line and after that, who knows?
Perfumes, scarves, the possibilities are endless. In short, 'if,' to quote
Silverman again, 'we can maintain progress,' it should not be long before we
have a complete couture house, French-style, here in London. Everything is
set to go - all that remains to be seen is whether this time round, with a
deep recession still to cope with but at least no Gulf war and more
Americans in town, women have enough 'dressing-up' to do to need the clothes
that Hartnell makes. A lot is resting on Marc Bohan's shoulders next week.
Sketched above by Marc Bohan are three designs from the new Hartnell
ready-to-wear collection to be launched next week. Left to right: chiffon
dress and jacket in navy or black, sizes 8-18, Pounds 395. Navy and jade (or
black and fucshia) silk and viscose suit, sizes 8-18, Pounds 450. Peach (or
stone) short sleeved dress in wool gaberdine, Pounds 249. All from Hartnell,
26 Bruton Street, London W1, Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1,
Selfridges, Oxford Street, London W1, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Piccadilly, London
W1, Jane of Newmarket, Cambridgeshire, Ideal Clothes of Stratford-upon-Avon
and Jane Young of Newark, Nottinghamshire

WHILE most of us associate auction rooms with things old, rare and precious
by artists and craftsmen long dead and buried, Bonhams, the auction house
based at Knightsbridge, west London, has seen that there is another sort of
saleroom market - for things utterly contemporary.
Not that Bonhams has been alone in trying to develop this market. Sotheby's
and Christie's each has dipped a toe into it - and then withdrawn hurriedly
when profits failed to match expectations. But Bonhams, having developed the
market for contemporary ceramics so successfully, has decided to persevere
but to re-think its strategy.
It has decided that the auction formula, although highly successful when
selling established names and reputations, does not work so well with
contemporary furniture and other applied arts; the public, it seems, needs
more time to look, ponder and decide. Instead, Bonhams will on Monday open a
two-week selling exhibition, Decorative Arts Today, at its rooms in
Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge.
Those interested will be able to see (and, of course, buy) work designed and
made by 150 different British contemporary designers and artists. Everything
will be hot from kiln, workshop or studio. The full gamut of arts and crafts
disciplines will be on view - jewellery, furniture, ceramics, floor
coverings, glass, jewellery, lettering, bookbinding, lighting, metalwork,
musical instruments, silver, stained and decorative glass, wall hangings and
wood.
Many of the designers - such as Floris van den Broecke, Senior/Carmichael
(who have made a Pounds 28,000 walnut table for which there is an interested
buyer already), Ron Arad, Fred Baier and Richard La Trobe Bateman - are very
well-known in their fields. Most have produced pieces specially for the
exhibition.
Peta Levi (its curator) has encouraged the designers to produce items that
are practical as well as beautiful - things like beds (there is a
marvellous, austere four-poster by Paul Neil Rathkey for Pounds 5,700),
bedside tables, dining tables, library steps and so on. It is undoubtedly a
unique chance to see the finest contemporary work and, perhaps, a chance to
begin a small collection of your own.
Everything on view is for sale and every piece is a one-off. Although some
of the very fine pieces - such as a silver tea service by Robert McEwan and
the larger pieces of furniture - are expensive, there is plenty to buy at
less than Pounds 1,000. Spalted beech bowls and vessels by Bert Marsh start
at Pounds 15 as does jewellery by Jane Adam, while Maurice Long's two-candle
wall sconce is Pounds 90 and some beautiful curving ash hanging shelves by
Trannon Furniture (David Colwell and Roy Tam) are Pounds 98.
Styles range from simple, almost Shaker-like simplicity (the hanging
shelves) to the wild, Memphis-like joie-de-vivre of Sarah Greaves Stewart's
furniture. As Peta Levi puts it: 'After all the bleak sales, how cheering to
see such a wealth of innovative but practical design and such superb
craftsmanship.'
The exhibition is open every day from January 20-29; 10 am to 5 pm weekdays
and 11-4 on the Saturday and Sunday.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Sport: The Welsh dragon must roar - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELEVEN weeks ago I sat in the press box at Twickenham filled with
apprehension as England faced Australia in the final of the World Cup.
England had played heroically to defeat France and Scotland in eight days -
away from home, at that - but now, surely, their number was up against the
most gifted all-round team in the event.
So Australia's victory was not unexpected (they had beaten England 40-15
only a few months earlier). What was a surprise was England's stubborn
resistance. They outplayed the Australians in the second half when facing
the wind and outscored them by two penalties to one. Had England played to
their forwards, who were colossal that November afternoon, as they had in
their two previous matches, they could have beaten the Aussies.
But they did not. Instead they contributed enormously to a thrilling final
that did as much for rugby around the world as anyone could have wished.
Now here we go again. This afternoon England face Scotland at Murrayfield
and Wales play Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The 1991-92 five nations'
championship will not equal the World Cup in many aspects, if any. The
standard of play will be lower, the players less well-prepared and
motivated, but it is certain to add a bit of zing to life between now and
March 21.
During the World Cup, Finlay Calder, the Scottish captain, said he thought
the championship would diminish in significance in coming years,
overshadowed by the World Cup. I think he is wrong. The World Cup has raised
the public's awareness of the game and thus of the five nations. Rugby has
never been so popular; as a result, this championship is the most widely
anticipated ever.
Every ground will be full for the eight matches (610,000 spectators will
attend in all, paying Pounds 16m). England's home matches at Twickenham
could have been sold out three times over.
What makes the 1991-92 five nations so interesting are the questions that
can be asked: can England, under new coach Dick Best, win the grand slam
again? The odds are against them, even though they are the best team.
Successive slams have been won only three times in 82 years.
How will Scotland fare without the magnificent back row that was together
for 22 matches and outstanding scrum-half Gary Armstrong? Was Ireland's
stunning performance against the Australians in the World Cup quarter-finals
a fluke? The Irish have more match winners and more depth than for years and
they have, as Yeats said, 'still the indomitable Irishry'. What will these
virtues bring them in the coming weeks?
A much more significant question is whether Wales can make significant
progress towards parity with the other countries instead of being their
whipping boys.
This is an important matter to me. I am a Welshman. I was born in Wales of
Welsh parentage. My grandfather was involved in selecting schoolboy players
in Wales and remembers choosing a promising full-back named Vivian Jenkins.
I went to school in south Wales and on holiday in north Wales. I have sung
Welsh in Wales. I am Welsh from top to toe.
There was a time when I would have said it was good for Wales to lose a
match. It would puncture the complacency that existed around Cardiff. For
example, it would have been better for Wales if they had been run into the
ground by England in that notorious match in 1980, the match in which Paul
Ringer was sent off early on. Instead, a sordid game went down in Wales's
history as a glorious defeat.
Wales's third-place finish in the first World Cup in 1987 was also
unfortunate, for it papered over the cracks in their game. 'Well, boys, we
can't be that bad can we if we came third in the World Cup,' went the
argument.
But now, I have had enough of defeats. I am desperate for a Welsh victory.
Just as it used to be said that English rugby was strongest when Gloucester,
Coventry and Northampton were at their best, so British rugby is strongest
when Welsh rugby is at its best. Welsh rugby is the heartbeat of the game in
Europe. If Welsh rugby was as strong as it was 15 or 20 years ago, the
British Lions would be unbeatable.
When Welsh rugby is weak, as it is now, British rugby is diminished by far
more than one quarter. 'When Wales are out of rugby, rugby is out of sorts,'
says Tony O'Reilly. Welsh rugby is so out of sorts at present that only one
Welshman would get into a British Lions' side.
The good news for those from the land of the leek is that Alan Davies has
set about his duties as coach to the national team with flair and vision. He
replaced the Stakhanovite coaching techniques of his predecessor with a
lighter, defter touch. He raised the players' confidence, tried to make
rugby a game to enjoy, not endure. He has employed sportsmen and coaches
from other disciplines to talk to his players about fitness and has
recruited some of the most influential names from Welsh rugby of the past
two decades to help.
Whether it will be sufficient for Wales to achieve Davies's target of
winning one of their four matches in the five nations remains to be seen.
Wales have to play France at home, which is far better than facing them in
Paris.
England, however, must be faced at Twickenham. How Wales will set about the
task of countering the twin towers of Martin Bayfield and Wade Dooley,
England's gigantic locks is just one question that will be answered in the
next five weeks.
All I want is the start of a Welsh revival, a sign of something to sing
about. A strong Welsh team is good for the game. No one can deny that, not
even an Englishman.

<TEXT>
Right Hon Norman Lamont,
Chancellor of the Exchequer,
11 Downing Street,
London SW1
Dear Chancellor,
There is a rare opportunity for you to please industry and environmentalists
alike in your next Budget. All you need do is remove some of the unjust
financial penalties on those who buy or use cars that save energy and put
less muck into the atmosphere.
When your colleague, Malcolm Rifkind, the Secretary of State for Transport,
addressed the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders last December, he
called for a 40-50 per cent improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency by the
year 2005. He rejected sweeping government restrictions on car use as
'barely worth contemplating' and advocated the development of alternative
fuels.
We have one already; diesel. Diesel-engined cars use a lot less fuel than
their petrol equivalents. Official figures produced by the Department of
Transport put the saving at around 15 per cent. In fact, according to a
report called The Diesel Passenger Car in a Green World, by Britain's
internationally-renowned Ricardo Consulting Engineers, their actual benefits
are twice that.
The official (EC 15-cycle) consumption figures are obtained by testing cars
with fully-warmed engines. In real life the average car journey is under 10
km (six miles) and many start with cold engines. Petrol engines guzzle fuel
while warming and catalytic converters do not work properly until hot. So,
during this time they are uneconomical and their exhausts are dirty.
By contrast, a diesel's consumption is much the same whether warming or at
working temperature, and the exhaust is just as clean. Cleaner and less
damaging to the environment, in fact, than that of a comparable petrol
engine, even one with an elaborate catalytic converter.
Ricardo tested two cars - one with a 1.8-litre petrol engine, the other a
2.5-litre diesel version - for a full year and 30,000 km (18,640 miles) of
urban and rural use. They used petrol at the rate of 10.64 litres per 100 km
(26.55 miles per gallon) but diesel at only 7.89 l/100 km (35.8 mpg). The
real-life saving: 35 per cent - and that is just on fuel. There is a
corresponding reduction in the nasties flowing out of the exhaust.
What financial reward is reaped by the business driver of a diesel car?
Often, it is a thumping increase in personal tax liability.
Drivers who pick a Peugeot 605 SRD turbo-diesel (official average fuel
consumption 41.9 mpg, or 6.74 l/100 km) instead of a two-litre
petrol-engined 605 SLi (29.4 mpg, or 9.6 l/100 km) more than double their
personal income tax liability from Pounds 55.21 to Pounds 114.58 a month.
Their crime: picking a car with an engine a few cubic centimetres over two
litres in cylinder capacity and costing a little more than the magic (and
arbitrary) Pounds 19,250 list price.
There are several ways in which you could remedy this unjust situation. You
could raise the engine capacity tax break on diesels from two litres to 2.5
litres. (A diesel must be bigger than a petrol engine of similar power). The
10 per cent special car tax could be removed or reduced, or the Pounds
19,250 price limit raised, just for diesels.
You would reward, not penalise, those sensible and responsible enough to run
diesels and encourage others to follow their good example.
You might care to note, too, that most EC states have a wider differential
than the UK between petrol and diesel prices. (In France, diesel is
two-thirds the price of unleaded petrol. About 40 per cent of all new cars
there are diesels, compared with under 10 per cent in Britain).
Of course, unleaded petrol is better for the environment than leaded,
particularly in cities. Unleaded is essential if a car is to have an exhaust
catalyser, as all new ones must by January 1 1993. But its benefits have
been exaggerated and its disadvantages - such as higher fuel consumption -
are overlooked.
In the same way, the diesel car's benefits have been overlooked officially.
You have a chance to put that right, Chancellor. A little discrimination in
favour of the diesel car will earn you the thanks (and, perhaps, the votes)
of Britain's growing band of diesel car-users. You will please the
car-makers (all big British-based manufacturers make diesels).
Companies cutting the cost of running business cars will praise you.
Environmentalists - the kind with their feet on the ground - will approve.
Yours sincerely, STUART MARSHALL

FT  18 JAN 92 / Sport (Cricket): The sublime mystery play - The English
cricket season is still some way off. But Teresa McLean has ambitions.
Anxious to spread understanding of the game into Europe's furthest nooks and
crannies, she has addressed herself to cricket's fundamental principles,
particles and mysteries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MYSTERY is a 'hidden or inexplicable matter' (Concise Oxford Dictionary),
so it would seem that attempting to explain one is a waste of time. But a
mystery of the highest order is a 'religious truth divinely revealed,
especially one beyond human reason,' which makes an attempted explanation of
cricket irresistible.
The more one knows about cricket the more mysterious it becomes; the more
mysterious, the more sublime.
And delicious. Take bowling. Batting and bowling are the twin pillars of
cricket, as of all bat and ball games. So far, so simple. But the sunshine
is always speckled in Yorkshire and in cricket the player with the ball can
only bowl, not throw it, to the batsman. This is one of the game's
fundamental principles. The bowler must hurl the hard, heavy, cork,
twine-wound, leather-bound, seam-stitched, red-dyed ball at the batsman
without straightening his arm in the hurl.
If he does straighten his arm, he has thrown instead of bowled, something
any old fool could do, and dishonoured the game. The umpire (of whom more
later) calls no-ball, which disallows that hurl and gives the batting team a
free penalty point, known as a run, because most of the time batsmen have to
run up and down to get them. The side with the most runs wins, but there are
nobler and more energetic ways of getting them than through the bowler's
transgressions.
While the bowling arm must stay straight, by the way, the wrist may
straighten, twiddle or turn as it pleases. Indeed, such achievements are the
pride of spinning skill. Wrist or finger spinners are so called because they
spin the ball, but they may well spin their wrists or fingers in the
process. The more subtleties the better in perfecting such triumphs as 'the
unnatural trouble of screwing the ball out of the back of the hand over a
cocked wrist,' to quote one writer, Donald Woods, on Abdul Qadir's bowling.
Spin bowling is one of cricket's many inducements to poetic - any way,
elaborate - reporting, though its technical language is the poetry of
reticence. Good spinners contrive to make the ball 'stop,' 'come back,'
'stand still,' 'hang,' 'turn,' 'float' or even 'move'. What sweeter
compliments for spin than an expert commentator declaring: 'That one moved]'
England's damp and temperate climate produces more medium pace than spin
bowlers, while the West Indies produce speed. Speedy no-balls are common,
but throwing is rare, almost exotic, among them; most are pedestrian. Last
summer, when the West Indies visited England, an abundance of penalty runs
was given away by bowlers pounding in to bowl at cowering, praying batsmen
and, as they did so, putting a front foot slightly over the line painted at
the end of the wicket (batting strip), the bowler's and batsman's deadline.
This is bowling from too near the victim, which is cheating. A no-ball is
called. There is a simple, conservationist logic behind these no-ball laws.
The mystery lies in their enforcement. It is in the hands of an umpire, the
game's divine force of decision and judgment. 'Hard is the lot of the
arbitrator,' lamented The Field magazine in 1954, writing about umpires,
'for he can seldom please both sides. He can only suffer criticism with
dignity, repudiation with philosophy.'
Quite so. It is to the umpire that appeals for the dismissal (removal,
getting out - different expressions, same deathly event) of batsmen must be
made. Each team has 11 players, some of them bowlers, some batsmen, all
liable to bowling and batting service in their team's hour of need, all
capable of appealing for an opponent's dismissal.
In cricket, an appeal must be made before a decision is made, not after it.
The batsmen bat two at a time, one at each end. Their aim is to score more
runs than their opponents. When a batsman hits the ball well he runs up to
the other end of the wicket, as does his partner at the other end, running
in the opposite direction. He scores one run for every length he runs before
a fielder throws the ball in to the stumps (three close-standing sticks 28
inches tall), which he has been defending with his bat from the bowler's
balls.
These are bowled one after another in sets of six, known as overs. At the
end of an over, another bowler starts another over at the other end. There
are stumps at both ends. The batsman scores four runs every time he hits a
ball off the field of play and six every time he hits a ball off the field
without a bounce.
Bowlers do not like being hit for six. It provokes fiercer efforts to bowl
the batsman out - knock one or both of the bails (little sticks 4 3/8 inches
long) off the top of the stumps, where they lie in a shallow groove, defying
the bowler to displace them.
Cricket is not a metric game. Its measurements abound in pounds and ounces,
feet, inches and yards. The wicket is 22 yards long. When a batsman is out,
he goes off. Sometimes the walk off the field of play can seem a long and
humiliating one to a batsman who is going off. But it makes life easier for
the umpire. Anyone can see when a batsman has been bowled; no appeal is
necessary. The same is usually true when a batsman is caught or finds
himself trapped in one of the more spectacular, bucolic means of
self-dismissal, such as treading on his own stumps or hitting his own bails
off.
For the most part, however, many are the methods and marvels of dismissal,
and the umpire must pass judgment on them all. They are too many and too
complicated to describe, but mention must be made of the most common and
most controversial: lbw (leg before wicket), an umpire's nightmare.
The batsman, reasonably enough, stands in front of the stumps he is
defending, but if a ball is bowled which hits his legs on its way to hitting
the stumps, he is out. The umpire signals this by putting his first finger
in the air. Leg-before decisions range from the easy (plum) to the
mysterious tinged with the mystical.
In March 1903 the Rev Jones of Crowborough, Sussex, was inspired by the
impenetrabilities of lbw variations to preach a sermon on 'lbw, a parable of
the cricket field,' text Matthew XIII, 34.
In case things do start to look simple, there are two umpires in each game,
one at the bowler's end, between him and the stumps; one at the batsman's
end, on the same side as his legs but some distance away, chatting to the
fielders out at grass. This position is known as square leg. All fielding
positions and batting shots side-ways on to the stumps are square, just as
all those almost in line with the stumps are fine.
The close-catching fielder with padded gloves, breathing down the batsman's
neck, is the wicket-keeper and is too straight to be fine. Other fielders
very near the stumps but not fine are silly; fielders far out towards the
boundary are deep or long; those not far out are close or short; those on
the leg side are on the on side; those on the bat side are on the off side.
Hence positions like deep square leg and silly mid-off.
You could almost call it poetry in motion, except that most cricketers spend
so little time in motion. The main pre-occupation of the field of play is
when will it be time for a beer? First-class matches start half-way through
the morning, stop for lunch and again for tea, then stop for the day in the
early evening. Test matches, which decide the might of nations, last for
five days and usually end in a draw.
Cricket is a wondrous game, better loved than studied.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Sport: High risk game for top casinos - Gaming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN GOOD times and in bad, the British love to gamble
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and nowhere more intensely than on the so-called Mayfair strip in London.
The drop, or money exchanged for chips, in London's casinos reached almost
Pounds 1.2bn last year. But the top clubs face an uncertain future.
Casinos in trouble include the Ritz in Piccadilly and Les Ambassadeurs in
Park Lane. They face the ultimate risk: that they may be closed down  - rien
ne va plus - if the police and Gaming Board decide to oppose renewal of
their licences following a dawn raid last June.
The recession has not hurt the gaming industry. High-stakes players such as
Australian tycoon Kerry Packer or Saudi Arabia's 'Mr Fixit', Adnan Kashoggi,
are still often seen at the tables.
The high-rollers come mainly from abroad. The British do not, it seems, have
the money these days to play for life-and-death stakes, as the scions of the
shires did in the heyday of John Aspinall, formerly one of Mayfair's leading
casino proprietors. However, Aspinall is planning a come-back later this
year with a new licence which might well flush out old English money again.
Nowadays it is to the Far East - Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan - that the
casinos look for big-money players. A handful of flamboyant gamblers are
prepared to play off a credit line of six figures and gamble Pounds 500,000
in a weekend.
Betting Pounds 1,000 on an individual number at roulette and covering all
the numbers round it, a player can rake in as much as Pounds 396,000 on a
single coup and put a serious crimp in a casino's finances. If the wrong
number comes up, the player loses Pounds 40,000. Top casinos will take bets
of Pounds 50,000 a hand at punto banco (the British form of baccarat) and
Pounds 10,000 at blackjack.
When one of the internationally-known high rollers comes to town, rival
casinos buzz with excitement. Which club will the player favour? No matter
that such gamblers, if they hit a winning streak, can clear enough to make
or break the house; the action is what counts. If the player returns the
next night the law of probabilities will reward the casino.
It is the competition between casinos to attract high rollers from abroad
that could, in part, explain the present crisis.
The Ritz Club is the most successful casino in London, with an annual profit
of around Pounds 8m. From the famous Ritz bar, with its gilt and mirrors, to
its temple of gaming tables attended by votaries gowned by Yuki in flowing
red silk, it reeks of luxury.
The newly re-opened Les Ambassadeurs, in Hamilton Place at the end of Park
Lane, is a former Rothschild mansion and a celebration of high Victorian
taste. Its restoration cost Pounds 7m, which the company is said to have
recouped in the first three months of play.
Nemesis came out of the blue. London Clubs, owner of these and four other
London casinos, was about to go public with a long-planned share flotation
when, at 3.45am last June 6, 250 police and the entire inspectorate of the
Gaming Board descended on its main casinos.
The police were as discreet as they could be. The gamblers, intent on the
final spin of the wheel before the night was over, were not disturbed.
Instead, as soon as the clubs were empty the police began removing all the
company's files and computer records.
The police said they chose that time so they could remove all the papers
they wanted. Woken from their beds, managers organised copying machines
across the casino floor. Around 50,000-60,000 documents were removed.
What, though, were the police looking for? What would have justified such a
dramatic raid on London's most successful casino group? As yet, there are no
answers.
'We have been waiting for six months but we are still in the dark,' says
London Clubs' management. 'It's a very difficult time for us because we have
2,300 staff who are fearful for their jobs. All we can do is wait it out.'
A decision on whether to proceed against the company will have to be made
shortly, if only because its casino licences come up for renewal in the
spring.
The Gaming Board has given no hint on whether it is worried by so-called
technical issues - complimentary services ('comps') to players or control of
credit and clearing of cheques - such as led to the closure of Playboy's
casino in Park Lane 10 years ago. Such matters are regarded as the
touchstone of good conduct in British casino gambling.
The guiding legal principle is that casinos are prohibited from inducing
players to gamble. But there are grey areas. For instance, it is not clear
how far overseas players may be offered 'comps' such as air fares and hotel
suites.
Casinos from Monte Carlo to Las Vegas to Darwin offer comps as the easiest
way of bringing in good customers. British casinos, striving to compete, are
restricted in what they can offer by way of hospitality. In a celebrated
dictum, the board once suggested diaries and pens as suitable gifts to
favoured customers. In practice, there is no objection to players being
entertained to dinner in the clubs or chauffeured to events such as Ascot or
Wimbledon.
For the past decade, since Coral and Ladbroke were forced to dispose of
their casinos after charges of corruption, the chief danger to the British
casino industry has been its dullness. Now rumours abound, some quite lurid.
It is said that some London casinos are the haunt of call-girls, although
that seems unlikely. There are many pretty women to be seen at the tables;
but any woman can wear a designer dress and carry a Chanel handbag.
In spite of London Clubs' anxiety about its future, the wheels are spinning
as fast as ever. The company hopes to make a profit of more than Pounds 20m
this year. After the raid, the management had an independent check done on
its books and claims to have found no cause for concern.
Whatever happens, the present case is the biggest event to hit British
casinos since the shake-out of Ladbroke and Coral and the departure of
Playboy. The industry is worried about its good name. The threat facing
London Clubs shows that the risks of casino gambling are not all on the
players' side of the table.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Travel: On the very edge of civilisation - To Americans, old
Quebec City is cute. Daniel Green is not so sure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
J'ai quitte mon village
Par le premier bateau
 - Opening lines of a Quebecois rock song.
STAND ON a promontory on the left bank of the St Lawrence. You are just
downstream from the last bridge. Look north, past the rooftops of Quebec
City's old town. The first few miles of countryside in that direction are
cultivated. Beyond, a black forest rises up the slopes of the Laurentian
ridge. On the other side it dips down, out of sight, to another country: a
dimpled plain of wood and water.
Four hundred miles north of Quebec City, the sub-arctic taiga starts and the
moose die of cold. It is another 800 miles to the few Inuit settlements on
the crinkly coastline opposite Baffin Island, where visitors can arrive only
by seaplane or kayak. After that? A desert stretching to Siberia.
Quebec City is at the edge of civilisation. But it thinks it is at its
centre.
Five million French-speaking Quebecois adore their city. Their taxes pay for
a gilt-encrusted parliament building and smart suits for the MPs. Some of
their most talented sons and daughters cannot bear to leave.
To Americans, old Quebec City is cute. Its fortifications, chateau, winding
streets and son et lumieres are picturebook Europe. Wise old-worlders might
more easily see a city hooked on tourist dollars and politicians' expense
accounts. The money has bred self-satisfaction. Add nationalism (and
Catholic guilt?) and you have paranoia: languages other than French are
banned from public notices. Bienvenue, yes. Wilkommen, no.
Out in the countryside, among the 5m, the phenomenon of French North America
is more beguiling. In the farming and fishing towns, adorned with the
belvederes and verandahs of New England-style summerhouses, les anglos seem
far away.
The south shore of the St Lawrence is peppered with mean sounding towns like
Trois Pistoles and Riviere du Loup. They are actually sweet little
agricultural and tourism centres. The loup in Riviere du Loup is not a wolf,
but a fish.
The Auberge Mange Grenouille is a converted village general store by a small
nature reserve in the village of Bic. Its sloping floorboards were as shiny
and new as a Madonna hit record and the chambre nuptiale came complete with
brass bedstead and purple drapes. 'C'est un peu fou, je sais,' shrugged
Madame, a warm round woman with an all-embracing personality that seems both
American and French.
The chambre had no en suite bathroom. A creaking hallway, lined with
wood-framed vignettes of small animals curled up in pools of sand-coloured
light, leds to the loo. The awkward Victorian door knobs conspired to
frustrate any urgency in a stumbling dawn patrol, but the auberge's giant
electronically-controlled whirlpool bath was as seductive as plumbing can
ever be.
The Mange Grenouille is on the south shore of the St Lawrence. The American
shore. Part of a civilised, settled, comfortable continent. The landscape is
farmland. The US is a few miles away, through a panhandle of Nouveau
Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province.
Sept Iles is on the north shore, where the climate is like Mont Blanc's. It
is the last town on the road going east. The frontier.
No one speaks English. Why should they? None of their ancestors spoke
English. Nor do relatives, neighbours or visitors. Les Anglos are further
away than the Shetlands are from Paris. The welcome is warm, if a little
surprised.
There is one maple leaf, on a flag outside the town's hospital. Everywhere
else the fleur de lys flutters: from apartment blocks, schools and the
dozens of video rental hypermarkets.
Fifteen feet of snow fall each year in Sept Iles, by the salt water of the
St Lawrence estuary. In late May, just before the blue whales arrive, the
air still freezes at night. The tourist kayaks stand idle, waiting for the
last ice on the lakes to break up. Renting videos is still big business.
There is a railhead at Sept Iles. The single track line goes north, inland.
It leads to a settlement called Fermont, whose literal translation,
Ironmountain, describes one of the land's natural riches. Like Quebec City,
Fermont has fortifications; unlike Quebec City, the defensive wall was built
before the houses. It keeps the wind out.
I missed the train to Fermont by eight hours. The next one was six days
later. Maybe I was lucky.
Daniel Green was a guest of the tourist offices of the provinces of Quebec
and Ontario. He travelled with Air Canada (London tel: 081-759 2636) to
Montreal.
Return fares range from Pounds 258 and Pounds 368, for east and west coasts
respectively, to Pounds 3,288 and Pounds 4,126.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Travel: The peak of skiing perfection - There are few
resorts anywhere that Arnold Wilson has not cruised, sped or fallen through.
So we asked him to pick his ten favourites. This is his selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT MAKES a ski resort special? Some would say spectacular, steep and
challenging runs; others would go for exhilarating cruising runs or
delightful nursery slopes.
Others would insist on a picturesque village half-buried in a blanket of
snow beneath a star-spangled sky - the quintessential Austrian hamlet, for
example. Sensual apres ski - tribal gyrations in a frenetic, overtly sexual
disco atmosphere - would be top of some holidaymakers' lists.
In theory, a top resort should meet all these criteria. Few do, although
some US resorts like Sun Valley, Vail, Taos and Jackson Hole have tried to
establish a European-American melange with some success.
The French resort of Val d'Isere, with its huge network of lifts, superb
selection of blue and black runs, excellent off-piste powderfields, gullies
and couloirs is, by common consent among good skiers, one of the greatest
ski resorts in the world - many would say the best. And the nightlife
throbs. But pretty it is not. Nor, to be fair, is it particularly ugly, but
it is linked with Tignes, which is.
On the other hand, there are several Austrian villages (Alpbach is a prime
example) which epitomise Austrian charm and gemutlichkeit and have pleasant
nursery skiing, although very little for experts. St Anton, however, has
spectacular skiing and scenery, if nowhere near as much charm, unless you
count its idyllic little satellite, St Christoph, cocooned in deep snow like
a dish of profiteroles with too much cream.
By contrast, Kitzbuhel has enormous charm when the atmosphere is not being
shattered by rowdy and sometimes inebriated Scandinavians. This most
attractive of towns has walled and cobbled streets, clustered gabled houses
and colour-washed facades and arches. But it also has something of a snow
problem. Built at a mere 800 metres, it is fortunate to get as much snow as
it does (it is in a 'snow hole').
St Moritz may be a predictable selection, but it has an enormous choice of
skiing with six distinct areas encompassing almost every kind of skiing
terrain, from the warm, fairly gentle slopes of Corviglia to sterner stuff
at Lagalb, Diavolezza and Corvatch, where steep runs and exotic scenery
combine to produce the much sought-after skiing cocktail of physical and
visual stimulation.
The atmosphere in the town itself is also stimulating, but surprisingly
unstuffy and friendly for a resort so steeped in the history of winter
sports and so heavily infiltrated by generations of glitterati. You can
study the affluent residents and guests quite cheaply from any number of
tea-rooms, but you must sample at least one dinner at the Palace and another
at the more reserved and more elderly Kulm with its countless glass cases
packed with trophies from the celebrated Cresta run, which descends partly
through the hotel grounds.
Zermatt, with the Matterhorn, is another Swiss resort that cannot be
excluded. There is hardly a mountain nation that does not seek to syphon off
some of the Matterhorn's mystical allure by dubbing one of its own mountains
'our Matterhorn.'
With three major ski areas spread about its perimeter, Zermatt has no
shortage of excellent slopes, plus more mountain restaurants (about 30 last
time I counted) than any ski resort in the Alps. The traffic-free main
street lined with superb hotels such as the Mont Cervin, Monte Rosa,
Zermatterhoff and Schweizerhof, has charm, elegance and luxury.
Aficionados of Argentiere would be speechless if this cult resort were left
out, although its appeal - it has beautiful and challenging off-piste
skiing, some of it teetering on the very edge of the Argentiere glacier - is
almost exclusively orientated towards strong skiers. The famous Pas de
Chevre is a giant leap for a goat, never mind a skier. Although there are a
few funky bars in the narrow, Wild West-style main street, most of the
apres-ski is down the road at neighbouring Chamonix.
Courchevel is another classic, with plenty of smart restaurants, shops and
hairdressers: almost anything that you might seek in Paris has already been
transported there. It also has a more-than-comprehensive network of lifts,
beautifully groomed slopes and enough skiing to last a fortnight without
even venturing into neighbouring Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens.
In North America, Jackson Hole scores heavily on all fronts, particularly
scenery (the Teton range is quite startling, especially in contrast to the
vast, flat valley floor) and exciting skiing (it does not get much steeper
or more rugged in the Rockies).
Although discos are out, there is great fun to be had in the town of
Jackson, where wooden sidewalks and cowboy bars remind you of a score of
Hollywood westerns. (One of the most famous, Shane, was shot locally). In
the skiing area at Teton Village, the Mangy Moose is the big attraction. The
unfortunate creature after which this establishment was named hangs, forlorn
and stuffed, from the rafters, giving revellers an unseemly view of its
undercarriage.
The skiing at Jackson is outstanding, with wonderful cruising trails that
are wide and steep. Fast skiers can beat Jackson's famous tram down from the
top of Rendezvous Mountain if they can better 4,000 vertical feet in 12
minutes. There are innumerable chutes and gullys, plus the superb Hobacks -
the steep, wide-ranging flanks of the mountain that can keep powder skiers
in a frenzy for run after run.
Telluride, a remote and atmospheric old town in south- west Colorado, evokes
the old mining days like nowhere else in the US. In particular, Main Street,
with its smoky Last Dollar Saloon, is un-nervingly unchanged since Butch
Cassidy robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank 100 years ago. The skiing is sheer
joy for intermediates and experts, with wide-open, steep runs cut through
the trees, some outstanding off-piste and beautiful views.
Aspen writes its own name in any list of Top Ten resorts. It is unique. The
skiing, with some good fast cruising runs and some very tricky chutes, may
not be quite the ultimate in the US, but if you add Aspen Highlands' wild
ridges and Snowmass's more challenging terrain and long 'motorway' trails,
you would be hard-pressed to beat it.
Add in Aspen's 100 restaurants and glitzy mix of celebrities, colourful
history and inspirational scenery and you have an outstanding resort.
Apologies to Vail, but having only been conceived in the early 1960s it does
not have Aspen's patina or cachet.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Quattro - a spreadsheet with
class - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS April 1991 and What Micro? magazine is handing out its awards for the
year's top software packages. In the Professional Spreadsheet category we
read that 'Borland's Quattro Pro 2 is steadily eroding Lotus 1-2-3's market
share on character-based DOS machines  .. For those with low-end PCs and
text-only displays, Quattro Pro 2 is now the one to buy and a worthy
runner-up to the more flashy graphics-based leaders.'
What Micro?'s award comes as no surprise. Since its introduction in 1989,
Quattro Pro 2 has sold more than 1m and gained 40 industry awards
world-wide. In 1990, Infoworld magazine made it Spreadsheet Product of the
Year; in 1991, it was the Readers' Choice in Byte magazine. Naturally, with
that sort of pedigree Quattro Pro 2 does not come cheap: Pounds 395 plus
VAT.
It is now September 1991 and Borland is pleased to announce the release of
Quattro Pro Special Edition, for the home and small business, at Pounds
49.95. Obviously, you might think, at one-eighth the price of its big
brother it can offer only a fraction of the features. In the computer world,
though, things are not always as they seem. In fact, Quattro Pro 2 and
Quattro Pro SE are one and the same product.
With the quiet drop in price of Quattro Pro, there is now an embarrassment
of riches in the world of cheap spreadsheets. The market leader has always
been Lotus 1-2-3, but its price of Pounds 295 surely looks unsustainable
when set against Pounds 49 for Quattro Pro and Pounds 79 for another
award-winning spreadsheet, Supercalc 5 (itself drastically reduced from
Pounds 395 late in 1990). Nor should you forget As Easy As, a 'shareware'
spreadsheet also awarded a prize by What Micro? and costing only Pounds 45.
All three of these packages offer splendid value - but which one should you
buy? All are 'Lotus-compatible' in that they can read and write 1-2-3 files,
but Quattro Pro and As Easy As (hence its name) go further and operate in
virtually the same way as 1-2-3. Anyone who learns his spreadsheets on
Quattro Pro or As Easy As will easily master 1-2-3, and vice-versa.
Of the three, however, there is a decisive argument in favour of choosing
Quattro Pro SE - its 'pull-down' menu structure. Based on a 'menu bar' which
runs across the top of the screen, this structure rapidly is becoming
industry standard. It conforms to CUA, the Common User Access style
developed by IBM and adopted by Microsoft in its 'Windows' operating system.
Virtually all new packages now conform to CUA.
If, after buying Quattro Pro SE, you get a word-processing package, the
chances are that it will look very similar and, consequently, will be easy
to learn. By contrast, Supercalc and As Easy As are idiosyncratic in
structure; in a sense, anyone who chooses them is leaving the mainstream of
present day standards. The clincher for Quattro Pro is its documentation. In
a very sensible move, Borland has taken a third-party self-teach book from
Sybex and re-badged it as its own manual. It is too long, but it contains
plenty of tutorial material and is far more helpful than the documentation
usually produced by the software companies.
So, not only is Quattro Pro SE a bargain at Pounds 49 but, within the price,
it also throws in a self-teach book that would normally cost you Pounds 20.
By the way, people invariably talk about spreadsheets as number crunchers.
They are not. They are information managers and, with database features, can
be equally valuable for handling text as well as numbers. After you have got
your bearings, make a point of going to chapter 14 of the manual, 'Building
a Spreadsheet Database,' which shows you how to set up a database of names
and addresses, and how to sort and extract records.
Conclusion: Quattro Pro 2 is a beautifully-crafted piece of software, state
of the art in design but very easy to use. It fully deserved its 40 industry
awards when it was a top-of-the-range product costing Pounds 395. At this
Special Edition price of Pounds 49.95, it is an irresistible bargain.
(Quattro Pro Spreadsheet Special Edition is available from retailers such as
Dixons and Wildings, or ring Borland on 0734-321 150).

FT  18 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The hard slog of sharing the
rural good life - Nick Garnett looks at the inns and outs of life in North
Yorkshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSEDALE Abbey, a village on the edge of the North Yorkshire moors, nestles
in the kind of secluded valley that makes much of the British countryside so
beautiful. For Terry and Joan Bentley, who bought the Milburn Arms hotel 15
months ago, living there in the seclusion of Rosedale is a joy. But it
carries a penalty.
Rosedale's relative isolation means there are no large population centres
nearby and winters can be tough. 'People have to make a conscious decision
to come to Rosedale. There is no passing trade,' says Terry. 'One thing that
has surprised me is the tremendous difference between peak and low seasons.
The winter is a struggle.'
Yet, despite the Gulf war and recession - which combined to lower turnover
20 per cent below target in the Bentleys' first year at the Milburn Arms -
they are delighted to own the 11-bedroom, 18th-century inn. 'It has been
more difficult than we expected but we are glad we purchased it. It has a
lot of potential. The product is 80 per cent right and all we need is a
better general trading environment,' says Terry.
Until 1988, he had been international sales manager for Portakabin in York
and then overseas manager for Dexion, a materials-handling company. 'We'd
spent so much of our married life apart. We sat down one Christmas and
decided we'd do something else.'
The couple bought a small hotel outside York in 1988 and, after a
speculative offer, sold it at a profit the following year. Having been
gazumped by Pounds 30,000 on another hotel, they purchased the Milburn Arms
in October 1990, having known the previous owner.
They paid several hundred thousand pounds ('though quite a bit below half a
million') for the handsome, stone- built hotel and six acres of farming
land. Of the purchase price, just 27 per cent was borrowed - from the
Skipton building society. 'Banks really are not too helpful,' says Terry.
'We took a commercial loan from the building society. They were much more
competitive and interested.' The Bentleys also had Pounds 35,000 in cash
earmarked as a trading float to get the new business up and running.
Terry stresses the importance of preparation: 'People should not go in
blind.' The accountant he used knows the hotel and entertainment industry
very well. 'He picked the previous owner's balance sheet apart. He was in
tune with the issue of margins in different areas of the business - the bar,
the restaurant, and so on. Having an accomplished accountant is very
important.'
Terry had three months' training in hotel management in the 1970s. When he
bought his first hotel four years ago, he took a three-month residential
course supported by the recently-disbanded Hotel and Catering Training
Board.
You cannot be prepared for everything, though. The recession, Gulf war and a
blizzard at the end of 1990 - which took out electric power for a week -
dented trade seriously. In their first year to October 1991, the Bentleys
were Pounds 80,000 adrift on the previous year and 20 per cent below their
original target of a turnover of just under Pounds 400,000. The bed
occupancy rate has been running at below 60 per cent against the 85 per cent
the Bentleys hope to achieve. 'The recession has bit a lot harder than we
thought and we are not out of it by a long chalk,' says Terry.
The hotel purchase did come with certain benefits, however. High among them
were two trained chefs, who were retained by the Bentleys. Using a mixture
of permanent and casual staff, the hotel's annual wage bill is between
Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 80,000. Staff accommodation absorbs six rooms aside
from the 11 for letting.
The Milburn Arms makes a big play of its food. The bar menu includes
hazelnut and brown rice bake, smoked mackerel and brandy pate, and shellfish
and halibut hotpot. The five-course evening meal in the restaurant (tiger
prawn tails, fillet of beef with Stilton sauce) arrives with a fixed price
of Pounds 16.50. Vegetables are bought fresh from a local wholesaler, game
is acquired from farms, and fresh fish is delivered by van twice a week from
Whitby.
One other benefit was that the previous owner had converted and extended the
place, including turning some stock barns into bedrooms. All letting rooms
are doubles with full en-suite bathrooms; they are finished in such woods as
teak and pine.
The dining room is on two levels and looks out on open country. Although
there is central heating, the Milburn has three open fires fuelled by coal
and logs.
There is one structural problem. The inn is also the village pub and the
large, smoky bar with its heavily-occupied pool table does not offer the
kind of venue for eating that all overnight stayers appreciate. Then, too,
there is competition from the bar of the White Horse Farm hotel, the
village's other inn. So, the Bentleys are planning to add a residents' bar
as well as a conference centre. The Milburn's real-ale bar is crucial,
providing more than 40 per cent of total turnover. Bed and breakfast costs
Pounds 28.50 a person with a single occupancy supplement of Pounds 7.50.
The hotel uses an advertising agency and also pays around Pounds 1,000 a
year to be part of the Consort Hotel and Wayfarer Inn group. Membership of
this chain of independent hotels and inns provides some advertising at
competitive rates.
Terry is hoping to tighten the management belt and generate a small profit
this year. This is being done partly through better cost controls and
reducing food wastage by, for example, buying cuts of meat that can be used
in a variety of dishes.
Such attempts at cost control make the new uniform business rate even more
galling. The present rate of Pounds 3,000 has risen to Pounds 10,000 and
will increase steadily over the next few years, something against which the
Bentleys are appealing. 'The uniform business rate is disgusting,' says
Terry. 'It has ruined a lot of small businesses.'
Despite the drawbacks, the Milburn Arms does provide a reasonable living and
staffing levels have allowed the Bentleys to take holidays. It has been
included in such publications as the Consumers Association's Good Hotel
Guide but the couple are looking for something that will get the business
moving a bit quicker.
'Unless you get a Michelin star or an AA rosette, it can be a long climb,'
Terry says.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): A prized inheritance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YEARS ago my wife's father bought premium bonds (Pounds 25 each) for our
three children. With their agreement the bonds were replaced by Pounds 75
worth in my name, to achieve equal benefit from any large win, which is what
their grandfather would have wished.
Now we see that a win could be liable to inheritance tax. Can the bonds, or
replacements in joint names be put into a trust to benefit only the
children, with access to any income?
From what you say it seems that the bonds are already held on trust for the
three children as joint beneficiaries. If so this should be confirmed in a
declaration of trust made by the bond-holders. If not, they can be put into
trust, but only with the agreement of anyone who might be entitled to a
specified bond, or its winnings. There should be no income from such a
trust.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS regularly need to establish acquisition costs of their equity
holdings for estimating capital gains. When various classes of shares, scrip
issues and warrants etc. are involved, this can be a difficult and
time-consuming problem. Are there any references that list and update this
information on a regular basis?
In a local library, look for either the Extel Capital Gains Tax Service
published by Extel Financial Ltd or Stubbs Adjusted 31.3.82 Base date Prices
published by Dunn &amp; Bradstreet International. The cost of both services puts
them out of the reach of most private investors.

protection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I UNDERSTAND that if a building society failed, the deposit protection
scheme would reimburse the first 90 per cent of deposits up a maximum of
Pounds 20,000 per individual.
My wife and I have a joint building society account. If our society were to
fail, would we each be eligible to receive the first 90 per cent of
deposits? Would it be better to have separate accounts?
Each of you is entitled to the full protection so long as the joint account
is not held for only one of the account holders beneficially. It is not
material whether there are two separate accounts or one joint account held
for the two account holders beneficially.

wife
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I own our house as joint tenants, under a deed of gift set up
when we were married. As we get older, it will become more advantageous to
own the property as tenants-in-common.
Do we need to get a solicitor to draw up formal deeds to alter the method of
ownership or will a simple statement, suitably witnessed, be sufficient?
Do I need to lodge such a statement with the Land Registry, and with the
building society which holds the deeds as security for the mortgage?
You do not need a witnessed document, or a solicitor. One of you should
write a letter to the other stating 'I hereby give you notice of severance
of the joint tenancy under which we hold the property (description) to the
intent that we shall henceforth hold that property on trust for ourselves as
tenants in common in equity'. You should apply to the Land Registry to enter
a restriction to reflect this, supplying a photocopy of the letter. It is
wise for the recipient to sign an acknowledgement of receipt of the letter.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Darts beat the experts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIRECTORS are still in front, but it has been a very poor period for our
portfolios. In July, we used four methods to construct portfolios for the
private investor. After three months, three portfolios were making profits
and beating the FT-A All-Share Index. But after six months, all four are
losing money and are lagging behind the All-Share, which dropped just 2.7
per cent over the period.
To the amateur investor, the most encouraging news must be that the experts'
portfolio has now fallen behind the dartboard portfolio, which was chosen by
throwing darts at the share price pages of the Financial Times, making a
random selection of shares.
The dartboard portfolio was the best of the four over the October to January
period, despite the presence of TVS Entertainment, the television group
which has lost its franchise. The 84 per cent decline in TVS's share price
is largely responsible for the decline in the value of this portfolio.
A number of investment trusts gave the dartboard portfolio stability and
some useful income. However, one change has had to be made. Precious Metals
Trust has been wound up and the proceeds were reinvested, at the behest of
the darts, in EMAP, the printing and publishing company.
The selections of the experts, a mixture of analysts and private client
stockbrokers, suffered because of two stocks - Hillsdown and Tarmac. The
demerger of Vodafone from Racal Electronics means that there are 11 stocks
in this portfolio.
The lead of the directors' portfolio has been achieved despite one or two
handicaps. The shares were acquired not on the day the directors bought
them, but just before the purchases were tabulated by Directus in the
Weekend FT.
The result was that many of the shares were bought after their prices had
already risen in reaction to news of the purchases. Nevertheless, we wanted
to buy the shares at the same price as a private investor using the Directus
table might do so.
Again, losses on two particular stocks, ADT and Albrighton, were largely
responsible for the portfolio's decline. However, the October-January period
was still disappointing, with the group showing a 15 per cent decline over
the period.
But the biggest disaster has to be the high yield portfolio, down 18 per
cent in six months and 20 per cent over the last three. The fact that a
stock has a high yield inevitably means that it carries a high risk - as
investors have discovered at the Lep group, Ratners and TVS, all of which
have fallen more than 80 per cent.
The rationale for choosing a high yield portfolio is based on the hope that
the markets will have over-estimated the risks. If companies can maintain
their dividends, in spite of market fears, then investors will profit both
from the high income and from a capital gain.
So far, although the portfolio has the highest income and, in Anglia TV, the
single best performing share of the four groups, the losers have far
outstripped the winners.
It is still early days, but what lessons can be drawn from the performance
of the portfolios so far? The first is that avoiding losers is probably more
important than picking winners. Even a portfolio of 10 stocks is not
widespread enough to safeguard against this risk.
The second moral follows on from the first. Given the difficulty of stock
selection and the need to amass a substantial portfolio to reduce the effect
of single company disasters, most investors are likely to be better off with
the built-in diversification of a unit or investment trust.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The bright side of life - How to . . .
obtain the right insurance cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU ARE probably groaning already. Thanks to salesmen, most people know how
to buy life insurance. Over-selling has given the product a bad name.
But that does not mean that the product is not worth having. Just make sure
you do not wait until a salesman contacts you before buying life cover. Work
out your own requirements. Then decide which cover, if any, is the most
appropriate for you. Finally, go to an independent intermediary, who can
look for the best rate.
The life industry is fiercely competitive, so shopping around will always be
worthwhile. Also, make sure to check how much life cover you have through
your employer. Many companies will insure your life for two or three times
salary, which reduces your need for extra cover.
There are two events in your life when you will probably most need cover -
when you buy a house, and when you become a parent.
Mortgage lenders are not happy about lending money if they have to bear the
risk that you will die before it is paid off. In any case, you will want to
buy life cover for at least the cost of the house.
Once you have children, it would be irresponsible not to cover your life.
Quite how much cover you need is a moot point, however, and the best way to
approach it is to work out how much money your children would need to
continue their lifestyle if you were to die.
There are other uses for life assurance products in more complicated
financial planning packages - but this article assumes that all you want to
do is cover your life.
Life products come in three basic forms:
Term Assurance is the most similar to a straightforward general insurance
contract. You insure against dying within a fixed term of years. If you
survive the term, the insurance company pockets all the premiums you have
paid in. If you die, the company pays your next-of-kin an amount agreed at
the beginning of the policy.
Whole-of-Life Assurance, as its name implies, lasts for the whole of your
life. This makes it a very different beast from general insurance, because
there is no 'risk' involved as to the final pay-out - the underwriters know
you are going to die, and that some time sooner or later they will have to
pay out. Unlike term assurance, you can cancel a whole-of-life policy and
recoup some of the money paid in as premiums.
Endowments have elements of both. They cover your life for a fixed term,
like term assurance. But they guarantee to pay you the sum assured at the
end of the term, even if you are still alive. Life companies invest the
premiums for a profit, so it soon became the custom to pay out the sum
assured along with the profits made on it at the end of the term. This led
to the term 'with-profits'. Unit-linked endowments are also available.
Which is the most appropriate? If you want to protect your children, then
the straightforward term assurance is the best bet. With luck, they will be
over the age of 50 before you die, and will not be in great need of a
pay-out from a whole-of-life policy. Term assurance allows you to cover only
the vital period before they gain their financial independence.
The gap in premiums paid for term and endowment policies is large. For
example, from Pearl Assurance, the monthly premium for a 29-year-old man
taking out 25-year term insurance for Pounds 50,000 is Pounds 18, or Pounds
21.50 if he smokes. The premium for the same man to take out the same amount
of cover via an endowment would be Pounds 62.50.
Endowments often turn out to be a good investment, but that is no reason to
take on extra outlay when you will probably be spending a lot on such items
as nappies and baby food.
So all you need to do is insure yourself against dying within a certain
term. Working out the precise term is a difficult and personal decision. The
rules of thumb used by Peter Hargreaves, of Hargreaves Lansdown, are to look
for about a 15-year term for the mother, as children above this age are not
liable to need expensive nannying and supervision. For the higher earner -
mother or father - he suggests an 18-year term, which should see the
children through until they leave school.
Insurance companies are unlikely to leave it as simple as this. For example,
you can take out two individual policies, or joint life assurance, which
pays out on the first death. This might be a cheaper alternative - seek
quotes for both.
Then, you might opt to take the cover in the form of a regular income,
rather than one lump sum. Either option might make sense - again, get your
broker to obtain quotes.
Decide how much you can pay in the next few years. It is not always a good
idea to go for the cheapest offer, as it might cost more in the long run.
But if your cash flow is a problem, insurers do offer low-start policies.
The options might include:
Taking out insurance only for a short term (for example five years), putting
up with the fact that premiums will be slightly higher when the next term
starts in five years' time, and that you will not be able to take out cover
if your health has declined significantly.
Convertible term assurance, which insures you for a short term but give you
the right to convert into an endowment or a whole-of-life policy. You have
guaranteed reinsurability - if you become uninsurable (for example because
of a heart attack) during the first five-year term you can still take out
more insurance.
Renewable term cover, also buys guaranteed reinsurability, and the right to
continue term assurance without having a medical test. Several advisers,
such as Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, are keen on this option as a
more long-sighted way of saving cash flow.
The renewable option certainly starts cheaper. According to Baronworth, an
Ilford-based independent adviser, the best rate for a 29-year-old
non-smoking man taking out 25-year cover of Pounds 50,000 is Pounds 6.60 per
month from Premium Life. But this is a renewable contract - it might
increase after five years. Other strong renewable offers come from Albany
Life (Pounds 10 premium for Pounds 62,992 cover) and Legal &amp; General (Pounds
10.60 for Pounds 50,000).
The cheapest fixed-rate cover came from Permanent (Pounds 10.20), followed
by Norwich Union (Pounds 11.70) and Commercial Union (Pounds 12.00). If you
can, take out insurance for the full term you require from the beginning.
Follow these guidelines and you will have fulfilled your responsibilities to
your family. Whatever you do, do not confirm the old salesman's adage: 'Life
insurance isn't bought - it needs to be sold.'

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Final call for power shares payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in National Power and Powergen, the two electricity generating
companies, will have received letters this week asking them to pay the
second and final instalments on their shares.
Most investors received 300 shares in last year's flotation, split in the
ratio of 186 National Power to 114 Powergen. The amount you pay will depend
on whether you opted for the discount, or the bonus shares, at the time of
the offer. Those who opted for the bonus will have to pay the full
instalment of 75p per share - a total of Pounds 225 on a typical 300 share
allocation.
If you opted for the discount, you will save 14p per share, which means that
the typical investor will have to pay Pounds 183, a saving of Pounds 42.
Payment, which must be made by cheque, should be sent to the address shown
on the notice. Separate cheques must be sent in respect of each company and
of each family member who holds shares.
If you have not paid by February 4, you could lose your rights to the shares
and the incentives. You will receive a refund of only your original payment
of 100p per share - and lose your subsequent profits. To allow time for the
cheques to clear, make sure they arrive by January 30.
Those who want sell their shares without paying the second instalment must
do so before January 27, when the shares start trading in their full-paid
form.
Anyone who owns generator shares and has not received their instalment
demand, or who has a detailed query, can call the registrars of the
companies on helplines. For National Power, call Lloyds Bank on 021-433
4466; for Powergen, call National Westminster Bank on 0272-465511.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AFTER Christmas we noted the very substantial volume of buying by
directors during December which, when combined with the dismal state of the
market, led us to suggest that the market was overdue for a recovery. That
is precisely what has happened, but judging from this week's table it may
prove short-lived.
Two sales of 50,000 shares at 347p by Stephen Zimmerman, deputy chairman of
Mercury Asset Management, follow a pattern of steady selling by directors
since interim results were announced in mid-November. Mercury Asset
Management, which is 75 per cent owned by S G Warburg, has benefited from
last year's more buoyant stock market conditions.
Christian Salvesen, the Scottish-based distribution group, has weathered the
recession well: the shares have risen by 50 per cent over the last year.
Andrew Salvesen, a non-executive director, and part of the founding family,
has sold more than 1m shares at 242p, close to its all-time peak.
Back in March last year five directors of Strong &amp; Fisher, the leather
producer, bought shares at 25p. The shares have risen sharply since then,
but Geoffrey Andrew, a non-executive director, has bought a further 100,000
at between 33p and 34p.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: More BES offers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Business Expansion Scheme is back, write John Authers and Paul
Cheeseright.
New offers include: Auction Raider, a 'scavenging' company from Neill Clerk,
which will buy repossessed properties at auctions; Cavendish Home
Investments, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, which will buy properties as
part of a mortgage rescue scheme for The Mortgage Corporation; Kerrington
Developments III, a North London property company sponsored by Johnson Fry;
London Repossessions Fund, sponsored by Close Brothers, which will buy
repossessed homes within the M25 area, and Johnson Fry Cash Backed High
Growth Scheme, which will buy accommodation for the University of Ulster.
This has tried to address worries about the security of BES companies by
arranging for the university to buy a five-year Certificate of Deposit to
cover all liabilities to BES shareholders.
There is also one trading company - Racom Electronics, a Newbury-based
company specialising in car alarms and electronic systems. It is now rare
for manufacturers to use the BES, but Racom plans to raise the maximum
Pounds 750,000 permitted, without a sponsor. It is already trading, and in
the financial year to March 1991, it made pretax profits of Pounds 48,000 on
turnover of Pounds 2.15m.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: BCCI payouts are nearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDATION this week of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
means that the process of compensating depositors can start at last.
Under the UK's deposit protection scheme, sterling depositors can claim 75
per cent of their money up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. This means that
someone with Pounds 12,000 in his account will receive Pounds 9,000 but
those with more than Pounds 20,000 will get no more than Pounds 15,000.
Those whose deposits were not in sterling are not covered by the scheme,
even if their accounts were held in the UK.
Last July, the Deposit Protection Board (DPB) sent 40,000 claim forms to
those with sterling deposits held with BCCI in the UK. (In fact, the
liquidators later calculated that the number of depositors is 32,000, the
higher figure resulting from duplication of accounts).
Only 12,500 have been returned so far and 10,000 have been processed. Anyone
who has not received the form should telephone the board's helpline on
071-601-3050. Those who have yet to complete it should do so immediately and
return it to the board at 19 Old Jewry, London EC2R 8HA.
Compensation payments cannot be made until depositors have also registered
their debt with the liquidators in accordance with a provision in the
Banking Act. This means filling in another form, which will be sent to
depositors within a week by the four partners at Touche Ross who have been
appointed joint liquidators.
They stress that creditors should 'take no action until they receive an
official communication.' These forms could not be sent out earlier because
Touche Ross acted only as provisional liquidator pending BCCI's formal
wind-up. Once the DPB receives confirmation about the eligibility of
depositors, compensation payments can start to be made. This could be within
a couple of months.
Compensation will be paid to individual depositors. If one depositor had
seven accounts, he would still be eligible for only 75 per cent of their
total. But in the case of a joint account, each individual would be eligible
for compensation.
Creditors who accepted the Pounds 3,000 emergency payment provided by the
Bank of England will find this sum deducted from their compensation.
Meanwhile, the liquidators are still negotiating with the government of Abu
Dhabi about additional compensation.
Touche Ross says the plan is to pay those eligible globally by up to 40 per
cent of their deposits. However, the DPB would be entitled first to the
amount it had paid out. In other words, if someone in the UK had deposits of
Pounds 100,000 in BCCI, he would have received the maximum Pounds 15,000
from the DPB. A further Pounds 40,000 would become available, assuming the
talks with the Abu Dhabi government come to fruition.
The DPB would be entitled to Pounds 15,000 of this and the customer would
receive Pounds 25,000, bringing his total compensation to Pounds 40,000. The
liquidators hope to conclude the deal with Abu Dhabi by the end of the
month.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: A red light on cheque clearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU find your bank account on the verge of going into the red, trying to
remedy the situation with a quick injection of funds will often fail.
The main barrier is the three-day clearing system through which the 10m
cheques that are written every day in the UK are processed. This involves
the physical movement of cheques transferred from the drawer's bank to the
payee's bank.
Assume, for example, that a customer with a Barclays account writes a cheque
to his friend, who has an account with National Westminster. The friend pays
in the cheque at his branch and it is sent that night, together with its
credit slip, to NatWest's London clearing department.
Overnight, the cheques are separated into those drawn on NatWest and those
drawn on other banks. The latter, like the Barclays cheque, are sent to the
Bankers Clearing House in Lombard Street, London, the following morning (day
two). Those cheques drawn on NatWest are processed within the clearing
department itself.
The cheques and credits at the Bankers Clearing House are exchanged,
processed and put into bags at the end of day two to be taken to the
relevant branch of Barclays. When it arrives on day three, Barclays will
theoretically examine the cheque to verify the signature and authenticity.
In practice, banks rarely find this worthwhile if the cheque is for less
than Pounds 1,000.
The amount of the cheque would then be debited from the Barclays customer's
account. However, it may not be until the following day (day four) that the
payee finds he can draw on the credit at NatWest. The customer would have
been better off paying the cheque into a branch other than his own - his
account would then be credited on day three rather than day four.
If you have more than one account, you might think it would be quicker to
shift money from one to another in order to avoid going into the red.
However, a cheque drawn on your branch will be debited on that day but would
not be credited into your other account until day three.
The money sits in the float of a bank as an 'uncleared effect'. Since it is
estimated that there is some Pounds 10bn in uncleared effects, it is not
surprising that 'the float has been a basic source of banking income,'
according to Richard Tyson-Davies, head of public affairs at the Association
for Payment Clearing Systems (APACS) the umbrella body for the industry.
Trying to shore up your account with cash can be just as ineffective unless
you can pay it into your own branch. A reader complains of Barclays that
'when you pay in cash to a branch other than your own, it takes two working
days before you receive credit to your account. While I realise cheques have
to be cleared, cash does not.'
Barclays is not the exception but the rule. The other three of the Big Four,
Midland, Lloyds and National Westminster, all take two to three to clear
cash if it is paid into a branch other than the customer's. Midland says
that its system does not distinguish between cash and cheque credits.
Barclays, while arguing that its clearing system does differentiate, 'is
still unable to give same day value for deposits made at branches away from
the main account.'
The bank says that when cash is paid in at a branch other than the account
holder's, a credit slip has to be filled in and this then runs through the
same three day clearing cycle as a cheque. A same day service is available -
but for a charge of Pounds 10 per transaction. 'These days few people pay in
cash,' said a spokesman for Barclays, 'and the majority of those that do,
pay in to their own branch.'
Those customers who disagree may like to know that of the banks, TSB and
Abbey National will credit your account immediately wherever a cash deposit
is made. Both use an on-line real-time system which makes available customer
details through a centralised computer. By contrast, traditional banks
operate through a branch network rather than through a central system. The
downside is that cash debits from your account are made just as quickly.
Girobank also provides a quicker paying in service for cash. Cash deposits
are recorded in the Post Office and are sent in an overnight pouch to
Girobank's processing centre at Bootle, Merseyside. Your account will be
credited the next day.
NatWest says that many people erroneously assume that cash is worth more to
a bank than a cheque. 'Cash is not worth anything when it is paid in unless
we can use it,' said a spokesman for the bank. 'It takes 2 1/2 days for the
bank to get value from cash - we would have to make a commercial decision
whether to give value to the customer rather than to ourselves.'
TSB acknowledges that it developed its system out of necessity when it was a
savings bank. Depositors could not be overdrawn and the bank needed a
computerised system to keep track of their balances. 'We think it brings
tremendous benefits to our customers,' said the bank.
Most building societies also operate an on-line service that allows them to
credit and debit cash immediately, although cheques go through a slower
process. Since few building societies are clearers, they use the services of
one of the clearing banks.
Practice varies between building societies but many take 10 days before
allowing you to draw on funds deposited by cheque on investment accounts,
although interest will often start accruing on the amount from the night it
is paid in.
The Clearing System
Day One
Customer at Bank A pays into his account a cheque drawn on bank B.
Cheques for customers at that branch of Bank A are retained, as are cheques
encashed at that branch. Other cheques are sent at the end of the day to
Bank A's London Clearing Department.
Cheques are divided overnight into those drawn on Bank A and those drawn on
other banks. The latter are sorted into bundles for the other banks.
Day Two
Cheques and credits drawn on other banks are sent in the morning to the
Bankers Clearing House in Lombard Street, London.
The sorted bundles are exchanged, processed at the Clearing House and sent
to the branches concerned.
Day Three
Bank B receives the cheque, verifies its authenticity and debits the
account.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (Diary of a Private Investor):
Takeovers hit right key - Small companies were a boon in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JANUARY is a good time for reviewing a previous year's investments and
digesting the lessons. Somewhat surprisingly, 1991 turned out to be quite
good for takeovers and I benefited from three - all small companies.
I first became attracted to Herrburger Brooks, a piano keyboard
manufacturer, in 1985. I felt that its specialist industry provided scope
for rationalisation. Also, the company was small enough for an entrepreneur
to consider using it as a 'shell' to expand into other activities. I paid
60p a share for my investment. In May 1991, I accepted a takeover offer of
220p from Kimball International.
For similar reasons, in 1988 I paid 120p for shares in Flexello Castors. In
June 1991, I accepted the takeover price of 130p from a Japanese company,
Nansin. The offer was rather miserly but there were no signs of any rival
(and better) bidders and Flexello's performance had been disappointing.
Another Japanese company, Sankyo Seiko, made a successful takeover bid for
DAKS Simpson, the up-market department store and clothing group in London's
Piccadilly. I first bought non-voting shares in this company in 1988 for
430p because I liked the store and its attentive staff. I had noted also
that it appeared to be popular with Japanese tourists. Sankyo Seiko's March
1991 cash offer was 585.5p for my 'A' ordinary shares. I accepted.
These three successful takeover bids re-affirmed my faith in small-company
investment and I shall continue to acquire shares in such concerns.
The Japanese takeover of DAKS Simpson also made me follow my wife's 1986
example and buy shares in Liberty, another retail store in London's West
End. Early in 1991, she increased her holding via a Personal Equity Plan. I
bought shares for my personal pension scheme, paying 445p for the voting
shares and 240p for the non-voting.
Like DAKS Simpson, Liberty has an up-market image, is popular with the
Japanese and also has an association with Japan - a company owned jointly
there with Seibu Department Store.
Early in September, it was announced that Bryan Myerson, a South African
stockbroker who assisted in the Japanese bid for Aquascutum in 1990, had
acquired a shareholding in Liberty. The company's voting shares are now
around 650p and the non-voting 433p. My wife and I still retain ours and
await further developments.
The year was not without disaster, though. I discussed the horrors of my
investment in Gresham House last year. Fortunately, my pension scheme's
purchase was limited to 1,500 Gresham shares (albeit at 300p) in March. The
belief was that this investment trust's assets were worth at least twice its
share price.
A number of its investments turned sour, however, and the Gresham shares now
languish at less than 20p. I should have sold them - for 60p or so -
immediately the bad news about the fall in its assets was announced at the
end of June. But I held on, hoping that the massive write-offs would attract
a takeover bid.
Gresham House has such a low market capitalisation that, hopefully, there
will be it will attract takeover attention - or, at least, changes in its
board of directors.
The Gresham experience also highlights the importance of knowing when to
sell. Another company where I missed the 'sell by' date was Premier
Consolidated Oilfields. Living in Dorset - not very far from Wytch Farm, the
largest onshore oilfield in Europe - I believed that Premier (which had a
significant interest there) ought to see its share price increase when the
field neared its full annual production level. As a relatively small
concern, I thought Premier had takeover potential and might appeal specially
to a French company.
Sadly, Premier - despite Wytch Farm's success, its overseas oil exploration
interests, and its increased profits - has fallen from a high of 58p in 1991
to around 27p now.
Some of my timing was spot-on, though; take A. &amp; C. Black, a small company
which publishes Who's Who plus many reference and childrens' books. Over the
year, I have been 'in and out' of this company several times, getting useful
profits.
Another timely sale was my pension fund's disposal in July 1991 of its
remaining shares in Television South West, for 82p. In October, the
Independent Television Commission announced it would not be renewing the
company's franchise. The shares are now around 46p.
Away from the stock market, my best-performing investment continues to be a
share in the West End musical Forbidden Planet, which is now in its third
year and is showing a profit of Pounds 1,080 for every Pounds 1,000 invested
in July 1989 - with the hope of more to come.
Investing in theatrical ventures is very risky, which is why I remain
selective as to which shows I back. Anyone considering such an investment
can obtain further information from the Society of West End Theatre, Bedford
Chambers, The Piazza, Covent Garden, London WC2E 8 HQ.
My wife and I retained our maximum Pounds 10,000 holdings in premium bonds
throughout 1991 but the returns have continued to be pathetic. I had four
wins of Pounds 50 each and one of Pounds 100 (total Pounds 300), while my
wife collected 15 prizes of Pounds 50 (total Pounds 750). Both of us would
have fared better by putting our money in a bank and drawing the interest -
but we both keep hoping for a big win. At least the returns are tax-free -
an important consideration bearing in mind the possibility of a Labour
government increasing taxes on investment gains.
We achieved one good tax-free return from my wife's Pounds 5,000 investment
in index-linked National Savings certificates. These reached their five-year
maturity in August and she got Pounds 8,258.74. Even with the lower levels
of inflation in the UK, index-linked certificates look to be a good
longer-term investment, especially given political uncertainties.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Sunday shopping may lift Budgens - The
Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL eyes this week will be on the results of Lonrho on Thursday. Shares in
the conglomerate, which has wide ranging agricultural, manufacturing and
leisure interests, have dropped from 230p in late November to 150p last
night. Concern centres around the 'tycoon factor' - the future of Tiny
Rowland, the company's driving force. (See story on Page II).
Interim results from Budgens on Tuesday will be the first news on how things
are progressing at the the food retailer, where institutional investors
installed a new management team last April.
Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1m, and will be
interested to hear how Sunday trading is holding up, now that other food
retailers have clambered aboard the bandwagon which Budgens was one of the
first to get rolling.
Newman Tonks, Europe's largest maker of architectural hardware, will report
on Wednesday a steep drop in pre-tax profits for the year ended October.
They are likely to fall to around Pounds 15m from Pounds 23.2m a year
earlier.
The decline is no surprise given the abysmal UK housing market. However, its
strength abroad, coupled with tight management, will have helped minimise
the blow. Analysts are pencilling in a slight pick up for the present year.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Lloyd's report leaves some Names still
at a loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO. What's in it for a Name?
Lloyd's: A Route Forward, the report published by the Lloyd's Task Force on
Wednesday, has quickly been hailed as the most radical overhaul for the
Lloyd's insurance market in its 300-year history. But it is less clear that
it will have any great impact for those unlucky enough already to be Names
with loss-making syndicates.
If you are already a Lloyd's Name - one of the wealthy individuals who
provides capital backing for underwriters - or are considering becoming one,
two questions are raised.
Will the report help if you are already a Name?
The proposals contain little comfort for Names facing heavy losses from past
years. Tom Benyon, a campaigner for Names who are in financial difficulties,
has already made his trenchant views known on this subject: 'It's done
nothing to help the injured names, of which there are 6,000. Many of them
are in great financial difficulties already, and it is going to get worse
this year. Names who are suffering this year ain't seen nothing yet.'
The most significant proposal for existing Names is the possible escape
route from 'Open Years', or accounts which cannot be closed due to
outstanding losses. The only problem is that the route should be at 'a price
which fairly reflects their outstanding liabilities'.
Unfortunately, an exit route which does this would still be very expensive.
The main proposal on this front concerns CentreWrite, which was created in
July last year and at present works as a reinsurance agency for Lloyd's
syndicates. The Report suggests it should offer reinsurance for Names with
open years instead. Names could pay a premium to CentreWrite, which would
then bear liabilities for any further losses on the open years.
This would be an advance on the present system of stop-loss insurance, under
which premiums have often been criticised for being both high and
inaccurately assessed. However, an accurately assessed premium to bear the
risk of an open year will be expensive.
'If they can afford that they can probably afford the losses,' said Mike
Voller, Lloyd's specialist with the accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, which
advises about 1,000 Names. 'I can't see an awful lot of people taking that
out because of the level of premiums which is likely to be charged.'
But Mark Farrer, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents 9,500 Names, was more positive about the proposal. He said: 'I
think the proposals for CentreWrite are going to be extremely useful for
Names, because nobody at present is really prepared to assess the individual
risk. I don't doubt that what is proposed is an excellent idea.'
The proposal to allow open years - which are mostly burdened by pollution
claims, which often take many years to come through - to remain open is bad
news for existing Names who want to leave. While you are a member of a
syndicate with an open year, you cannot walk away from being a Name, except
by taking the expensive reinsurance route.
This proposal could, therefore, have the effect of tying Names in, to keep
supporting underwriters for the next few years.
Will it make it more attractive to become a Name next year?
Provided the report's recommendations on limiting liability come into force
in time for January 1993, virtually everyone seems to agree the answer must
be 'yes'.
The high-level cap to limit excessive losses leaves the concept of unlimited
liability intact, but only just. The proposal, which the Task Force hopes
can be implemented in time for next January, is that losses will be limited
to the total a Name puts forward in premiums for a year. The minimum level
for this amount is Pounds 250,000.
Thus, Names could not lose more than the money they originally made
available to the underwriters. But the fund would be cumulative and cover
losses over four consecutive years which together exceed the limit. Lloyd's
is still working on the precise details as to how the scheme would be put
into operation.
The compensation would be paid by a compulsory levy on all Names equal to
0.25 per cent of their premium income limit. This limits the 'up-side' of a
Lloyd's membership, but scarcely by a significant amount. Although you are
still taking a big risk, if you put up Pounds 250,000, you are at least able
to treat this as 'risk money'.
That puts the potential downside of Lloyd's membership on a par with buying
shares in a small company - you can lose all the money you put into the
investment, but you cannot lose any more. Unlimited liability wold only
remain if the fund could not meet the calls on Names, in circumstances which
'threatened the continued existence of the market'.
Another change which would make Lloyd's much more friendly to new Names is
to set up Members' Agents Pooling Arrangements (or Mapas). This has been
likened to a unit trust. Members' agents would pool all the syndicate
participations of the Names they represented, effectively giving a greater
spread of risk. Given that last year's losses were heavily concentrated on a
few unlucky Names in a few syndicates, this would be a big plus for Lloyd's
novices. It might deter those insiders who profit at present from their
knowledge of the different underwriters.
Becoming a Lloyd's Name is still a decision which demands to be taken very
seriously. It can only make sense if you are in the fortunate position of
having Pounds 250,000 in free capital and are prepared to take the risk of
losing all of it.
If you decide to become a Name, Clive Scott-Hopkins, of Towry Law, says that
for married couples where one partner has most or all of the wealth, it
makes sense for the less wealthy partner to be given the Pounds 250,000 and
then become the Name. This is a handy way to limit liability.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Mortgage boost for first-time buyers -
David Barchard assesses the latest cut in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-TIME buyers now enjoy the most favourable conditions for entering the
market in many years because of this week's decision by Abbey National, the
second-largest mortgage lender, to cut interest rates again.
Abbey's special rates for first-time buyers range from 9.49 per cent on
mortgages under Pounds 60,000 to 8.9 per cent on those over Pounds 100,000.
It says they are its lowest since 1978 for this type of purchaser.
In addition, the government introduced legislation this week to remove the 1
per cent stamp duty normally paid on all house purchases under Pounds
250,000 before August 19.
John Bayliss, Abbey's managing director, says: 'We want to get the
first-time buyers back in the market. There is a huge backlog of people who
haven't moved. All it needs is a bit of confidence and for commentators to
stop writing gloom and doom.' The other top lenders agree. Although Halifax
and Nationwide were surprised by Abbey's cuts, it matched them within hours.
As the tables show, the cuts favour buyers of cheaper properties. Although
people with big mortgages still get a better rate of interest, the
difference between the top end of the market and the bottom has been nearly
halved.
Halifax calculates that customers with Pounds 60,000 endowment mortgages
will find their monthly payments dropping from Pounds 503.13 to Pounds
479.08. Repayment mortgage customers will pay Pounds 523.12 instead of
Pounds 543.63.
The news for existing borrowers of the Big Three is not quite so good. The
new rates will not apply to them for a full month. In the meantime, you can
be sure that interest rates on deposits will fall. But the cuts have come in
time to ensure that 2.6m customers on the Halifax Budget Plan, and other
annually-adjusted mortgage payment schemes, will benefit.
Other building societies look certain to fall into line shortly. If your
mortgage comes from a bank, however, you might have to wait. The TSB already
has said it has no plans to cut its rates but others have the situation
'under review.' The centralised lenders probably will be even slower to
reduce their variable-rate mortgages.
(Incidentally, if a lender announces that it is reducing its rate, look
twice to see what this means in practice. In recent months, some centralised
lenders have been announcing cuts which do not take effect for 2 1/2
months).
Will the Big Three be able to sustain their cuts? The base rate has not
fallen for some time and there have been fears that the government might
have to raise it again. But Abbey appears to have decided that there will
not be a base rate increase in the weeks ahead and that the Chancellor might
well reduce it around Budget time in March.
Ian Darby, marketing director at mortgage broker John Charcol, says: 'This
is a good move by the societies but it has come about because of serious
lack of business volumes. After some terrifying statistics about house price
falls, lenders feel it is worth reducing their prices to prevent the market
falling further.'
Darby doubts, however, that the property market can be kick-started in this
way. 'We have seen the interest rates fall by 4 per cent and house sales
volumes have decreased steadily as they have done so.'
John Wriglesworth, housing market specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, agrees.
'The only thing that could kick-start the market is something more radical,
like doubling the Pounds 30,000 mortgage interest rate relief for first-time
buyers.'
The trouble is that many potential buyers remain dubious about the future.
With an election nearing, they are worried that a change of government might
affect incomes.
The recession also is making many people concerned about the safety of their
jobs. The threat of redundancy is by far the biggest constraint on the
housing market, according to a survey of property valuers published by
NatWest.
Such fears are especially strong in the south-east, and this week's jump in
unemployment figures shows that people are right to be careful. But for
those with the cash and the confidence to buy a house, conditions rarely can
have been more favourable.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Labour wobbles on National Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S commitment to remove the upper threshold for National Insurance
contributions - welcomed by many economists but unpopular with voters in
marginal London constituencies - appears to have been watered down.
It is not clear exactly what Labour will do instead. Currently, you do not
pay National Insurance contributions (charged at 9 per cent of income) on
income above Pounds 20,700 per year. This means people with income above
this level effectively pay a lower rate of tax, than those below it.
Labour has been committed for four years to abolishing the upper earnings
limit. It has not made any secret of the fact that this would effectively
add 9 per cent to the top marginal rate of tax paid by everybody with
incomes above Pounds 20,700.
The Institute of Fiscal Studies described Labour's proposal as 'a welcome
reform to the UK personal tax system'. In a report published yesterday, it
showed that 88.2 per cent of families would not lose by this system. But in
Greater London 20 per cent of families will lose, and in the rest of the
South East 18 per cent.
Until this week Labour had not emphasised the fact that this rise in the
National Insurance threshold could be phased in gradually. This possibility
has now been stressed. Such provisions were in earlier policy documents, but
the Conservatives have presented this as a change of policy.
Labour said abolition of the limit remained acommitment, adding:  'There are
a number of ways in which we could cushion the blow to personal incomes from
a sudden increase in the rate of taxation. How we do so is for the
Chancellor to decide in his first budget.'
If your household income is above the threshold, but not by much, this is
good news. It also suggests that it is unwise to change investments in
advance of possible tax changes.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Markets: Where to place your trust? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor

<TEXT>
Big fleas have little fleas
Upon their backs to bite 'em
And smaller fleas have littler fleas
And so ad infinitem
SO IT is with the investment trust industry. Trusts have a parasitical
nature - they are, after all, companies that exist solely to invest in other
companies. The next level of evolution - trusts that invest solely in other
investment trusts - have been around for a while.
The industrial branch of the family tree - split capital trusts - rigorously
divides such functions as income and capital growth between different
classes of shares. Adam Smith would have approved.
Someone had to invent the split capital trust that invested in other split
capital trusts and, of course, they did. The trust which invests only in
trusts which invest in other trusts cannot be far away.
The private investor has to wonder whether these ever more complex examples
of financial ingenuity are wonderful investments, or carefully crafted
illusions.
However clever the structures, the success of all of these trusts depends on
the underlying health of corporate earnings and dividends. Normally this
specifically means UK corporate earnings and dividends since it is only in
the UK that dividend streams are high enough to make these structures work.
If the profits and dividends of UK companies do not grow through the 1990s,
then the investment performance of many of these trusts will be sharply hit.
It is not therefore logical for a private investor to shy away from the
stock market as 'too risky', only to be lured into a split capital trust on
the grounds that it is a 'sure thing'.
And the private investor also needs to be careful which class of shares he
buys. Take Exmoor Dual Investment Trust, a split capital investment trust
that invests in other splits.
The three classes of share in Exmoor - ordinary, income and zero preference
 -were issued for a combined total of 240p in 1988. Their current combined
price is 352p, a return for anyone who bought all three of 46.7 per cent,
well ahead of the FT-A All-Share Index over the same period.
However, the gains have not been equally distributed. Those who bought the
zeroes at 100p have seen the price of their shares rocket to 184p, and those
who bought the income shares have also done well, enjoying a rise from 100p
to 132p. But the ordinary shares have fallen in price from 40p to 36p over
the three years.
In general, there has been a popularity shift in favour of zeroes - which
have a prior claim on the assets of a trust and are perceived as almost
'risk-free' - and income shares - which are highly attractive when held in a
Personal Equity Plan - and away from capital shares - which depend for their
return on a trust achieving strong asset growth.
Exeter Preferred Capital, a new trust launched this week, will invest in the
'popular' classes of split shares. By investing in a mix of zeroes, yielding
around 11.6 per cent and income shares, yielding 15 per cent, the aim is to
get a return on Exeter ordinary shares of 13.6 per cent per annum. The vast
bulk of this return will be provided in the form of capital growth.
There is also a tax twist. Exeter has raised a large part of its capital in
the form of a zero coupon debenture. It will make annual provision for the
'interest' element on this debenture (the annual increase in the value of
the zero) and claim this as a tax deduction against the investment income it
receives.
It sounds attractive but could Exeter get it wrong? If there was a general
collapse in the stock market, then there would be a risk that the zeroes in
which the trust is invested would not be redeemed at par.
The income shares which the trust buys will themselves be invested in
high-yielding stocks. Such stocks performed well in the 1980s but there is a
risk that in the 1990s, they may not be able to produce much in the form of
dividend growth. The nature of income shares is also that their price
declines towards the end of their life. If dividend growth is slower, and
income share prices decline more sharply, than Exeter expects, then the
returns to investors might not be as high as 13.6 per cent.
That said, the risks ought to be less than would be incurred by investing in
a single company or in a geographically specialist trust. Investors should
remember, however, that the returns are not guaranteed.
The other split capital trust to be launched this week is more traditional.
Lloyds Smaller Companies Investment Trust has two classes of shares -
dividend and capital - and as its name implies, it is hoping to benefit from
a revival in small company shares. After many years of outperformance, small
companies slumped in the late 1980s, and the hope is that they will benefit
more than their larger brethren when the UK economy recovers.
As with last year's M&amp;G Income Trust, investors can only apply for packaged
units. For most investors, therefore, the split capital structure is only
important to the extent that it helps to prevent the trust from slipping to
a discount.
With a yield of around 5 per cent, the Lloyds trust will be more suitable
for inclusion in most people's PEPs than the Exeter trust, which has a
minimal dividend yield. But again, do not dive in just because of the tax
savings.
A 5 per cent yield on Pounds 6,000 is Pounds 300 a year, which means a
maximum tax saving of Pounds 120 for higher rate payers. Investors could
lose a lot more in capital than that if share prices decline sharply.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Markets: Lonrho tackles the tycoon-bashing factor - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE market has developed an appetite for tycoon-bashing, the one thing
that Tiny Rowland's Lonrho cannot afford to do is unveil any surprises when
it publishes its year end results on Thursday.
The shares of the international trading company traditionally perform
strongly in the period between the September year end and the publication of
the results in January. This is because of the high yield on the final and
interim dividend, which are announced simultaneously.
Yet Lonrho's share price has recently fallen to a four-year low. It
yesterday closed at 150p. Just over two years ago it stood above 300p. When
Robert Maxwell died at the end of last year it was 250p.
The so-called 'tycoon factor' is still Lonrho's greatest problem. Following
the spectacular downfalls of Polly Peck, Brent Walker and the Maxwell
empire, the stock market has become increasingly nervous about companies
where one man dominates. Since November the market has been full of stories
that Rowland, now 74, was ill and even that he had fallen out of a plane
over Africa. As Paul Spicer, a Lonrho director, pointed out at the time, the
rumours were all untrue.
There is still a great deal of concern about the lack of any obvious
successor to Rowland.
One fund manager said: 'Lonrho has an impressive record of increasing
shareholders' funds. But there is a succession problem which was not helped
by Rene Leclezio's appointment as chairman, and was made worse by Terry
Robinson's departure to Union International'. Robinson had been with Lonrho
for 20 years and a director for 10 years. Rene Leclezio, aged 71, has been a
Lonrho director for 15 years.
However, the tycoon factor, while important, is by not means the only
problem facing Lonrho. The share price took a hammering at the end of last
year when James Capel cast doubt on Lonrho's ability to maintain its
dividend and pointed out the company's exposure to the recent sharp fall in
rhodium prices.
The price of rhodium has fallen from a recent high of Dollars 7,000 (Pounds
3,910) an ounce to around Dollars 2,000. Lonrho owns a 75 per cent stake in
Western Platinum, the South African mining company which produces 45,000
ounces of rhodium a year. A slump on such a scale could reduce Lonrho's
gross earnings from rhodium by about Pounds 100m.
James Capel duly reduced its profit forecasts for Lonrho in the current year
from Pounds 270m - last year's figure was Pounds 273m - to Pounds 240m.
Other brokers followed suit, although Warburg Securities did not cut its
Pounds 260m forecast.
Capel's has also drawn attention to the fact that the dividend of 16p a
share last year was covered less than 1.5 times by earnings of 23.6p. The
implied drop in earnings this year to around 21p could put the dividend at
risk.
County Natwest has cut its payout forecast to 12p. Lonrho pays three
dividends a year and analysts believe any change is more likely to affect
1992's first interim payment - 3p for the last three years.
Nonetheless, on balance most analysts do not believe that Rowland will be
prepared to cut either the final or interim dividend. As one put it: 'Tiny
is a contrarian who will not want to be bludgeoned into cutting the dividend
just because the market says he will.'
The group also has significant levels of net debt and difficulties in
generating cash from organic activities. The 1990 report and accounts show
that Lonrho had net debt of Pounds 936m and shareholders' funds of Pounds
1.38bn. The net debt increased to Pounds 1.06bn and shareholders' funds to
Pounds 1.4bn by the interim stage of the 1991 year. Warburg Securities has
estimated that the debt will have risen to more than Pounds 1.1bn by the
year-end.
Planned disposals, such as its 50 per cent stake in German freight forwarder
Kuehne &amp; Nagel and the Ashanti gold mine in Ghana, would help cut debt but
have yet to materialise.
Lonrho is also expected to suffer a significant downturn in its motors
division, which includes dealer Dutton Forshaw and Volkswagen/Audi
distributor VAG in the UK, as well as assorted African interests. Here,
pre-tax profits are expected to fall by about Pounds 10m to around Pounds
35m over the year.
The group also needs to find a stream of UK earnings which is
cash-generative. Lonrho is not making sufficient profits to offset against
its advanced corporation tax (ACT). In the year to September 30 it had a
contingent liability of Pounds 79m against ACT.
Thus its flirtation with buying Brent Walker's William Hill betting shop
chain and brewery and later Mirror Group Newspapers. Both came to nothing,
but they were highly revealing of Lonrho's thinking and problems.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Markets: Reality at the epicentre of recession - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY made a virtue of intellectual honesty this week as both
the US President and the chairman of America's biggest bank stared reality
in the face and issued a string of mea culpas.
For George Bush the occasion was a campaign visit to New Hampshire, where -
after assuring voters that he was not going to 'throw up' again - he said
the nation's economy was in a free fall and admitted he needed to exert
stronger leadership on domestic issues.
The US economy is not exactly in a free fall, but it does appear to be
headed for the much feared double dip recession. 'I've known this economy is
in a free fall. Maybe I haven't conveyed it as well as I should have, but I
do understand it,' said a seemingly chastened Bush.
Back in New York, one of the epicentres of the US recession, the embattled
John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, also issued an apology or two. After
ousting the head of his global corporate banking division - and announcing a
Dollars 450m (Pounds 251.3m) to Dollars 475m loss for 1991 and Dollars 650m
of fourth quarter commercial loan write-offs and writedowns - Reed put on
sackcloth and ashes.
'One of the things I have been correctly criticised for is that the
management (of the corporate division) has produced some pretty horrendous
results,' said the Citicorp chief. 'We are guilty of having run the business
a bit cavalierly,' he added.
Reed's management changes, and a promise that his Dollars 1.7bn cost-cutting
scheme is on track, gave Citicorp's depressed share price a boost. The
effect of Bush's new policy of admitting times are tough has yet to be
judged by voters.
The relative intellectual honesty of Wall Street, however, is quite another
matter.
Many investors, both institutional and individual, have clearly made up
their minds that economic recovery is coming in the latter half of 1992.
That conviction, together with the desire to shift away from instruments
such as bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit  - all of them
yielding less since last month's full-point cut in the discount rate -
accounts for the rally that has been under way since late last month.
Trading volume has been heavy in recent days, up above the 300m share mark
on two occasions this week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average has
risen by 12 per cent since the Fed's interest rate cut on December 20.
This is not the first time that lemming-like equity investors have gone on a
buying spree that is based on the discounting of future economic recovery.
It happened just 12 months ago, even as bombs were falling on Baghdad. At
that time the rally was driven by confidence in the security and price of
Gulf oil supplies, combined with predictions of a second half 1991 recovery.
The oil price stayed low, but the recovery failed to materialise. Now, with
parts of the US economy apparently still contracting, the optimists are
again making the running.
It may be that corporate America has seen the worst in recent quarters, and
it may be that lower interest rates and an expected election year package of
tax cut gimmicks will restore confidence to the US consumer, but few in
finance and industry appear willing to recognise the economy's deep
structural problems. One cannot help thinking that Wall Street's rally may
be another example of the market's propensity for short-term, superficial
behaviour.
Investment patterns in the troubled US banking industry offer slightly more
in the way of logic. The fourth quarter results from banks such as Chase
Manhattan, Bank of America, Security Pacific, Chemical Banking and even
Citicorp included no new shocks, which was a comfort.
Bottom fishing has become quite the vogue, and where better to start than
with Citicorp? Just before the interest rate cut last month 20, Citicorp's
share price stood at a measly Dollars 8 1/2 . Jim McDermott, of analysts
Keefe Bruyette, says worries about Citicorp were such that 'last month you
couldn't give the stock away at Dollars 8 1/2 .' The bank's share price has
underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index by about a third over the
past 12 months, but has bounced back.
This week's announcements, including plans to divest itself of its remaining
49.7 per cent stake in Ambac, the municipal bond insurer, have helped
Citicorp's share price to rise by more than 35 per cent over the past seven
days.
Analysts say investors now see banks as recovery stocks that will outperform
the market this year. The question that remains is how long it will take for
the banking sector, like the rest of the US economy, to justify Wall
Street's faith in the future.

<TEXT>
Pearl Assurance has launched a free-standing Additional Voluntary
Contribution contract. As explained in the Weekend FT last week, FSAVCs are
similar to personal pensions but need to be taken out in addition to a
company scheme. New business figures from life offices are showing that
sales of AVCs were high last year.
Pearl's Expectations FSAVC will invest in the main Pearl with-profits fund.
This might be attractive for people near to retirement because of the
relative security of with-profits funds compared with their unit-linked

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family: More life bonuses announced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NPI and Royal Life announced their bonuses on life assurance policies this
week. Both followed the trend of cutting pay-outs on ten-year policies while
leaving 25-year pay-outs relatively unscathed.
Using the standard assumption of a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 monthly
premiums, NPI left its 25-year pay-out unchanged at Pounds 51,989, while
10-year pay-outs dipped 8.8 per cent to Pounds 6,003. Royal Life's 25-year
pay-out increased 12 per cent to Pounds 55,052, but 10-year pay-outs fell 5
per cent to Pounds 6,443.
Neither office is likely to feature among the strongest performers for the
year - for example Commercial Union is paying out Pounds 65,596 and Pounds
7,484.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Grenfell is launching the Japan 'Bullet' fund, a Dublin-based
offshore unit trust. The fund's investment policy will mirror that of the
group's existing Japanese smaller companies fund, which is top of the
combined onshore and offshore Japanese sector over the five years to January
5. The fund will have a single price, which in practice means that the 5.74
per cent initial charge will be shown separately - thus the investor
subscribing for the minimum of Pounds 1,000 will receive around Pounds 940
of units. There will be a fixed offer price of 100p from February 3-7; those
who apply through an independent financial adviser will get a discount of 1
per cent. The annual charge is 1.5 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family: Mortgage rates are cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cuts in mortgage rates this week came without the stimulus of a cut in
bank base rates. With base rates at 10.5 per cent and the new mortgage rate
from three leading lenders at 10.95 per cent, the margin between the two is
very narrow in historic terms.
Divergence between base rates and the Halifax mortgage rate was at its
greatest when base rates were relatively low in 1987 and 1988. In May 1988,
the difference was just over 2 1/2 percentage points, when base rates were
7.5 per cent and the Halifax mortgage rate 9.8 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Markets: Secretaries have votes, too - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE symbolic photograph of the week showed a forlorn Roger Freeman,
transport minister, taking an unwonted ride on the London Underground
clutching a box of chocolates.
The chocolates were for his secretary, whose job status he had inadvertently
insulted in a speech. The symbolism said: the election campaign is under
way; do not foul things up.
Although there could easily be five months between now and an election,
stock market traders, like politicians, are already behaving as if the vote
were imminent.
This week, the sustained Conservative attack on the potential tax
implications of Labour's spending plans had two effects. By making it clear
that the government would fight the election as the low-tax party, it raised
the prospects of an (ever so slightly) tax-cutting Budget.
More important, it exposed a weakness in the Labour camp: by mid-week the
leadership was attempting to muffle the impact of its proposal to lift the
ceiling on National Insurance contributions.
Investors worried by the way the Tories had appeared to be drifting to
defeat were heartened by a suddenly rediscovered ability to put Labour on
the defensive.
Thursday's half-point drop in building society mortgage rates was also
cheering, not least because of its potential impact on home-owning voters.
In truth, this move is more an indication of the big societies'
determination to shut the clearing banks out of the market for home loans
than of improvement in the economic climate, but investors wanted to read
the best into it.
Shares in Abbey National, the quoted former building society that led the
rate-cutting move, rose 11p on the day of the announcement and closed on
Friday at 298 1/2 p, up 19p on the week. Shares in the clearing banks also
rose strongly, even though they stand to lose from their rivals' sacrifice
of margins.
There were other forces at work, of course: weighed down by loan losses,
banks have become as cyclical as any chemical or construction company. And,
as the chart shows, the week saw a marked shift out of defensive,
recession-resistant stocks - especially the big pharmaceutical companies
that dominate the Health and Household sector of the All-Share - into shares
that might benefit from economic recovery.
Glaxo closed at a new high of 930p on Monday, then lost nearly 100p in the
next four days, closing at 838p. SmithKline Beecham went from 946p to 889p
in the same period. On Thursday, these two companies took nearly 12 points
off the FT-SE index's performance.
The reasoning behind the move owed a little to optimism about the UK
economy: sterling's stability above its ERM floor, and lower pay demands
from the German trade unions, both signalled a lower risk of a
Bundesbank-inspired run-up in UK interest rates.
The move owed at least as much to developments in the US, where a marked
switch from defensive to cyclical stocks was arguably more justified by a
growing confidence about economic recovery. US pharmaceutical companies such
as Merck, Glaxo's closest international competitor, suffered; and so did the
UK drugs companies, in which US investors' have big stakes. The trend spread
to the London market, where investors leapt on it with enthusiasm.
Among the gainers were shares in banks, stores, and construction companies.
The cautious remember, however, that there were several abortive attempts to
establish the trend last year; it remains to be seen whether this version is
longer-lasting than its predecessors.
One drug company, Fisons, had other news to contend with. On Tuesday its
chairman of 11 years, John Kerridge, retired on health grounds, leaving the
company looking for a new chief executive. The share price has been
languishing for months, as the company has been attempting to overcome
hostility it has managed to inspire in the bosom of its most important
regulator, the US Food and Drug Administration.
Kerridge's departure was marked by an immediate run-up in Fisons' shares,
followed by an only-slightly-less immediate bout of second thoughts. Those
were compounded by some wounding FDA comments in internal documents obtained
under the US freedom of information act. Fisons' shares closed on Friday at
334p, down 13p on the week.
The US theme that ran throughout much of the week's activities also affected
Cable &amp; Wireless. For several weeks, the markets have been circulating
rumours about discussions with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US
long-distance operator; on Friday, those rumours were confirmed, with the
rider that the talks had halted for the moment after failing to make
progress.
Those who had been talking up the stock in the (never very realistic) belief
that AT&amp;T would buy the whole of Cable &amp; Wireless were disappointed that the
talks had not gone further; those who had expected some more limited
relationship were heartened that the talks had happened at all. Cable &amp;
Wireless closed the week at 600p, up 11p.
One other big stock reacted to important news this week: British Gas stepped
back from a confrontation with its regulator, and the shares rose 3p on the
week, closing at 243p. Opinion was divided about whether this was a decisive
surrender or just another skilful manoeuvre in the utility's struggle to
preserve as much as possible of its market dominance.
One thing was clear: British Gas was able to ease itself out of
confrontation thanks to the diplomatic involvement of John Wakeham, the
energy secretary. In the run-up to the election, expect to see more such
diplomacy all round.

FT  18 JAN 92 / The Long View: Too many fish in the fjord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP reminder of the scale of the problems in Britain's financial system
came this week when TSB, not one of the UK's very biggest banks, disclosed
bad debt provisions of some Pounds 650m. A lot more of the same is
inevitable when the main bank reporting season opens next month.
How long will the crisis go on? This time last year there were hopes that
the worst was over, but it has turned out otherwise. Extravagant booms based
on credit, of the kind that we enjoyed between 1986 and 1989, have to be
paid for over a lengthy period. There are plenty of international
precedents; I was intrigued to receive recently an excellent study of the
Norwegian boom and bust by Axel Dammann, a retired Norwegian banker.
Perhaps the parallels between Norway, population 4.2m, and the UK should not
be drawn too closely. But the Norwegian lending spree and surge of economic
growth - mainland GDP increases averaged 4.2 per cent annually for the
four-year period beginning 1983 - were very similar in scale to what
happened in the UK for four years starting 1986, when economic growth was
3.8 per cent. Broad money growth in Norway reached some 18 per cent a year
in 1984 and 1985, just as happened in the UK later in the decade.
The gap of roughly three years could provide us with an opportunity to
glimpse the UK's future. Again, we have to be careful not to jump to
conclusions. At least Britain's banks will not have to bear the burden of a
32,000-ton surplus frozen salmon mountain, as Norway's did, in a
particularly bizarre example of overexpansion; they financed far too many
fish farms out in the fjords.
But two facts stand out. Norway's GDP has remained stuck for five years at
around the 1986 level. And in 1991, four years after the main lending boom
ended, the major banks all had to be rescued by the government.
Lending controls were abolished by the Norwegian government at the beginning
of 1984, in pursuit of faster economic growth and lower interest rates. A
huge demand for credit both from businesses and from private individuals
became apparent. The stock market began to soar and house prices doubled
between 1983 and 1987, while debt outstanding to mortgage institutions
expanded 2 1/2 times to NKr100bn. An oversupply of commercial office space
was developed. Business bankruptcies are now running at three times the
level of the early 1980s. It sounds familiar.
The economic hangover in Norway has proved to be much longer than anybody
expected. Axel Dammann says there are three reasons: a lack of insight into
the workings of the monetary side of the economy, an ignorance of the weak
financial status of small companies, and inattention to the erosion of the
reserves of the banks. Broad money growth has tailed away to an annual 5 or
6 per cent because of the unwillingness of banks to lend (inflation is about
4 per cent). The government and the central bank continue to be puzzled by
the sluggishness of the domestic economy, but refuse to pin the blame on
weak monetary growth.
Elsewhere in Scandinavia similar banking crises have led to recent
devaluations but the Norwegians are made of sterner stuff. To complete the
parallels with the UK, Norway linked its currency to the Ecu in October
1990, the same month as sterling entered the exchange rate mechanism
(although Norway is not a member state of the EC).
In quite a lot of important respects the British recession appears to be
developing along Norwegian lines. Monetary growth has tumbled to a level -
around 5 1/2 per cent over the 12 months to last November on the M4 measure
 -which is causing concern among monetary economists. The economy is much
more sluggish than the Treasury computer says it should be.
What lessons can we draw? Well, there should be much less talk about a
hypothetical recovery in consumer confidence, and much more analysis of
asset prices, loan security and the burden of debt at a period of high real
interest rates. It is important to sustain confidence in the banking system,
but it would be shortsighted to do so in a way which led to real problems
being ignored.
The deadly arithmetic of compound interest penetrates the whole problem. If
interest cannot be paid, then it will not do any good to wait until next
year because the problem can only get worse. In the past, inflation or a new
credit-based recovery of asset prices have tended to bail out the banks and
the troubled borrowers, but this cannot be expected to happen under a
monetary regime ultimately controlled by the Bundesbank. The message from
Norway is that asset prices, once overinflated by a lending boom, can drift
back downwards year after year and eventually the banks will suffocate under
the weight of their accumulating bad debts.
You have to wonder whether the banks should really be paying out unchanged
dividends, as TSB did this week, or should be preserving their dwindling
capital with much greater care. Perhaps the government, which would have to
foot the bill for rescuing any British banks, might start thinking about
that.
But the question of how the banks can best weather the current storm is only
one point at issue. Beyond that, the question raised by what happened both
in Norway and the UK in the 1980s is how on earth the banks can be prevented
from causing a similar mess all over again should they be given half a
chance.
Competition must be encouraged, but not to the point where floods of money
are distorting whole sectors of the economy. The property bubble will surely
not recur for at least another decade, but the next boom might be in, say,
small business lending, with government encouragement.
Ultimately there must be the presence of a strong monetary authority, able
to assess broad risks and control the pace of credit growth across the
economy; it must be immune from temporary political pressures, however
beguiling - such as to help first-time house buyers.
The banks themselves, though, always seem irresistably inclined to swim with
the flood tide, even when it is carrying them towards the rocks.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Voyage of the damned: a slaver's diary - In 1700, Walter
Prideaux sailed for Africa on the slave ship Daniel and Henry. His log of
the voyage has now been published. John Kitching re-tells his tale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THE 500th anniversary year of Columbus's voyage to America, another
extraordinary trans-Atlantic tale can be told. By chance, the log of the
slave ship Daniel and Henry, which sailed from Dartmouth in 1700, was found
on a London bookstall. The discovery has led to a vivid reconstruction* of a
remarkable trip to Africa's Guinea coast and the West Indies. It is the
shameful story of a trade in which the British always claimed an
abolitionist role.
CHRISTMAS: quite the worst time of year for a journey, and the most
difficult at which to put together a crew. It would take Roger Mathew, an
experienced Devonian captain, several weeks to find the 44 men he needed for
his gruelling voyage.
For several reasons, the complement of a slave ship had to be more than
double that of a normal merchant vessel: its financial backers feared slave
revolt, against which they could not insure; the barter process was
labour-intensive; guarding the slaves took many man-hours, and the death
rate among the crew was high. Of the Daniel and Henry's company, 10 were to
die and five to run away; others married or were bundled into the Royal
Navy. Only 24 returned. But the fate of the slaves was far worse.
Roger Mathew's ship would sail for the African coast to collect men, women
and children in exchange for cloth and weapons. Months later, the slaves who
survived would be delivered to rich plantation owners in the West Indies in
hard bargaining for sugar. It was a brutally simple equation: barter equals
slaves equals sugar.
In 1683, Mathew had delivered 123 slaves to Barbados as an unlicenced
trader, returning to Dartmouth with, among other things, two tons of Guinea
redwood. It was clear to the boat's merchant backers, Daniel Ivy and Henry
Arthur, that he was the man for the job.
be With him would be Walter Prideaux, his 23-year-old nephew, who came from
a well-known Quaker family. Nearly 300 years later, it is Prideaux's
meticulous record of the voyage that serves as an epitaph for this trade in
human beings.
Like a good seaman, Prideaux records the ship's position dutifully. As
conditions worsen, so his sympathy for the slaves grows. An uneasiness and a
strong whiff of superstition creep into his log. Repeatedly, he describes a
flaming sword (suggesting divine retribution) and his record becomes a
catalogue of slave deaths.
When Prideaux set sail for Africa, in February 1700, there were no
restrictions on involvement by the Society of Friends (Quakers) in the slave
trade. William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania and a devout Quaker, had
owned slaves in the 1690s. Indeed, during its journey to Jamaica the Daniel
and Henry fell in with the Society, a Quaker slave ship. The Friends did not
act on their involvement in slavery until 1757 - the year Prideaux died -
when alarm was expressed at their yearly meeting in London.
The Daniel and Henry was a merchantman typical of the period: broad-beamed,
apple-cheeked at the bow and made entirely of wood: oak, elm, beech, pine,
mahogany or teak were all in use as planking, baulks, keels, masts and
spars. It carried between 25 and 30 sails. As it left Dartmouth, Prideaux's
hopes were running high; but he was already suffering:
'5th March, 1700: The wind at topgallant gale: being not all well myself,
having my head in raging pain.'
Even before taking the slaves on board, life for the crew below decks was
cramped and chaotic: 'A mass of humanity in which each man was permitted
approximately 14 inches (35 cm) breadth to sling his hammock.' It was dark
and cold and the air was foul.
'The Daniel and Henry, fully laden, rode deep in the green waters of the
Western Approaches . . . the risk of fire on a timber ship, caulked and
coated with combustible oakum and tar pitch, carrying 80 barrels of
gunpowder and hogsheads of highly inflammable spirits, constantly occupied
the minds of her officers . . . into these cramped quarters, already alive
with vermin, came the flower of England's merchant marine. They had but the
haziest idea of whence they were bound, little idea of basic hygiene, only
the most meagre of bedding and few clothes.'
What lay ahead was the prospect of protracted negotiations with caboceers
(village headmen) as bolts of woollen cloth, sets of knives or Guinea coast
gold (often fake) were traded for slaves. The English were sustained by the
then-fashionable notion that Africa was so overcrowded that the slave ships
were doing the continent a favour. Another seafarer, Captain Nathaniel
Uring, wrote in 1726: 'The country is full of people, as may be supposed by
every man's being allowed as many wives as he has the ability to maintain;
and if it were not for these wars among themselves, and the Europeans
carrying such great numbers of slaves from thence, it is highly probable
that they would grow so numerous at last that the country would not contain
them.'
Almost all the slaves destined for the hold of the Daniel and Henry were
from what is now Ghana. Slaves of Coromantine (Ghanaian) origin were the
most highly-prized as strong, long-living and healthy specimens. Caboceers
were always on the look-out for novice traders: the headmen were past
masters at dressing mutton as lamb. Grey hair would be dyed, bodies shaved
smooth and oiled to give the appearance of health.
Bartering was a long, tiresome process with a complex set of rules entirely
of the Africans' making and liable to change at any time. A selection of
goods from the Daniel and Henry would be demanded and inspected. Plenty of
gifts - dashee - to headmen also changed hands. When both sides were
satisfied, slaves were marked with the initial letters of the ship's name
and consigned to minor caboceers until the goods were ferried ashore.
Mathew and Prideaux found themselves in fierce competition with other
traders on the Guinea coast. Negotiations began at daybreak and continued
until sunset. Several trips by longboat had to be made from the Daniel and
Henry, which was moored well offshore for added security. Prideaux
negotiated from the longboat, Mathew from the ship. Their first slave was
bought in Dix Cove on April 11 but progress for several weeks after that was
desperately slow:
'7th April, 1700: We seeing at Caotre several canoes on shore and many
negroes on the sand and we had one canoe which came off to us . . . but got
nothing but a few limes.'
Then, mooring at Poinyon, the Daniel and Henry took on 452 slaves, mostly
women and girls. But within 30 days of leaving Africa, Prideaux records on
October 6, 1700, that 153 slaves had already died and been jettisoned. In
the end, the number sold in Jamaica was 246 out of the 452 loaded in Guinea.
Ruthless captains could trade on the basis of losing up to 80 per cent of
their slaves en route.
Disease and overcrowding were among the main culprits on the so-called
'middle passage' between Africa and Jamaica. So was despair. Dysentery was
rife, with slaves who had been used to high-fibre food reduced to eating
beans boiled in lard and salt beef. The Africans, it was noted by many
seafarers, cared little for salt. It was impossible to conceal the poor
physical condition of many of Mathew's slaves, and the predominance of women
was to depress further the price merchants were prepared to bid.
Few captains can have felt at ease during the middle passage. Perhaps their
very discomfort is caught by the 18th century writer Thomas Aubrey: 'What a
devil makes these plaguey toads die so fast? To which I answer: 'Tis
inhumanity, barbarity and the greatest cruelty of their commander and his
crew'.'
The four-month run to Jamaica tested Prideaux sorely. He had been writing
his log diligently in a vellum-bound ledger bearing his coat of arms and the
legend Walter Prideaux - His Booke - Anno Domini 1688. It had been his 12th
birthday present.
'As in the first stage, Prideaux opens his account with the ritual entreaty
of God's blessing upon the voyage,' writes Nigel Tattersfield in The
Forgotten Trade. 'This is no empty supplication, for nowhere was man more at
the mercy of the elements than at sea. And, beneath the everyday
navigational conventions of the log book, there arises a suggestion that
Prideaux is far from easy about being employed on a slave ship . . . He
grows more and more fearful; five prayers are invoked on this passage.'
Even sighting Barbados gives him no cause for joy. To him, the Daniel and
Henry has become a ship of death. Prideaux has become acutely conscious of
his own mortality. The devil seems to sail with him. On October 22 he
writes: 'Saw a star shoot which continued like a flaming sword for three
minutes.' Jamaica was reached in November.
For the first time in nine months, the ship's scuttles and gunports could be
opened, the foul air released and the hold scrubbed out. Pitch was burned
like incense in a bid to fumigate the area. Wood was washed down with
vinegar, a makeshift disinfectant. The huge accumulation of sewage made
cleaning the bilges a hideous task. Rats roamed freely; cockroaches and mice
were everywhere. The sails had been ruined by a year of verminous attack.
There was much to be done before the Daniel and Henry could change from
slave ship to merchantman.
By the following summer, 1701, some 18 months after starting its voyage, the
crew of the Daniel and Henry was back in Devon. For the captain, the balance
sheet was not healthy. The slaves had generated perhaps Pounds 3,800,
although this was largely in bills of exchange and promissory notes likely
to be discounted heavily by London bankers. He had also brought back five
tons of muscovado sugar worth less than Pounds 300. His outgoings were about
Pounds 5,300. His hazardous and often horrific voyage had not made him or
his backers rich.
None of the crew ever worked the slave routes again. Mathew went back to
ordinary merchantmen and never returned to Africa. Prideaux, who married and
produced 13 children, became a maltster. Several of his descendants were
important figures in the Society of Friends, well into this century. But,
chiefly, he left us his log, which hints at horrors almost beyond
comprehension.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Dutch lager group thirsty for real ale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AMSTERDAM

<TEXT>
LOVERS of traditional ale are facing the possibility that a famous British
brewer could be taken over by a fashionable Dutch lager company.
Ruddles, the Leicestershire-based brewer of real ale founded in 1858, is in
talks with Grolsch, the Dutch brewer of the premium lager in a swing-top
bottle.
The deal could be worth about Pounds 40m, according to industry estimates.
Ruddles, based in Langham, Leicestershire, was acquired by Courage, the UK
arm of Fosters Brewing, the Australian group, in a pubs-for-breweries swap
with Grand Metropolitan last year. It has estimated national sales of
300,000 barrels a year.
Courage said yesterday: 'Grolsch have put forward an interesting proposal
which may offer us mutual benefits.'
Grolsch, which dates back even further than Ruddles to 1615, said it planned
to preserve the Ruddles brand name and to protect the interests of
employees.
The acquisition is part of Grolsch's aim of establishing a strong presence
across north-west Europe from Britain to Germany and Poland. It entered the
UK market in 1979, setting up its own sales and marketing organisation to
develop its lager brand. The beer, supported by advertising campaigns
featuring its distinctive bottle and the slogan 'you can't top a Grolsch',
rapidly gained a niche in the packaged beer sector.
During the past 14 months, Grolsch has signed agreements to supply the lager
on draught to the pub estates of regional brewers, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley
and Fuller's.
Total sales in 1991 grew by about 20 per cent to 165,000 barrels and account
for 40 per cent of Grolsch's exports.
Industry analysts agreed that a Grolsch-Ruddles combination would be a good
fit. The UK markets for premium lager and real ale are both growing.
The purchase of Ruddles would boost Grolsch's sales by nearly 15 per cent to
more than Fl 800m (Pounds 250m).
Grolsch raised expectations of an acquisition when it raised Fl 100m through
a convertible bond issue in mid-1991. Britain was presumed to be the target
area.
Trading in Grolsch shares was suspended on the Amsterdam stock exchange
prior to the announcement yesterday. The shares closed on Thursday, up Fl
2.50 to Fl 185, near their 12-month high.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Frankfurt considers electronic trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRANKFURT stock exchange, the largest in Germany, is considering plans
for a fully electronic trading system by the middle of the decade, a move
which would transform Germany's financial markets.
The first step would be to abolish floor trading in the shares of Germany's
30 largest companies, according to proposals debated yesterday by the board
of the Frankfurt exchange. The exchange will decide by April whether to
adopt the plans.
News of the proposals came a day after the federal government launched a
package of measures designed to strengthen Germany's role as a world
financial centre.
Chief among these were plans to introduce a centralised body to regulate the
securities industry and to implement laws against insider dealing. Both
measures are to be introduced by the year-end.
A move to a fully electronic system could be just as significant for the
future of Germany's financial markets. It is likely to have a profound
effect on the structure of securities trading in Germany by concentrating
business now spread between four separate market systems. It will also act
as a catalyst for further centralisation of securities trading around
Frankfurt, which already handles more than 50 per cent of the business
conducted on Germany's eight exchanges.
Mr Rudiger von Rosen, chairman of the exchange, said such a move would be
consistent with developments in other markets. It would strengthen Germany's
position as a financial services centre by enhancing liquidity and
transparency in German share-trading and reducing transaction costs.
Details of the proposals, contained in a report prepared by the McKinsey
consulting firm, have not officially been made public. However, the essence
of the report has leaked out, provoking a furore among the so-called Freie
Makler, the official brokers who act as intermediaries on the official
market on which the bulk of domestic trading in the 30 largest companies is
done.
The Maklers fear they will lose business to the banks which will be able to
buy and sell directly via the new computer system. At present, they are
responsible for setting prices on the market floor, which is open for
business for three hours each day. The McKinsey report is believed to
conclude that there is no long-term future in running a screen-based system
in parallel with floor-trading.
Any full computerisation would follow the introduction of the Ibis
screen-based trading system in April last year which allows dealing in
shares in the DAX 30 index as well as in certain widely traded bond issues,
alongside floor trading. After a slow start, Ibis has gathered importance.
But the planned system would be more sophisticated and would, in time,
replace floor trading altogether.

FT  18 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Cityvision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cityvision, the UK's largest chain of video rental stores, could be heading
for a footnote in corporate finance manuals, if only as another example of
belated intervention by the institutions. A few of them are backing a group
of ex-managers in an attempt to oust a board which recently agreed to a
Pounds 75m bid from Blockbuster, a US chain. Given that the bid resulted in
Cityvision's share price doubling, the institutions might appear ungrateful.
Instead, the two-year collapse in the shares from over 140p to a low of 22p
last October has caused them to feel cheated by the 48p bid price.
If the counter-attack is successful, the shares will presumably fall back
again while the company is rebuilt. But with around a quarter of
City-vision's shares in the hands of arbitrageurs, the institutions have
their work cut out. Since they could simply have sold their shares, the
obvious question is why it took a bid to spur them into action. The sad
answer is that it almost always does. One only has to recall the case of
Ultramar; had that company not produced one set of disastrous six-month
results, it would presumably still be independent.
The institutions claimed to have been concerned for years at levels of
executive pay and the underperformance of Ultramar shares; but they achieved
nothing to compare with the brutal simplicity of the Lasmo offer.

FT  18 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just as well that sterling's recovery and the falling mortgage rate
have left the gilts market in reasonably cheerful mood. Otherwise
yesterday's PSBR figures could not have been shrugged off so lightly. The
most immediately unnerving part is the fall in corporation tax receipts to
little more than half their level of a year ago. That bodes ill for the PSBR
in January, normally a heavy month for corporation tax payments.
It also suggests the government's Pounds 10.5bn target for the full year
will be exceeded by a fair margin. The Bank of England's funding position
suddenly seems a trifle less comfortable, especially if it wants to stock up
for 1992-93 ahead of the election.
In the slightly longer term, the worry concerns the way the cycle is still
biting deeply into both tax receipts and spending. Against a background of
weak recovery at best, the 1992-3 PSBR now also looks also likely to exceed
the Pounds 19.8bn City consensus at the turn of the year.
That puts the total into the range where a little bit extra here or there
does not seem to matter. Thus, the prospect of vote-winning tax reductions
in the budget stirs little comment about fiscal rectitude. The same goes for
Labour's talk about phasing in its tax and national insurance changes while
increasing pensions and child benefit immediately. Each of these would add
the odd billion to an already high PSBR; not enough to restore it to the
real levels of the crisis-ridden 1970s, but sufficient to cramp the
post-election style of the lucky winner. Pledges of higher spending on the
infrastructure need to be taken with an ever larger pinch salt. So do
promises of tax cuts from a party which still professes commitment to a
balanced budget over the cycle.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank shares may have risen sharply this week on the hope that recovery will
help their bad debt problem, but the new charges being introduced by both
the Halifax and NatWest suggest another side to the story. Loan demand is
still flat; base rates are meanwhile 4 1/2 percentage points below their
peak, leaving both the banks and building societies with less of a cushion
to fund their overheads from cheap retail deposits.
So now they are scrabbling for extra income, and the defenceless retail
customer is the obvious target. One has to assume that other building
societies will latch on to the idea of charging for withdrawals and that
other banks will exact payment for refreshing the memory of those who happen
to forget their personal card number. As much as anything else, this will be
a sign of desperation in a market where there is not much sign of growth in
the core business at all.

FT  18 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: It all depends on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,536.7 (-4.9)
This column began the year on a bearish tack, suggesting that in the opening
months at least the investor would be better off in cash than in UK
equities. Given the cheerful mood in the markets this week, the position
deserves examination. Since the turn of the year, the FT-SE is up 44 points,
or 1.7 per cent. The Dow is up by nearer 3 per cent. Since the US recovery,
though not in the least detectable, is now at least feasible, Wall Street
may be on to something. The UK's position is more problematic.
In the past week, three things have happened to encourage the UK investor.
Labour has stumbled over the issue of taxation, the big building societies
have cut their mortgage rates and sterling has strengthened against the
D-Mark. None of these is exactly conclusive. Labour's reverse should be set
in the context of a campaign which still has months to run. The building
societies' action could be interpreted either as a forecast of lower
interest rates or as a desperate attempt to stimulate trade.
And above all, although sterling has been helped by the strength of the
dollar, it is still very nearly as low against the D-Mark as at any time
since joining the ERM. At yesterday's close of DM2.855, it is 7.7 pfennigs
above its absolute D-Mark floor. Given that it has shown itself capable of
falling by 4.7 pfennigs in a single day within the last year, that is not
much of a cushion.
The money market, as the chart shows, has lately abandoned thoughts of a
base rate rise. But as the chart also shows, the market has been wrong
before: last March, for example. Sterling is not out of the woods yet; and
at any serious hint of higher rates, the other bullish factors would go out
of the window.
Granted all that, there has been a genuine note of optimism about UK
equities this week, particularly in the move out of overvalued defensive
stocks and into cyclicals and high-yielders. Any market which can push Glaxo
down by 8.7 per cent in a week and ICI up by 7.5 per cent believes it has
scented real recovery. All the same, cash looks the safer bet for a little
while yet.

FT  18 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paribas falls 7.3% on profit
downgradings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECTOR rotation spread to a number of bourses yesterday, while Paris
concentrated on individual stocks, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS ended flat, but its steady close masked some big movements. The CAC 40
index closed 0.24 lower at 1,859.95, for a 1.2 per cent rise on the week.
Volume eased to FFr3bn from FFr3.2bn.
Paribas slumped FFr26 or 7.3 per cent to FFr330 on 172,33 shares on a wave
of downgradings on 1991 net income, from previous forecasts of around
FFr2.5bn to FFr1.5bn. The bank was reported to have told analysts at a
meeting on Thursday that it would have to make heavy provisions for loans to
Maxwell companies.
BSN rose FFr28 to FFr1,140 with 269,670 shares traded on speculation that
the Agnelli family would increase its stake in the food giant. Similar talk
drove Perrier up to FFr1,455 before it slipped back to close FFr8 higher at
FFr1,396.
Early selling, following the company's statement late on Thursday that
profits had fallen as much as 20 per cent in 1991, pushed Lyonnaise-Dumez as
low as FFr428. But it bounced back to close FFr15.50 higher at FFr458 in
258,705 shares.
FRANKFURT negotiated expiry day for DTB options with equities still ahead,
the DAX index closing 4.65 higher at 1,670.99 after a rise of 2.63 to 678.64
for the FAZ at midsession. Gains on the week were 3.4 and 4.0 per cent.
Volume rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.2bn. Strike threats were shrugged off as
Bayernhypo and Bayernverein rose DM6 to DM405 and DM6.20 to DM427.20, and
Hoesch and Thyssen by DM13.50 to DM255.50, and DM4.40 to DM221.80.
It remained a traders' market, rather than one for the fundamentalists. The
point was demonstrated again in carmakers, where the oversold Volkswagen
recovered another DM7.80 to DM324 while Daimler, highly regarded by most
analysts, fell DM2.70 to DM748.50.
MILAN ran into some profit-taking at the end of a strong week dominated by
domestic buying. The Comit index fell 2.92 to 548.11, up 3.1 per cent on the
week. Volume was estimated at less than Thursday's heavy L176.3bn.
Pirelli continued its recovery ahead of its rights issue, closing L68 or 5.7
per cent higher at L1,270. The stock has jumped by 20.8 per cent this week.
Telecoms were mixed after parliament approved a major restructuring of the
industry on Thursday night. Brokers said that the overhaul was expected to
favour Stet, Italcable and Sirti, but it increased the chances of Sip having
a rights issue. SIP fell L27 or 1.8 per cent to L1,498 while Stet added L13
to L2,284.
Insurers were depressed by indications that there would be no change in car
insurance tariffs before 1992. Generali eased L435 to L30,365.
AMSTERDAM was swayed by the dollar's volatility. The CBS Tendency Index rose
0.3 to 120.5, up 3.7 per cent on the week, in heavy turnover of Fl 1.14bn.
Philips rallied Fl 1.60 or 5.3 per cent to Fl 32.00 on reports of
upgradings. It said on Thursday that it was closing a microchip plant in the
US.
Shares in the brewer Grolsch were suspended at Thursday's closing price of
Fl 185.00 ahead of news that it was negotiating to buy the British regional
ale brewer, Ruddles, from Courage.
ZURICH talked of a recovery in cyclicals with Alusuisse, SFr28 higher at
SFr937, also reflecting the revival in the aluminium price. Declines
elsewhere included Von Roll, down SFr50 to SFr900 on a group loss for 1991.
The all-share SPI index fell 2.2 to 1,104.05 on the day, but rose 1.5 per
cent on the week.
MADRID steadied after an early fall but still ended with the general index
2.76 lower at 253.92, a fraction higher on the week. The index was weighed
down by Telefonica, which fell Pta50 to Pta1,215 after it said that
stockholders' equity and, to a lesser extent, future operating results could
be affected by plans for new pension benefits.
BRUSSELS closed higher, the Bel-20 Index adding 7.58 to 1,156.50 for a 4.5
per cent rise on the week. Petrofina put on BFr25 to BFr10,975 on moderate
volume of 7,860 shares.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index put in its third consecutive rise to
close 1.8 higher at 982.2. A rise of SKr5 to SKr122 in Ericsson B could not
offset the drop in Astra A of SKr22 to SKr560.
OSLO was lifted by Norsk Hydro which jumped NKr13, or 8.5 per cent to
NKr166. The all-share index rose 8.92 to 464.24, up 8 per cent on the week.

FT  18 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg extends its three-year
advance - Philip Gawith analyses the South African climb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first few weeks of 1992 have seen the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)
continue the onward march which has made it one of the best-performing stock
markets in each of the last three years.
The all-share index closed at a new record of 3,713 on Wednesday, a rise of
8.9 per cent since December 23, and 39 per cent higher than a year ago. The
financial and industrial index, which has made most of the running over the
past year, closed at 5,016, 9.7 per cent up on December 23, and 54.5 per
cent higher than a year previously. Although the market has weakened
slightly over the past two days, the gains remain mostly intact.
Analysts agree that the main explanation for the JSE's strong advance in
recent weeks lies in the strong performance of world stock markets,
particularly Wall Street following the pre-Christmas cut in the discount
rate by the Federal Reserve. The JSE closely tracks the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
The JSE has also been boosted by the unexpected firmness in the gold bullion
price which is trading at about Dollars 356 per ounce. This fed over into
the prices of gold shares, with the All Gold index rising by 12.8 per cent
from December 23 to close at 1,324 on Friday. The index is close to its
year-ago level but is still a long way from the 2,250 reached in early 1990.
Mr Paul Beachy Head, general manager for investments at the Southern Life
insurance company, says the view that share prices rarely fall when interest
rates are on the decline is the cause of positive sentiment in the market.
Local brokers, who hold this view about the US market, believe it also
applies in South Africa. Although the bank rate has not been cut for nearly
a year, there is unanimity that a cut in rates will come within the next few
months. This view received further support earlier this week from the news
that producer price inflation had fallen to 7.9 per cent in November, the
lowest level in eight years. Money market rates on short-term paper have
also come off quite sharply in recent months.
Mr Beachy Head also believes that the JSE is enjoying a political re-rating.
'Political developments continue to be perceived as favourable and hence the
risk premium demanded on shares is seen to be declining.'
Although JSE industrial shares were considered to be in expensive territory
even before the latest increases, Mr Beachy Head does not consider
valuations to be 'frothy'. He said he would not rule out a speculative
bubble developing on the JSE over the next few years, similar to 1969 when
the market's price/earnings ratio reached 25 (the overall index is currently
on a multiple of 13.3).
Whether this bubble appears or not, it is already the case that the JSE is
discounting earnings prospects further ahead than used to be the case. Mr
Roy McAlpine, fund manager at the Liberty Life insurance company, expresses
the popular view when he says he is not expecting earnings from industrial
companies to improve in 10992. 'Company profits are going to be under
enormous pressure this year. In many cases earnings will be flat or down.
Off this base, the possibility for a further favourable re-rating is very
limited.'
He also points out that South Africa cannot kick-start its economy on its
own. The economy has a strong export orientation, so growth will remain slow
until world economies pick up. For this reason, Mr McAlpine is doubtful
whether, this year, mining counters will experience the sort of price
increases which industrial stocks have been enjoying. 'Activity will only
happen if you get favourable price movements in the underlying metal.'
Few analysts are predicting significant price rises for South Africa's large
commodity exports like gold, platinum and ferrochrome. Mining houses,
however, have already enjoyed a considerable upward re-rating over the past
year. The bellwether stock here, Anglo American, traded this week at
R131.75, 57 per cent up on its 1991 low of R84.
Although sceptical of the extent to which economic fundamentals justify the
market's optimism, Mr McAlpine points out that cash or gilts have been very
poor alternatives to equities over the past 25 years, and there seems little
reason to expect a change in the near future. This is the familiar
'hothouse' effect on the JSE, whereby exchange control prevents institutions
investing their enormous cash flows abroad, with few favourable alternatives
to equities at home.
Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors, a local financial institution, argues
that although the market is high by South African standards - the financial
and industrial index is on a p/e of 14.7 - it can be justified if the
country achieves its growth potential (3-5 per cent per annum growth in GDP)
over the next three to four years. He does not, however, see the financial
and industrial index repeating last year's re-rating until improved earnings
start coming through, probably next year.
Despite the stock market's record-breaking advance, Mr Lee believes there is
still value to be found. The good performance of the index reflects
institutional buying of a limited number of blue chip stocks like Barlows,
SAB, Richemont, Rembrandt and Anglo American. Second-tier stocks not
included the index have not enjoyed similar upward re-ratings are likely to
attract increasing attention from investors.

FT  18 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei at lowest level
since October 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-LINKED arbitrage and institutional selling prior to March
book-closings pushed the Nikkei average to its lowest level in over a year
yesterday amid continued low volume, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed down 290.82 at 21,321.37, the lowest close since October
1, 1990, and down 4.7 per cent on the week. The index posted a high of
21,660.29 and a low of 21,145.71 during the day. Volume came to 240m shares,
against 244m on Thursday.
Declines led rises by 814 to 172 with 132 shares unchanged. All 36 sectoral
indices declined while 192 issues reached their lowest levels since 1990.
The Topix index of all first section shares fell 18.12 to 1,600.26 but, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.23 to 1,217.76.
The broadly-based decline was triggered early in the day as continued
selling by trust funds and other financial institutions, combined with
futures-related arbitrage to put pressure on shares, a pattern whichhas
become familiar in recent days.
'The great fiscal year-end selling spree has started,' said Mr Jesper Koll,
economist at SG Warburg. 'This is putting tremendous pressure on the market
at a time when you can't find any interest in Tokyo equities.'
Prices recovered briefly in the early afternoon on talk of a meeting between
executives of the Big Four securities houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and
Yamaichi, to discuss market support measures. Comments by Bank of Japan
Governor Yasushi Mieno suggesting that interest rates might fall also lent
some support.
At a conference yesterday, Mr Kenji Kobata, general manager at Nomura
Securities, said that he expected the market to emerge from its slump in the
second half of 1992.
Financials lost ground, with Nomura Securities off Y50 at Y1,510 and
Sumitomo Bank downY50 at Y1,880. Pharmaceuticals also fell, with Dainippon
declining Y50 to Y1,240 and Daiichi by Y40 to Y1,530. Electricals managed
some gains, with TDK up Y120 to Y4,350 and Toshiba by Y6 to Y636. Some
speculative issues surged after a heavy sell-off the previous day, with
Takuma rising Y30 to Y1,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 227.87 to 22,779.84 in volume of 82.2m
shares. Izumiya fell Y150 to Y1,750.
Roundup
HEAVY volume featured in a number of rising markets yesterday.
HONG KONG scored its fourth successive all-time high, the Hang Seng index
rising 42.75 to 4,454.89, up nearly 1 per cent on the day and 2.5 per cent
on the week.
Turnover rose again, from HKDollars 1.92bn to HKDollars 2.3bn. The market
was lifted by news of a trade accord between the US and China.
MANILA broke up through 1,300 as the composite index closed 26.51 higher at
1,303.30, its highest point since the coup attempt in December 1989, up 2.1
per cent on the day and 6.8 per cent on the week.
Turnover climbed from 98m to 172m pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone,
which gained Dollars 1 in New York on Thursday to Dollars 37 7/8 , rose 40
pesos to 1,000.
BANGKOK saw heavy buying of finance and property issues which took turnover
up to a second consecutive all-time high of Bt12.34bn, up from Bt8.59bn on
Thursday. The SET index rose 12.50 to 770.83, 5.9 per cent higher on the
week.
SEOUL majored in shares with low price-earnings ratios as the composite
index closed 6.53 higher at 616.72, slightly lower on the week in turnover
little changed at Won355.9bn. TAIWAN ended the week 5.5 per cent better with
the weighted index up 22.98 to 5045.94, turnover rising from TDollars 49.3bn
to TDollars 53.1bn. AUSTRALIA featured gains in oils and mining shares, but
banks fell and the All Ordinaries index stood still at 1,673.5, up 0.3 per
cent on the week in turnover down from ADollars 287m to ADollars 241m.
NEW ZEALAND fell in light profit taking following the strong gains in the
previous two sessions, the NZSE-40 index losing 0.9 per cent on both the day
and the week as it closed 12.84 lower at 1,504.93.
SINGAPORE saw bargain-hunting but finished mixed in active trading, the
Straits Times Industrial index rising 3.46 to 1,532.51, up 3.0 per cent on
the week. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index ended just 0.42 higher at 569.65
after profit-taking, but was 3.2 per cent higher on the week.
BOMBAY was lifted to its third record high this week by a surging steel
sector, on news late on Thursday that the government was lifting its
controls on steel prices and distribution. The BSE Index soared 113.29 or
5.7 per cent to close at 2,115.89, after an intraday peak of 2,118.15.
JAKARTA's index rose 1.44 to 251.25 on turnover of slightly more than 2m
shares compared to 3.63m on Thursday. Brokers said that profit-taking
dominated Friday's half-day trading, but some favourite shares gained a
slight rise. Indah Kiat dropped 50 rupiah to 2,450, with over 200,000 shares
traded. Argo Pantes fell 100 rupiah to 3,800.

FT  18 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets ended a busy week with a calmer session yesterday
although stock index futures trading was characterised by volatility writes
Joel Kibazo.
A squeeze at the opening sent the March Footsie contract forward to touch
the 2,600 level, encouraged by firm gilts and currencies markets. Sellers
then emerged mid-morning causing March to give up earlier gains. The
contract continued to drift lower, paying no heed to UK inflation figures
that were in line with market expectations, until early afternoon.
Sporadic buying was then noted as dealers anticipated a firm opening on Wall
Street. When this did not materialise, March once again retreated.
March closed at 2,576, up 8 on the previous session and some 17 points above
its fair value estimated premium to cash of 23. Turnover reached 6,837, down
on levels seen for most of the week.
In traded options, turnover reached 36,554 lots. Marks &amp; Spencer was the
busiest stock option trading a hefty 5,241 contracts with the April 300
calls the busiest series. Analysts have come to the view that the Christmas
and post-Christmas sales figures at the group are likely to be ahead of
earlier predictions.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Appointments: Reshuffle at Salomon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON BROTHERS, the US investment house suffering from a wave of
defections among staff unhappy about their bonuses, yesterday announced two
promotions.
Gary Wolens becomes head of equity sales for Europe, replacing Peter Clarke
who resigned on Thursday. Wolens is currently a managing director
responsible for fixed income and equity derivatives distribution in Europe
and the Middle East.
Salomon says his appointment underscores its intentions of staying in and
developing the European equities business. After making another senior
member of staff on the equity side redundant, the firm was anxious to fill
Clarke's position speedily - to deflect doubts about its commitment to that
area.
Meanwhile Kermit Schoenholtz returns from Tokyo, where he is currently a
director and international economist, to become manager of the economic and
market analysis group in London, stepping into John Lipsky's shoes. Lipsky
has moved to New York to replace Henry Kaufman, who stepped down as chief
economist in 1988.
He will also be Salomon's senior German analyst, bringing the team up to
strength since the departure of Thomas Mayer who left shortly after the US
treasury bond-rigging scandal broke.
As a result of that crisis last summer, Salomon was forced to reorganise
senior management, leaving some lingering unhappiness, but other colleagues
have left over compensation. Last year's bonuses were lower than in 1990,
and the framework for 1992 compensations is currently being set - for the
first time at the beginning rather than the end of the year.
Peter Kelsey is to succeed Brian Gladwin as managing director of ROYAL LIFE
ESTATES, the largest UK estate agency network. He was previously director
and general manager of Dart Oil company, Esso Petroleum's direct retailing
subsidiary.
His mission at Royal Life Estates is to try to push the group back into the
black after several years of loss-making. Last year Royal Life Estates lost
Pounds 8m.
Some of his team are already in place. Last October Ron Way was brought in
as finance director for the agency network.
Tough new financial controls are already being put in place and new
marketing activities are planned to enable the group to take advantage of
any market upturn.
*****
The UK Machine Tool Technologies Association has appointed Simon Brown
director general with immediate effect, filling a gap left since the
resignation last July of John Nosworthy.
Brown, 41, is currently the association's administration manager and company
secretary, and had been co-ordinating the trade association's day-to-day
activities since July.
The appointment underlines the association's desire for continuity at a
difficult time for the UK machine tool industry by appointing someone who
'knows the ropes' rather than a high-profile outsider. Brown joined the MTTA
as company secretary two years ago, and has spent 20 years in accountancy,
exhibition and trade association activities.

FT  18 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling wave hits Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL group Fisons suffered the biggest percentage fall of all the
FT-SE 100 stocks yesterday and recorded the highest turnover. The shares
fell 27, or 7.5 per cent, to 334p with a closing volume of 15m. The effect
of the heavy switching out of pharmaceutical stocks in New York was
accentuated by negative press reports. Specifically, an article yesterday
said Fisons' most promising product, the asthma drug Tilade, had been
criticised by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Analysts said they were slightly surprised by the effect of the press
reports. One said: 'We are not learning anything new here but clearly
shareholders are still nervous. This sort of news is already reflected in
the price but there does tend to be a knee-jerk reaction.'
BET falls
Strong rumours of a downgrade in 1992 profit forecasts for international
support services company BET by one securities house led to a sharp fall in
the share price.
The shares had been up about 10p for much of the day. Then, speculation
swept the market that securities house Robert Fleming would on Monday be
reducing its 1992 forecast for BET to Pounds 135m, well below the range of
analysts forecasts which stands between Pounds 150m and Pounds 165m. The
shares tumbled sharply to close 19 off at 186p with 6.3m traded. A number of
houses mentioned Fleming but the house had no comment to make.
BP hit again
The recent see-saw performance by BP continued yesterday with the shares
heavily sold and finally 8 lower at 284p - one of the Footsie's poorest
individual performances. Earlier in the week BP shares, along with most of
the oil stocks, posted good gains as crude oil prices recovered in the wake
of production cuts. Adding to the bullish trend in the stock was a flurry of
broker buy notes in the sector.
Yesterday's notable weakness emerged after Strauss Turnbull, the broker,
issued a swingeing downgrade of the 1992 profits forecast on the basis of an
increase in the company's tax charge from 45 per cent to an average of 50
per cent during 1992; 'this means a substamntially uncovered dividend for
two years,' said Mr John Toalster at Strauss. He also spsoke of the
company's refining margins coming under more pressure. Strauss chopped their
1992 forecast from Pounds 930m to Pounds 750m.
Construction group AMEC remained one of the pacemakers in the contracting
sub-sector despite the placing of a hefty block of shares in the company via
a 'bought deal.' The Seaq ticker revealed that two large blocks of AMEC were
traded, a line of 7.1m at 145p and a block of 7.1 at 146p.
Smith New Court, widely regarded as the market's 'bought deal' specialist,
was said to have transacted the business which caused little more than a
murmur in AMEC shares. They closed a net 7 higher at 152p with turnover,
made up largely of both sides of the bought deal, reaching 15.2m.
An early fall in Wellcome was reversed after the group said sales in the
first four months of its financial year to the end of August had risen by by
20 per cent. The shares a closed 12 up at 1034p with 3.6m traded.
The slide in pharmaceuticals stocks continued yesterday. Glaxo dropped 28 to
838p, and SmithKline Beecham lost 34 to 889p.
Cyclical switching benefited RTZ (up 15 537p) and ICI (33 better at 1255p).
Hanson appeared to find a level at 216 1/2 p but saw good two-way business
with 11m shares dealt.
Shell, a good performer for much of the week, ran into profit-taking and
settled 6 off at 497p on a heavy turnovver of 7.7m shares. British Gas,
remained firm at 243p on 5.7m.
Dealers noted persistent demand for Burmah Castrol, which ended the day 11
higher at 519p, on stories that the first in a series of disposals
associated with the Foseco business acquired by Burmah last year, is
imminent. Burmah shares have risen 33p over the week.
Property shares gained from the move into cyclical stocks as buyers were
spurred on by Thursday's mortgage rate cuts. As prices rose, some brokers
issued urgent sell notes and the market was hit by profit-taking.
However, many analysts believe the rises are sustainable.
Of the leading stocks, British Land was up 7 to 262p, Greycoat gained 7 to
75p, Land Securities added 13 to 473p, while MEPC rose 11 to 395p.
Hammerson, which announced the part-letting of a Fifth Avenue office block,
saw its Ordinary shares gain 12 to 535p, the A shares closing 10 ahead at
475p.
Medeva fell 12 to 216p. It was announced that the Bank of New York, which
holds American Depositary Receipts for its clients, had increased its
interest in Medeva by 1.5m shares to almost 28m (14.13 per cent). Arjo
Wiggins Appleton fell 17 to 258p on announcing the breaking off of
negotiations for the sale of its 42.8 per cent stake in Soporcel.
Leisure stocks with significant property exposure benefited from the rally
in property shares. Ladbroke jumped 8 1/2 to 222 1/2 p and Rank Organisation
rose 15 to 616p, while the less-exposed Forte gained 3 to 234p.
Unusually heavy turnover of 16m at Cityvision left the shares only  1/4 p
higher at 51p, with Blockbuster, the company making the agreed Pounds 75m
takeover for the video rental group, active in the market.
Hopes that the latest cuts in mortgage rates will quickly filter through
into retail spending prompted another bout of out performanceby stores
shares. Leading the sector higher was Marks &amp; Spencer, up 10 to 302p on
turnover of 6.5m.
Alexon was another strong performer, the shares settling 18 higher at 349p
after a recent presentation at BZW attended by around 20 leading
institutions. and profits estimates for next
Burton edged up 1 1/2 to 40p with hefty turnover of 16m substantially
boosted by an agency cross of 5m at 39p.
Thursday's mortgage rate cuts by leading UK lenders triggered another burst
of buying interest in building materials and construction stocks. In the
former group RMC took pride of place in advancing 23 to 579p while Rugby,
heavily bought on Thursday, raced up 9 more to 196p.
The Steetley/Redland bid battle hotted up with speculation that ECC,
formerly English China Clays, is about to enter the fray, driving Steetley
higher. They closed 11 better at 381p, well below the Redland terms, while
the latter, moved up 15 to 473p. Significantly, according to dealers, ECC
fell 3 to 485p, having been as low as 478p earlier in the session.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Silver takes lead in
bullion market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER TOOK over the role of pace maker in the precious metals market this
week. Having been towed into higher ground by gold's strength, silver prices
spent the early part of the week consolidating those gains before moving
ahead strongly to a six-month high on US commission house and investment
fund buying.
The rise took the cash price at the London bullion market through stiff
resistance at at 425 cents a troy ounce on Thursday, when the market easily
absorbed a bout of Middle East selling, and despite easing back by 6 cents
yesterday it closed at 430 cents an ounce, a net gain of 18 cents.
Traders noted that the advance was aided by improved sentiment on the
outlook for the US economy.
Silver's strength spilled over into the gold and platinum markets, which had
earlier surrendered some of last week's gains. After dipping to Dollars
353.90 an ounce the gold price was pushed up to Dollars 357.65 an ounce
before meeting stiff resistance. It closed yesterday at Dollars 356.35 an
ounce, down Dollars 1.40 on the week. Meanwhile the platinum price rallied
from Tuesday's low of Dollars 332 an ounce to Dollars 348 an ounce, up
Dollars 6.25 on balance.
At the London Metal Exchange the leading base metals contracts also built on
last week's gains. The sharpest gains were for aluminium, up Dollars 51 at
Dollars 1,188 a tonne in the cash position; copper, up Pounds 34 at Pounds
1,210; and nickel, up Dollars 390 at Dollars 7,710.
Aluminium's rise started in mid-week after dealer purchases and option
covering triggered a wave of stop-loss buying. In the absence a fundamental
explanation dealers put the advance down to investment fund and speculator
buying. But they noted that gains were limited by producer selling and that,
suggested Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Car, Kitcat &amp; Aitken, indicated that
producers felt the market would 'get worse before it gets better'.
Nevertheless, as aluminium tends to lead the base metals out of recession,
because of its use in a wide variety of industrial and consumer products,
the market's improved sentiment was reflected in other LME contracts.
Copper in particular benefited from aluminium's strength, after a threat of
a temporary stoppage, because of financial difficulties, at the huge La
Oroya complex in Peru, which produces about 50,000 tonnes of copper a year,
failed to materialise. Yesterday the price fell back Pounds 11 in spite of
news that Inco of Canada had declared force majeure on shipments from its
Copper Cliff refinery because of furnace failures. According to the company,
however, output losses should amount to only about 7,700 tonnes.
The La Oroya fears also affected the zinc market, which already had its tail
up because of Monday's announcement that Nuova Samim of Italy would be
closing its 100,000 tonnes-a-year Crotone smelter in southern Italy for a
refit at some time during the first half of this year. That followed the
announcement of the closure of Union Miniere's 120,000-tonne Overpelt
smelter in Belgium. Cash zinc closed on the LME yesterday at Dollars 1,161 a
tonne, up Dollars 24.50 on the week.
Concern over Russian supplies was chiefly responsible for the rise in the
nickel market. President Yeltsin was quoted in a local newspaper in the town
of Nikel as saying that the huge nickel complex in the area should be closed
because it was uneconomic. Analysts played down the significance of this,
however, pointing out that Mr Yeltsin said the closure should follow
Russia's switch to a free market economy, which could take a very long time.
There was also some talk circulating early yesterday of difficulties at
Outokumpu's 14,000 tonnes-a-year Harjavalta plant in western Finland. But
this was denied by the company.
Tin and lead were again left out of the uptrend, the former dipping at one
point to a fresh life-of-contract low of Dollars 5,485 a tonne in the three
months position. Lead continued to be depressed by flat battery sales and
the cash position closed yesterday at Pounds 287.50 a tonne, down Pounds
2.50 on the week.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange, the cocoa market, after devoting
a few days to consolidation, resumed its recent uptrend. Helped by
sterling's decline against the dollar and news of a bigger-than-expected
10.8 per cent rise in UK fourth quarter bean grindings (compared with the
same period last year) the May delivery position ended Pounds 12 up on the
week at Pounds 772 a tonne. The currency factor also boosted sterling coffee
futures.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Appointments: Entertaining synergies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tussauds Group, which owns and operates not just the London waxworks but
a range of other attractions from Warwick Castle to Alton Towers, has
appointed Michael Jolly to the newly created post of chief operating
officer.
A marketing man who spent 11 years at Cadbury-Schweppes before moving to
Tussauds in 1983, the 39-year-old Jolly has recently returned from three
months at Harvard on the advanced management programme. He says he is now
'going through the mental processes of deciding which parts of what I learnt
are applicable (to Tussauds).'
The point of having a chief operating officer, according to Jolly, is to
make more effective use of potential synergies within the group - from
sharing management expertise to co-ordinating an approach to large suppliers
such as Coca-Cola and Kodak.
In a month when Windsor Safari Park called in the receivers, Jolly contends
that Tussauds, while far from untouched by the recession, is faring 'rather
better than some'.
The group, which is owned by Pearson, is keen to grow outside the UK -
beyond its one Madame Tussaud Scenerama in Amsterdam. Consequently, Ray
Barratt becomes development director, also formally a new post, although he
had previously been an executive director responsible among other things for
development.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Appointments: Tenuous tenure for Gunn?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Gunn has just been appointed to a job which circumstances may prevent
him from taking up. Legislation to establish the Further Education Funding
Council should be passed shortly, but if Labour wins the election it may
well be repealed. Gunn's tenure as chairman would therefore be rather short.
If set up, the FEFC will take over from local authorities a Pounds 2bn
budget for financing the 563 further-education, tertiary and sixth-form
colleges in England, which cater predominantly for the 16-19 age-range. It
will also have responsibility for monitoring colleges' financial planning
and performance - likely to be an onerous undertaking, given their financial
inexperience.
Gunn, 65, spent 39 years with Boots. As chairman for the five years until
July 1990, he was responsible for the spending-spree which brought to the
retail chain car-parts and do-it-yourself companies, among others. Given the
state of many further education colleges, this background would seem
pertinent. To be fair, though, Gunn is no stranger to the education debate
having done a stint on the Polytechnics Funding Council (PCFC).
However, with only a day or so a week to give to the FEFC, Gunn will be
heavily dependent on the chief executive, William Stubbs, also appointed
yesterday. Stubbs moves sideways from the PCFC, where he is widely credited
as a force behind the polytechnics' rapid expansion in the past four years.
'We need to create a national system for 16-to-19 education which ranks with
the best in the world,' says Stubbs - not exactly a modest strategy.

FT  18 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking reverses early advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKERS made their expected appearance in the UK stock market
yesterday but the broad range of shares held on to the gains achieved this
week. The FT-SE Index was again held back by determined selling of
pharmaceutical stocks, with Fisons hit hard as Tilade, its asthma drug, met
criticism from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The session opened strongly as some UK public opinion polls indicated an
improvement in the ratings of the Conservative government of Mr John Major.
Switching from the pharmaceutical sector into the cyclical stocks continued,
with the institutions buying the banks, building and construction and retail
stocks.
The Footsie quickly advanced by nearly 20 points in early dealings to
challenge the 2,560 mark, despite heavy falls in Glaxo, Fisons and
SmithKline Beecham which between them represented minus 8.6 on the Footsie
scale.
The stock market slowed down at midday and profit-takers appeared when Wall
Street made a slow start to the new session after IBM disclosed a loss for
the final quarter. The early gains in UK stocks were steadily whittled away
and, although the Dow edged higher in UK hours, London closed down on the
day, at least in index terms.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,536.7, a net loss of 4.9. This
week has brought a gain of around 2.4 per cent in the UK stock market as
hopes of economic recovery have prompted switching into those stocks thought
likely to respond to an improved business climate. The sudden advance in the
London market has been the more impressive in that it was triggered by
cash-raising selling of the heavyweight pharmaceutical stocks.
Trading volume remained high yesterday, with Seaq recording 687.2m shares
against 638.4m on Thursday. This week has seen an increase in genuine
customer, or retail, business in equities. Thursday, the most active day
this week, saw retail volume worth Pounds 1.2bn.
European-based funds, which have shown themselves sensitive to political
trends in the UK, were buying equities in London yesterday. Domestic
investors were also active, taking the view that this week's cuts in
mortgage rates may set the scene for further stimulus to the economy at
Budget time.
The UK retail index figures, showing an annualised rate of 4.5 per cent in
December, confirmed expectations in the City of London. Government bonds,
the clearest beneficiaries from falling inflation, moved upwards and
although below the best, showed gains of around  3/8 at the close.
Equity, or customer, volume in equities has picked up sharply since the
Christmas holiday and remains above last year's daily averages.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Late selling erodes dollar gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar lost the best of recent gains in a bout of late selling on the
foreign exchange markets yesterday, losing 3 pfennigs as dealers took
profits before the weekend, writes Simon London.
Overnight in Far East trading the dollar was stable, pushing higher against
the D-Mark. From a close in New York at DM1.6172, the US currency rose to
DM1.6265 by the close in Tokyo, just below a resistence level at DM1.6280
which marked the high point of the day.
Against the yen the picture was reversed, with the dollar falling back
slightly from Y128.28 in New York to Y127.95.
The yen was supported by comments from Mr Yasushi Meino, Bank of Japan
govenor, which were interpreted as meaning that the authorities were
prepared to tolerate a stonger currency.
But the D-Mark continues to be weak and this was reflected in its cross rate
with the yen, which fell steadily through the session.
From Y79.23 at the close in London, the German currency fell to Y78.67 by
the Tokyo close, breaching the Y78.80 level at which it was expected to find
support. Instead, stop-loss trading programmes kicked into action,
accelerating the decline of the D-Mark.
In early European trading the US currency finally breached DM1.6280 after
two days of pressure, rising to a high of DM1.6350 during the morning
session. Overnight losses against the yen were also recovered as the US unit
rose to Y128.50.
However, in late afternooon a wave of selling pushed the dollar back to a
low of DM1.5930 and Y127.12. Some traders blamed the fall on US trade
figures for November, which showed a sharp 5.5 per cent fall in the level of
imports, underlining the weakness of consumer demand in the economy.
Other analysts noted that the selling pressure had all the hallmarks of
profit-taking before the weekend. The US unit closed at DM1.6070, from
DM1.6185, and Y127.45 from Y128.30.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling remained close to its
floor against the Spanish peseta but gained ground against the D-Mark in
line with other currencies.
Having closed at DM2.85 in London yesterday, the UK currency rose to
DM2.8520 during the morning session, a position maintained through the day.
Sterling close in London at DM2.8550.
UK inflation data for December showed a sharper than expected rise in the
rate of retail price increases but this did not dent the stability of
sterling.
The retail price index rose during the month at a year-on-year rate of 4.5
per cent, from 4.3 per cent in November. Most analysts had expected a 4.4
per cent year on year rate. Excluding mortgage payments and poll tax, core
inflation rose at a year-on-year rate of 7.8 per cent from 7.7 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Rates edge higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money market interest rates were pushed higher again yesterday with the
market continuing to experience an overall shortage of funds, writes Simon
London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 2bn for the day,
around half of which resulted from maturing treasury bills and the expiry of
earlier money market assistance.
In early assistance the Bank injected a chunky Pounds 997m. This comprised
the outright purchase of band 1 treasury and bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent,
band 2 bank bills at 10 3/16 per cent and band 4 bank bills at 10 1/8 per
cent. In addition, the Bank purchased Pounds 115m for resale to the market
on February 3 at 10 7/16 per cent - the same repurchase terms as on
Thursday.
A further Pounds 527m was injected in the late morning, comprising the
purchase of further band 1, 2 and 4 bills and a Pounds 135m repurchase paper
on the same terms.
In the afternoon session, Pounds 373m was injected through the purchase of
band 1,2,3 and 4 bills. Late assistance totalled Pounds 150m, bring the
injection for the day to Pounds 2.05bn.
This was enough to keep the lid on overnight money rates, following wild
fluctuations which saw unsecured overnight money trade up to 30 per cent on
Thursday. However, overnight funds still closed at 11 - 10 3/4 per cent,
against 10 3/4 -  3/4 per cent on Thursday.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange traded up to 89.72 during the day, from a close of 89.69 on
Thursday, but fell back through the afternoon session to close at 89.70.
In Frankfurt, money market interest rates eased for the second day running.
Call money traded mostly at around 9.40/50 per cent, from 9.45/55 per cent
on Thursday and 9.55/60 seen earlier in the week. Analysts noted that the
anticipated liquidity squeeze ahead of this months deadline for taxation
payments had failed to materialise.
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan was content to see rates edge higher, offering
no immediate assistance in the face of a Y140bn liquidity shortage. Call
money traded up to 5 5/8 per cent, up  3/32 of a point from Thursday.
Rates could press higher still on Monday. A Y1,100bn shortage is forecast,
but the Bank of Japan will sell the same amount of bills, draining funds
from the market.

JAPAN Airlines (JAL) is strengthening its relationship with Qantas, the
Australian airline, through a series of leasing agreements, but it denied
Japanese press reports that it planned to take a 5 per cent equity stake in
the company, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
JAL is to lease Qantas aircraft and pilots for three routes between Japan
and Australia, with the Japanese airline providing the passenger service
staff. The agreement is likely to begin in April this year and last for two
years, and will help JAL overcome a shortage of pilots.
But JAL insisted that it has no firm plans to take a holding in the
state-owned Qantas.

FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Inland Steel turns in record
loss of Dollars 275.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INLAND Steel reported its largest ever annual loss in 1991 totalling Dollars
275.1m, or Dollars 9.88 per share.
The results, already hit by low steel prices and poor demand for consumer
durables, were further depressed by a Dollars 215m restructuring charge
relating to plant closures and about 3,500 jobs cuts. The workforce
reduction will take place over several years.
Before the restructuring provision, the company's net loss last year was
Dollars 110m, or Dollars 4.55 per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars
20.6m, or Dollars 1.41, in 1990. Sales fell by 12 per cent to Dollars 3.4bn
from Dollars 3.87bn in 1990.
For the fourth quarter, when the charge was taken, Inland reported a net
loss of Dollars 191.3m, or Dollars 6.44. Before the charge, the loss had
been Dollars 26.2m, or Dollars 1.11, against losses of Dollars 57.1m, or
Dollars 2.05 per share, a year ago.
Mr Frank Luerssen, Inland's chairman, said the company's restructuring and a
modernisation programme should allow it to benefit from steel's next upturn.
But, he said, 'we have no illusions that the months ahead are going to be
anything but difficult. The outlook for steel orders, particularly from the
automobile industry, remains weak.'

FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Salomon sees deficit of Dollars
30m in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US SECURITIES house Salomon announced yesterday that it expected to report a
Dollars 30m after-tax loss for the fourth quarter of 1991.
The warning surprised brokerage analysts on Wall Street, who had expected
the company to record healthy profits in the wake of lower US interest rates
and vibrant domestic financial markets.
Salomon said in a brief statement that the fourth-quarter loss would reduce
after-tax earnings for the full year to about Dollars 500m, a figure which
includes the Dollars 200m charge the company took in the third quarter to
cover potential costs and fines arising from its illegal activities in the
US Treasury markets.
The loss in the last three months of 1991 was partly due to a one-off
Dollars 60m charge taken by Salomon's oil subsidiary, Phibro Energy.
The charge, which will leave Phibro with a loss of Dollars 60m for the
quarter and a small profit for the year of Dollars 43m, was taken to reflect
the reduction in the value of the company's oil refining and marketing
inventories, caused by the worldwide decline in petroleum and petroleum
product prices.
Although the Phibro charge partly explained why the Salomon group incurred a
loss in the fourth quarter, analysts remained puzzled by the forecast of a
disappointing contribution from the Salomon Brothers securities operation,
which the company said would make a 'modest' profit in the fourth quarter.
Salomon offered no explanation why its securities business did not shine in
a quarter when US interest rates were falling and bond prices were rising.
As Wall Street's premier bond trading house, Salomon would normally be
expected to have profited hugely from the favourable interest rate
environment and the heavy trading volume in Treasury markets.
Industry observers suggested several possible reasons for Salomon Brothers'
modest quarter. The sale of Dollars 50bn in assets that Salomon undertook in
the second half of the year to stave off liquidity problems in the wake of
the Treasury market scandal will undoubtedly have reduced the firm's
earnings from interest and capital appreciation.
The scandal also led to the loss of some customer business and forced the
firm into a radical restructuring, which are likely to have reduced revenues
and pushed up costs, particularly those related to the shedding of more than
130 jobs in US and European operations.

WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has been severely hit by
bad real estate loans, yesterday underscored the impact of recession on its
industrial operations when it reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars
171m.
The profit figure, equivalent to 51 cents a share, compares with a loss of
Dollars 449m, or Dollars 1.53 in the same period of 1990, when the company
took a Dollars 975m charge to cover real estate and other losses at its
troubled financial services subsidiary.
However, before making that charge the company reported a net profit of
Dollars 284m in the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues in the latest
quarter were Dollars 3.4bn, against Dollars 3.7bn.
Westinghouse, which took a further Dollars 1.68bn charge in the third
quarter of this year to cover problems at the finance company, is trying to
sell many of the subsidiary's assets to bolster its balance sheet and reduce
debt.
It said yesterday it had disposed of about Dollars 700m of corporate
financing, real estate and leasing assets in the third quarter. The finance
company's total assets now stand at Dollars 8.6bn and it reported a net loss
of Dollars 5.1m for the quarter.
Among Westinghouse's industrial businesses, operating profits in its
electronic systems, industries, office furniture, environmental and
broadcasting divisions were all lower during the quarter, mainly due to the
recession.
However, operating profits for power systems were significantly higher, due
to volume increases.
For the full year Westinghouse reported a net loss of Dollars 1.1bn, or
Dollars 3.46 share, on revenues of Dollars 12.8bn, against net income for
1990 of Dollars 268m, or 91 cents, on revenues of Dollars 12.9bn.

forecast

<TEXT>
COMPAGNIE de Suez, the French financial and industrial holding group,
yesterday estimated that profits would rise to between FFr3.8bn and FFr4bn
for 1991, compared to FFr3.7bn (USDollars 670m) in the previous year.
The forecast, in line with the group's earlier estimates, marks a
significant recovery from 1990, when Suez's profits fell by 9 per cent. Mr
Gerard Worms, the chairman, wrote to shareholders: 'I am convinced that the
market will soon realise that Suez's prospects are thoroughly positive.'
The increase comes despite a FFr1bn earnings setback from Suez's exposure to
non-ferrous metals through its mining investments. However, the group put on
a strong performance in its other activities, embracing banking, insurance
and a range of industrial investments.
These other businesses 'will have been able, in the context of a
deteriorating economy, to compensate for the lion's share of this reduction
by increasing their contribution to profits by 25 to 30 per cent,' he said.
Mr Worms singled out Banque Indosuez, the investment banking arm, as one of
the best performers.
Suez's discussions were at a decisive stage with Union des Assurances de
Paris, the state-owned insurance group, which owns 34 per cent of Groupe
Victoire, Suez's main insurance subsidiary, he said. UAP has been pressing
for co-operation with Victoire, against resistance from the company's
managers.
Suez's FFr7.5bn asset sale programme, announced in November 1990, was nearly
complete, and the group's asset value was now well over FFr500 per share,
said Mr Worms. This compares with yesterday's closing price of FFr305.8,
which was up FFr1.90 on the day.

FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Dassault launches bid for Cessna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DASSAULT Aviation, the French maker of business and military jets, has
launched a bid for Cessna of the US, the world's leading supplier of
medium-sized business jets.
Dassault is not revealing the price of its offer for Cessna, which was put
up for sale last October by General Dynamics, the US defence group, as part
of its strategy of curbing debts and concentrating on core businesses.
Analysts then valued Cessna at Dollars 600m-Dollars 900m, as against the
Dollars 660m which General Dynamics paid for it in 1985.
If accepted, the deal will mark Dassault's most ambitious step yet in its
attempt to diversify away from the defence industry, where a squeeze on
spending has moderated the outlook for the Rafale, a fighter bomber due to
come into service from 1996.
Mr Serge Dassault, the chairman, estimates that sales fell last year by 17
per cent, to FFr14.3bn (USDollars 2.6bn) from FFr17.1bn in 1990, said
officials. This compares with estimates of roughly stable sales in the 1990
annual report.
In addition, orders fell by 25 per cent last year to FFr12bn. The group will
still be profitable in 1991, officials said.
Dassault had made 'a precise offer, at a normal price, without a date
limit,' said Mr Bruno Revellin-Falcoz, vice-president of the French group,
of the Cessna bid.
There could be a problem with the price, he hinted. Dassault's Falcon range
and Cessna's Citation series are broadly complementary, even if the new
Falcon 2000 medium-sized jet, due for sale in 1994, and the Citation X, due
out in 1993, aim at a similar market.
Dassault estimates it holds roughly a third of the world market for
medium-sized and large business jets through its Falcon range.
The aim is to lift business aviation to 35 per cent of sales over the next
few years, to compensate for a fall in the share of military sales from 71
per cent, to 55 per cent, said a Dassault official.
Cessna has an estimated 60 per cent of the world market for medium-sized
business jets and is about the same size, in turnover terms, as Dassault's
civil aviation division.

FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Packer to float 55% of ACP for
ADollars 475m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATED Press Holdings (Conspress), Mr Kerry Packer's privately-owned
master company, is expected to announce plans soon to raise ADollars 475m
(USDollars 353m) through the flotation of 55 per cent of its magazine arm,
Australian Consolidated Press (ACP).
A draft prospectus circulated to financial institutions yesterday said ACP
would remain the cornerstone of Mr Packer's family interests, but would be
independently managed.
The prospectus said Mr Packer would remain chairman of ACP, with Mr Al
Dunlap, chief executive of Conspress, as his deputy. ACP publishes several
leading titles, including Woman's Day, Cosmopolitan, New Idea, The Bulletin
and Australian Business Monthly.
The flotation values ACP at ADollars 865m, equivalent to 7.6 times forecast
earnings of ADollars 112.4m before interest and tax for the 12 months to the
end of June. Profits are forecast to increase to ADollars 132.2m in the
following year.
The issue price is 13.4 times forecast net earnings of about ADollars 65m
for 1991-1992, which puts the company in the top range of Australian media
stocks.
Analysts said the high valuation was justified by the quality of the group's
management, and its titles, which include nine of the top 20 magazines by
circulation. However, some said the price might be too high for the shares
to trade at a premium when the stock is listed on the Australian Stock
Exchange, probably in March.
The prospectus says ACP plans to distribute 80 per cent of the company's
forecast profits as dividends. Analysts said this was intended to increase
the flotation's attractiveness to investors worried about the high p/e
earnings multiple.
The issue is to be fully underwritten by Ord Minnett, the stockbroking firm
which recently underwrote fundraising by Tourang, the consortium led by Mr
Conrad Black.
The part flotation of ACP will raise eyebrows in Australia, since Mr Packer
has previously resisted shareholder involvement in his operations, with the
exception of the Channel Nine network.
Mr Packer bought out non-family shareholders in Conspress in 1983, and his
agreement to a flotation of a major part of the group has been interpreted
by some observers as an indication that Conspress is in need of cash flow to
meet interest payments.

appliance groups

<TEXT>
CANDY, the privately-owned Italian white goods group, has reached
preliminary agreement to buy MAYC and MEM, two linked Spanish domestic
appliance makers, best known for their Otsein brand.
The deal, for which no price was given, marks another step in the
rationalisation of the European white goods industry in the face of
oversupply and cut-throat price competition. The purchase is subject to
regulatory approval.
'Last year was especially tough on prices. Up to 1990, competitive pressures
were masked slightly by rising demand in eastern Europe. However, that
demand has collapsed as a result of credit problems, said Mr Silvano
Fumagalli, managing director of Candy.
Otsein, based in Vergara in the Basque country, has more than 8 per cent of
the Spanish washing machine market and around 50 per cent of that for
top-loaders.
Combined turnover of MAYC and MEM, which employ about 700, exceeded L130bn
(Dollars 108.9m) last year. The companies, which also make other household
equipment, produced over 300,000 units in 1991.
Candy, controlled by the Fumagalli family, employs 5,000 and is Italy's
third-biggest appliance maker. Sales topped L1,200bn in 1991. Pre-tax
profits were L50bn in 1990.

EUROCOPY, the photocopier distribution and servicing group, is again
postponing the publication of its results for the year to September 30 1991.
Its shares slipped 2p to 80p on the announcement.
The group said that it had not yet received the decision by the Office of
Fair Trading on the investigation into its Consumer Credit Act licences. The
OFT's legal notice came in August after press reports and parliamentary
questions in autumn 1990 about practices at two of Eurocopy's subsidiaries.
The group had intended to announce its results on December 17, believing, it
said, that the OFT decision would have been known by then.
It now believes that the decision is imminent and has said that it will
release its results within seven days of the publication of the OFT
findings.
In August, Eurocopy said that the negative publicity had affected its
trading and forecast profits for the year to end-September of Pounds 7.4m.
Previously it had expected to make Pounds 12m.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Paribas to provide Pounds 83m for private
Maxwell loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Paribas fell more than 7 per cent yesterday as the French
investment bank said it would have to make about FFr800m-worth of provisions
(Pounds 82.6m) in its 1991 accounts to cover the risk of losses on its loans
to Maxwell private companies.
It is the first bank to make a public estimate of the scale of its losses on
Maxwell loans. Indeed its losses are likely to be among the biggest recorded
by any bank.
The bulk of Paribas' exposure is understood to be held in its Swiss
subsidiary, Paribas Suisse, which acted as the lead bank in a Pounds 100m
syndicated loan to PHA Finance, a Maxwell vehicle.
Paribas' share of the facility is unusually high and may be as great as 80
per cent.
This loan was secured against 118.5m shares in Maxwell Communication
Corporation, the company which is now in administration under UK insolvency
legislation. MCC shares are now regarded by the banks as worthless.
However Paribas refused to comment on stock market rumours that its net
profits fell last year by 41 per cent from FFr2.54bn to FFr1.5bn. The
rumours contributed to yesterday's 7.3 per cent share price fall to FFr330,
the steepest drop on the Paris bourse.
Officials were surprised by the fall, given that Mr Andre Levy Lang,
chairman, had already warned earlier this month that the group would be
making heavy provisions on several large corporate loans.
French banks, such as Credit Agricole, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit
Lyonnais, may face bigger losses on loans to the Maxwell public and private
companies than even the UK clearing banks. Credit Lyonnais, which is
chairing the steering committee representing bank lenders to MCC, is
believed to be particularly exposed, with loans estimated at about Pounds
150m.
When the UK clearers announce their 1991 results next month, they are
expected to disclose provisions totalling more than Pounds 200m to cover the
risk of losses on their Maxwell loans. The biggest Maxwell-related losses
are expected to be taken by Lloyds.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Micrelec shares rise 8p on possible bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MICRELEC GROUP, which serves the petrol forecourt trade and has just
announced a first half loss, has been approached by third parties which may
lead to an offer being made for it.
Yesterday its shares on the USM moved up 8p to 121p, putting a value on the
group of a little more than Pounds 16m.
Mr Peter Beck, the chairman, said the second half was also likely to show a
trading loss but he was confident of a return to profitability in 1992-93.
The group had a good future on its own, he added, but 'opportunities that
exist in the market place could be such that they would be more rapidly
addressed as part of a larger group'.
The directors were examining all options open to them, he said.
The group's main business is the manufacture of electronic pump control,
point-of-sale, funds transfer and management information systems for use at
petrol stations.
In the half year ended September 30 1991 the group suffered as a result of
the much reduced expenditure by oil companies. On a 27 per cent drop in
turnover to Pounds 8.34m (Pounds 10.6m) there was a downturn from a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 1.11m to a loss of Pounds 442,000.
Losses per share came to 2.5p (earnings 5.51p) and the interim dividend is
again 1.35p.
Mr Beck said the sale of Normond CMS, the tank gauging division, for Pounds
7m was a most significant development.

Sir Alastair France, the chairman, told yesterday's annual meeting that 'our

The return to growth in the sales of Retrovir, the Aids drug, helped

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: And here's to you, Thomas Robinson - Jane
Fuller on the thinking behind BM's next acquisition step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the construction equipment distributor and maker which has so far
defied the recession, looks set to broaden its engineering activities with
the takeover of Thomas Robinson.
Shares in both companies were suspended yesterday: BM's at 400p and
Robinson's at 12 1/2 p, giving the potential target a market value of about
Pounds 20m.
The deal being contemplated is thought to be worth about twice that amount,
with BM favouring the use of its paper to limit the damage to its gearing.
Robinson, which, since August, has been guided by Mr Roy Barber, the company
doctor, saw its debt rise to nearly Pounds 64m last spring and it still owes
nearly Pounds 40m - gearing of about 100 per cent. BM may also go for a
fund-raising exercise to reduce the level of borrowings taken on.
Headed by Mr Roger Shute, BM acquired Blackwood Hodge, the ailing
international distributor of earth-moving equipment in November 1990.
Although the combined group's debt had been brought down from Pounds 110m to
Pounds 81m by June 30, the Robinson deal - if completed - comes a little
sooner than expected.
It remains to be seen whether it would threaten BM's aim of reducing
year-end gearing from 68 per cent to less than 40 per cent.
Timing aside, such an acquisition would carry out Mr Shute's aim to expand
the engineering/manufacturing wing of the business and reduce the dependence
on construction equipment which accounted for more than 70 per cent of last
year's sales.
BM's distribution activities were given a big push forward by the purchase
of Blackwood Hodge, which cost about Pounds 55m - mostly in shares which
were then valued at 245p each.
That deal also accelerated BM's effort to increase overseas sales. In
1988-89, only 15 per cent lay outside the UK; after Blackwood the proportion
grew to 65 per cent.
BM has grown rapidly to make pre-tax profits in 1990-91 of Pounds 34.1m  -
15 times 1985-86 - on sales of nearly Pounds 400m. This year it is forecast
to make about Pounds 43m pre-tax and earnings per share of over 33p.
Like Blackwood in the run-up to its purchase, Robinson is losing money. In
the first half of 1991, the pre-tax deficit was Pounds 22.3m, just over half
arising from the cost of redundancies, reorganisation and stock write-downs.
No worthwhile profits were expected until 1993.
Robinson was highly acquisitive in the late 1980s under the chairmanship of
Mr Graham Rudd, brother of Nigel who heads Williams Holdings, the industrial
conglomerate which has been far more successful with its purchases.
At its peak in 1989, when the prevailing share price was 10 times
yesterday's level, Robinson made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25m on sales of
Pounds 308m.
Since the departure of Mr Rudd, Mr Barber's team has sold the electrical
contracting and motor divisions, plus flour milling and one or two other
subsidiaries, to reduce debt.
What remains turns over about Pounds 150m a year and the dominant parts are
woodworking and the Unifix and Nettlefold fastenings businesses. Baking
machinery and some specialist engineering companies are also there.
Some kinship can be seen between these activities and, for instance, BM's
interests in joinery, components distribution and dairy equipment.
As with Blackwood, a big rationalisation exercise has had to be carried out,
although this time nearly all of it has been done and provided for in the
accounts.
Mr Barber came to Robinson from fire fighting at Astra Holdings, the
munitions and fireworks company which not only needed sorting out at an
operating level, but had also attracted investigation by the DTI.
BM said yesterday that it expected to make an announcement on Wednesday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kevin Maxwell will have to wait at least a week to find out if the Appeal
Court will allow him the right to silence over millions of pounds missing
from pension funds controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell, his late father.
Lord Justice Dillon reserved judgment yesterday after hearing five days of
legal argument. He told the court that, because of the urgency of the issue,
the judgment would be given as soon as he and his co-judges had 'clarified
the issues in our minds'.
But the battle may not end in the Appeal Court. Lawyers think that, because
of the fundamental legal implications, the case could continue to the UK's
highest court, the House of Lords.

THREE institutional share-holders in Cityvision, the video rental chain,
have called for an extraordinary general meeting to oust the current
management and replace it with a team led by two of the company's former
executives.
The shareholders, Fidelity Investments, US-based Alliance Capital and Postel
 -the UK's largest pension fund - hold approximately 16.8 per cent of
Cityvision's shares. Companies are required to hold an EGM if those holding
a minimum of 10 per cent of shares ask for one.
Cityvision is facing a Pounds 75m agreed bid from US-based Blockbuster
Entertainment Corporation which some shareholders say does not fairly
reflect the value of the company's franchise. Some were also angered by
directors' move to improve their severance terms around the time they were
discussing the friendly bid.
Yesterday, Cityvision's directors urged shareholders to ignore a circular by
the two former executives, Mr Phillip Crane and Mr Ray Hipkin who have the
backing of the three institutional investors.
Cityvision said that the two 'are offering shareholders nothing' and that by
the time an EGM could be called, the Blockbuster offer was likely to have
become effective. The company also said that it had issued legal proceedings
against Mr Hipkin after he resigned in 1988.
Yesterday, Cityvision shares closed at 51p, some 3p below the weighted value
of the cash and shares offer.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: IBM UK's chief executive quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ANTHONY CLEAVER has resigned unexpectedly as chief executive of
International Business Machines' UK subsidiary. He retains the role of
chairman.
His successor as chief executive and UK representative on IBM's European
management board is Mr Nick Temple, general manager of IBM UK since January
1991.
Sir Anthony, who is 53, has worked for IBM since 1962. He succeeded Sir
Edwin Nixon as chief executive in 1986 and became chairman in 1990.
Mr Temple, 44, has been with IBM since 1965 and has held a variety of senior
posts including European vice president with responsibility for systems and
products, and general manager, European central unit, where he was involved
in developing IBM's trade with the eastern bloc.
For the past year Mr Temple has been developing and implementing a radical
reorganisation within IBM UK designed to improve profitability and
competitiveness which has led to the loss of some 2,500 jobs.
His appointment is seen as reflecting IBM's need to take drastic measures to
restructure the company in the face of depressed sales and declining
profitability. IBM UK's figures will not be published for some weeks but,
reflecting the high cost of restructuring, are expected to be unattractive.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Addison buys UK side of AGB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADDISON, the market research group, has reached preliminary agreement with
the administrators to buy most of the UK interests of AGB Research, part of
the collapsed Maxwell private empire.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, the administrator from Arthur Andersen has also reached
conditional agreement with a management consortium to buy the European
subsidiaries of AGB.
The UK deal would take Addison, which trades under the name Taylor Nelson,
from sixth position in the UK market research industry to top position with
a combined annual turnover of about Pounds 60m.
Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive of Addison, which specialises in market
research in food and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, said yesterday: 'It's
a good company with good products and good people.'
Addison is expected to have a rights issue and to try to attract new
institutional shareholders. At yesterday's suspension price of 14 1/2 p it
had a market capitalisation of Pounds 9.3m.
Addison is buying the trade and operating assets of the businesses involved
and is not taking on any liabilities over the pension fund. The AGB part of
the Maxwell pension funds should have been worth about Pounds 60m. It is not
clear how much of that is left.
The purchase, which is expected to be completed within four weeks, will
include the AGB continuous research panels in areas such as food and
packaged goods and the panels that provide the UK television industry with
its ratings information. Addison is also buying the ad hoc market research
businesses.
No price was disclosed deal but industry speculation last night put the
figure at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m.
MAI, the financial services,marketing and television group, holds 25 per
cent of Addison. In 1988 it was about to raise its stake in AGB to 30 per
cent until Mr Robert Maxwell swooped and took the company over with an offer
which valued the business at Pounds 134m. Since then many parts of the
business have been sold.
MAI was invited to bid for AGB but did not. The big surprise was that AC
Nielsen was apparently outbid for AGB. Opposition to a Nielsen takeover from
users of the AGB continuous research panels on the grounds of monopoly and
the near certainty of interest from the Office of Fair Trading may have been
a factor.
The Gutenberghus Group has bought the Maxwell stake in Fleetway Editions,the
comic company with titles such as Dan Dare, Roy of the Rovers and Postman
Pat. Last October Maxwell's Fleetway and London Editions Magazine, owned by
Gutenberghus, set up a 50:50 joint venture. The takeover of the Fleetway 50
per cent is designed to end uncertainty 'following the recent developments
in the Maxwell Group'.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins fails for second time to sell
stake in Soporcel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the paper group, has failed for the second time in as
many years to sell its 42.8 per cent stake in Soporcel, the Portugese pulp
and paper maker, writes Daniel Green.
Yesterday it broke off negotiations with a consortium led by South
Africa-based Mondi Paper, part of the Anglo American group. The consortium
included Neusiedler, an Austrian paper company.
Mr Stephen Walls, Arjo Wiggins' chief executive, said: 'We have always made
it clear that we were only a seller on the right terms.
The company's shares fell 17p to 258p.
Arjo Wiggins would not say what the Mondi consortium had offered except that
it was 'less than Pounds 126m'. That was the figure Arjo Wiggins accepted
from Stora of Sweden, Europe's largest paper and pulp company, in 1990
before the deal was blocked by the Portugese government.
The company said yesterday it still wanted to sell the stake, for which it
paid Pounds 42m in 1985.

FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Nationwide again insured against losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide Anglia, the second largest building society, went for nearly
eight months last year without an outside insurer for its mortgage losses
after it ended a three year agreement with Sun Alliance in April.
Mr Daniel Hodson, deputy chief executive, confirmed yesterday that the
society has now signed a retrospective agreement with an insurance group who
will in effect be insurers and reinsurers for its mortgage losses this year
and next year.
The agreement, an 'excess of loss' reinsurance agreement, was placed on the
market in early December.
Mr Hodson declined to say which group had won the contract.
The arrangement with Sun Alliance was not renewed after it increased its
premiums. Mr Hodson said yesterday that the new agreement was not
necessarily very much more expensive, even though it came after a year of
sharply increased arrears problems.
He said the costs of the deal covering the past year were commensurate with
those for the coming year, but admitted that the premium would be somewhat
higher.
During the period when it was not covered by an outside policy, Nationwide
collected premiums from its customers to be paid when the new insurer was in
place.
Loan loss provisions last year were Pounds 94.8m.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's risks flight of Names - and insurance giants
will fill the void (3)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWARD DE BONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lloyd's is one of those marvellous British institutions which works
very well if everyone behaves like a gentleman and the bounders are kept
out. There is a strong feeling that Lloyd's is interested in preserving its
name at the expense of the Names. The report does realise that without the
Names there is no Name but does little to put matters right.
The Council of Lloyds might be accused of a serious lack of care in allowing
an agency to go out of business without the need to renew errors and
omissions cover for mistakes that would not be visible for two years after
it went out of business. This is exactly the case with Lime Street agencies
whose members suffered some of the worst losses (being on both Feltrim and
Gooda Walker syndicates). This agency has now ceased to function and carries
no errors and omission policy beyond the date of its ceasing operations.
Liability policies were only on a claims made basis and cannot cover claims
made later. Apparently this is fully permitted by the Council of Lloyds and
would seem to indicate a certain lack of concern for Names. At the very
minimum agents should not be allowed to incorporate but should remain
personally liable for errors and omissions committed by them.
The Name of Lloyd's should not be used to attract Names who then come to
feel themselves exploited.

will fill the void (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL D FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Claud Gurney concludes (Letters, January 16) by stating that he has
sent off his resignation to Lloyd's for the reasons which he so clearly sets
out. I fear that his action will be followed by many more Members unless
Lloyd's understands that its future is inextricably linked to a fair
resolution of the problems of the past, as highlighted by its dreadful
results for 1988 and 1989.
The task force rightly points out, and Lloyd's has at long last accepted,
the urgent need to 'cap' its Members' losses. However, the brief of the task
force was only to look to the future. Thus Names who have already suffered
losses exceeding 150 per cent of their premium income limit, and who see no
end in sight because so many underwriting years of so many syndicates remain
'open', will derive no benefit as a result of the proposals which very
belatedly are now attempting to address the problems.
Lloyd's own estimate is that it suffered 4,000 resignations in 1991 and at
least 2,000 Members cannot continue to underwrite because they have failed
the solvency test. The 1989 results, to be published in June, are expected
to reveal a loss of Pounds 1.3bn which can only exacerbate the flight from
Lloyd's,
It must surely be plain to Lloyd's that if it is to retain and indeed
increase its capacity to take advantage of the hardening of the market, it
must restore the confidence of its Members who are its only source of
capital.
If Lloyd's fails to do this the giants of the European and US insurance
market will simply step in to fill the void.

<TEXT>
Sir, It is going to need more than just the useful and constructive report
(January 16) on Lloyd's by David Rowland's task force to reverse the trend
in Lloyd's, if my own experience is anything to go by.
In May this year I wrote and spoke to my Lloyd's members' agency requesting
a face-to-face meeting by August 31 (the last date by which a Name can
formally resign for the 1992 year). Despite repeated requests, August 31
went by with no meeting.
After repeated requests for an explanation, the agency informed me that it
had been 'too busy'. I apparently have no redress, and this was one of
Lloyd's biggest Names agencies. I have been a long-standing Name and
underwrote approximately three times more premium than its average Name.
Until this complacency and arrogance is removed from Lloyd's, surely it will
have difficulty prospering.
My members' agent had my unlimited liability in his hands, and he could not
even spare five minutes to meet me, and, what is more, he seemed surprised
that I wanted to discuss and understand what was going on]
I resigned.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: Devilish task to negotiate pensions maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From H RUSSELL IRVING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender must have missed the sweetener in his morning coffee
before he wrote 'Sinking funds' (January 14). His indictment of the 'gaggle
of actuaries, lawyers, bankers and consultants' as a 'dismal, self-serving
lobby' is overdone. While I am not a member of this dismal gaggle, I have
dealt with it on both sides of the Atlantic for more than 20 years. I think
Mr Plender's Scud was fired in the wrong direction so here is a Patriot in
response.
Pension legislation is obviously needed and the professional organisations
in the UK, including the National Association of Pension Funds, are
providing sound advice to the lawmakers.
Achieving the right degree of regulation over this complex and sensitive
maze of conflicting interests will be a devilish task. The US Congress
passed its landmark pension legislation in 1974 and America's pension funds
(and its own gaggle of experts) have spent the past 17 years working out the
snags.
At the end of the day, the basic issue is simple: How effectively to insure
fiduciary responsibility. Those who deal with the assets of a pension scheme
are held to a standard requiring above all else loyalty to the
beneficiaries. In this context 'loyalty' means the trustees must deal solely
in the interest of the plan members and never benefit themselves from the
use of plan assets.
Fraud can no more be eliminated in the pension system than it can in the
rest of the financial world. It can only be made more difficult to bring
off.
The UK pension community is well-served by its professional advisers and
exerts as they tackle the problem of protecting plan members while avoiding
smothering pension trustees under a bureaucratic blanket of regulations.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: New funding regime hits disadvantaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JUDY WELEMINSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We are deeply disturbed at the expected collapse of Apex Trust ('Apex
to apply for an administrator', January 17) and the previous fall of
Fullemploy. These are charities doing very important work with disadvantaged
groups who will suffer from their demise. The collapse highlights the
continuing funding pressures on charities and voluntary organisations
providing support and training.
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations has warned the government
consistently over the past 18 months that training for special needs is
being undermined with the new funding regime used by Training and Enterprise
Councils. The two examples are not by any means unique. Indeed, the majority
of organisations for people with special needs are under similar pressures.
A recent report by NCVO - Making training accessible: meeting special
training needs - highlighted the need for greater financial incentives by
the government. To date insufficient action has been taken.
NCVO has called on the government to protect funds for training people with
special needs. This is the only feasible way to secure provision for the
most disadvantaged groups of the unemployed. We will also be seeking an
urgent meeting with the Home Office to discuss its role in securing the
stability in core funding.

<TEXT>
Sir, I agree with Michael Keevill (Personal View, January 16) that the
construction industry needs a kick-start. He suggests that the way to
achieve this is for government to permit local authorities to spend more of
their capital receipts from the sale of council houses.
However, according to the prime minister in a letter to the British
Constructional Steelwork Association on December 16, the fault lies with the
local authorities. He states: 'Local authorities have considerable scope to
increase investment in new construction without any change in the current
rules. Last year, they reported the availability of some Pounds 3.5bn of
capital receipts, but spent only 62 per cent of that amount.'
Local authorities take note - the prime minister is urging you to spend]

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on the Pounds 125m management buy-out at the Birmingham
Post &amp; Mail (January 3) referred to the Birmingham Post as 'the problem
paper of the group'.
While it is undoubtedly true that every newspaper seeks to attract new
readers the Birmingham Post is widely read by the most influential men and
women in the West Midlands and, as a result, it is generally recognised as
an important advertising vehicle.
As the Financial Times will testify, a relatively low sales figure does not
mean that a newspaper cannot be profitable. To say that the Birmingham Post
is 'the problem paper of the group' when compared with the mass circulation
Evening Mail is a little like calling the Financial Times a problem paper
because it is out-sold by the Sun.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Damned if it does - and if it doesn't: Quentin Peel examines
Germany's defence against the charge that it is beginning to throw its
political weight around
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The charge is clear: a united Germany, already the economic power house of
Europe, is starting to throw its political weight about too. The Anglo-Saxon
media, and the corridors of Congress and the Elysee, are full of dark
mutterings of German high-handedness.
This was the week when the member states of the European Community (EC)
finally bowed to the bullying of Bonn, the accusers say, and recognised the
independence of Croatia and Slovenia against their better judgment, just to
prevent Germany going it alone. And that came barely a month after the EC
summit in Maastricht set the signals for a common European foreign and
security policy, at Germany's insistence.
The economies of Europe are still smarting from the effects of the German
Bundesbank's best Christmas present - a half percentage point rise in its
interest rates, dragging most of western Europe in its wake. That was pretty
rich, coming only 10 days after Maastricht agreed on European monetary
union, says the prosecution.
And now they charge that Chancellor Helmut Kohl, not content with
unification, is campaigning for more members in the European Parliament, and
for German to be used as a working language of the EC, like English and
French. Close allies in his coalition government are even calling, God
forbid, for Germany to be granted its rightful seat as a permanent member of
the UN Security Council.
The charge is furiously denied, in Bonn: more in sorrow than in anger,
although with more than a hint of bitterness, too.
'First we were accused of being high-handed over unification; then we were
charged with being too feeble in the Gulf war; and now we are accused once
more of being a bully over Yugoslavia. It is difficult to know how to
react,' says one senior German diplomat.
The feeling is equally sore in the Chancellor's office: 'How can we argue
our case better, in Brussels for example, without being instantly accused of
national assertiveness?' one of Mr Kohl's advisers complains. 'We are rather
like the Americans during the Vietnam war: the ugly Americans. We are the
ugly Germans, and we cannot escape it.'
So what is the verdict: guilty or not guilty? Has German foreign policy
changed since unification in substance, or only in style? If it has changed,
is that any bad thing for the west, and the rest of the world?
There is no doubt that the world has changed since German unification, and
Germany too. 'The situation has changed fundamentally. That must have
consequences for our foreign policy,' says Mr Karl Lamers, foreign policy
spokesman in parliament for Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU). 'The recovery of our full sovereignty gives us greater room for
manoeuvre. We are no longer threatened (from the east) or dependent (on the
west).
'Germany has not only grown bigger, but the expectations of our partners
have grown too: both their hopes and their fears. The hopes are in the east,
and the fears are in the west, and these are contradictory expectations.'
The irony for a united Germany is that the country's greatest preoccupation
is internal - the need to make the traumatic process of unification work,
given that it is proving far more difficult and far more expensive than
expected.
Yet, just when the German desire, both in government and in business, is to
be entirely introverted, the growing chaos in the outside world is forcing
the country to become a much more serious actor on the international stage.
'Germany is in an awkward position,' according to one experienced European
ambassador. 'They are not assertive because they want to be assertive. It is
thrust upon them.'
Mr Hanns Schumacher, the official spokesman for Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
the foreign minister, is adamant that German policy has not changed one jot.
It has simply been reinforced.
'Mr Genscher says it is most important not to lose the trust we have earned,
not to turn our new size into more power, but into more responsibility in
the world,' he says. 'He made a solemn European offer, immediately after
unification. We offered to bind ourselves into a process leading to
(European) political union. We proposed the gradual transfer of national
competence and political responsibility to European bodies.'
Put another way, the offer was not to make Europe more German, but Germany
more European.
Since then, two things have happened. The negotiations on European political
and economic union have laid the foundations for greater integration, but
they still fall well short of what Chancellor Kohl would like to have seen.
And the process of disintegration in eastern Europe, in Yugoslavia and,
above all, in the Soviet Union, has accelerated. It is the latter, the fear
of chaos and collapse on its eastern frontiers threatening even the security
of the German integration process, that is now proving the driving force of
German foreign policy. And there is a conviction throughout the body politic
that the rest of the western world has simply failed to appreciate the
danger.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the finance ministry and Germany's chief
negotiator in the Group of Seven industrialised nations, is convinced that
his British, French, American and Japanese colleagues are dangerously
complacent. 'We are living on a powder keg, yet nobody is worrying about it
enough,' he said last month, on his return from negotiating the G7 debt
relief programme in Moscow. 'The British are making a terrible mistake if
they think they can sit on their island and escape when another nuclear
power station blows up.'
Mr Jochen Thies, editor of Europa Archiv and a critic of the Kohl-Genscher
foreign policy, says: 'All round our German home, the landscape has totally
changed. Stability ends on the German and Austrian borders. Indeed, the
earthquake begins already in east Germany, for the Russian troops are still
there. No other EC country is confronted with that.'
German fears are not only about nuclear safety (from civil as much as
military sources), but also about immigration. 'We have no straits of
Dover,' says Mr Thies. 'The river Neisse in some places is only 50cm deep.
You can walk through it. Chaos in the Soviet Union would have an immediate
impact.'
There is no doubt that the urgency of German fears over collapse and
disintegration in the east have fuelled its assertiveness in foreign policy.
Yugoslavia is the immediate example. But there, German apparent
heavy-handedness has been compounded by the peculiarities of the country's
foreign policy-making process and its dominant personality - Mr Genscher.
With 17 years as foreign minister behind him, Mr Genscher is the most
experienced foreign policy maker on the European stage. He is also a supreme
tactician, a master of apparently perpetual motion, an acutely sensitive
follower of the public mood and, above all, a supreme local politician. His
insistence on dragging visitors to his home town of Halle is legendary. So
is his almost total personal domination of the German Foreign Office
machine, and the diplomatic debate in the German media.
'He is badly advised. There are no early warning systems. When you are
foreign minister for 17 years you can play with the journalists at home, but
you cannot afford to do that on the international scene,' says Mr Thies.
'This explains astonishing mistakes in terms of style.'
According to one western diplomat: 'Germany is not overbearing, but Genscher
can be.'
Yugoslavia became a huge emotional issue in German public life in the middle
of last year. The media debate was almost entirely one-sided: sympathetic to
the self-determination of Croatia and Slovenia, and hostile to the
aggression of Serbia. Mr Genscher reflected that emotional response. He was
personally horrified at the Yugoslav National Army's use of force. The
turning point was apparently a telephone call from Mr Stipe Mesic, the
Yugoslav president, on July 3, reporting that the army had effectively
carried out a putsch. From then on he was determined to force through EC
recognition of the two republics to protect them, even if it meant
alienating his EC colleagues.
German policy on Yugoslavia reveals another profound difference with foreign
policy making in, say, France or Britain - although a similarity with that
in the US. It is far more motivated by domestic political considerations,
and by perceptions of principle and morality, than pragmatic national
interest.
'Yugoslavia was an emotional reaction, and there I would see a weakness in
the German political system,' the western ambassador says. 'It runs on
emotion, in the population and the media, and without guidance from the
government. The government always wants to be in harmony with public
opinion.'
Mr Lamers, an outspoken supporter of Croatian independence, agrees: 'Whether
you believe it or not, our engagement was very strongly morally motivated,'
he says. He admits that German opinion may have been blind to human rights
violations by Croatia, but the overwhelming sympathy was for
self-determination, against perceived aggression by Serbia.'
Yugoslavia was the immediate example of Germany's determination to pursue an
active foreign policy in central and eastern Europe, but Germany does not
want to go it alone. 'I don't want Britain and France to sit there and
criticise us,' Mr Lamers said. 'They must take the initiative too. This
wait-and-see attitude is not good enough.'
He believes that Germany's bitter experience of Nazi rule from 1933-45 has
taught the country that it is no longer possible to behave like a nation
state. France and Britain have not learned the lesson so well.
Another powerful driving force for co-operation in eastern Europe is the
economic state of the nation. The once purring German economic machine is
staggering under the burden of transfers of state spending to subsidise
jobes in the east. Indeed, it was concern over the state of the domestic
economy, the size of the public sector deficit, and the demands for
double-digit wage awards that prompted the Bundesbank to raise interest
rates in December. The government was as upset with the central bank as were
London, Paris and Rome. There was certainly no hint of co-ordinated
muscle-flexing.
'We have problems creating an order of priorities,' says Mr Thies. 'We try
to do everything, and have a tendency to do nothing: never to take hard
decisions. This generation in government seeks to buy its way out of
conflicts if it can. But this policy is coming to an end. The money is
running out.'
He believes that, far from fearing German assertiveness, the rest of the
world ought to be encouraging greater German international involvement and
responsibility. He regrets the fact that Mr Kohl has flatly rejected seeking
a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the foreseeable future. 'It
is very important to bind in the Germans at the world level, as well as at
the European level,' he says.
A senior diplomat from one of the smaller EC nations goes further. 'It is
both wrong and dangerous to accuse the Germans of arrogance,' he says. 'The
Germans have always offered to pool their sovereignty in a European context.
If France and Britain continue to refuse that offer for parochial reasons,
the Germans may eventually say: 'Let us go it alone.' Then the current
anti-German propaganda would prove self-fulfilling.'

FT  18 JAN 92 / Man in the News: Lloyd's reformer who may not see results -
David Rowland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Rowland, the dapper businessman at the helm of Europe's biggest
insurance broking firm, Sedgwick, could well be the best chairman that
Lloyd's of London never had. This week, as head of a task force on the
future of the Lloyd's insurance market, he produced a radical blueprint for
reform.
Unfortunately for those who favour sweeping change, his responsibilities
stop here; Lloyd's officials must carry the burden of putting the reforms
into practice. Despite the welcome the Lloyd's establishment gave the bulk
of his proposals on Wednesday, reform of the 300-year-old market could still
run into the sand, as so often before.
Mr Rowland, who is 58, was a natural choice to head the task force. He has
been at Lloyd's for all his working life, but as a broker he is not totally
dependent on the market. His company derives only around 10 per cent of its
revenues from business with Lloyd's syndicates. This 'semi-detached'
relationship has given him a wider experience than many of his colleagues
among Lloyd's top brass; it also makes for a certain objectivity about the
market's difficulties.
It is thus not surprising that Mr Rowland has proposed far reaching change.
In the short term, he wants to modify one of the central principles
governing Lloyd's activities: that of 'unlimited liability' for Names, the
wealthy individuals whose personal assets provide the market's capital base.
Many of the Names are facing heavy losses as a result of the scale of
damages awarded by US courts and natural disasters in Europe. The task force
has provided no relief for victims of past losses, but its recommendations
should remove the prospect of bankruptcy for Names in future.
The task force goes well beyond these short-term measures, however. It also
sets out a blueprint for much more drastic change, including the admission
of insurance company subsidiaries to the market. These changes would finally
sever Lloyd's from its fiercely individualistic roots.
None the less, Mr Rowland is steeped in Lloyd's traditions. He says he has
'loved' the institution ever since 1956 when, fresh out of medical school at
Cambridge, he joined a small family-owned insurance broker, Matthews
Wrightson. Perhaps surprisingly - in view of the scandals that rocked the
market in the late 1970s - he says the reason for his attachment was the
honesty and trust that traditionally underpinned trading at Lloyd's.
Such factors, he says, permitted the market to work with an informality that
also bred efficiency. 'Early on it dawned on you that peculiar though the
work methods might appear, it ultimately produced an extraordinary
efficiency,' he says. 'Nowhere in the world could you achieve results so
fast. Equally, nowhere in the world did you fear less that the bargain you
struck would be unnecessarily rescinded.'
The trust that allowed Lloyd's to combine informality with efficiency was
greatly weakened by what Mr Rowland calls 'the appalling unfolding of the
1970s.' He finds it hard to sort through the waves of scandal that hit the
market: 'It's all a bit jumbled and unclear, as indeed one's own emotions
are.' He knew things were going wrong, but never had the evidence to prove
it - and sometimes found the wrongdoing he suspected inconceivable or
impossible.
Joining the Matthews Wrightson board at the age of 31, Rowland steered the
firm into successive mergers, to form Stewart Wrightson, one of the most
successful insurance brokers of the 1980s. The climax of this process was a
merger which joined Stewart Wrightson with Willis Faber. But for Mr Rowland,
this proved one merger too many. He left shortly afterwards to head a much
bigger rival, Sedgwick.
Nevertheless, the skills displayed in the series of mergers - persuading
highly paid, sometimes contentious personalities to work together - were to
make him a natural choice to head the task force last year.
It was formed in an atmosphere of crisis, with Names deserting Lloyd's in
their thousands. Meeting entirely at weekends, the task force brought
together a range of underwriters, brokers, market bureaucrats and outside
advisers, all of whom had very different views about Lloyd's future.
Throughout, Mr Rowland aimed for consensus. 'He has done it with a great
deal of skill, humour and, above all, authority,' explains one member of the
task force. 'His great expression was 'Let's pause for a moment, let's
reflect a moment.''
The emphasis on consensus has produced a well-written, clearly thought out
report, that starts from the assumption that Lloyd's must continue to grow,
not shrink - as some outsiders have suggested - to a specialist core.
The weakness of Mr Rowland's consensus approach, however, is shown in the
crucial issue the report does not tackle: the crippling losses imposed on a
relatively small number of Names by the disastrous business conditions of
the late 1980s. Mr Rowland subscribes to the view summed up more brutally by
Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman: 'The losses that are there have fallen
where they fall. The policies that produced them are a fact of life. The
syndicates that picked them up are a fact of life.'
There is no attempt in the task force report to provide any retrospective
help to those Names afflicted by heavy losses. Though this was probably the
only feasible basis for consensus, it is certain to dismay those Names who
have been campaigning for a rescue scheme, and this continued bitterness
will continue to hamper attempts to set Lloyd's on to path for the future.
Much therefore hangs on the skill with which the reform plans are piloted
through the cumbersome Lloyd's machinery. Mr Rowland stresses that the
report is designed to produce action: 'It doesn't do any good if you don't
achieve change as a result.'
He is concerned by the decision of the Lloyd's Council to reject the
report's recommendations on corporate governance, which would have split
regulatory supervision from business management.
The aim of the proposed new structure was to create a powerful new business
leadership for the market, run by its core members, the underwriters who
assess risk. 'Lloyd's will never wholly solve its problems until it actually
realises it is an underwriting market and it should be run by underwriters',
says Mr Rowland.
The Lloyd's Council's immediate rejection of the governance proposal does
not augur well for the forceful implementation of the Rowland reforms. None
the less, Mr Rowland is optimistic. 'The task force has created
opportunity,' he says, and that will lead to inevitable change: 'I think
there is a good chance that market forces - pressure of people's opinions -
will not allow anything other.'

FT  18 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Shaking the money tree
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MARKETS are quiet, and commissions hard to earn, brokers have a bad old
habit of marking prices up or down in an effort to stimulate some buying or
selling - a manoeuvre known as shaking the tree. For this reason, prices
movements in thin markets are usually unreliable; after a few headlines, and
a flurry of activity, prices tend to drift back to their starting point.
Cynics might well, then, see no more than a bout of tree- shaking in the
apparent dramas of the last week, which saw a sharp Wall Street rally fizzle
out, the dollar rise more than 6 per cent against the D-Mark in a couple of
days and then fall nearly half way back again, and a sharp rise in London
equities yesterday morning turned into a small fall by the end of business.
Like the British political opinion polls, which see-sawed for a few days and
ended the week recording sharp Labour and Conservative leads on the same
day, the figures average out to nothing in particular.
However, there are some fascinating issues raised by both these apparent
non-events. The political contest in Britain is uninspiring in its early
stages, but poses a quite profound question: can voters face unpalatable
truths in hard times? They long to hear some good news which they can
believe; but the government has greeted too many false dawns to retain much
credibility. Most voters do know that their own real incomes are healthily
up - if only they could feel sure that this would continue.
Grim picture
Labour paints a grim picture of the current state of affairs, as oppositions
are bound to do, and especially of the rundown in public services; but it
also puts in a forbidding estimate for the cost of repairs. Its Treasury
spokespeople, Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett, have established an
enviable reputation for competence and honesty, but do not appear
user-friendly. This amounts to a contest, if such can be imagined, between
Micawber and Savonarola.
As Mr Walter Mondale found some years ago in his run for the White House,
the hair-shirt appeals strongly to some commentators; but it is very hard to
turn it into a popular fashion. Unless the economy turns far faster than any
forecaster now expects, the opinion polls and the London market will no
doubt remain prey to every gloomy statistic and ill-judged speech.
The dollar prospect looks a little less volatile (as ministers have no doubt
been advised, to their great relief). This is not because the US economy is
now recovering, promising high returns to investors; on the contrary, the
figures for output, trade and consumer sentiment, which appeared yesterday,
and the up-to-date industrial soundings of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve,
make it clear that nothing is yet stirring. What yesterday did confirm is
that it is growth prospects rather than trade flows which now rule the
exchanges: the dollar fell on unexpectedly good trade figures, because they
were read as evidence of weak demand.
Dollar strength
The real strength of the dollar is simply that it has fallen so far. Weak US
productivity and investment, and the disappearance of America's net earnings
from overseas investment, suggest that it will remain weak in real terms for
a long time; but thanks to near-zero inflation in the goods market, this is
quite compatible with a rising nominal exchange rate. It can at least be
said that thanks to low real interest rates and a reduced debt burden, there
is now little to prevent a US recovery, if little to trigger it. The long
bear run on the dollar may be over.
But is the dollar strong, or is it, as some Amsterdam comment suggests, just
that the D-Mark is weak? Strong wage pressures in Germany continue; and the
turbulent events in the former Soviet Union suggests that Germany, which has
provided an eagle's share both of official aid and private investment, may
lose a lot of its money. Already every report of trouble for Mr Boris
Yeltsin provokes selling of the mark, usually from Tokyo. Japan's own loss
of self-confidence was marked by a new low on the Nikkei. So the dollar's
appeal may rest simply on the better hole argument.
The new trend has relieved for the time being the threat of a forced rise in
British interest rates, which seemed so imminent only a week ago. (The
building societies have placed a sizeable bet that it will stay away.) There
are reported stirrings of recovery in some parts of the retail trade; and on
the dollar model, sterling might withstand a consumer-led recovery in the
UK, if it promises solid earnings. So the markets are positioning themselves
for a future general recovery. Mainstream stocks are up, and yesterday's
glamour stocks nearer to reality. The markets are as usual well ahead of
events, both here and on Wall Street, and remain suspiciously thin; but
surely have their eyes on the right horizon.
