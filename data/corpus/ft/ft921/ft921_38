APEX Trust, the organisation that provides training for young offenders, has
accepted that it is unlikely to find the Pounds 350,000 it needs to survive.
Apex says it needs Pounds 100,000 each from the Home Office and the
Department of Employment and could then raise another Pounds 150,000 from
private sources.

THE South African Government, under political pressure to raise social
spending despite deep recession, is to ask parliament next month to approve
a substantial additional budget for the current fiscal year.
Mr Barend du Plessis, the Finance Minister, said the government's deficit
before borrowing would be higher than expected. This deficit was originally
budgeted at 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product - the IMF recommends no
more than 3 per cent of GDP - but economists now believe it could total as
much as 5 per cent of GDP.
He said state expenditure was running ahead of budget, rising by 18.5 per
cent for the first nine months of fiscal 1991/92 compared with the year
earlier period. It would be necessary to ask parliament for a substantial
additional budget to meet extra spending needs, especially on health,
finance for black townships, and interest on public debt. He gave no figure
for the amount sought, but said it would be substantially larger than the
R1.2bn contingency reserve envisaged in the budget.
Meanwhile revenues remain depressed by the severe recession, with exchequer
receipts rising only 7.6 per cent in the first nine months, against 11 per
cent budgeted for the year.

<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, pledged yesterday to continue
Middle East peace talks despite the imminent collapse of his coalition
government. But he warned that progress in the negotiations might be
hampered during the expected prolonged election campaign.
Two extreme right-wing parties, Tehiya and Moledet, will tomorrow formally
resign from the coalition, led by Mr Shamir's Likud party, in protest
against the peace talks. Their departure will leave the government without a
parliamentary majority. Mr Shamir has indicated he will seek a general
election in May or June.
Mr Hans Van Der Broek, the Dutch foreign minister who is visiting Israel,
yesterday expressed to Mr Shamir what he called the world's concern that the
election should not be used to delay the peace process launched at the
Madrid Middle East Peace Conference last October. He said Mr Shamir had
assured him this would not be the case.
'The peace process will continue. For our part, we will try to proceed with
it as much as we can,' the prime minister said in a newspaper interview. But
he added: 'It is possible there will be certain restrictions because of the
special situation we are in.'
Mr Shamir, a sceptical participant from the start, will not mind if the
already tortuous negotiations slow because of the election.
But the Likud has made plain it intends to use its commitment to the peace
process as a central part of its election platform.
The stance is rich in irony, given the role Mr Shamir and his party have in
the past played in torpedoing peace initiatives, but it will pose a problem
for the opposition Labour party, which traditionally campaigns as the party
of peace.
There was no conirmation yesterday of reports that a hostage swap involving
Israel was imminent.

A SPECIAL court yesterday sentenced two former Greek cabinet ministers after
acquitting Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former socialist prime minister, of
involvement in the 1988 Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal.
Although neither man is likely to go to jail, their political careers may be
over.
Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, a former finance minister, received a 2 1/2 -year jail
sentence for breach of trust, but was given the option of paying a Dr912,000
(Pounds 2,800) fine instead. Mr George Petsos, a former industry minister,
received a 10-month suspended sentence.
The 13-member tribunal cleared Mr Papandreou of charges of taking a bribe,
receiving the proceeds of a crime, and breach of trust, but only by a 7-6
majority.
Mr Papandreou was censured by the court for retaining close ties with Mr
George Koskotas, the former owner of the Bank of Crete, after it was
revealed in 1986 that he was wanted in the US on fraud charges.
Mr Papandreou, afterwards launched a scathing attack on the conservative
government of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, saying it won power by
deceiving Greek voters, using the judicial system as a political weapon and
orchestrating a campaign of lies.

<TEXT>
US and Hong Kong business groups yesterday applauded a last-minute
settlement averting a trade war with China over its failure to protect
adequately copyrights, patents and trademarks.
In a memorandum of understanding, signed yesterday, China agreed to provide
protection for US inventions and copyrighted works, including computer
software, product patents, sound recordings and trade secrets.
In Hong Kong, the government and business establishment yesterday responded
with a positive, if cautious, welcome. The agreement has averted punitive
trade sanctions against China, under 'Special 301' section of the 1988 US
trade law, which would have harmed the colony's economy.
The broad US-China agreement was won by insistent pressure in six rounds of
negotiations and will be seen as a victory for US use of bilateral
negotiations under the 'Special 301' provision
This success will be noted in Congress, if the Uruguay Round trade talks
produce weaker sectoral protection measures such as those contained in the
text proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). To accept a Gatt agreement, the US
will probably have to give up what has been a powerful weapon in its 'fair
trade' arsenal.
China promised to extend protection to existing copyrighted works and sound
recordings as well as new works; protect computer programmes as literary
works with a term of protection of 50 years after it joins the Berne
Copyright Convention later this year; and confirm that copyright owners of
computer programmes and sound recordings will have control of the rental of
their works.
However, the resolution of this US-China dispute is seen in Hong Kong as
just the first of three obstacles which US and Chinese negotiators have to
overcome before fears in the colony are allayed.
Mrs Hills is preparing further actions against China, under the 301
umbrella, over trade policy issues; and, Congress gives every indication of
wanting to fight President George Bush on the renewal of China's Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) status. Mr Bush has to renew China's MFN status by
June 3.
The prospect of China losing its MFN status was 'in the realm of the
unthinkable', one senior Hong Kong trade official said yesterday.

FT  18 JAN 92 / No cheer for Spain or UK in Gibraltar poll: Bossano's
re-election is a mandate to seek constitutional change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE complexities of the Gibraltar dispute, which bedevils diplomatic
relations between London and Madrid, have been thrown into sharp relief by
the landslide re-election of Mr Joe Bossano as chief minister this week.
The results of Thursday's elections to the House of Assembly in the tiny
British crown colony on Spain's southern tip were announced yesterday. They
gave Mr Bossano's Gibraltar Socialist Labour party (GSLP) 73 per cent of the
votes cast by the 14,000 voters in a four-way contest, up from 58 per cent
in 1988.
Mr Bossano, 52, a former union official, now has a mandate to push for
constitutional changes viewed with trepidation by London and with outright
hostility by Madrid.
These include an end to Gibraltar's colonial status, which would reflect
Britain's shrinking military presence on the rock, and the transfer of
responsibility for the rock's foreign affairs from the UK to the European
Community.
Gibraltar joined the EC in 1973 as a dependent British territory but it
remains outside the Community's Common Customs Tariff.
Mr Bossano plans to bypass the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht - under which Spain
ceded Gibraltar to the British crown in perpetuity, with the stipulation
that should the UK relinquish the colony it would revert to the Spanish
crown. 'The treaty of Utrecht is completely out of date. It doesn't envisage
anything existing other than monarchies,' the chief minister said.
The British government has nevertheless made it plain that the independence
planned by Mr Bossano is not an option: either Gibraltar is British or it is
Spanish. The Madrid government is meanwhile adamant that, while all forms of
safeguards can be arranged to accommodate Gibraltar's way of life, the
territory has to revert to Spanish sovereignty.
Desultory annual talks between Britain and Spain on Gibraltar's future have
been fiercely criticised, and boycotted, by Mr Bossano. He has concentrated
instead on creating the basic infrastructure required to assure Gibraltar a
prosperous niche in the off-shore finance industry and has built impressive
modern office facilities on land reclaimed from the harbour where a dockyard
once stood.
Gibraltar's off-shore potential has certainly been recognised by four
Spanish banks operating on the rock. One of them, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,
recently used Gibraltar's high-profile lawyers and financial experts to
place a Dollars 300m (Pounds 167.5m) preferential share issue on the New
York stock market.
But Gibraltar's long-term viability as a finance centre depends on Spain's
acquiescence. At present, Spain does everything in its power - from ensuring
endless queues at the customs post on the frontier to branding Gibraltar as
a money-laundering centre - to hinder the off-shore activities.
Spain's latest obstructionist weapon is its determination to exclude
Gibraltar from the Community's External Frontiers Convention unless there is
progress in the sovereignty negotiations with the UK. Spain's veto prevented
agreement on the Convention, which will govern free movement of people
within the Community next year, at last month's Maastricht summit.
Spain is, in particular, pressing for the dual use of Gibraltar airport, on
the isthmus linking the Rock to Spain, a no-man's land under the Treaty of
Utrecht.
London and Madrid agreed to dual use more than four years ago but
implementation of the agreement has been blocked by Mr Bossano.
Gibraltar's offshore plans would be dealt a possibly mortal blow if the
intransigence of Mr Bossano and the Spanish government meant the rock was
excluded from the Convention.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Yugoslav army 'will stay in Croatia'

<TEXT>
A YUGOSLAV general has insisted the federal army will not withdraw from
Serb-controlled regions in Croatia, in contradiction to the United Nations
plan for the deployment of peacekeepers there.
General Andrija Biorcevic, commander of the Novi Sad corps of the federal
army, swore that Serbs from Croatia would 'lie on the roads' to stop the
army pulling out of Croatia. Leaders of the federal army and Serbia have
backed the peace plan, which calls for the withdrawal of the federal army
troops when the UN forces are deployed.
Teams of UN liaison officers yesterday left Belgrade and Zagreb and headed
for bases across Croatia, where they will establish communication links
between federal and Croat troops. The UN says it will not deploy the planned
force of 10,000 peacekeepers until there is a stable ceasefire. Croatia and
the army yesterday accused each other of violating the 15th ceasefire in the
Yugoslav conflict, brokered two weeks ago by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special
envoy.
In an interview published yesterday in Borba, a Belgrade daily, Gen
Biorcevic lashed out at the European Community for 'destroying Yugoslavia,
by recognising its fascist republics'. He said: 'The army is where it is
because of the treason at the top of the state and in the army.'
His remarks address the split in the top army ranks over withdrawal from
Croatia and the demilitarisation of Serb irregular units. Admiral Stane
Brovet, the deputy defence minister, yesterday repeated the army's plans to
disarm paramilitary groups in Croatia. The general blamed Serbia's
opposition leaders for the failure of the army to fill its ranks. The army
and Serbia have denounced the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia.
'The army has no choice but to go on fighting until the victory over
fascism,' Gen Biorcevic said. The Serb-dominated army accuses Croatia of
fascism, comparing it to the Ustashe (pro-Nazi) Independent State of Croatia
set up in 1941, when hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gypsies were
killed.
Gen Biorcevic pledged that 'the army can fight to the end for the defence of
the rest of Yugoslavia, for which it has the power as well as the support of
the people'.
Italian President Francesco Cossiga yesterday began the first visit to
Croatia by a foreign head of state since the former Yugoslav republic won
international recognition earlier this week, Reuter reports from Zagreb.
Italian officials said his visit was partly aimed at counterbalancing German
influence in newly-independent Slovenia and Croatia.
A British photographer died after being shot by a sniper near the eastern
Croatian town of Osijek yesterday, doctors said, Reuter reports.
Mr Paul Jenks, who worked for the Frankfurt-based European Press-photo
Agency (EPA), died during surgery at Osijek hospital shortly after he was
shot in the head in the village of Josipin Dvor.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Pace of global warming may be less than thought

   THE PACE of global warming
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the greenhouse effect - could be 20 per cent slower than originally
estimated, according to a report agreed by an international panel of
scientists this week.
The revised figures have come from the scientific working party of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The panel was set up by
the UN to draw up climate change figures for next June's Earth Summit on
environment and development in Rio de Janeiro.
The new assessment means that the IPCC's original prediction of a 1 degree
Celsius increase in global mean temperature by the year 2025 could be
delayed until the year 2030.
The revision has largely been made in the light of new studies of the amount
of sulphur in the atmosphere which cools the Earth's surface and offsets the
greenhouse effect.
But the working party emphasises that there is still great uncertainty on
the subject and sulphur may have only a transient effect.
If the amount of sulphur in the atmosphere is reduced by cleaner industrial
methods, the pace of warming could speed up. In that event a 1 degree rise
could still take place by 2025.
The depletion of ozone in the stratosphere has also offset global warming.
Concentrations of other greenhouse gases such as methane from rice paddies
and halogens used in fire extinguishers have slowed down.
However the concentrations of other greenhouse gases have continued to grow
or remain steady. 'The anomalously high global mean temperatures of the late
1980s have continued into 1990 and 1991, which are the warmest years on
record,' the report warns.
The results do not change the main thrust of the original IPCC 1990 science
report, which was described by Mrs Thatcher as 'an authoritative early
warning which we ignore at our peril'.
Global warming, largely as a result of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels  -
including coal - is still taking place at a rate which threatens the planet
with rising sea levels and drastic changes in the weather pattern.
Over 300 scientists world-wide contributed to the latest study, which was
completed at a meeting at Guangzhou, China, this week.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Russians bow under transferred prices burden: Neil Buckley
sees living standards collapse as subsidies end and market forces fail to
breach the gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Russian president Boris Yeltsin was confronted in the city of Bryansk
this week by protesters complaining about the high cost of sausage, he gave
the instinctive reaction of a former communist. He accused the manager of
the sausage factory of sabotage and ordered his dismissal.
The incident highlights both the depth of unpopularity of the price
liberalisation undertaken by Russia and other former Soviet republics
earlier this month, and the difficulty of adjusting to a market economy for
a people that has known only a state-controlled economy for 70 years.
The price rises have become a national obsession in Russia. This week, they
have haunted Mr Yeltsin at every step.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Mr Yeltsin's deputy prime minister responsible for managing
the economy, argues that the move is 'unavoidable', to reduce Russia's
budget deficit by removing the huge, and ever-growing, burden of subsidies
that the government has paid on goods.
'This measure was not adopted because we thought it would lead to a
blossoming of the economy or because we thought the shops would be full,' he
said, 'but because, in the present situation, we had no other room for
manoeuvre.'
Getting that message across to the Russian people, as their living standards
plummet, is not proving easy.
Mr Valentin Pavlov, then Soviet prime minister, first imposed administrative
price rises of 300 to 500 per cent on many goods last April. A fall in
production, and panic buying in expectation of further rises, contributed to
an inflation rate for the year of 200 per cent.
The combined effect of this and the recent price liberalisation has been
that many goods have increased in price by between 10 and 50 times in less
than a year. The average wage, meanwhile, has scarcely doubled, although
wages were freed along with prices and are expected to rise.
For the first winter since the Second World War, large sections of Russian
society are threatened by real poverty.
Under the headline 'We are now living as we did 45 years ago, and perhaps
worse' the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week quoted statistics showing
that even before price liberalisation the standard of living in Russia had
dropped to 1946 levels.
What the paper calls the standard-of-living index, or the relationship of
the average wage to prices for a range of goods, has suffered a four-fold
drop in the last two years.
The cost of feeding a family of three children for one day is calculated to
have risen from Rbs2 in 1985, to Rbs18.6 in 1991.
Examples of the prices being paid by Russians for basic goods this week are
shown in the table. Their severity can easily be appreciated by comparing
them with the average manual workers' wage - around Rbs380 a month at the
beginning of January.
As the temperature plunged below minus 15 in south-west Moscow this week,
150 mainly elderly people queued in the snow for an hour or more to buy milk
at almost 10 times its old price. A little old woman hobbled out of the shop
with a jar of smetana (sour cream) for which she had paid Rbs14. Three years
ago the same jar cost 27 kopecks - there are 100 kopecks to the rouble.
'It's not worth going shopping with less than 1,000 roubles in your pocket,'
one woman commented. Another drew grunts of approval from the crowd as she
recalled Stalin's time, when goods were cheap and queues were short. 'Yes,
we lived well under Stalin,' she sighed.
The price rises are not confined to basic food or clothes. The cost of a
return air ticket from Moscow to London has risen from around Rbs2,000 to
Rbs57,000. The economy fare to New York is now Rbs96,000 - or more than 20
years' average wages.
There have, however, been reports from cities such as Yaroslavl and
Novosibirsk of prices falling after shops returned goods to the producers
because they failed to sell - the first, fleeting signs of market forces.
But ordinary Russians are not the only ones complaining. Some economists -
even those who supported market reforms in the Gorbachev era - have been
highly critical. Mr Nikolai Petrakov, a former economic adviser to the
Soviet president, wrote in Moscow News that it was 'obvious that the reform
process just begun has not been duly prepared, either methodologically or
organisationally. . . Such experiments demonstrate only contempt for
people.'
Market forces, the critics say, cannot really start to operate when so much
of the old system is still in place. Most state shops must still purchase
their wares from appointed 'wholesale' centres, or bazy. They are permitted
to add a mark-up, limited to around 25 per cent, out of which they pay their
costs and workers' salaries.
The bazy purchase from the producers - such as factories and state farms -
who also rake off a limited percentage.
It is, therefore, the producers who bear most responsibility for the level
of prices, and until producer monopolies are broken, the scope for price
reductions is limited.
There may be some, however. In his speech to the Russian parliament on
Thursday, Mr Yeltsin attacked producers for taking excessive profits,
sometimes of 200 to 300 per cent. He promised to limit profit margins of
enterprises to 50 per cent, and to speed up privatisation.
Mr Gaidar accepts the criticisms of his reform. But he is probably justified
in his claim that the need to cut the state budget outweighs all others.
However, price liberalisation is only the first step on a very long road. If
it is to travel that road successfully, Russia will need all the help it can
get.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Pakistan and France sign power deal

<TEXT>
FRANCE and Pakistan have signed two financial protocols, to a total value of
FFr1bn (Pounds 103.2m) for French companies to build two conventional power
stations in Pakistan.
But a French offer to supply Pakistan with a 900MW nuclear power station has
been put on hold, because France now insists all civil nuclear exports must
be subject to inspection under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The protocols were agreed during the visit to Paris of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the
Pakistani prime minister. The two sides also agreed the sale of three French
minesweepers to Pakistan, to a value of FFr1.3bn.
The French offer to supply a nuclear power station was first made by
President Francois Mitterrand just under two years ago. France has continued
to assert its readiness to co-operate with Pakistan in the civil nuclear
field, but only in conformity with the controls required by France's
adherence to the NPT.
France is also reported to have agreed to pay Pakistan FFr600m to settle a
long-standing dispute about the decision in 1978, by President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, to cancel an agreement to supply Pakistan with a nuclear
reprocessing plant.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: They're playing his song - Michael Arditti talks to
the English musical's forgotten man, Vivian Ellis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARDITTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIVIAN Ellis's mother was so determined that her child should be a musician
that she played the violin every day during pregnancy. It must have worked,
since he later became one of the foremost theatrical composers of his day,
the equal of Ivor Novello and Noel Coward. And yet now, the last surviving
member of that generation, he is the English musical's forgotten man.
Novello is the mainstay of countless amateur operatic societies and Coward
of any company from Weston- super-Mare to the West End, but Ellis remains a
name for the record books and the library shelves. All of which should now
change as Dan Crawford, producer of the 1983 Mr Cinders revival, presents
Spread a Little Happiness, a compilation of 30 of his classic songs, at the
King's Head (reviewed in the FT yesterday by Alastair Macaulay).
Crawford believes such a setting to be the ideal showcase for his work.
'After Mr Cinders we spoke of doing other shows, but we always bumped into
the books.' These were of such colossal inadequacy that it is no surprise to
learn that, like other composers of the time, Ellis rarely read them but
simply provided a number for a specified slot.
But whatever the holes in the plots, the music that filled them lives on.
Sandy Wilson, whose The Boyfriend was a pastiche of just such 1920s
musicals, considers the tribute long overdue: 'I'm very glad they're doing
it. He's one of the eminent composers of my youth, whose tunes I grew up
with. When I was writing The Boyfriend I had Mr Cinders particularly in
mind.'
It was Mr Cinders, which played for 526 performances in 1929, that made his
name. But the road to the West End did not run smooth. - indeed, it first
looked to run to the Wigmore Hall rather than the Hippodrome, for his early
ambition was to be a concert pianist. But a classical career was thwarted by
both temperament and circumstance, although he is convinced that the
discipline has been crucial to his success: 'The difference between a
song-writer and a composer is that a song-writer is responsible for
individual songs, but a composer should have the ability to balance an
entire score. For that he needs a musical education like mine.'
Yet his first work, always excepting such childhood efforts as a lament for
the sinking of the Titanic, consisted entirely of incidental songs. He
placed one in a 1922 revue entitled The Curate's Egg. 'Arthur Wimperis, the
lyricist, encouraged me, saying money would roll in like a cascade. What
actually rolled in for the first year was Pounds 5. But from then on I was
hooked.'
He worked as a song-plugger for a music publishers by day, while hearing his
own sung in revue by night. His first chance to compose a complete score
came with Mr Cinders, even though he at once fell victim to the
transatlantic snobbery which has dogged him throughout his career. The
producer was anxious to attract a Broadway composer. 'American musicals had
swept the market. They didn't want anyone English and, except for Andrew
Lloyd Webber, they still don't'
But it is this very Englishness which lies at the heart of his music's
appeal. Sheridan Morley, the deviser of the present tribute, speaks of its
wistful, yearning guality. 'He is the master of songs of lost love . . . the
boy who could never get the girl. She was always too expensive, too foreign,
at the cinema or dancing with someone else. We've lost that, now that music
is so much more up-front.'
Mr Cinders brought him friends, fame and fortune, including the supreme
accolade: a contract from the legendary CB Cochran. The following season he
was responsible for the scores for six West End shows - a record Lloyd
Webber himself would find hard to beat. Such was his ubiquity that it was
wryly reported of a later Cochran revue: 'One novelty I discovered is that
Vivian Ellis will not compose the music.'
He continued to provide songs for individual performers. As Morley puts it:
'It is hard to find a great star of the Music Hall and theatre between the
1920s and the '30s for whom he didn't write.' For 15 years he was court
composer, often against his better judgment, to Jack Hulbert and Cicely
Courtneidge. 'He was a tyrant. Time and again I'd swear that I'd not do
another show; then Cis would take me to lunch at the Ivy and win me over
with her charm.'
Lavish lunches were fast becoming a fact of life, as he was taken up by high
society, under the aegis of the Baroness Catherine d'Erlanger. It was in her
Piccadilly mansion that he played his hit song The Wind in the Willows as a
piano duet with the Duke of Kent. 'He and the Prince of Wales used to ring
up the theatre to find out what time it was being performed so they could
pop in and hear it.'
With Frances Day, Maisie Gay, Jack Buchanan and Sophie Tucker singing the
songs, Rex Whistler and Cecil Beaton designing the sets, and Georges
Balanchine, Frederick Ashton and John Cranko choreographing the ballets, he
worked with some of the finest talents of his age. Among the many new
talents he discovered was his own: 'with one exception I found no one I
liked to write my lyrics; so I wrote them myself.'
The exception was AP Herbert, with whom he enjoyed a celebrated ten year
partnership at the end of the war. The war, and his six years' naval
service, had changed him: 'I became a very different composer, one of
operettas.' He had previously worked with Herbert on such classic revue
songs as Other Peoples' Babies so he was well-equipped to take on the score
of his political satire, Big Ben.
Although Gilbert and Sullivan, a partnership with which they have sometimes
been compared, had struck gold with the House of Lords, they themselves were
less lucky with their House of Commons satire. And yet it paved the way for
their later collaborations: Bless the Bride, Tough at the Top and The Water
Gypsies, which launched the young Dora Bryan. She remembers it 'with much
affection. It was the first time my name was ever in lights. It was too
old-fashioned for a lot of people, but it was lovely entertainment.'
The Water Gypsies was his last West End musical; although he has never
stopped working. 'When people want to know if I'm still writing, I tell them
that that's what the Queen asked; which always stumps them.' Now, at the age
of 87, he is an enthusiastic participant in the current show, unearthing new
material, such as Hengist and Horsa from a version of Lady Godiva, which
remained unproduced when the adaptor, Guy Bolton, failed to renew the
rights.
He is also actively involved in the Vivian Ellis award, an 80th birthday
present which, true to form, he shared with others. Modelled on the Gershwin
prize in America, it offers an annual showcase, at the Guildhall School, to
five or six young writers of musicals. And it is a measure of the respect in
which he is held that practitioners such as Cameron Mackintosh, Tim Rice and
Andrew Lloyd Webber regularly agree to judge.
Ellis's own advise to any budding composer is simply to listen: learn to
listen and listen to learn. Now a new generation has the rare opportunity to
listen to a master of the art.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US company plans Russian gold
search
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CYPRUS MINERALS, the second-largest US copper producer, hopes to be the
first American company to go mining for gold in the newly independent
Republic of Russia, writes Kenneth Gooding.
However, Cyprus says suggestions that its Cyprus Gold subsidiary is ready to
invest Dollars 50m on a joint venture in Russia's main gold producing
region, Magadan in the far east of the Republic, are very wide of the mark.
Mr Michael Rounds, a Cyprus official, said: 'We have been negotiating with
the Russians since October, 1990, but there is still a great deal of work to
be done before we get any agreement. It is certainly much too early to put a
dollar amount on any proposal'.
He was responding to a report by Russia's Interfax news agency quoting Mr
Ilya Rozenblum, president of Geometall, with which Cyprus has been
negotiating.
Mr Rozenblum was quoted as saying a joint venture with Cyprus would re-work
two gold deposits that had not been very profitable when Soviet methods were
used. He said, however, success of the venture would depend on the Russian
government allowing Cyprus to keep 25 to 30 per cent of the gold - but the
agency gave no indication of expected output.

AFTER DECLARING shortfalls on its European Community sugar export quota for
the past three years, Guyana expects to meet the 167,000 tonnes quota in
full this year, according to government officials.
The quota, to be delivered by the end of June, will be supplied from a
better-than-expected second harvest last year, which yielded 115,000 tonnes,
and from this year's first harvest.

FT  17 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities decline despite good
news on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
PROFIT-TAKING and switching between sectors was the order of the day on US
stock markets yesterday, as share prices fell in frantic trading in spite of
good news on inflation and employment, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.95 at 3,249.55, but
30 points above its session lows. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
dropped 2.56 to 418.21, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks fell 3.48 to 627.34. Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was
exceptionally heavy at 334m shares, the busiest day since October 16 1989.
The day's economic news should have spelled further gains for the market.
The Labor Department reported a rise of just 0.3 per cent in consumer prices
during December, further proof that inflation is not a threat to the
economy, and announced that 49,000 less people claimed state unemployment
insurance during the first week of the year.
The economic data, however, failed to lift prices, primarily because
investors were intent yesterday either on realising some of the profits they
have earned in the recent rally, or in shifting funds within the market,
leaving some big sectors, notably drugs, sharply weaker.
Among the drug companies to take a hit for the second day running were
Merck, down Dollars 5 at Dollars 151 1/8 , Upjohn, Dollars 1 3/8 lower at
Dollars 43 3/4 , Pfizer, down Dollars 3 at Dollars 76 3/8 , Schering-Plough,
Dollars 3 1/8 lower at Dollars 61 5/8 , and the ADRs of Glaxo, Dollars 1 7/8
weaker at Dollars 30 7/8 .
Some of the money removed from drug stocks shifted into cyclicals, lifting
Caterpillar Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 , USX Steel Dollars 2 5/8 to
Dollars 29 3/8 , Bethlehem Steel Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 17 1/4 , and
Aluminum Company of America Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 68 1/4 . Paper stocks
were also in favour, with Chesapeake Corp up Dollars 3 at Dollars 27 7/8 ,
aided by brokers' recommendations, and International Paper up Dollars  1/2
at Dollars 72 3/4 .
On the over-the-counter market, Intel jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 61 after
recording fourth-quarter income of 90 cents a share, up from the 80 cents a
share earned a year earlier and above analysts' forecasts.
AST Research was also higher on good earnings news, climbing Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 23 1/4 in heavy trading after reporting fiscal second-quarter
profits of 52 cents a share, slightly higher than market estimates.
Microsoft was down Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 127 3/4 , Sun Microsystems
Dollars  3/4 weaker at Dollars 33, and Amgen, down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars
68 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed higher in busy trading, led by a surge in gold stocks.
According to preliminary data, the composite index gained 9.24 points, or
0.25 per cent, to close at 3,665.96. Advancing issues outnumbered declines
366 to 283. Volume was 39.98m shares, down from yesterday's 41.108m, but
trading value climbed to CDollars 487.3m from CDollars 471.3m.
Yesterday's gain, though not nearly as strong as the previous two days,
extended the market's winning streak to seven straight sessions.
The gold group had the day's biggest gain, up 4.9 per cent as the New York
gold price gained USDollars 2.25 to Dollars US356.50. American Barrick
jumped 1 1/2 to 33 3/8 and Placer Dome was up  3/4 to 12 1/8.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar holds on to new gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar shook off profit-taking pressures yesterday to retain most of the
gains made in its spectacular rally on Tuesday and Wednesday, writes Simon
London.
In Far Eastern trading the dollar began to slip back from the high levels
seen in New York on Wednesday, as some dealers took profits on long dollar
positions held since last week.
However, there was support at around the DM1.6150 and Y127.50 levels as
operators with an optimistic view of the prospects for the US currency
stepped in. By the close in Tokyo, the US unit stood at DM1.6225, from
DM1.6235 in New York, and Y128.43, from Y128.55.
However, selling pressures again emerged in early European trading. The
dollar was pushed down to DM1.6065 and Y127.65 at one stage before
rebounding.
In addition to profit-taking pressures, traders said rumours that the Group
of Seven industrial countries will intervene to cap the rapid appreciation
of the dollar had blunted positive sentiment.
Yet no central bank intervention was forthcoming and central banking sources
made no overt comments on currency rates. By mid-morning in London, the US
unit had been pushed back up over DM1.6150 and Y128, levels maintained
through most of the afternoon session.
The dollar dipped briefly on the announcement of US inflation data for
December which was broadly in line with expectations but underlined that the
monetary authorities have room to lower interest rates again.
The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent in the month, against
expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise, bringing inflation to a year-on-year
rate of 3.1 per cent for the whole of 1991, from 6.1 per cent in 1990.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6185, from DM1.6220 on Wednesday, and
Y128.30 from Y128.40.
Analysts said that the US currency is now constrained within a DM1.6280 to
DM1.60 range, with little clear direction. The rally last week and this week
was driven largely by technical trading by intermediaries, with little
change in the underlying economic fundamentals. Until some more conclusive
economic data is released, the prospects for the dollar will remain clouded.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling remained the weakest
currency, pinned to the outer limit of its permitted divergence from the
Spanish peseta, the strongest currency.
Sterling traded within a narrow range between DM2.8450 and DM2.85 for most
of the day, pushing up above DM2.85 in late afternoon and closing at DM2.85
exactly, from DM2.8475 on Wednesday.
However, this remained only just above the UK currency's effective floor
within the ERM. The Spanish currency also appreciated slightly against the
D-Mark, closing as Pta63.43 from DM63.495 on Wednesday, lifting the floor
for sterling.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Liquidity squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK short money rates were squeezed sharply higher yesterday as taxation
payments continued to drain funds from the market, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.7bn shortage during the morning
session, later revised upwards to Pounds 1.8bn.
As with other recent liquidity shortages the main factors draining funds
from the market were maturing assistance totalling Pounds 832m and exchequer
transactions, mostly tax payments, of Pounds 790m.
However, while the Bank of England has provided early relief in recent days
to keep a lid on overnight money rates, yesterday there was no substantial
liquidity injection until the afternoon session. Facing a Pounds 2bn
liquidity squeeze again today, operators preferred to hold on to paper
rather than taking funds from the Bank.
Early assistance amounted to just Pounds 158m, comprising a small outright
purchase of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and a Pounds 128m purchase
of bills for resale to the market on February 3 at 10 7/16 per cent. Later
in the morning session the Bank bought a further tranche of band 1 bank and
treasury bills and added Pounds 31m for repurchase on February 3 on the same
terms.
Only in the afternoon did the Bank step in to relieve the squeeze in
institutional liquidity which saw overnight money rates rise to 30 per cent
for a short time.
Early afternoon assistance totalled Pounds 642m, again a mix of the outright
purchase of short maturity band 1 and band 2 bills and a further Pounds 96m
paper for repurchase.
Late assistance totalled Pounds 560m, bringing the total liquidity injection
for the day to nearly Pounds 1.5bn, still Pounds 300m shy of the forecast

By the close, unsecured overnight money rate had traded back down to 10 3/4

The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial

In Frankfurt, short rates eased for the second day running following the
Bundesbank's net liquidity injection of DM7.3bn on Wednesday.
Call money traded mostly at 9.45/50 per cent, from 9.45/55 per cent on
Wednesday and 9.55/60 per cent earlier in the week.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis give green light to NZ
sheep

NEW ZEALAND appears poised to increase its profitable live sheep trade with
Saudi Arabia following successful talks on health regulations with the Saudi
government. New Zealand has emerged as the main exporter of live sheep to
Saudi Arabia since exports from Australia began to decline in 1989 following
Saudi complaints about the health of some animals.
Mr John Falloon, the New Zealand agriculture minister, said the talks had
been complex and difficult, but had resulted in an understanding that would
allow the trade to continue.
New Zealand sent 1.6m live sheep to Saudi Arabia last year, including
500,000 intended for the Haj religious festival. Exports are likely to
increase this year in the absence of competition from Australia.
The trade has been an important success story for New Zealand farmers at a
time when many have suffered financial hardship as a result of falling wool
prices, mostly caused by over-production in Australia.
Live sheep have also helped to offset falling Middle East demand for exports
of New Zealand sheep carcasses, which fell to 43,000 tonnes in 1990-91,
compared with 150,000 tonnes in 1986-87. However, the live sheep trade
remains prone to interruption because of Saudi sensitivity to real or
perceived health problems, in spite of strenuous New Zealand efforts to
guarantee the condition of the animals.
The trade is directly controlled by the New Zealand government, which sends
two veterinarians with each shipment, and allows only one shipload to be on
the water at any time.
New Zealand sheep sold into the trade also tend to be young animals, which
are better able to cope with the stress of the journey than the older
wethers (castrated males) usually shipped to the Middle East from Australia.
Officials say this is because of the structure of the New Zealand sheep
industry, which is more geared to lamb production than the
fine-wool-oriented Australian industry.
Mr Falloon said relations with Australia's primary industries ministry
remained good, in spite of the effective transfer of the Saudi trade from
Australia to New Zealand.
Officials in Canberra said Australia expected exports to Saudi Arabia to
recommence following talks now taking place, but there is little hope of an
early resumption.
'We have endeavoured to use all reasonable channels to negotiate with the
Saudis, and we have found that extremely difficult. We go through stages
where there are glimmers of hope, and stages where there is not. Right now
the talks are still going on, but we are not optimistic,' said an official.
The live sheep trade was worth about ADollars 200m in export revenue to
Australia at its peak in 1988, of which about half was accounted for by
exports to Saudi Arabia. Problems began in 1989, when shipments were
rejected after the Saudis claimed some sheep were infected with the deadly
disease blue tongue or brucellosis, which causes abortions.
Australian officials claimed blue tongue did not exist in Australia in its
clinical form (although the virus which causes it has been detected in some
flocks), and pointed out that all the sheep alleged to be suffering from
brucellosis were males.
However, Saudi complaints continued, mostly in relation to less serious
diseases such as pink eye, a form of conjunctivitis, and scabby mouth, a
viral disease which in some circumstances can be contracted by humans.
Officials say Australia is keen to reach an accommodation with Saudi Arabia,
but has so far been unable to agree on a health regime that is acceptable to
both sides.
Live sheep sales to other Middle East countries have not been affected by
the dispute with the Saudis, and Australia remains a major exporter to
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Salomon resignations continue
as top analyst quits for First Boston
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WAVE of defections from the equities department of Salomon Brothers, the
Wall Street securities house, continued yesterday when Mr Thomas Hanley, the
top-ranked bank analyst, left the firm to join First Boston. Mr Hanley's
colleague, Mr Phillip Carter, has also left Salomon for First Boston.
However, three members of the equity research team reportedly turned down an
offer from First Boston. The three staying at Salomon are Mr John Leonard -
who will head the banking research group - Ms Diane Glossman and Mr Jeffrey
Naschek.
Mr Hanley's exit takes the number of departures by senior equities staff in
the past six weeks into double figures. Among those to have left Salomon for
other firms are Mr Ralph Fletcher, head of private placements; Mr Leslie
Ravitz, a chemicals analyst; Mr Gary Gastineau, a derivatives analyst; and
several members of Salomon's London team, including Mr Chris Mitchinson,
head of equity research and strategy. Mr Peter Clarke, head of equity sales
and trading in London, also resigned yesterday.
The trickle of defections from the equities business is threatening to turn
into a flood because of changes in Salomon's compensation system, which left
stock traders and analysts with lower bonuses at the end of last year.
Staff in the equities department are also worried that reforms in the firm's
business structure could mean equities will be neglected at the expense of
the two most profitable departments, bond sales and trading. Senior
management at the firm, however, insists that it remains committed to
maintaining a presence in US and European equities.
The circumstances surrounding Mr Hanley's departure were unclear. He was
reported to have been upset because he was unable to get a meeting with Mr
Warren Buffett, the chairman of Salomon, to discuss the firm's direction. He
was said to have finally decided to resign because of a 'pay dispute'.
The loss is a blow to Salomon's equity research team. Mr Hanley was a
20-year Salomon veteran who had topped the banking section of Institutional
Investors's poll of US brokerage analysts for the past eight years.
There was some good news for Salomon yesterday. The treasurer of California
announced that the state would resume all business dealings with the firm.
California suspended certain business activities with Salomon last year in
the wake of the Treasury bond market scandal.

encouraging data

THE SLIDE in US Treasury prices continued yesterday morning, despite good
news on inflation.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 15/16 at 104
1/16, yielding 7.646 per cent. The two-year note was also easier, down  1/32
at 99 29/32 , yielding 5.033 per cent.
The market firmed in early trading, thanks primarily to the Labor
Department's report that the consumer price index rose just 0.3 per cent in
December.
The number was in line with market expectations, although a 0.4 per cent
gain in energy prices was bigger than forecast. Overall, though, the news on
prices was good, and should have provided support for the bond markets.
Bond prices soon turned around, however, partly in response to a 49,000
decline in weekly state unemployment claims, but mostly because the market
does not have the stomach, at least for the moment, for further gains.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied strongly on the mortgage rate cuts and
unemployment figures announced yesterday. Much of the gain, however, was
wiped out as the US Treasury market's fall pulled gilt prices lower.
Trading was mainly futures-driven, with the Liffe gilt futures contract
climbing to a high of 97.26 from its opening of 97.03, before settling at
97.14 in the late afternoon. The volume in the Liffe futures contract was
double the normal level at 42,000 contracts.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 gained nearly half a point at
one stage, from its opening level of 115 9/16 , but fell back to 115 3/4 by
late afternoon.
The news that Abbey National and Halifax, the two largest UK
mortgage-lenders, were cutting their mortgage rates, and the release of
unemployment figures which showed a slowdown in the rate of increase, were
both seen by the market as positive for the government.
THE WEAKENING in US Treasury bond prices helped to pull down the European
government bond markets, wiping out earlier gains.
In Germany, the cash and futures markets closed lower. The Liffe bund
futures contract, which opened at 88.38, fell from a high of 88.44 to close
at 88.16 on a volume of 46,000 contracts. Traders reported strong demand for
five-year bunds earlier in the day, but said the US Treasury bond market's
fall prompted considerable volatility towards the close of trading.
In the French market, government bonds fell  1/3 of a point in
futures-dominated trade, wiping out the gains made on Wednesday. The March
bond future ended at 108.72, down 36 basis points, on a volume of 139,184
lots.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day unchanged in Tokyo in dull trading.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue closed at 5.395 per cent, having
traded in a range of 5.385-5.415 per cent.
The Bank of Japan drained funds from the money market yesterday on the first
day of the new reserve period for banks. The overnight call money rate
inched up to 5 17/32 per cent, while three-month certificates of deposit
remained at 5.28 per cent, traders said.

SEMBAWANG Shipyard, the diversified Singapore-based shipping group, has
raised more than SDollars 200m in new equity by means of the biggest bought
deal carried out for a Singapore company.
SG Warburg Securities, the UK investment bank, and Phillips Securities, a
Singapore securities house, bought 27m shares in Sembawang Shipyard at
SDollars 8.01 per share - or a total cost of SDollars 216.27m - and placed
them at SDollars 8.27, or a total of SDollars 223m. The shares were trading
on the stock market at SDollars 8.35 at the time.
Bought deals are becoming increasingly common for international equity
issues. In the case of Sembawang Shipyard, 6.75m shares were placed in
Singapore and 20.25m shares were sold internationally, mainly in Asia and
Europe. The deal was oversubscribed by between 1.5 and two times.

'Both put and call options will be introduced on six scripless equity

<TEXT>
BRISTOL-Myers Squibb, one of the world's biggest drugs companies, yesterday
turned in an 18 per cent rise in 1991 earnings.
Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31 advanced about 20 per
cent to Dollars 510m or 98 cents a share from Dollars 425.5m or 81 cents a
year earlier. Sales in the three months grew 7 per cent to Dollars 2.94bn
from Dollars 2.74bn. Pre-tax earnings advanced 16 per cent to Dollars 703.7m
from Dollars 607.1m in the 1990 quarter.
For the full year, Bristol-Myers Squibb had net earnings of Dollars 2.06bn
or Dollars 3.95 a share, compared with Dollars 1.75bn or Dollars 3.33 in
1990. Sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 11.16bn from Dollars 10.3bn. Pre-tax
earnings grew 14 per cent to Dollars 2.89bn from Dollars 2.52bn.
The results met most analysts' expectations, but the company's shares fell
Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 83 3/4 .
On Wall Street, investors have started shifting funds away from the
pharmaceutical sector in the past week as they search for better returns and
stock in the big pharmaceutical companies has come under selling pressure.
During 1991, Bristol-Myers sales were led by the US, where they rose 10 per
cent while international sales grew 6 per cent. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman
and chief executive, said almost all of the company's businesses posted
improved sales, excluding discontinued operations. Consumer products was the
only business sector to show a decline in sales.
The company last week said it would cut the prices of drugs it sold to
Federal programmes for veterans, the military and the Public Health Service.

new light on merger

<TEXT>
FOURTH-QUARTER figures from Bank of America and Security Pacific yesterday
underscored the degree to which the planned Dollars 4.2bn merger of the two
California banks - the biggest in US history - is in many respects a rescue
of the latter by Bank of America.
While the San Francisco-based Bank of America reported annual net profits of
more than Dollars 1bn for the third year running, the Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific said that it expected to report a Dollars 400m
fourth-quarter deficit that would result in a loss for the year of Dollars
765m.
Security Pacific, which began selling off many of its non-US holdings even
before the merger was announced last summer, achieved a Dollars 161.3m net
profit in 1990.
The bank said its fourth-quarter results would include Dollars 730m of bad
debt provisions - Dollars 180m more than the anticipated fourth-quarter loan
losses of Dollars 550m.
Secpac's fourth quarter would include a Dollars 65m writedown of the bank's
investment in Hoare Govett, the UK broker.
This reflected a decision to sell the business rather than pursue a partial
management buy-out of Hoare Govett, the bank said.
Mr Robert Smith, Secpac's chairman, said the results 'continue to reflect
adverse economic conditions in the principal markets we serve, as well as
further strengthening of the reserve for credit losses'.
Mr Smith said he had been advised by Bank of America that the fourth-quarter
losses and loan provisions at Secpac 'do not alter BankAmerica's assessment
of the overall benefits of the planned merger'. He said both companies were
proceeding with regulatory filings needed to consummate the merger, which
was expected to go ahead in the next couple of months.
Bank of America, which said earlier this week it would increase the amount
of deposits to be divested upon completion of the merger from Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 7bn, has separately indicated it would create a 'bad bank'
consisting of problem assets of up to Dollars 4bn.
Bank of America said its fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 285m,
slightly below its Dollars 287m in the same period of 1990. Net earnings for
the whole of 1991 were Dollars 1.12bn, compared to Dollars 1.11bn of 1990.
Non-interest income rose by 18 per cent to Dollars 653m in the fourth
quarter, while net loan losses were Dollars 279m in the quarter, more than
double the Dollars 132m in the same quarter of 1990.
Total bad debt provisions for 1991 were Dollars 805m, compared with Dollars
905m in 1990.
By the close on Wall Street, Bank of America's share price had fallen
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , while Security Pacific's was Dollars 1/4
lower at Dollars 34 5/8.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: GM to pull out of car production
in S Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle maker, is planning to
withdraw from car production in South Korea with the sale of its 50 per cent
stake in the troubled Daewoo Motor.
GM said yesterday that it was exploring the possibility of selling its stake
to the Daewoo Group, the holder of the remaining equity in Daewoo Motor.
The disposal is a severe setback to GM's plans for expansion in the Asia
Pacific region, as it seeks to counter the overwhelming Japanese presence.
South Korea is expected to be one of the world's fastest-growing car markets
in the 1990s, but GM has decided to pull out of car making in the country in
the face of its prolonged conflict with the Daewoo Group over the management
of Daewoo Motor.
GM said it would maintain its presence in Korea through a number of
automotive components joint ventures, which would continue to supply Daewoo
Motor. GM holds 50 per cent stakes in five components joint ventures in
South Korea, two of which are linked to the Daewoo Group.
The disposal of the 50 per cent stake in Daewoo Motor was subject to the
negotiation of an 'acceptable' price and other terms, said GM.
Earlier this week the company announced that it had agreed to enter its
first vehicle production venture in China, where it is planning to assemble
light commercial vehicles.
Mr Robert Stramy, GM's senior executive at Daewoo Motor, has been
transferred to the Chinese joint venture Jinbei GM Automotive Company, which
is expected to begin kit assembly of pick-ups later this year in north-east
China.
Daewoo Motor was originally established in 1972 as GM Korea. It was greatly
expanded in the second half of the 1980s with the production of vehicles
developed by GM in Europe. The US car maker had hoped that its South Korean
venture would develop as a low-cost production source for small cars.
Blocked by GM's refusal to contemplate expansion of Daewoo Motor, the Daewoo
Group has pressed ahead with other automotive ventures including the
production of mini cars by another group subsidiary under licence from
Suzuki of Japan.
Daewoo Motor produced 184,795 cars in 1990 and 176,504 in the first 11
months of 1991. Its domestic sales rose by 5.4 per cent to 126,349 in the
first 11 months of 1991 in a domestic car market that rose by 25 per cent to
683,081.

<TEXT>
WESFARMERS, the Western Australian farming and commodities group, is trying
to gain control of the Bunnings timber, hardware and metal products company
at 'an unacceptably low price', Mr Dolph Zink, Bunnings' chairman, said
yesterday.
Wesfarmers announced a ADollars 3.55 (USDollars 2.61) a share hostile bid
for Bunnings on January 1 following indications that BTR of the UK was
seeking to dispose of its 24.6 per cent stake.
BTR acquired the shares as a result of its recent Pounds 1.5bn (USDollars
2.68bn) takeover of Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group.
Wesfarmers says the ADollars 163m bid represents a fair price for Bunnings,
in which it has a 19.9 per cent holding.
However, Mr Zink said a committee of directors formed to consider the offer
believed the bid price was not related to the underlying value of Bunnings'
assets.

CAROLCO Pictures, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, said
yesterday it had secured Dollars 45m of financing and a deferral on Dollars
10m of debts from US and foreign lenders. The funds will allow it to
continue operating.
Carolco, best known for Terminator 2, the Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster,
is caught in a financial squeeze along with other independent film
companies. Orion Pictures, the bigger independent, recently filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
Carolco's problems have been mounting since last summer. In November it
ended talks aimed at acquiring a 46 per cent shareholding in Live
Entertainment, a home video supplier majority-controlled by Carolco. In
December, Carolco cut its staff of 200 by 25 per cent and said it was
considering scaling back a number of deals with film makers.
For much of last year the company was in technical default on Dollars 172m
of bank loans. In the third quarter it suffered a Dollars 43.7m loss. At the
year-end, Mr Peter Hoffman, chief executive, said he would leave the company
following what analysts described as internal management conflicts.
The Dollars 45m financial package was approved by Carolco's foreign minority
shareholders - Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of Italy and Canal Plus of France.
It consists of a Dollars 32m loan secured on Carolco's 53 per cent stake in
Live Entertainment, plus a new issue of Dollars 13m of preferred stock
convertible into common shares. The foreign shareholders have agreed to
defer receipt of Dollars 10m of payments owed to them.
Carolco's share price rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 2 1/2.

1992. Terms were not disclosed.
Mobil Chemical's polystyrene resin operations have a combined annual

of high-impact polystyrene capacity, which came on stream in June 1991, at
Joliet, Illinois.
Other manufacturing plants are located at Santa Ana, California, and

Analysts had expected losses of between 30 cents and 60 cents a share.
Revenues for the quarter rose slightly to Dollars 3.48bn, from Dollars
3.35bn a year ago.
Digital's stock plunged on the results to close at Dollars 54 3/4 , down
from Dollars 59 overnight.
'In a competitive world where most customers are cutting back on capital
expenditures, we did not see any growth in product sales and we had to
adjust pricing,' said Mr Kenneth Olsen, Digital president.
Equipment sales were flat, although the software and services business
continued to grow, he said.
Digital had forecast an operating loss for the quarter, saying last month
that recessions in the US and Europe had hit sales of its highest
performance computers particularly hard.
For the fiscal year ended last June, Digital reported its first annual loss
of Dollars 617m after taking heavy restructuring charges to cover the cost
of thousands of layoffs.
Digital is to accelerate efforts to restore profitability, through
cost-containment measures and by seeking new opportunities for revenue
growth by expanding markets and distribution channels, said Mr Smith.
Digital had announced plans to cut its workforce by 10,000 this year, but
may now make deeper cuts. The company employs about 119,500 people
worldwide.
For the half-year, the net loss was Dollars 109.7m, or 88 cents, against net
income of Dollars 137.3m, or Dollars 1.12, a year earlier. Revenues were
Dollars 6.8bn against Dollars 6.4bn.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: JC Penney to report deficit for
the year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
J. C. PENNEY, the Dallas-based department and drugstore group which ranks
fourth largest retailer in the US, announced yesterday it would report
fourth-quarter and full-year losses in the 12 months to January 25 after
taking a one-off Dollars 695m charge before tax.
The charge covers items ranging from a Dollars 200m write-down on Penney's
property portfolio to a non-cash charge for future post-retirement
healthcare costs.
The company, which made after-tax profits of Dollars 227m in the first nine
months of the year, a drop of almost 39 per cent, saw its share move Dollars
 3/4 higher to Dollars 54 7/8 on the news.
The largest element in the aggregate charge, Dollars 300m, covers the
provision for future healthcare costs. This is required by a change in US
accounting standards. A further Dollars 200m stems from the decline in
property values. The value of the portfolio after the write-down is some
Dollars 3.4bn.
'Significant declines in the real estate market nationwide and the
unlikelihood that there will be a return to formerly high values have
prompted us to re-evaluate our retail estate portfolio,' said Mr William
Howell, Penney's chairman.
The rest of the charge stems from cost-cutting measures, said to save
Dollars 160m a year before tax, goodwill write-offs and bowing out of some
'experimental' businesses.
Penney said it had been hit by weak consumer spending, pressure on margins
and declining sales.

sales

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer's first quarter earnings were boosted by strong sales of its
latest notebook-size portable personal computers introduced in October. The
US personal computer maker reported earnings well above Wall Street
expectations.
Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.36 ashare,
up from Dollars 150.5m, or Dollars 1.28 in the same period a year ago.
Analysts had been forecasting earnings of about Dollars 1.05 a share.
Net revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn from the Dollars 1.68bn
reported in the first quarter of the last fiscal year.
Apple shipped well over 100,000 of its PowerBook notebook computers in the
first fiscal quarter, said Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive.
'We saw immediate acceptance of our PowerBooks in the notebook market where
we had not participated before.'
Apple's gross profit margins declined sharply from the same period last
year, reflecting significant price cuts; operating expenses were also
reduced, however, more than offsetting the drop in profit margins.
'During a time of difficult economic and industry challenges, we have
sustained momentum for our products, while changing our infrastructure to
remain competitive,' said Mr Sculley.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1992 international sales were 45 per cent of
net sales, unchanged from a year ago.
'We will continue to closely manage our current business, while putting in
place plans for future growth opportunities,' Mr Sculley said.
Apple recently announced plans to enter the consumer electronics market.

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL BANK, the Chicago-based group which had to be rescued by federal
authorities eight years ago, yesterday reported a Dollars 76m loss for 1991
despite a return to the black in the fourth quarter of the year. Net income
for the whole of 1990 was Dollars 75m.
The bank's Dollars 50m net profit in the last quarter came after Dollars
126m of losses in the first nine months. Mr Tom Theobald, chairman, called
the last quarter result 'a promising finish to a year in which we completed
our restructuring'.
Continental said its bad debt provisions were Dollars 222m higher in 1991,
at Dollars 340m. In the fourth quarter, these provisions amounted to Dollars
30m, down from Dollars 48m in the last quarter of 1990. Net loan write-offs
in the whole of 1991 totalled Dollars 223m, compared with Dollars 87m in
1990.
Non-performing loans at the year-end increased by 7 per cent on the 12-month
period to Dollars 733m, but they were 19 per cent down on the September 30
level. At the year-end, non-performing loans represented 5.28 per cent of
Continental's total loan book.
Continental has cut its workforce from around 10,000 in 1987 to just over
5,000. The bank has focused increasingly on corporate business.

<TEXT>
THE DRAMATIC improvement in Wall Street's fortunes in the past year was
reflected yesterday in the latest figures from Bear Stearns, the New York
securities house, which announced a 400 per cent increase in fiscal second
quarter profits to Dollars 77.4m, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The huge rise in quarterly profits, earned on revenues of Dollars 479m, up
from Dollars 247m in the second quarter of 1990, was achieved on the back of
buoyant equity markets and intense activity in the corporate stock and bond
issue business.
The most impressive performance came from Bear Stearns' investment banking
division, which thanks to a sharp jump in earnings from the underwriting of
equity and fixed-income issues, reported a 330 per cent increase in profits
to Dollars 98m.
Income from principal trading was also significantly higher compared to a
year ago.
Profits from trading mortgage-backed securities, Treasuries, corporate bonds
and securities in the high-yield and bankruptcy sectors more than doubled to
Dollars 238m.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: TVS to sell stake in CBS/MTM studios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS ENTERTAINMENT is selling its 50 per cent interest in the CBS/MTM studios
to the Walt Disney company for Dollars 27m (Pounds 15m) cash.
CBS/MTM is a joint venture between CBS, the US media group, and MTM
Entertainment, the US television production company bought by TVS for
Dollars 320m in 1988. TVS has been badly hurt by the high price and
subsequent poor performance of MTM.
Mr Rudolf Agnew, chairman of TVS, which loses its broadcast franchise for
the south of England at the end of 1992, said: 'We want to continue as an
independent producer. It's early days to know exactly how that will work
out, but as an independent producer we don't need to own our own studios.
This sale is therefore a further attempt to strengthen our balance sheet.'
Mr Agnew pointed out that CBS had a 30-day option to buy TVS's holding in
MTM, though he was not aware of any plans to exercise it.
The 20 studios are spread across a 39-acre site in Los Angeles. They
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 600,000 in the year ending December 31
1990.
Last November, after learning it was to lose its franchise, TVS decided to
cut its regional programmes by two hours a week - 14 per cent - to the
minimum 12 1/2 hours required. The group's 800 staff are facing a phased
redundancy plan.
At the time, TVS said that its bankers had reaffirmed its bank facilities
until the end of the franchise. TVS has a US facility of about Dollars 95m,
which was organised by Chemical Bank. TVS's indebtedness prior to
yesterday's announcement stood at Pounds 75.8m.
Last December, the compan's application to the High Court for leave to seek
a judicial review of the Independent Television Commission's decision was
turned down on the basis that it waited too long before mounting a
challenge.
The south of England franchise was awarded to Meridian Broadcasting last
October, even though TVS outbid Meridian by more than Pounds 20m.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: List of potential MGN buyers shortens -
Publishing software supplier could be first buy-out from MCC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Asset Management, the venture capital arm of SG Warburg, the
merchant bank, has decided against bidding for Mirror Group Newspapers.
The company is the latest to decide against trying to acquire the popular
newspaper group from the administrator of the private interests of the late
Mr Robert Maxwell, which account for a 51 per cent stake.
MAM, which last year bought National Transcomm, the privatised transmitter
and engineering business of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority in a
Pounds 70m deal, decided that there was too much complexity and uncertainty
to go ahead.
Mercury is the third potential purchaser to rule itself out before it was
even possible to make a bid. The others which expressed interest and then
changed their minds were Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Mr Tiny
Rowland's Lonrho group, publisher of The Observer.
The main candidate now appears to be a management buy-out team led by Mr
Richard Stott, the editor of the Daily Mirror, backed by Electra, the
venture capital group.
A rival management bid could yet emerge however. Hambros Bank has also
expressed interest in putting together a consortium.
It seems improbable that anyone will be able to make a bid before MGN's
fully audited accounts are available for 1991. This is unlikely before
March.
Any potential purchaser will want to know precisely what the company's
assets and liabilities are and in particular how much money will be needed
to restore the MGN pension fund to financial health.
Meanwhile, the management of QED Technology, a subsidiary of Maxwell
Communication Corporation, is trying to complete a buy-out of the business
by the end of the month.
A deal would allow QED, a systems integrator and software supplier for the
publishing industry, to complete the purchase of a subsidiary of Norsk Data,
the Norwegian computer group.
Mr Jonathan Phillips, one of the joint administrators of MCC, had told Norsk
Data that an offer from QED made last August to buy one of its loss-making
subsidiaries could not proceed.
However, Norsk Data confirmed that it was still willing to sell ND Comtec to
QED if the sale could take place before the end of January. The offer
depends on QED's ability to buy itself out from MCC before then.
Mr Svein Sognen, executive vice-president at Norsk Data, said that a US, a
UK and a Norwegian company were also interested in buying the subsidiary
which also provides software to the publishing industry.
It also emerged that Berlitz International, MCC's language training and
travel publishing company, has been removed from the 'M&amp;O' group of
companies controlled by Mr David Shaffer under the joint US/UK
administration procedures agreed on Wednesday.
M&amp;O is the vehicle under these joint proceedings to handle Macmillan,
Official Airline Guides and 15 other subsidiaries of MCC.
The announcement came after a hearing in the New York southern district
bankruptcy court that approved arrangements governing the control of MCC
jointly under UK administration and US Chapter 11 bankruptcy legislation.
Five US banks have claimed ownership of most of the 55.6 per cent stake in
Berlitz that is also claimed by Macmillan. Mr Shaffer said it would not be
appropriate for Berlitz to be within M&amp;O while there was dispute over its
ownership.
Credit Suisse, Swiss Volksbank, Advest of New York, Morgan Stanley and
Shearson Lehman are believed to claim ownership of the Berlitz shares as
collateral for loans extended to companies within the Maxwell empire.
Nimbus Records pension funds, UK and US, have not been part of the MCC
pensions funds since the company's acquisition by MCC in December 1987.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dossiers compiled on supposed opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Maxwell ordered detailed investigations, including the build-up of
personal dossiers, to be carried out by his personal security staff on any
individual or organisation he claimed to be libelling him, even though some
of the alleged libel has subsequently proved to be true.
The security staff, which included a former Scotland Yard chief
superintendent, worked closely with lawyers and some Mirror Group Newspapers
journalists but reported directly and were answerable only to the late Mr
Maxwell.
A highly-placed source, who worked closely with Mr Maxwell, detailed the
scope and scale of Mr Maxwell's apparent paranoia as business associates and
others began to probe deeper into his activities.
'For the last 2 1/2 years we worked very closely with our legal department .
. . we carried out investigations on behalf of the legal department . . . we
would make up a file on an individual who had made the libellous claim in
the first place . . . very often they were journalists.'
According to the source, Mr Maxwell also 'on occasions taped his own
conversations' and ordered the investigations to be extended to business
associates, although these tapes are believed to have been destroyed.
It is understood that Mr Maxwell's suspicions about some of his associates
continued in spite of being advised by his security staff that there was no
evidence to substantiate his allegations.
'Mr Maxwell was concerned about certain people and their loyalties . . . he
believed that there were some people who were leaking information . . . very
often people were unaware of what was going on around them,' the source
said.
Following Mr Maxwell's death, the Daily Mirror published a series of reports
alleging that Mr Maxwell's security staff bugged Mr Lawrence Guest, Mirror
group finance director, and executives of two other Maxwell-owned companies.
The alleged basis for the reports is believed to be the subject of an
investigation by the City of London Police, which seized documents from the
offices of the security staff.
A senior editorial executive of the Daily Mirror said this week that part of
the anger behind the newspaper reports stemmed from the alleged fact that
colleagues had not been able to use the services of the security staff for
their own investigations.
However, according to the source close to Mr Maxwell, the security staff did
provide some investigative journalists employed by Mirror Group Newspapers
with equipment and training.
Mr John Pole, former director of group security for Maxwell Communication
Corporation, said last night that he was not prepared to comment about the
activities of his department pending a police inquiry.

Commercial Union, the composite insurance group, reported a 19 per cent
increase in new life assurance and pensions business during 1991.
In common with Prudential, which announced new business figures earlier in

There was a 9 per cent increase to Pounds 146.3m in annual premiums, which
are seen as being more vulnerable to a recession.
Single premiums to personal pensions accounted for much of the rise, while
new annual premiums for life policies fell by 2 per cent.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Olivetti jobs go as two UK subsidiaries
merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI Office and Olivetti Systems and Networks, two UK operating
subsidiaries of Olivetti, the Italian office equipment and computer maker,
are to be merged into one company with the loss of some 65 jobs, about 4 per
cent of the workforce.
The move is part of a worldwide reorganisation Olivetti is putting in place
to deal with declining sales and profitability. The new company, with
headquarters in Putney, London, will be called Olivetti UK and be run by Mr
Paolo Tosi, formerly managing director of Olivetti Systems. Mr John Kernick,
ex-managing director of Olivetti Office, has left the company.
Until 1990 the company was known as British Olivetti in the UK, to play down
its Italian parentage; in that year it was divided into the office division,
dealing with low end personal computers and typewriters, and Systems,
dealing with computer systems in anticipation of a growing market for
computer equipment.
The recession in the US and Europe, coupled with a significant decline in
the price of computer hardware, has meant that the market has shrunk rather
than grown. Olivetti said earlier this week its sales last year declined by
about 5 per cent.
While the group worldwide has almost certainly incurred a loss, the UK
subsidiary performed well, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m on sales of
Pounds 75m at the half way mark.

The net asset value per ordinary share of Witan Investment amounted to
178.8p at December 31 1991, a 17 per cent improvement on the 153.3p figure
of a year earlier.
The net asset value of the warrants improved from 76.8p to 102.3p over the
same period.
Revenue before tax for the year grew by Pounds 1m to Pounds 26.3m. A final
dividend of 2.8p (2.5p) is proposed making a total for the year of 5.3p
(4.75p). Earnings per share came out at 5.67p (5.4p).
Lord Faringdon, chairman, attributed the rise in net asset value to a
cautious investment approach under difficult stock market conditions.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Markheath Pounds 459,000 in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKHEATH, the property group, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 459,000 in
the six months to September 30 1991 and is cutting its interim dividend from
2p to 0.5p.
The group is 60 per cent owned by the Australian Adelaide Steamship Group
which is being refinanced.
Markheath's figures for the first half of last year, showing a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 6.6m, were not comparable because of the contribution from
Camford Engineering, a motor components company which has since been sold.
That sale, completed in May 1991, helped to cut debt from Pounds 95m in
March to Pounds 62m in September. Mr Paul Bobroff, managing director, said
it had gone up by about 10 per cent since then because of a purchase and
dividend and tax payments.
Turnover plummeted to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 74.5m) and mainly comprised the
sale of two properties previously owned by Camford. The loss, after paying
Pounds 1.05m interest, was Pounds 2.49m, offset by just over Pounds 2m
income from properties and dividends. Losses per share were 0.19p (earnings
of 3.59p).
Mr Bobroff said a further Pounds 2.6m of interest was capitalised. With
rental income of Pounds 2.8m this year and at least Pounds 3.7m next year,
the group was moving closer to a balance between rental income and total
finance costs.
'We are not selling property into a bad market and we are comfortable with
our portfolio, which is either completed tenanted buildings or development
sites. We have no developments in progress.'
The main opportunity for the group remained in Kings Park, Stevenage, a
22-acre site. About Pounds 1.5m was being spent on infrastructure work and
discussion were taking place with international companies to pre-let
substantial parts of the development.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unforeseen costs leave Microgen lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEXPECTEDLY high costs in its UK business hit profits at Microgen, the
information services company, which yesterday revealed a 14 per cent decline
to Pounds 7.3m in its pre-tax return for the year to October 31. Turnover
was Pounds 47.7m, against Pounds 47.1m.
Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said: 'Costs and capital expenditure had been
allowed to run ahead of income during the recession.' Microgen has also been
unable to dispose of some unoccupied UK premises, which is costing the group
Pounds 525,000.
Mr Lee said the group was making good progress in cutting costs.
In Scandinavia, which he said had been hit even harder by recession than the
UK, the Capella subsidiary had won the group's largest-ever contract. The
deal with a leading Finnish bank was expected to produce revenue of about
Pounds 3m a year.
During the year, Microgen sold its office equipment and supplies business in
Sweden for Pounds 1.4m, allowing the group to concentrate on its core
businesses there, Mr Lee said.
Earnings per share, before an extraordinary gain of Pounds 189,000, fell to
12.2p (13.5p). The final proposed dividend is maintained at 4.8p, making an
unchanged total of 7p.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Paris Match to withdraw autopsy pictures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PARIS court has ordered Paris Match magazine to withdraw an issue
featuring autopsy photographs of Mr Robert Maxwell and allegations that he
was hit before his death, reports Reuter.
The court, acting at the request of Mrs Elizabeth Maxwell, the media
magnate's French-born wife, issued an interim injunction late on Wednesday
also ordering the weekly to pay FFr100,000 (Pounds 10,300) provisional
damages to Mrs Maxwell.
The court also ordered bailiffs to ensure that the offending issue,
published last week, was removed from news stands.
The autopsy photographs were accompanied by what the magazine said was a
partial transcript of a conversation between Israeli and UK pathologists who
examined Mr Maxwell's body in Tel Aviv before his Jerusalem burial in
November.
Paris Match quoted French specialists as saying the body showed numerous
traces of blows before death. Dr Iain West, one of the British pathologists
involved, dismissed the allegations as nonsense.
In its latest issue, Paris Match said it had spoken to the three Israeli
pathologists in Tel Aviv who were under orders not to talk.

FT  17 JAN 92 / US drug regulator criticises Fisons product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS' most promising product has been criticised by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), casting a shadow over the prospects for profits growth
at the UK drug company.
The FDA controls products which go on sale in the Dollars 60bn (Pounds
33.50bn) a year US drugs market.
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that UK
production of Tilade, an asthma drug for which sales were once forecast by
analysts to reach Pounds 500m a year by 1992, has been breaking US
regulations.
The FDA said Tilade's production methods 'do not conform to NDAs (new drug
application regulations)'.
It criticised the manufacturing process of Tilade dispensers and said that
testing of the drug during production was not accurate enough. The report
also listed inadequacies in quality control of another asthma drug, Intal,
as well as Opticrom, an eye treatment, and Imferon, an blood-iron treatment.
Fisons said yesterday: 'Tilade production issues raised by the FDA have been
answered satisfactorily. There are no further undisclosed issues.' It hopes
to get US approval within months.
Tilade is intended to replace Intal, which has been the mainstay of Fisons
profits growth since the 1970s. However, Tilade has failed to secure US
approval in spite of statements from Fisons on several occasions over the
past 18 months that approval was imminent. The drug is available in several
countries, including the UK, but revenues in 1992 will probably be less than
Pounds 50m.
The FDA has told Fisons that it might be committing a felony under US law if
the drug were shipped to the US without changing the production process.
The criticisms of Tilade production have come to light two days after the
resignation of Mr John Kerridge, Fisons' chairman and chief executive, on
grounds of ill-health.
His sickness had probably been exacerbated by controversy surrounding the
company over the last four months, according to Mr Patrick Egan, his
temporary replacement at Fisons.
The shares have lost one third of their value since the summer and the
company issued a profits warning in December.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Gamsakhurdia calls for civil war: Ousted Georgian president
rallies supporters and urges march on capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GEORGIA'S ousted president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, yesterday returned from
exile to the west of the republic and called on his supporters to arm
themselves and march on the capital Tbilisi.
The return of Mr Gamsakhurdia, who fled on January 6 after a bloody two-week
siege of parliament by opposition forces, poses a serious threat to the
fragile stability achieved and revives the spectre of civil war in the
republic.
Reports said the president had addressed a rally in the western city of
Zugdidi, and announced the beginning of a civil war against the military
council which seized control of the republic after his escape.
The council responded with a television appeal for a counter-demonstration
in Tbilisi. Mr Jaba Ioseliani, one of the two council leaders, dismissed the
threat to the new government and said troops had already been sent to block
any march by Gamsakhurdia supporters.
Mr Gamsakhurdia had been sheltering in Armenia, which had offered him
temporary asylum, and where he repeatedly declared he was still president of
Georgia.
He arrived in Sukhumi, on the Georgian Black Sea coast, in the early hours.
Some reports suggest he flew via Grozny, capital of the Chechen-Ingush
autonomous republic north of Georgia, which has expressed support for Mr
Gamsakhurdia and called his removal illegal.
The extent of any fresh conflict depends on how much popular support remains
for the president and on the effect of the anti-Gamsakhurdia propaganda
campaign waged by the new government. Since gaining control of republican
television, the opposition has made repeated broadcasts denouncing the
president and documenting his alleged abuses of human rights.
Mr Tengiz Sigua, acting prime minister, has accused Mr Gamsakhurdia of a
variety of excesses. The accusations range from stealing Rbs200m from state
funds before he fled the republic and embezzling more than Rbs1bn during his
presidency, to having set up a 'private zoo' for his family.
He has also claimed that documents exist showing that Mr Gamsakhurdia was
three times diagnosed mentally ill.
Such denunciations seem to have made little impression on the 1,000 or so
supporters of the president who have been demonstrating regularly in
Tbilisi. He also has a core of support in western Georgia, particularly
among his own ethnic group, the Mingrel people.
The fact that Mr Gamsakhurdia's support is concentrated in Mingrelia and
Abkhazia in western Georgia also raises the possibility of a regional/ethnic
dimension being added to the conflict. Tass reported yesterday that
Gamsakhurdia representatives were discussing the idea of uniting the two
regions into an independent Mingrel-Abkhazian republic.
But Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of Abkhazia's parliament, said he was
unaware of any such discussions.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Mideast talks end close to deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST round of Middle East peace talks ended in virtual deadlock
yesterday after four days of negotiations in Washington.
Israeli delegates flew home, a day later than planned, to face a mounting
domestic political crisis after the withdrawal announced by two right-wing
parties imperilled the parliamentary majority of the Likud-led coalition
government.
They left behind a host of unresolved issues, after making little headway in
bilateral talks with Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Palestinian
delegations.
But threats of a complete breakdown in the talks appeared to be averted.
Israeli and Arab delegates at least agreed they should meet again on
February 10, but could not agree where. Israel wants to move the talks to
the Middle East, while the Arab delegations want to keep them in Washington.
Mr Richard Boucher, a spokesman for the US State Department, said: 'We think
that this round of talks was important and that significant procedural
issues were resolved.
'The issues to be negotiated are complex, and thus the negotiations are
expected to be tough. The key is to remain on course towards achieving a
comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute.'
Blocking further progress is the issue of the settlements in the occupied
territories in the West Bank and Gaza: Palestinian delegates view this as a
critical obstacle; Israel sees Palestinian violence against the settlers in
the same light.
But the US, which views the settlements as an obstacle to peace, is placing
increasing pressure on Israel to curb its settlements activity or forego the
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.50bn) of loan guarantees it has requested from the US
over the next five years to finance the absorption of Soviet Jews.
Under growing pressure from their home constituencies - the Palestine
Liberation Organisation in Tunis and the leaders of the Intifada in the
occupied territories, for the Palestinians, and the right-wing parties for
Israel - the delegations have exchanged insults with mounting intensity, in
a process described by Mr Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, as
'one-upmanship on pain'.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Reduction in youth training funds planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Employment is planning 'a substantial reduction' in the
weekly contributions it makes for youth training, its main scheme for 16- to
18-year-olds.
The move, announced yesterday, came as the government reported a 31,000 rise
in the jobless figures in December, with the unemployment rate rising to 9
per cent, the highest level for four years.
Training and enterprise councils (Tecs) will strongly resist the planned
reduction, which will be in excess of 10 per cent.
A confidential memorandum circulating among Tecs, which administer youth
training schemes (YT), has warned that a reduction in funds would cause
bankruptcies among training providers. It could also mean that the
government could fail to meet its guarantee of a training place to all young
people who want one.
Last week, Fullemploy, which trains ethnic minorities, went into
liquidation, while Apex Trust, which trains ex-offenders, said last night
that it would apply for a court order to appoint an administrator.
Previous cuts in weekly unit prices for YT did not directly cause their
financial difficulties, but were contributory factors. The government, in
cutting its grants for training, wants employers to pay more.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour's spokesman on training, described the proposals as
a scandal. 'We believe the Tecs should stand firm, make their collective
voices known publicly and refuse to accept any unit price which does not
provide quality training.'
The Department of Employment, under pressure from the Treasury, wants
increased volumes of training in 1992-93 for roughly the same amount of
money as in 1991-92. It said yesterday it expected young people to stay in
YT longer partly because of the recession but mainly because many young
people were taking courses leading to national vocational qualifications
A memo from the north-west region of Tecs said: 'If a reduction in prices
were to occur, Tecs' standing in their communities would be considerably
damaged by further difficulties and bankruptcies of training providers.'
The memo said the average cash price per person for YT was Pounds 46 a week
in 1983. Eight years later, after more than 50 per cent inflation, most Tecs
still operated at between Pounds 46 and Pounds 50 a training week.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Nissan flexes more of its muscle: Increased UK capacity will
be good for domestic components suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan has set alarm bells ringing in the boardrooms of indigenous European
car manufacturers. Its announcement today that it would increase its car
production capacity in the UK by more than a third is bound to increase
Continental anxiety about the Japanese penetration of an already fiercely
competitive European car market. From producing just a handful of cars in
1986 when it opened its plant in Sunderland, in north-east England, Nissan
will be able to produce 300,000 cars annually from next year.
Overnight, French and Italian car makers have been forcefully reminded of
Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet's portrayal of 'transplants' in the UK as 'a
Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe'. Traditionally protected
by their governments from Japanese imports, the French and Italians have
most to fear from increased production of Japanese cars classified as
European because they are built in the UK.
Nissan's latest expansion lifts official combined capacity projections for
Nissan, Toyota and Honda plants in the UK to 700,000 units within the next
five years. This will represent about 6 per cent of the European car market.
Since Toyota and Honda - the only other Japanese transplants in the UK  - do
not even start producing cars at their plants at Derby and Swindon
respectively until the end of this year, developments at Nissan are likely
to be viewed as a precedent for faster-than-expected expansion at Toyota and
Honda as well.
If expectation becomes reality, little additional production would be needed
to make nonsense of the EC Commission's 'working assumption' that Japanese
manufacturers will be producing 'only' 1.2m cars and light commercial
vehicles in the single market in Europe by the end of the decade.
UK government officials are already privately calculating that the figure is
likely to be much closer to 2m, with 1m in the UK alone by that time. That
being so, Nissan's announcement appears set to spark a new round of debate
about Japanese penetration of Europe's car market, and the role to be played
by the transplants within it.
What Nissan's expansion plans do indicate is that European consumers are
more than willing to buy the Japanese products now coming on offer.
According to Mr Ian Gibson, the former Ford executive who is managing
director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), Nissan had been 'well on the
conservative side in estimating how fast we could grow a customer base in
Europe'.
This was partly because of the big difference in the reception given on the
Continent to the one type of car being made in Sunderland - the Primera -
compared with its boxy predecessor, the Bluebird.
In its final year of production 40,000 Bluebirds were sold on the Continent.
Last year, the more sophisticated Primera found 112,000 Continental buyers,
and Mr Gibson says it has not been possible wholly to meet demand.
Significantly, 40,000 of the sales were to Germany, one of Europe's most
discriminating markets. Later this year, Nissan will start building a second
model, the Micra, which it believes will be as popular as the Primera.
The hostility of some Continental car makers notwithstanding, Nissan's
expansion is likely to give considerable satisfaction to European, and
particularly British, component makers, whose parts can account for up to 70
per cent of the vehicle's content.
Purchases from European and British suppliers will jump from Pounds 600m
last year to Pounds 850m in 1993, according to Mr Gibson.
The UK-based components industry's share of what Nissan will spend for parts
is set to jump by one half from Pounds 420m last year to Pounds 655m next
year. Its share of the spending will rise from 70 to 77 per cent. This added
business will help the components sector to offset reduced volume elsewhere
as a result of the UK car market collapse, Mr Gibson says.
The larger share is partly due to extra suppliers being recruited for the
Micra.
But part, too, is extra business for Continental European components groups
such as Bosch of Germany and Sommer and Raydell of France. These  -
surmising that the UK-based motor industry is not only going to produce many
more cars but be raised to Japanese standards of competitiveness - want to
be on the UK production bandwagon as it starts to roll in earnest.
Bosch, with its Pounds 100m alternator plant in South Wales, provides one
example. Sommer which supplies trim is another. It is actually setting up
shop on a site adjoining the Sunderland plant.
The biggest beneficiaries, however, are the 122 UK companies which have been
supplying Nissan from the start or who have joined as the Primera developed.
'Anyone supplying for the Primera has been a natural choice for supplying
Micra parts as well,' says Mr Gibson. Only about a dozen suppliers, unable
to meet or sustain Nissan's performance criteria have fallen by the wayside.
In north-east England, an area which until Nissan arrived had no motor
industry, the number of suppliers has grown from three when Nissan first set
up to 22. By next year, there will be 26. Spending with these will double
Pounds 280m.
The UK, however, is unlikely to be the principal beneficiary of the Pounds
150m investment in plant and equipment for the needed capacity expansion,
which includes more body pressing facilities and a greatly expanded engine
production facility. With relatively little left of the UK machine tool
industry, much will come from Germany and Japan.
The predominance of European suppliers appears to vindicate Japanese
contentions that there is no prospect of a march on Europe by Japanese
component suppliers of the type which has caused so much disruption to the
North American industry.
The history of Nissan UK's development so far is a compliment to the UK
components industry in particular, says Mr Gibson, who throughout his long
career with Ford - not least in setting up its often-troubled Halewood plant
on Merseyside - has acquired plenty of experience of the parts industry.
The development of Nissan's relationship with the UK components industry has
been a long and occasionally painful business. It has dawned only gradually
on some suppliers that they were expected to design and develop their own
components for Nissan cars - albeit to a comprehensive brief. This gave them
more autonomy than they were accustomed to in the normal, frequently
adversarial relationships with European car makers.
The fact that they have, or are fast acquiring, strong research and
development capabilities makes feasible Nissan's declared intention to
conceive, design and develop cars in Europe for European consumers, says Mr
Gibson.
'What has been really impressive though is the extent to which UK component
makers have been working with us as an opportunity to leapfrog their
continental competition.'
So far, says Mr Gibson, the inroads made by UK-built Nissans in the UK have
been made at the expense not of indigenous manufacturers but of other,
mainly Continental importers.
Ford, the UK market leader, has lost sales, but many industry observers
share Nissan's opinion that Ford's problems are self-inflicted. While
Nissan's output has been rising, Rover, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot have
also increased their share of the UK market. Mr Gibson, therefore, appears
right in his contention that it is mainly Continental imports which are
suffering.
With some 189,000 UK-built Nissans due to be shipped across the Channel next
year, that is not a message Peugeot's Mr Calvet or Fiat's Gianni Agnelli
will want to hear.

While we're talking about codes, isn't it time Trafalgar House replaced the

The three pennants spell out the number 253, which the company insists was
the code Nelson used for 'England' in his signal about expecting every man
to do his duty at the battle of Trafalgar. But to judge by yesterday's
rather stormy annual general meeting, the company of Trafalgar isn't living
up to City expectations at least.
A more apt logo might be letter-flags SFV, signifying 'my engines are going

The word he requested was Agincourt. To his consternation, the response came

Britain's parliamentary equivalent of TV talent-spotting shows, private
members' bills, offer obscure backbenchers a rare chance to change the law
and achieve stardom. And opportunity knocks today for Conservative MP Ivan
Lawrence, whose national lottery bill comes up in the House of Commons.
He is already better known than most backbenchers, not least because of his
other job as a criminal barrister in which he appeared for the Kray brothers
and serial-murderer Denis Nilsen. But he has also scored a telling
achievement in parliament.
In opposing the Water (Fluoridation) Bill nearly seven years ago, he made a
speech starting at 5 am and lasting four hours 23 minutes - enshrined in the
Guinness Book of Records as the longest backbench speech under present
standing orders.

It was scarcely a surprise punch-line that the New York Times's 65-year-old
chairman and publisher delivered yesterday. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, known
familiarly as Punch (his sister is called Judy) named his son Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger Jr to take over as publisher.
Junior, dubbed Pinch by outsiders, joined the NY Times in 1978. Now 40, he
has worked there as general reporter, advertising man, corporate planner,
and deputy publisher.
There was never any doubt about his destiny. His earnings, which in 1990
totalled Dollars 302,500, reflected his exalted position. As one Wall Street
analyst noted a while back: 'Obviously your name isn't Sulzberger for
nothing.'
True, Pinch will have to contend with a recession-hit media market. The New
York Times Company reported a 79 per cent slump in third quarter net profit,
to Dollars 1.9m. But Sulzberger senior declared himself 'confident that
Arthur will be an excellent publisher'.
Oddly enough, much the same was said last March by Katharine Graham, owner
of the Washington Post, when she named her son Donald to succeed her as its
chief executive.

The reshuffle of finance directors at NatWest and TSB is all rather odd.
Why should a well-respected NatWest veteran like John Burns want to defect
to a group less than half NatWest's size when he is only four years from
retirement? Presumably Burns is privy to NatWest's innermost strategic
secrets, so why allow him to take them to an arch competitor?
It looks far too cosy and once again raises questions about just how
competitive British banks really are. Burns was not talking yesterday, so
the market will have to draw its own conclusions.
Of the two banks, NatWest seems to be taking the bigger risk in the finance
chief it has decided to import. Although good British finance directors are
hardly in short supply, it has chosen someone from not only a different
industry but another country - and presumably at a salary that at least some
of his indigenous colleagues will resent.
It might be that the 49-year-old Richard Goeltz is just what's needed to
shake up NatWest's inbred culture. But the record of similar moves is less
than encouraging. Midland Bank is on its third outside finance director and
so far there's little improvement in its fortunes. Meanwhile, Lloyds Bank,
the most successful clearer, seems to have done very well without a finance
director on its board.

Recognition at last] Vincas Bilickas, who for over 50 of his 87 years has
unoffically represented Lithuania in Britain, is to be recognised as his
country's ambassador by the Queen.
The first envoy to be appointed to the Court of St James by one of the newly
independent Baltic states, he originally came to London in 1938 as a
commercial counsellor. A year later the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact gave
Lithuania to the Soviets.
Bilickas stayed put, along with the ambassador Bronius Balutis, becoming
head of mission when his chief died in the 1960s. Although the UK foreign
office allowed him personal diplomatic privileges, deeming him a charge
d'affaires, he was not recognised as Lithuania's envoy nor, of course,
invited to diplomatic parties.
He'll no doubt make up for it after presenting his letters to the Queen on
February 11. But, while he wouldn't say so himself, a better date might have
been chosen.
Five days later comes Lithuania's longstanding Independence Day - one of the
two occasions each year on which Bilickas has stead-
fastly raised his faded yellow, green and red national flag over the
legation. The other is Her Majesty's birthday.

NO TRUMPETS, NO DRUMS By Sari Nusseibeh and Mark Heller IB Tauris. Pounds
12.95
Any two people from opposite sides of the Arab-Israel divide who succeed in
agreeing on more than a vague outline of a resolution of the longest-running
Middle East conflict deserve credit. For the attempt to be made jointly by
an Israeli citizen and a Palestinian assures the project of greater
credibility and, hopefully, wider circulation. And for the authors to have
concluded their task by liking and respecting each other was a bonus that
even they had not contemplated.
What they would now like is for the involved parties to study their efforts
and to consider those areas where mutually acceptable solutions are shown to
be possible.
It was none the less tempting to abandon No Trumpets, No Drums after the
first few pages. The disappointment was provoked by the realisation that,
although setting out on a marathon course, the two runners had started at
the halfway mark.
Mr Heller, a Canadian-born Israeli, quickly admits to having supported for
some time the concept of an independent Palestinian state on the territory
occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. For his part, Mr Nusseibeh knew of Mr
Heller's position from the outset, and says that he could not have worked
with an Israeli who refused to accept the necessity of a two-state solution.
For him and, he says, the Palestinian people, the bottom line must be a
sovereign state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Contrast this with the starting point of the peace negotiations in Madrid
last November and in the third session of talks in Washington this week. Not
only does the Israeli government refuse to contemplate the emergence of a
Palestinian state, it refuses to negotiate with a separate Palestinian
delegation and will not concede the principle of returning any part of the
occupied territories.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, has said repeatedly that all
that is on offer is peace for peace. As if to reinforce that assertion,
Israel is accelerating the pace of its housebuilding programme in the West
Bank and Gaza, regardless of mounting American anger and the increasing
probability that President George Bush will seek to deny Israel the Dollars
10bn it is asking for in loan guarantees to help settle the wave of new
immigrants from what was the Soviet Union.
Of course, Mr Shamir is taking his most extreme position at the outset, both
as a negotiating stance and in the hope that he might persuade the Arab
delegation to abandon the process. But it would be nave to expect Mr Shamir,
the Likud party he leads, or anyone else from the Israeli right to do what
Mr Nusseibeh has required and received from Mr Heller: that is, to recognise
the principle of what they describe as 'equitability and mutuality' between
the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
If that were achieved, then Messrs Heller and Nusseibeh would be more likely
to be observing and chronicling the progress of the official negotiations,
rather than coming up with solutions of their own. Finding a way to cross
the bridge from the reality of today to the point at which the authors have
chosen to begin their own negotiations is what the present American-led
peace process is about.
For Arab leaders, the past decade has brought a relentless narrowing of
choice. The demise of pan-Arabism, the Gulf war defeat of Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the pre-eminence of
the US in the Middle East have left no way forward for them, other than
through negotiation. If Mr Nusseibeh was able to deliver to them in fact
what he has negotiated in print, songs in his honour would be sung
throughout the Arab world.
He may not have achieved everything that the Palestinians want, but he has
progressed further with Mr Heller than did President Anwar Sadat in his
attempt to win concessions from Mr Menachem Begin, the former Israeli prime
minister, at the Camp David negotiations which brought the first
breakthrough in Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
Mr Heller will have a harder task in selling the results of his labour to
fellow citizens. He questions, as do they, whether the Palestinians and
other Arabs will ever truly reconcile themselves to Israel's existence. But
he is also convinced that Israel, faced by the choice between stalemate and
a two-state solution, must choose the latter.
He and Mr Nusseibeh cannot agree on the precise borders between the two
states, but they do not back away from solutions for scarcely less
contentious issues, such as the return of Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements, security, water resources, and even the future of Jerusalem as
the jointly administered capital of both nations.
They have done what intelligent, fair-minded people should always be capable
of. Sadly, as the Middle East daily demonstrates, their voices remain faint,
and the need to make such a fundamental choice is far from being actively
debated by the majority of Israelis. If ever it is, No Trumpets, No Drums
can make a reasoned contribution to what will be an emotional and divisive
debate.

FT  17 JAN 92 / A fragile exchange: The effect of tensions within the EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques de la Rosiere, the governor of the Bank of France, emphasises his
country's new-found monetary rectitude by spelling out to visitors his
employees' latest pay increase: just 2.5 per cent.
He arches his Gallic eyebrows at events in Germany. As part of general high
wage demands in this year's German pay round, the civil servants'
association - which covers officials at the Bundesbank - has launched a
claim for an increase of 10.5 per cent. German steelworkers, meanwhile, this
week have threatened to strike in pursuit of a 10 per cent-plus pay claim -
even though yesterday there was growing confidence that a 5 to 6 per cent
pay deal might be negotiated without recourse to widespread work stoppages.
The uncharacteristic flagging of Germany's inflation performance - one of
the side-effects of German unification - - has a crucial influence on the
present strains within in the European Monetary System (EMS).
The nervousness surrounding sterling - which was yesterday still hovering
just above its effective floor in the system - reflects just part of the
tensions. The strongest currency in the EMS remains the Spanish peseta, but
the Italian lira, French franc and Danish crown have all been weak lately
against the D-Mark.
The EMS has functioned for five years without a significant exchange rate
realignment. But partly because Germany has fallen from financial virtue as
a result of post-unity economic turbulence, the system is starting to look
vulnerable, for three basic reasons:
High German interest rates: these have risen as a consequence of the
Bundesbank's worries that Germany's unity-induced boom in 1989-90 has left
the country with an inflationary hangover. The German public sector deficit
is running at about 4 per cent of gross domestic product, caused by
large-scale public sector transfers to east Germany, while German wage
inflation last year was an unusually high 7 per cent.
Worries about sterling: the British government has firmly ruled out
devaluation. But with the economy still in the doldrums, the UK has been the
only member of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) not to have increased
interest rates in the wake of the Bundesbank's pre-Christmas boost in
discount and Lombard rates. Confidence has not been helped by the Bundesbank
view - shared by some at the Bank of England - that sterling joined the ERM
15 months ago at an uncompetitively high rate.
Longer-term concern about the position of the higher-inflation currencies
within the EMS, above all the lira and the peseta: both Italy and Spain are
running large current account deficits and will be prime candidates for
devaluation if a large realignment needs to take place during the next two
years as part of preparations for economic and monetary union (Emu).
In spite of this fragility, a realignment in the near future looks
improbable, especially after the D-Mark's fall against the dollar in the
last few days. Most EMS participants are considerably more wedded to
exchange rate stability than at the time of the last shake-up in parities
five years ago.
Most of these countries believe that the competitive advantage gained
through any devaluation against the D-Mark would be outweighed by the
negative effects on inflation. Rather than seeking a currency adjustment,
Germany's partners seem likely, therefore, reluctantly to tolerate high
interest rates in the next few months - part of the price of German unity.
One senior European central banker who has played a key role in running the
nearly 13-year-old EMS says: 'There was a good argument to revalue the
D-Mark 18 months ago to lower inflationary pressures (during the
reunification process). If that had happened, there would have been less of
a boom in Germany, inflation would still be only 2.5 per cent, and German
interest rates would not be so high.'
Now, however, with German growth slowing, he says: 'The situation is
different. The time for a revaluation has been missed.'
In his struggle to avoid a foreign exchange market showdown, Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor, has several cards up his sleeve.
Sterling's crucial EMS floor - at present, just below DM2.85 - is set by the
peseta, the only currency other than sterling to benefit from the wide 6 per
cent fluctuation margin. If the Spanish currency moves lower in coming
weeks, this automatically increases the pound's leeway to drop to its
ultimate floor of DM2.78, reducing pressure on the UK authorities to take
defensive action.
If the Bank of England does need to intervene to protect sterling, it can
draw on an increased stock of foreign exchange reserves - much of them now
held in D-Marks. The UK's currency reserves have risen since the end of 1986
from Dollars 13bn to Dollars 36bn. This is part of an unprecedented Dollars
125bn increase in the currency holdings of Germany's eight ERM partner
central banks during the past five years.
There is now less overall economic reason for a currency adjustment than in
the past. European inflation rates have converged noticeably during the past
five years - sharply narrowing interest rate differentials (see chart).
With French inflation down to 3.1 per cent last year, against 4.2 per cent
in Germany, the Bank of France believes that the franc could eventually take
over the 'anchor' role in the EMS enjoyed by the D-Mark, allowing the French
government to reduce its interest rates to less than Germany's. This
explains why Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, has become
the arch-defender of the franc's present D-Mark parity.
One senior French finance ministry official remarks with hauteur: 'We find
it unacceptable that a currency with a lower inflation rate should be
devalued.' If there should be a realignment in the future, he says, the
franc would move up in line with a revaluation of the D-Mark.
Mr Beregovoy's rebuttals of devaluation now have considerable credibility,
for he has found some powerful allies at home. In spite of slow growth and
increasing unemployment - projected to rise to more than 10 per cent in
early 1992 - there is near-consensus among French industrialists in favour
of keeping the franc stable.
The French Patronat employers' organisation, which called at the beginning
of the 1980s for a lower franc, now firmly rebuts the devaluation option.
'Exchange rate discipline has had very positive effects on the
competitiveness and efficiency of French enterprises,' says Mr
Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, Patronat vice-president in charge of economic
affairs. 'For decades, we experienced systematic devaluations, which became
a way of life. We do not want to start again.'
Similar firmness on the need to stick to current EMS levels is shown by
employers' organisations in the UK and Germany. Mr Douglas McWilliams,
economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, says he is
pleasantly surprised by the number of industrialists supporting the UK
government's anti-devaluation line. Of CBI members, he estimates that 'most
would go along with a small rise in interest rates rather than a
devaluation'. Sir Brian Corby, the CBI president, yesterday ruled out a
devaluation as 'unacceptable, unnecessary and counter-productive'.
Mr Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German
Industries, the BDI, urges EMS partners to stick to the 'stability course. A
realignment would not be helpful', he says. 'Other countries may try to
escape the influence of German interest rates. But it would not solve their
difficulties.'
As European governments ponder how long the German credit squeeze will last,
forecasts that the Bundesbank will reduce its key lending rates by April are
starting to look more credible after a sharp fall in German capital market
yields during the past few weeks - a signal that the German economic
slowdown is now starting to bite.
Much will depend on the outcome of the next few weeks of German wage
bargaining. If further evidence of sluggishness in the German economy
coincides with moderation in pay deals, there will be overwhelming pressure
on the Bundesbank to relax its stance. 'At these high levels of interest
rates,' says one key Bundesbank official, 'the air gets a little thin.'
In the meantime, Germany's EMS partners will have little choice but to take
the medicine from Frankfurt.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Management (Health at work): Ashes to ashes as smoking bites
dust - Diane Summers investigates the trend among employers to free their
premises of the dreaded weed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks into the new year and many aspiring non-smokers are still fighting
to kick the weed. Others have given up the struggle - at least until next
January.
Quitting smoking at a corporate level requires even more planning and
consistency. Companies wanting to introduce a no-smoking policy among their
workforces are most likely to succeed if they consult their employees,
rather than just confiscating all the ashtrays one Monday morning. Two
events in particular this week have renewed interest among UK employers in
the subject of workplace smoking policies.
First, the Health and Safety Executive published a consultation document on
Tuesday making clear that employers will have to provide special rest rooms
for non-smokers from the end of next year in order to comply with a European
directive. The new rules could prompt many employers to ban smoking
altogether.
Second, at an industrial tribunal in Glasgow, a nursing auxiliary claimed
constructive dismissal over her employer's smoking ban.
Mary Dryden told the tribunal that she could not endure eight hours at work
without a cigarette and therefore had to leave her job. When Greater Glasgow
Health Board banned smoking on its premises last summer, it did not provide
rooms for smokers, or leave enough time for Dryden to go out for a cigarette
during her breaks, the tribunal heard.
The move to no-smoking workplaces has been marked in recent years, with up
to one-in-five companies now operating anti-smoking policies. Midland Bank
is the latest large employer to announce a ban for its 45,000 staff in
nearly 2,000 branches from the spring. Other employers, either with total
bans or severe smoking restrictions, include IBM, Marks and Spencer and the
Inland Revenue.
This trend is being driven by changes in attitudes to smoking in public
places, but also by employers' fears of future liabilities for damage to
workers' health through passive smoking.
There has yet to be a claim for damages in a British court arising out of
passive smoking, but Ash, the anti-smoking group, said yesterday that it
would be seeking counsel's opinion in the next few weeks with the aim of
bringing a case under common law, or through the Health and Safety at Work
Act. According to David Pollock, Ash director, passive smoking court cases
in Australia have led to widespread workplace smoking bans.
Whatever motivates an employer to act - and the pressure is as likely to
come from employees as from management - there are several pitfalls on the
way to implementing a no-smoking policy.
According to a survey carried out by Incomes Data Services, the employment
research group, most organisations go through the following stages on the
way to banning or restricting smoking:
Consultation with the workforce - an essential first step in preventing
mutiny, or worse, by nicotine addicts. Surveys, ballots, questionnaires,
meetings and negotiations with trade unions or staff associations are all
methods of gauging opinion and are likely, says IDS, to show a surprisingly
high level of enthusiasm, even from smokers themselves.
British Gas in Wales provides a typical example of what a company might
expect from a poll of employees: 34 per cent thought smoking should be
banned at work altogether, while 53 per cent were in favour of restrictions.
Degrees of restriction need to be decided. A total ban on smoking throughout
a building is unambiguous but is tough on smokers. Only an ex-addict can
appreciate the resentment that a total ban is likely to engender among
smokers.
Ash itself argues for the more humane 'sin bin' solutions, where smoking is
allowed only in designated - ideally separately-ventilated - areas. The
Financial Times is an example of an employer that has taken this route: its
sin bins on each editorial floor are the setting for some unlikely
alliances.
Phasing-in of policies. The gradual introduction of smoking restrictions, or
at least a period of warning (Ash recommends a 12-week implementation
period) will help to avoid resentment and legal problems, says IDS.
At Cambridge University Press, for example, a smoking ban was brought in
during four months, with smoking prohibited first before 10.30am, then
before noon, 2pm, 4.30pm and, finally, throughout the day.
Helping employees to give up the weed. There are considerable cost benefits
to employers in having workforces that do not smoke - either at home or at
work.
Most companies with no-smoking policies also offer employees help with
giving up permanently. For example, the Automobile Association distributes
Health Education Authority literature, and South Derbyshire Health Authority
gives staff time off for special 'stopping smoking' classes. IBM even offers
acupuncture and hypnotherapy as well as counselling and classes.
All this is old hat in the US, where no smoking offices are the norm. In
most Californian offices, you would no more think of lighting a cigarette
than spitting on the floor. In most of Europe, by contrast, smokers take
their rights so seriously that they may not take kindly to efforts by their
employers to help them quit.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM refuses call for 'supergun'
statement - Exports To Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major yesterday brushed off Labour demands for a ministerial
statement on the Iraqi supergun affair and dismissed recent allegations
about the extent of official awareness as 'nonsense.'
The prime minister was responding to a question from Mr David Winnick, the
Labour MP for Walsall North. Mr Winnick's remarks came the day after the
project manager of the supergun project informed MPs that British and US
officials were told about the gun's military uses before parts were
delivered to Saddam Hussein's regime.
Mr Major also dismissed criticism of the way ministers handled the Gulf war
campaign a year ago, describing it as 'one of the most successful military
operations ever undertaken in this country or elsewhere.' The campaign
'achieved its objectives more swiftly and with less bloodshed than anybody
could possibly imagine,' he said.
His comments follow the embarrassing disclosure of an internal armed
services report strongly criticising interference by ministers in the
conduct of Britain's role in the campaign. The report says that the
government showed 'a preoccupation with money and politics', 'excessive
ministerial influence', and 'a frustrating loss of cohesion.'
Mr Winnick called for 'a full and frank ministerial statement, which in fact
should come from the prime minister, of what was known inside the government
at the time over the supergun affair'.
He also referred to 'military items sold to Iraq right up to the invasion of
Kuwait'.
Mr Major will seek to intensify work on the Citizen's Charter, set to be a
important part of the Conservative election manifesto, at a Downing Street
summit today.
Most cabinet ministers have been asked to report on progress made in
implementing the package of proposals for improving public services unveiled
by the prime minister last July.
Mr Major will outline in a speech on January 27 how he sees the programme
developing.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory councils favoured, says Gould
 -Local Government Funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, environment secretary, has rigged the allocation of
government grants to councils for 'naked party political advantage', Labour
said yesterday.
Tory shire councils are receiving bigger increases than Labour authorities
in revenue support grant, said Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary.
Higher grants will feed through into lower poll tax bills for 1992-93.
Mr Gould's complaint, amid the continuing phoney election war at
Westminster, marked Labour's determination to raise poll tax as a political
issue.
Mr Gould said a general election on April 9 would coincide with the sending
out of poll tax bills - at least from Labour authorities.
Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, accused Labour of
'ludicrous' claims, pointing out that its figures covered only shires. The
three biggest grants went to non-Tory authorities, he said.
Mr Gould said the 'special help' given to Conservative-controlled Wandsworth
and Westminster councils had been 'an open scandal' for years. Mr Heseltine
was also allocating much of his inner-city and housing budgets 'on his
personal whim'.
The latest figures showed 'that the whole grants system has been rigged'.
A report by the Labour-dominated Local Government Information Unit compares
the standard spending assessments (SSAs) set by ministers for each local
authority according to a complex formula taking account of local needs.
On average, SSAs for Tory authorities will rise by 5.67 per cent in 1992-93,
the report says. Councils under independent or no overall control will see a
rise of 5.33 per cent.
Councils controlled by the Liberal Democrats will get 4.87 per cent and
Labour councils 3.92 per cent.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Electricity companies attacked over
pricing - Utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISED electricity companies were accused in the Commons last night of
overcharging their customers by 'a staggering' Pounds 93.5m.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs identified Norweb,
which covers the north-west, as the worst offender when leading Labour's
unsuccessful attempts to insert provisions in the Competition and Service
(Utilities) Bill for improved consumer safeguards.
He said the consumer bodies for the water and telecommunications industries
were ineffective and urged the government to make the consumer protection
arrangements in the gas industry the model for all the privatised utilities.
He said the consumer bodies in the electricity sector were too closely
associated with the Office of Electricity Regulation and often resembled
'toothless watchdogs' unable to command action.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, rejected Labour's view that
there should be a clear distinction between consumer bodies and the
regulator for the utility concerned. He said: 'In order to have effective
regulation you have to have one person or one body which can make a
decision.'
Commenting on the performance of the privatised electricity companies, Mr
Redwood acknowledged that they had done well 'against the background of firm
price regulation and control'. He expressed full confidence in the ability
of all the regulators to settle complaints on the basis of fair judgment.
The Bill was given an unopposed third reading and now goes to the House of
Lords.
The separation of the British Gas pipe network from its sales and marketing
operations and creation of regional gas companies by the end of the decade,
were proposed yesterday by the Liberal Democrats.
Legislation forcing British Gas to lose 60 per cent of its industrial market
share by 1997 was also suggested by Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment
spokesman. The pipe network would form a new privately owned company.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major says Labour 'in a shambles'
over plans - Opposition proposals to end the National Insurance
contributions ceiling have given the Tories an unexpected opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, accused Labour of being 'in a shambles'
over its tax plans yesterday, as the government sought to capitalise on the
uncertainty over the timing of Opposition plans to abolish the ceiling on
National Insurance contributions.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, might be considered 'a tax dodger' on
policy rather than personal matters, Mr Major added, during heated exchanges
which were dominated by economic issues.
Labour, for its part, preferred to concentrate on unemployment, with Mr
Kinnock claiming that Mr Major's record in this particular area was 'even
worse' than his predecessor's.
Why was the government not prepared to do anything useful to stop the
'remorseless' rise in unemployment, Mr Kinnock asked.
Unemployment had climbed by nearly 1m during Mr Major's time as chancellor
of the exchequer and then prime minister, he added.
Mr Norman Lamont, the present chancellor, joined in the assault on Labour's
tax intentions, calling on the party to clarify its own mind about its plans
for National Insurance.
There was nothing wrong with 'massive increases in public expenditure',
provided the party advocating them was open in admitting it planned 'massive
increases in tax to fund them', he said.
The chancellor also branded the contributions 'the tax on middle managers'.
Mr Patrick Nicholls, Conservative MP for Teignbridge, chose to highlight a
different aspect of Labour's National Insurance policy, calling on Mr Major
to confirm that it would 'actually punish anyone who earned Pounds 390 in a
single week'.
Labour's proposals would impose 'a massive tax burden' on 4m ordinary
people, he maintained.
The prime minister joined in by suggesting that Labour 'simply did not
understand that point when they drew up their policy'. Under Labour,
everyone would 'pay more National Insurance contributions in a single week
if they earned above 1/52nd of the statutory upper earnings limit', he said.
He cited newspaper reports stating that Labour's tax plans would represent
'the largest ever peacetime tax increase'.
Labour had 'promised explicitly that anyone earning less than Pounds 21,000
a year would not pay a penny extra in income tax or National Insurance', he
said.
That was clearly 'wrong' and Labour should 'admit that and do so publicly'.
In his earlier remarks, Mr Major had claimed Labour's 'muddled statements'
showed that 'you cannot trust them on tax'.
He added: 'They shift their position from day to day. The only thing that is
certain is that a party that promises to spend and spend is a party that
would have to tax and tax.'
These remarks followed a question from Mr Gwilym Jones, Tory MP for Cardiff
North, in which he suggested that it was 'the height of irresponsibility'
for Labour to 'pretend you can have massive increases in spending from day
one of a government' while merely phasing in the necessary tax increases.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock ponders dilemma of an
illogical 'tax'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE confusion in the Labour party over the timing of its plan to restructure
National Insurance contributions could not be more painfully ironic for Mr
Neil Kinnock.
It has underlined how a proposal conceived nearly four years ago to
demonstrate that the party's public spending plans would be prudently
financed is now regarded as a serious threat to Mr Kinnock's general
election prospects.
No one can argue that the plan to abolish the ceiling on National Insurance
contributions is an example of unreconstructed socialism.
One of the principal - if undeclared - critics of the system under which
employees pay 9 per cent of their earnings up to Pounds 20,280 a year and
then nothing after that was Mr Nigel Lawson.
The former chancellor saw the illogicality of a tax - and, despite the
notional distinction with income tax, that is how the Treasury regards the
contributions - which is progressive most of the way up the income scale and
then becomes regressive.
The system means that, when income tax and National Insurance contributions
are taken together, someone earning say, Pounds 40,000 a year, starts off
with an combined effective tax rate of 34p in the pound. That rate then
drops to 25p after the National Insurance ceiling is reached, jumping again
to 40p when the top rate income tax threshold is reached at Pounds 23,700 of
taxable (or between Pounds 27,000 and Pounds 30,000 of gross) earnings.
Mr Lawson wanted to abolish the ceiling in his 1988 Budget, offsetting the
change with the reductions in the top and basic rates of income tax which he
eventually announced.
But after exhaustive pre-Budget studies, Mr Lawson changed his mind. His
reasoning was precisely the same as that behind the present confusion in the
Labour party: the Treasury told him that he could not avoid creating losers
across a swathe of middle-to-high-income earners in southern England.
But for Labour the change had a strong attraction. Abolition offered the
prospect of demonstrating how it would fund its key spending pledges without
raising the tax burden on the vast majority of taxpayers.
A transfer from higher-income brackets - both from National Insurance
contribution payments and the party's commitment to increase the top rate of
tax - to pay for higher pensions and child benefit could be presented as a
discrete package.
Other spending commitments would be less firm. Labour would pledge to pay
for the fruits of economic growth and by forgoing future tax cuts. That was
how the position was generally understood until this week.
But the intensification of the election campaign and the concentrated
Conservative attack on Labour's tax and spending policies have reminded Mr
Kinnock just why Mr Lawson dropped the baton.
Around 3m employees and 0.4m self-employed would be worse off if the ceiling
were abolished.
That represents some 14 per cent of all taxpayers. Others whose incomes move
over the weekly National Insurance contributions threshold only occasionally
would also face higher bills.
But much more alarming for Labour was the growing understanding that in
London and the south-east, where Pounds 20,000 a year is not much higher
than the average income, there would be a much deeper concentration of
losers.
In some areas well over a third of employed households would be affected.
Those households are in the constituencies - such as Dulwich, Slough and
Battersea - that Labour must win if it is to form a government.
Put simply, Pounds 20,000 a year does not seem a lot of money in much of the
south-east.
The average male white-collar worker in London earns closer to Pounds 25,000
and would be nearly Pounds 7 a week worse off under the change.
So this week Mr Kinnock let it be known that the child benefit and pension
pledges could be comfortably funded if the change were phased in rather than
announced in Labour's first Budget.
There was talk also of the compensating gains from child benefit and,
perhaps, from a lower starting rate of income tax that those just above the
threshold might expect.
It was not a complete U-turn. Mr Kinnock could argue that his party's policy
documents had consistently stated that big changes would be phased in to
avoid wrecking family budgets.
And no-one could find a specific commitment to abolish the National
Insurance contributions ceiling immediately.
But, in private at least, senior members of the party admit that the
possibility of phasing was being raised now only because of the heightened
appreciation of the electoral threat. Previously Labour had never challenged
the general assumption of a one-off change.
Some of Mr Kinnock's colleagues were arguing last night that if the timing
of the change of heart had looked awkward and defensive, it was better that
it came sooner rather than later.
But as the Conservatives plan a new onslaught on Labour's spending pledges
it is the government rather than the Opposition which has the initiative.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs demand new watchdog - City
Regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faced calls from two of its senior backbenchers for improved
City regulation yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr Anthony Beaumont-Dark, MP for Birmingham Selly Oak and a long-standing
member of the Commons treasury and Civil Service committee, called on the
government to consider setting up a body such as the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the US.
The recent string of large corporate collapses showed that self-regulation
was proving to be 'somewhat less than satisfactory', he said. Under a system
of self-regulation, those involved 'tend to protect each other so they don't
get caught'.
He was supported by Sir Peter Tapsell, MP for Lindsey East, who was a
managing partner of James Capel, the stockbroker, for 30 years.
For the government, Ms Gillian Shephard, a junior Treasury minister, said
the recent collapses did not mean that the City was riddled with fraud or
that the regulatory system had failed. The present government had done 'more
than any other' to tighten City regulation, she said.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Home Office considers poll tax case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Home Office was yesterday considering issues raised by the adjournment
of nearly 2,500 cases of alleged poll tax default at Camberwell Magistrates'
Court in London after a magistrate ruled it would 'not be appropriate' to
hear them until the issue of the acceptability of computer-based payment
records had been resolved.
The new cases, coming a day after magistrates in Liverpool postponed for two
weeks more than 200 cases of alleged non-payment of the community charge,
have raised speculation that doubt over computer-based evidence may render
past prosecutions invalid.
But the Home Office said there was no reason for local councils to stop
taking community charge cases to court if the local authorities were able to
prove the debt had not been paid.
'Although it is not for the Home Office to interpret the law,' the
department said in a statement last night, 'we have no reason to suppose
that computer-generated records are not admissible in civil proceedings, in
accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act 1938.
'The Home Office is urgently looking into the issues raised in a recent case
to consider whether any action is required.'

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith defends flexible Budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WISE CHANCELLORS left themselves flexibility for Budgets, Mr John Smith,
shadow chancellor, insisted yesterday as he brushed aside renewed Tory
claims that Labour's tax plans did not add up.
The Tories' focus on the difficulties of phasing the removal of the ceiling
on National Insurance contributions while retaining immediate spending
commitments seemed, however, to disregard some Labour tax options which have
themselves featured in Tory attacks.
In previous discussions of Labour's tax plans, the introduction of a 50 per
cent top tax rate for those on 'well over Pounds 30,000' and removal of the
ceiling on National Insurance contributions have been linked with the two
firm spending pledges on pensions and child benefit. Labour itself, however,
has never been committed to that direct link.
How much would a Labour chancellor have to raise by tax changes? On the
minimalist approach, the party is firmly committed only to raising the
retirement pension by Pounds 5 a week for a single pensioner, and by Pounds
8 a week for a couple; and to increase child benefit - from April, were
Labour then in power - to Pounds 9.95 a week.
Both the government and the Opposition estimate that these would cost about
Pounds 3.5bn.
Beyond this, Labour says that extra spending in areas such as health and
education will be funded from growth.
How could a Labour chancellor raise the money to meet the Pounds 3.5bn
welfare commitments? The Opposition Treasury team says it cannot be definite
about its plans, not least because Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has not
said what he will do in the Budget.
It stresses, for example, that a Pounds 600m cut in the public sector
borrowing requirement because of the delay in the start of Taurus, the Stock
Exchange's paperless trading, might remain to assist them, just as Pounds
400m of the Pounds 1bn gained helped Mr Lamont temporarily raise the
threshold for house-purchase stamp duty.
As for Labour's own plans, the government estimates that just over Pounds
2.6bn would be raised in the first year from abolishing the National
Insurance ceiling. But raising the ceiling to Pounds 30,000, which might be
one way of phasing in the change, would still yield about Pounds 575m in
1992-93.
Introducing a tax band of 45 per cent on taxable income between Pounds
30,200 and Pounds 36,700, and a top rate of 50 per cent on a taxable income
above Pounds 36,700, would yield about Pounds 2bn in a full year at 1991-92
income levels, according to the Treasury.
Limiting all tax allowances and reliefs to the basic rate would yield about
Pounds 2.2bn at 1991-92 levels of income. If the basic personal allowance
were exempted from this, the yield would be about Pounds 900m.
Bringing in a 9 per cent tax on investment income over Pounds 3,000 for
non-pensioners is estimated by the Treasury to produce Pounds 870m in a full
year on 1991-92 income levels.
Labour itself believes that its commitment to freezing the married couples'
allowance and abolishing tax relief on private medical insurance would yield
about Pounds 170m and Pounds 60m respectively.
Mr Smith protests not unreasonably, that Labour has been clearer about its
tax plans than ministers have been about the Budget. But his options in
phasing any of these tax plans would still produce a wide field for
speculation in the weeks before a first Smith Budget.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Unemployment rises to 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNEMPLOYMENT rate rose to a four-year high of 9 per cent in December
from 8.8 per cent the previous month.
Last month's increase of 31,100 in the seasonally adjusted figure - the
twenty-first successive monthly increase - took the total number of
unemployed to 2.55m, a peak last reached in December 1987. The total rise in
unemployment last year was 704,000.
December's increase followed a revised rise of 40,800 in November, and
brought the average rise in unemployment over the past six months to 41,000.
In the six months to June last year the average monthly rise was 76,300.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said the figures showed that the
rate of increase in unemployment had eased. 'December's rise in seasonally
adjusted unemployment is, with just one exception, the smallest for 15
months,' he said. He also drew comfort from figures indicating a rise of
14,000 in the number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres in December
compared with the previous month. In the three months to December,
seasonally adjusted vacancies increased on average by 5,700 per month.
Labour said the figures were further evidence that the economy was showing
no signs of recovery. 'Not merely has Britain had the fastest-rising
unemployment in Europe over the past year, but we have today the highest
level of unemployment of any country in Europe except Spain and Ireland,'
said Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary.
Figures for the third quarter of last year showed that the number of people
employed in manufacturing industry had fallen by 88,000 compared with the
previous quarter, and by 96,000 in service industries.
At the same time the rise in average earnings in the year to November was
7.5 per cent, unchanged from October, and dashing hopes for a drop below 7
per cent.
The rate of increase of average earnings has been falling since it reached a
peak of 10.25 per cent in July 1990 but has not yet dropped below 7.5 per
cent, the lowest annual rate recorded in the 1980s, in spite of the
recession.
The Department of Employment said the rate of increase in the average
earnings index was likely to drop below 7.5 per cent when November wage
settlements, many of which were significantly below 1990 levels, fed through
into the December index.
The areas worst hit by unemployment included the south-east, where there was
a 0.2 percentage point increase on the previous month, bringing the rate of
unemployment to 8.1 per cent, and the south-west, where a 0.2 point increase
brought the rate up to 8.4 per cent.
Regionally the highest rates of unemployment were in Northern Ireland, the
north of England and the north-west, where rates were higher than the
national average. Greater London had an unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent.
Britain experienced the second-highest rate of unemployment among
industrialised countries in December compared with a year ago, second only
to Finland. Alfred Marks, the employment agency, said its year-on-year
figures for job vacancies showed that the London suburbs were the worst-hit,
experiencing a 66 per cent drop in vacancies. Central London suffered a drop
of 64 per cent.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): British Airways seeks single-union
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is seeking a single-union deal for the maintenance base it
is building for Boeing 747 Jumbo jets at Cardiff Airport.
The company said yesterday it had been talking to a number of unions but 'a
decision is not yet imminent'. The unions include the AEU engineering union,
thought to be the front-runner, and the TGWU and GMB general unions.
BA is to move all maintenance work in the UK on its Jumbo fleet from
London's Heathrow Airport to Cardiff next year. The company is building a
Pounds 70m plant which will employ 1,200 people and is on target to open in
April next year.
The AEU has already signed several single-union deals in Wales including one
with Sony when the Japanese company set up its television plant at Bridgend
in 1974.
BA is expected to start recruiting staff towards the end of this year and
would want to have the union agreement in place by then.
For the past 20 years unions in Wales have taken a progressive attitude
towards single-union deals. Mr Simon Jones, research officer of the Welsh
TUC, said in Cardiff yesterday: 'Nearly all the big inward investment
projects on greenfield sites in Wales are now single-union agreements. Wales
is further ahead in this area than any other part of Britain.' Other
single-union deals have been concluded by Toyota at its engine plant on
Deeside, and at Hoya Lens and Continental Can, both based in Wrexham, Clwyd.
A police sergeant yesterday told an industrial tribunal he was overlooked
for promotion four times because of his colour.
Sgt Raham Khan, 36, a policeman for 16 years, said he was ignored in favour
of less experienced and less qualified candidates. Mr Rodney Ferm, for
Pakistan-born Sgt Khan, told the Leeds hearing the officer had never been
racially abused during his career in the West Yorkshire force.
West Yorkshire Police deny racial discrimination.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Radical change proposed to councils'
pay bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities are being asked to consider a radical change to national
pay bargaining arrangements under which they would gain far greater leeway
in determining increases for groups of workers.
In a suggested 'kitty bargaining' arrangement, national negotiators would
agree on a percentage addition to the pay bill to which each authority would
then be committed. The distribution of the kitty would be determined
locally.
That would allow authorities to link the size of increases to individual
performance. There would no longer be national pay scales or rates.
The proposal is one of three options suggested by the Local Government
Management Board, the body which advises councils on training, pay and
conditions, and by associations of local authorities in a consultation paper
being sent to individual councils.
Its second option is 'two-tier settlements' under which national scales and
rates continue but only some of the available money goes to increase these,
with the remainder distributed locally.
The third option is to keep the current bargaining system under which
national negotiators determine pay scales and rates. 'The existing employer
strategy would continue of taking opportunities to slim down national
agreements.'
The 'kitty bargaining' proposal comes when all public-sector managements are
being urged to introduce more flexible pay systems under the government's
Citizen's Charter.
The proposal has already been attacked by unions, particularly those
representing white-collar workers who have strongly opposed the
fragmentation of national pay structures.
Mr Dennis Reed, national officer for the Nalgo public service union, pointed
out yesterday that more modest proposals for increasing local flexibility
were abandoned by councils in 1989 after a series of strikes. He predicted
there would be little enthusiasm among councils for 'kitty bargaining' or
for the two-tier settlements formula.
The consultation paper says that if there was a consensus among authorities
for radical changes, any reforms would need to be delivered over a number of
years to allow preparations for adjustment.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Single engineering sector body backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREATION of a single body to act as a focus for the UK's fragmented
engineering profession has come a step closer after most engineering
institutions had backed the formation of a steering group.
The decision was taken at a meeting in London on Wednesday of 41 presidents
or deputy presidents from the 46 engineering institutions. The steering
group will investigate the planned body's role and responsibilities, and
report back next year.
The move is the latest stage in an initiative launched in November by Sir
John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council, the institutions'
umbrella body.
The plan, endorsed by the council, aims to increase the profession's status
and influence through a new body which would set standards of performance
and conduct, represent the profession on important issues, and provide an
operating framework for engineering institutions.
The initiative represents an attempt to accelerate the trend towards
unification in the profession. Many engineers believe the creation of a
federal structure is more feasible than mergers between individual
institutions, which have traditionally proved difficult to achieve.
Sir John said the profession needed more influence on big issues such as
relations with the government, education and training.
He said the new body could bring the institutions together in a more unified
structure, with the Engineering Council being subsumed within it to complete
the unification. It would cover only those activities that were best
undertaken at the centre.
The specialist knowledge of engineering disciplines in the institutions
should be developed and maintained within the individual institutions, he
said. These should retain their identities within the new body if they
chose.
One of the steering group's first tasks will be to appoint a 'roving
diplomat' to examine the attitudes of institutions and members, look at
alternatives and make proposals.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Apex to apply for an administrator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the Apex Trust, the organisation that provides training for
ex-offenders, last night announced that it would apply for a court order to
appoint an administrator. The move came after the government ruled out any
financial help for Apex.
The board said it had decided to apply for an administrator from Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte 'in the absence of a positive response from the
government'. Yesterday the Labour party released figures showing that
specialist provision for offender training fell by 57 per cent last year.
Mr Barry Sheerman, a Labour home affairs spokesman, said yesterday that at
the beginning of last year Apex Trust and Nacro, the two main providers of
specialist training for offenders, ran 95 centres for 15,000 trainees. Since
April, cuts in the employment training budget and a revised system of fund
allocation through Training and Enterprise Councils had resulted in the
number of centres being reduced to 48 and the number of trainee places to
6,400.
Mr Sherman said Apex Trust research had shown that ex-offenders in
employment were three times less likely to re-offend than those unemployed.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said on BBC Radio yesterday: 'We
can't write blank cheques, and we can't keep writing cheques for money when
an organisation keeps coming back for more.'
He added that there were other bodies providing training for ex-offenders
and that training would still be available if the trust collapsed.
Twelve companies which have sponsored Apex in recent years are meeting today
at BT's London headquarters in an effort to save the charity. Several
leading employers and customers in the construction industry have expressed
concern that self-employment is leading to a decline in the number of
adequately trained people, according to a report from the National Economic
Development Council's construction group.
The report recommends a qualifications-based operative registration scheme.
It expects skill shortages to re-emerge when the recession ends and also
suggests poor training is a cause of the industry's poor safety record.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Watchdog plays down Wakeham gas-price pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Gas Supply (Ofgas), the industry regulator, yesterday played
down assurances British Gas said it had received from Mr John Wakeham,
energy secretary, that could enable it to raise domestic prices.
Mr Wakeham's assurances encouraged British Gas to agree on Wednesday to
sweeping changes to its industrial gas business proposed by the Office of
Fair Trading. The OFT proposals include halving the British Gas share of the
industrial market to 40 per cent and shifting its pipeline business to a
different company.
But Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, said yesterday that Mr
Wakeham had no influence over customer prices. Sir James said the pricing
formula that sets customer prices is 'nothing to do with government unless
the law is changed'.
Sir James has agreed to review the new formula on domestic prices for the
next five years in view of the changes to British Gas's business brought
about by the OFT proposals. The formula will come into force in April.
British Gas believes it has a strong case for revising this formula, which
limits price increases to five percentage points below the rate of
inflation. But although Sir James has said he will look at the formula, he
has not agreed to make specific changes. He rejects the idea of allowing the
company to push up domestic prices to compensate for the loss of industrial
business.
Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, said on Wednesday that Mr Wakeham had
given him assurances that the review of the tariff formula would be fair to
everyone. Mr Evans said the company could call on the energy secretary's
assurances if Ofgas would not permit a price rise.
British Gas wanted to secure the right of appeal on pricing to a higher
authority before agreeing to the OFT's proposals. The OFT had threatened to
refer the company to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if it had not
agreed to the proposals by yesterday.
A pricing review would take many months, and Mr Wakeham may have left office
before it is complete. He is standing down at the general election. The
Department of Energy said yesterday that the regulator should be fully
independent in pricing matters. That leaves British Gas with little room to
manoeuvre on domestic prices.
The City remained un-decided yesterday. Shares had gone up 4 per cent in
value on Wednesday on relief that British Gas had avoided an MMC
investigation. But the market lost its confidence yesterday, and British Gas
shares fell 2 1/2 p to close at 242 1/2 p.
'It is difficult to see much growth in the UK gas business in coming years,'
said Mr Ian Graham, a stockbroker at County NatWest in Edinburgh. 'The
company's growth will have to come from its global gas business and its
exploration and production division, which is riskier.'

FT  17 JAN 92 / Output of cars falls by 4.5% to 1.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR production in the UK fell by 4.5 per cent last year from 1,295,610 to
1,236,922, according to figures from the Central Statistical Office and
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It was the second successive
annual decline.
Car output in December fell by 13.9 per cent, the fifth successive sharp
monthly fall.
In spite of the deep recession in the domestic market for new cars, output
was sustained earlier in the year by a big rise in production for export.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, car production in the six months to the end
of December was 13 per cent lower than in the previous 6 months and 16 per
cent lower than in the same six months a year ago.
Car output in December was 79,034 against 91,833 in the corresponding month
a year ago. UK car output reached a low point of 888,000 in 1982, but
recovered in the second half of the 1980s to peak at 1,299,082 in 1989.
Car production for export markets jumped last year by 49.2 per cent to
605,425, while output for the domestic market dropped by 29 per cent to
631,497. Production for export fell, however, in December, the third
successive monthly year-on-year fall.
Commercial vehicle output fell by 19.7 per cent last year from 270,346 to
217,107. Output has fallen by 33.5 per cent in two years from 326,590 in
1989.
The UK motor industry trade deficit fell to around Pounds 1.5bn last year
from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990 and a peak of Pounds 6.6bn in 1989, said the
society. The improvement has been brought about both by the recession, which
has sharply depressed imports of new cars and commercial vehicles, and by
strong performance in export markets.

FT  17 JAN 92 / CBI wants Budget lift for investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES in investment allowances to help industry, rather than cuts in
income tax, should be the priority in the Budget, the Confederation of
British Industry said yesterday.
In a report to be sent to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, the CBI said
recent declines in investment had put UK businesses at a disadvantage
against overseas competitors.
The CBI wants Mr Lamont to raise investment allowances for plant and
machinery from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.
It said introduction of the new allowances would cost the Treasury Pounds
1.05bn in 1993-94 and increase public-sector borrowing when the government's
finances are under strain.
Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said: 'Our proposals are designed to
put the economy in a position where it can afford tax cuts.'
Other measures advocated in the report include:
Shelving the introduction this autumn of monthly rather than quarterly
collection of value-added tax from 1,600 large companies.
Ending the double taxation of profits from overseas operations through
advance corporation tax.
Speeding up payment of financial benefits for companies which stand to gain
from introduction of the uniform business rate.
Provision of 100 per cent relief for business assets from inheritance tax.
Stepping up investment on training and transport.
If the Treasury took up all the CBI's suggestions, the total cost to the
taxpayer would be Pounds 1.76bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 1.63bn the following
year.
Ian Hamilton Fazey writes: the CBI's Yorkshire and Humberside regional
council reported yesterday that business confidence had dipped further, with
many companies saying there would be no economic upturn before the second
half of the year.
Mr Peter Barker, regional chairman and chief executive of Fenner, a
Humberside industrial belting company, said many companies were having
trouble getting credit or finance. Half of the members were expecting to
shed more jobs. He called for a Budget to encourage investment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REACTION AMONG US-based Names to the Lloyd's reform package remained
tentative yesterday. Many stressed that they needed to read the entire
document and were basing their limited comments on newspaper reports. If a
prevailing sentiment could be gleaned, it was that the proposed measures had
come at least a decade too late.
Mr Dale Jenkins, one of the US Names involved in legal action against
Lloyd's, said: 'They're trying to rectify the mistakes of the past. Too bad
they didn't do it earlier.'
He added that even with the proposed changes, Lloyd's would have limitations
as an investment vehicle. 'There needs to be a complete housekeeping of the
management there,' he said.
Mr Dale Schreiber, an attorney at New York law firm Proskauer Rose Goez &amp;
Mendelsohn, which is bringing a lawsuit against Lloyd's on behalf of more
than 60 Names, said that the firm needed to study the report and was
unlikely to take a view for several days.
Some US Names did welcome the suggestion that they should have access to
syndicate information, a say in big transactions and certain other rights.
From Albany, Dr Joel Spiro, another Name involved in the Proskauer Rose
lawsuit, said: 'I would agree in principle that there should be access to
financial information and meetings'
There are more than 2,000 Lloyd's Names in the US, a fairly small proportion
of the total of 26,500 Names. However, they have historically committed
relatively large amounts of capital to the market.
Therefore the legal battles in the US could carry particularly damaging
implications for the insurance institution.

The Bank of England reported that long-term investors such as pension funds,
insurance companies and investment, unit and property unit trusts bought a

FT  17 JAN 92 / Rise seen in water pollution incidents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of water pollution incidents rose in seven of the 10 regions of
England and Wales between 1988 and 1990, according to a report from the
National Rivers Authority, leaked by Friends of the Earth, the environmental
pressure group, yesterday.
However, in the same period there was an overall drop of 3.5 per cent in
pollution incidents from 26,926 to 25,983.
The rivers watchdog said that Friends of the Earth had obtained an early
draft of the report on the regions run by the privatised water companies.
The final version, to be published later this month, would show entirely
different figures. The draft report says the overall decrease was accounted
for by a 55 per fall in cases reported in the Thames Water region.
Without the decline reported for the Thames region, the national trend would
be a 55 per cent increase in incidents. The other areas with a drop were
Yorkshire and Wessex.

<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, is asking financial, insurance and legal
companies to provide vocational training for 1,000 people from the former
Soviet Union for between six months and a year, Peter Norman writes.
The Treasury announced yesterday that the government will organise and fund
the administration of the scheme in association with the British Council, at
a cost of about Pounds 8m.
The move follows a plea by Mr Lamont to City companies last October to take
personnel from the former Soviet Union into their offices so that they could
learn about the workings of a market economy with a modern financial centre.
The move was welcomed by Sir John Banham, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry. He said yesterday that the CBI and the
British Council had helped provide training for 60 managers from industrial
companies in the former communist states of Europe and was in the process of
placing a further 400 to 500 in training schemes this year.

A LISTED Regency villa in Regent's Park, London, has been put up for sale

Australian financier, 18 months ago, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The 12,300 sq ft Grade 1 listed building, built in 1824 by Decimus Burton,
has four acres of private parkland. Mr Holmes a Court bought the villa in
1986 for Pounds 8m, spent two years renovating it and used it as a base for
his international investment operations.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the agents, said Mrs Janet Holmes a Court is selling
the building because she spends less time in London than did her husband.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Barriers to investment abroad highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE tax rates in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development tend to discourage cross-border investment,
according to a survey published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
The study says this leaves companies vulnerable to the effects of inflation
by favouring debt finance over equity or retained earnings.
The analysis also shows that the average rate of corporate tax in the UK is
the 10th highest among the 24 countries of the OECD.
The study shows that across member states it is substantially less
attractive for companies to invest abroad than domestically.
The overall average transnational rate of return before tax is 5.9 per cent
for domestic investment. That compares with 7.5 per cent both for countries
in one state investing abroad and for foreign companies investing in the
typical OECD country.
A separate part of the analysis shows that when the real interest rate is 5
per cent across OECD member states, the rate of return required before
corporate taxes to persuade someone to invest in a business enterprise would
be 5.9 per cent. This ignores personal taxes, and assumes average inflation
at 4.5 per cent and average weightings on the different sources of finance.
The figures reflect all corporate taxes and take into account available
deductions.
Turkey has the highest required rate of return at 7.2 per cent. Greece and
Sweden are lowest at 5 per cent; the UK is in the middle, at 5.9 per cent.
The required rate of return on debt - an average 2.8 per cent across all
countries - makes it preferable to new equity (at 6.1 per cent) and retained
earnings (7.9 per cent).

FT  17 JAN 92 / Move to delay plan for fixed legal-aid fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society is to press the government to postpone the introduction of
fixed fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts until the
issue has been examined by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.
The commission, set up last year after the release of the Birmingham Six,
has invited the society to submit evidence. It told the society it would be
'very concerned if the consequences of the proposed arrangements (for fixed
fees) were to do damage to the criminal justice system'.
Mr Philip Ely, society president, said at a meeting in London yesterday of
leaders of the 127 local law societies in England and Wales that standard
fees for criminal legal-aid work - regardless of the complexity of the case
or the time spent on it by a solicitor - could make the criminal legal-aid
system collapse.
Mr Robert Winstanley, a member of the society's governing council, told the
meeting that the government's proposals amounted to 'a capping of resources
available to the defence'.
He explained that few solicitors would continue to do work worth Pounds 333
 -the current upper fee limit for a not-guilty plea in a magistrates' court
 -when the standard fee was fixed at Pounds 162.
The proposal would add significantly to the present imbalance between
resources available to the prosecution and the defence. This, he said, had
been a significant factor in miscarriages of justice in such cases as those
of the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and Tottenham Three. 'What is the
point of the Royal Commission reporting in two years' time if standard fees
have by then further increased this imbalance.'
Solicitors say standard fees, coupled with the government's offer of a 1 per
cent increase in legal-aid pay rates from April, will amount to a heavy cut
in real terms in their income from work which is already barely profitable.
Solicitors in Southampton protested last autumn by withdrawing from the
provision of emergency cover at police stations and magistrates' courts.
Solicitors in Devon and Cornwall have threatened to follow suit. Lord
Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has agreed to attend a special meeting of the
society on February 12.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Prospects of talks on Ulster recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS of 'round-table' talks on Northern Ireland taking place before
the general election receded sharply last night as the Northern Ireland
Office said that, in spite of discussions with local leaders, 'we are not
moving forward'.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, met the nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party yesterday to discuss how to overcome the biggest
obstacle remaining - whether talks could continue if interrupted by a
general election.
Mr Brooke is expected to meet Mr Gerry Collins, the Irish Republic's foreign
minister, today to discuss possible ways forward.
Meetings with Unionists are likely next week. The Northern Ireland Office
said the chances of making progress were 'receding . . . but it would be
wrong to stop at this point'.
Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, objects to the Unionists' insistance that they
could not necessarily continue talks if a Labour government were elected. He
says that represents an additional 'pre-condition'.
His party says talks should take place on the same basis as those last
summer, when Mr Brooke succeeded in bringing the main parties to the
negotiating table but failed to reach any agreement on Northern Ireland's
political future. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is excluded from
the talks.
The imminence of the general election has altered the political atmosphere
in Northern Ireland. Unionists object to Labour's policy of Irish
unification by consent. Although officially it is denied, some Unionists may
also be hoping to hold the balance of power after the general election.
Mr Brooke had hoped for a meeting with all the province's political leaders
this week but that plan appears to have been shelved. The talks he envisages
would start with internal government in the province before considering
relations between north and south Ireland and between London and Dublin.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Names at odds over stewards' inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ONE doesn't mind going to the races, having a flutter on a horse, and
losing one's money. But one does mind if the horse has been doped,' a
Lloyd's Name said yesterday.
This was a typical reaction. Names generally have reacted positively to the
task force's plans, but resentment continues at the big losses they are
likely to incur as the result of unforeseen claims, particularly on
pollution.
Many Names say that the proposals to allow 'open years' to remain open could
act to stop dissatisfied Names from leaving.
Some were optimistic. Mr David White, a Name and managing director of
discount house Cater Allen, said he thought the cap on liability was of
great psychological importance, and he expected it to tempt many new Names
on to the market.
Mr Clive Scott-Hopkins, a Name who also acts as a financial adviser to other
Names via Towry Law, said that existing members would be tempted to reduce
their level of underwriting. He added: 'I wonder whether a 0.25 per cent fee
is going to be enough, with these unquantifiable pollution claims.
Personally I would be happy to pay 0.5 per cent.'
Mr Scott-Hopkins also foresaw a conflict between working and non-working
Names.
But many Names have not had enough time to study the report in full. The
Association of Lloyd's Names reported that reaction had so far been limited
but positive. It suggested stronger reaction was unlikely until after
Lloyd's had completed its series of worldwide briefings on the report.
Names involved in the Feltrim syndicate, which has suffered big losses, gave
a muted response, but are likely to study the report hard for signs of
implicit support for their position.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Wide consultations set to slow change: Reforms At Lloyd's
Insurance Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS at the Corporation of Lloyd's were yesterday grappling with the
practicalities of implementing reforms at the insurance market in the wake
of acceptance by Lloyd's of the task force recommendations. They are
admitting that the pace of change could be slow.
According to an insider at the corporation, which provides regulatory and
market support services to the Lloyd's market, the need for wide
consultation among the corporation's various committees, departments and
market associations will slow change.
'This one will run and run - it's a market,' he stressed. 'We haven't got a
chief executive who can simply order five heads of department to get on with
it.'
The conclusions of the task force's 12-month investigation into business
practices at Lloyd's were published on Wednesday and recommend a programme
of short-term measures - which can be introduced relatively easily by
Lloyd's - and longer-term changes which require modifications of the Lloyd's
Act, the legislation which outlines the way Lloyd's is regulated.
Lloyd's Council identified six priority areas for action when it met last
weekend: A high-level compulsory stop-loss scheme to limit the losses of
Names, the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's.
Drafting of a Names' charter outlining the rights of Names which would allow
them to veto big transactions and hold annual meetings of the syndicates
into which they are grouped.
The formation of members' agents pooling arrangements (Mapas), the vehicles
which will allow Names to spread their investments in syndicates more widely
in order to reduce the risk of heavy losses.
The drafting of new guidelines outlining best practice for Lloyd's agents
including provisions stipulating more disclosure of fees and expenses.
Ways in which CentreWrite, the reinsurance company owned by the corporation,
could reinsure the open years of individual Names rather than syndicates as
at present. Syndicates leave years open when they are unable to settle
accounts because of uncertainty over future claims.
The introduction of limited liability capital into Lloyd's, initially via
more flexible co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Call to protect BA from US competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS should be pro-tected from increasing competition from US
airlines in Europe until the US aviation market is opened up to foreign
carriers, according to an MPs' report published yesterday.
The report will be welcomed by BA, which has become increasingly critical of
the government's policy of allowing US airlines greater access to British
airports.
The study by the Commons transport committee says that further moves to open
up the UK market should be tied to moves to allow BA cabotage rights in the
US. Cabotage allows an airline based in one country to operate domestic
services in another country. BA has also pressed the US to ease restrictions
on foreign ownership of American airlines.
The committee calls on the government to maintain restrictions on landing
rights at London airports as a bargaining counter in future talks with the
US authorities. It says: 'These are early days in the new battle for
transatlantic market share and we trust the government will see a role in
developing opportunities for British carriers as well as providing better
services for consumers.'
An agreement last year allowed American Airlines and United Airlines, the US
groups, to take over routes from Heathrow Airport previously operated by Pan
Am and TWA. The deal ties the US carriers to keeping their services to the
level operated by UK airlines for three years. The committee suggests that
these restrictions should be lifted only if there is progress to create a
'level playing field' with the opening-up of the US market.
It says the Department of Transport significantly overestimated the benefits
of the deal when it was negotiated last March. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
transport secretary, said then that the deal would bring British airlines
financial benefits of Pounds 200m a year. The department has since
recalculated the impact of the deal after BA complained it was worth only
Pounds 130m.
The report recommends that the European Commission should introduce a
special merger regulation to prevent its plans to liberalise the air
transport market from being undermined by growing industrial concentration.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of El Salvador and its former rebel opponents signed a peace
agreement in Mexico City yesterday, ending the country's 12-year civil war
in which some 75,000 people died.
President Alfredo Cristiani signed the treaty and shook hands with the
10-member negotiating team from the left-wing FMLN guerrilla movement. He
called on the former rebels to help in the reconstruction of El Salvador.
The treaty concludes almost two years of UN-sponsored negotiations, which
culminated just before midnight on December 31, when the two sides resolved
their main differences and announced their intention to sign the treaty.
Under its terms, the Salvadorean army will be purged of its worst human
rights offenders, see its size halved within two years, and lose
responsibility for internal security. In return, the FMLN has agreed to
de-mobilise by October 31. It announced that it would turn its weapons into
monuments of peace. A permanent ceasefire will come into effect on February
1.
A new national police force will be set up, both led by and mainly composed
of civilians, but open to some former FMLN members. The government has
promised to enforce and accelerate existing procedures for land reform, and
to give the FMLN ownership of some of the land it has been occupying.
Mr Boutros Ghali, the new UN secretary-general, presided over the ceremony
with 10 heads of state and Mr James Baker, US secretary of state. The UN
chief said El Salvador 'must not be forgotten now peace has broken out'.
Mr Bernard Aronson, US assistant secretary of state for the Americas, said:
'There are special needs in El Salvador . . we are going to do what we can
to help'.
However, he would not commit the US to specific aid for El Salvador, saying
only that the US would shift resources from the military to national
reconstruction, as and when the FMLN demobilised.
The US has financed El Salvador and its army to the tune of Dollars 4bn
during the civil war. Mr Aronson added: 'The US can be proud of our
involvement in El Salvador' - without that, 'there would be no peace today'.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush is completing a package of tax cuts and economic
growth proposals to prod the US economy out of recession.
The White House is withholding details of the proposals until he unveils
them in his State of the Union speech on January 28 and in formal budget
presentations the next day.
However, several proposals likely to be included have emerged - many of them
measures that Mr Bush has already tried for in the past, such as a cut in
the capital gains tax.
Mr Bush said this week he wants to avoid 'quick fixes' and focus his
proposals on measures to stimulate investment and savings, not the
across-the-board income tax cuts Democratic congressional leaders have put
forward.
However, the administration is reported by the Washington Post to be
considering raising personal income tax allowances by as much as Dollars
1,000 (Pounds 560) per child - although other sources indicate a much
smaller rise - to give a Dollars 15bn-Dollars 17bn tax cut for families. The
advantage of this measure is that it would start trickling through
immediately as companies withheld less tax from employees' salaries.
Moderate price increases in December left US inflation at 3.1 per cent in
1991, its lowest rate for five years.
The Labour Department said yesterday its index of consumer prices rose by
0.1 per cent in December, or 0.3 per cent after seasonal adjustment.
The low inflation rate in 1991 was much helped by a 7.4 per cent drop in
energy prices (compared with an 18.1 per cent rise in 1990), but inflation
in almost all sectors stayed moderate. Food prices rose only 2.5 per cent,
their slowest advance since 1976.
The main exception was medical care, where prices rose by 7.9 per cent in
1991.

FT  17 JAN 92 / China's 'economic tsars' rise to fame: A Beijing
Correspondent describes two leading candidates for the top leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Beijing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH speculation continuing about China's future leadership after
elder-statesman Deng Xiaoping and other ageing officials pass from the
political scene, more and more attention is being focused on two men who
have emerged as the country's 'economic tsars'.
Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji, widely viewed as a reformer, and Zou Jiahua, seen
as a more cautious state planner, have played an increasingly important role
during the past six months as Beijing wrestles with one of the most serious
economic issues to threaten the ruling Communist party: how to deal with
China's bloated, state-run enterprises.
'These two men are the country's real economic brain trust,' says one
western diplomat. 'They are the heads of the most powerful pieces of the
Chinese government.'
Vice-Premier Zhu is director of the State Production Office, whose task is
the day-to-day management of the debt-ridden state sector; Zou runs the
State Planning Commission, which determines long-term strategies for medium
and large state-run enterprises. Both are seen as possible contenders to
become prime minister if the man now holding that office, Li Peng, is pushed
or steps aside.
The differences between Zhu and Zou are significant.
'Zhu is the action man, the spark plug,' the diplomat says. 'He's the man
who brings energy. He wants to get things done.' Zhu has charisma. A western
banker who has dealt with him says that he 'exudes a sense of confidence and
leadership. He is direct and emphasises practical issues.'
Zou, however, 'doesn't have the moral authority Zhu has,' the diplomat says.
'But he is an effective spokesperson for his brand of reform, which is
mainstream.'
Their handling of the troubled state sector illustrates both the contrasting
styles of the two men and the contradictions the party they serve faces in
resolving these problems. After a decade of market-oriented reform, private
and collectively-owned enterprises have sharply outperformed the state
sector, which now accounts for about 55 per cent of the country's industrial
output, compared with about 80 per cent in the early 1980s. Even according
to the Chinese, nearly a third of the country's thousands of state-owned
enterprises are in the red. Western estimates place the figure closer to 70
per cent.
There is no doubt Beijing recognises that there is a serious crisis. It has
chosen Zhu as the most likely candidate to salvage the situation. He was
given the extremely difficult task of raising the efficiency of the state
enterprises and reducing both the country's huge 300bn yuan domestic
inter-company debt and its enormous stockpiles of unwanted, shoddy goods.
Zhu's selection was believed to be an opportunity for him to demonstrate
whether he has the qualities to become the country's next leader. Observers
said his task was not only one of the most important but at the same time
one of the most difficult.
In fact, Zhu appears to have had some modest success in reducing China's
stockpile of cigarettes and textiles. There is also speculation that he is
responsible, at least in part, for recent moves calling for greater autonomy
of state-run enterprises.
Nonetheless, the problems are deep-seated and cannot easily be resolved
without raising the even more profound issue of the eventual elimination of
the state sector, a prospect which would threaten the very identity of the
Communist party and the core of the socialist economy. Zhu faces some
hostility from conservatives and hardliners who see his appointment as such
a threat to their interests that they hope he will fail, say western
analysts.
On the other hand, while Zou is not as vigorously involved in the daily
management of the state sector's many difficulties, he must provide
significant input for the country's Five Year Plan and take a longer-term
view of the economy.
'Zhu is a trouble-shooter who breaks up bottlenecks, whereas Zou is a more
conservative gradualist,' western diplomats say, adding that both believe
economic reform is the only way the Chinese system can improve.
Zhu supports the revitalisation of medium and large state enterprises, but
without relinquishing party control. He firmly believes that the radical
measures such as privatisation that were adopted in eastern Europe are not a
viable option for China. 'He has consistently argued for central, top-down
planning.'
Each man has powerful connections with China's party elders. Zhu's patron is
Deng Xiaoping himself. Zou is linked to the older generation of China's
revolutionary idols. His immediate benefactor is the economic planner Chen
Yun.
Although both are from Shanghai, their backgrounds are as different as are
their patrons.
Like Premier Li, Zou studied in the Soviet Union and has extensive ties to
the country's military-industrial complex, including reportedly having
worked for Norinco, one of the country's largest arms exporters.
Zhu began to acquire more prominent recognition when he became mayor of
Shanghai in 1988 and is remembered for his cool-headed approach in Shanghai
to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
Chinese respect Zhu as a very efficient, tough-minded decision-maker who is
unafraid to sternly criticise bureaucrats, even publicly.
But this last attribute has earned him enemies and he seems recently to have
adopted a lower public profile. And while he plays down ideological
concerns, he has carefully avoided disputing openly the party line that
state enterprises must remain in public hands.
He apparently enjoys bold, dramatic moves and is responsible for the
construction of two Shanghai bridges. They are spectacular engineering feats
that cross the Huangpu, linking the city-centre with the Pudong investment
zone in the eastern suburbs. 'These were very expensive solutions to
crossing a river,' a western banker said. 'A tunnel would have been much
cheaper, but nobody would see it. These bridges are monuments to him and
Shanghai.'
Unlike Zhu, Zou lacks charisma, but has a reputation as an effective
technocrat who understands complex economic issues. Despite his trip to
Europe this autumn, he has less of a public persona than Zhu and fewer
details are available about his life. 'Like Li Peng, he doesn't look good in
public, but he is a power broker,' one western observer said.
If both were given the chance to become premier, analysts believe Zhu would
bring change, while Zou would continue current policies. But their true
colours may not surface until one of the elderly leaders dies or leaves the
political scene.

ALGERIA'S new leader Mohamed Boudiaf gave a clear warning to Islamic
fundamentalists yesterday that no group would be allowed to use religion for
its own interests, Reuter reports from Algiers.
The 72-year-old veteran of Algeria's independence war issued the warning
just hours after being sworn in as head of the five-man High Council of
State set up to rule the country by the military. The council was created
following the resignation of President Chadli Bendjedid on Saturday and the
cancellation of a second round of elections.
Earlier yesterday Mr Boudiaf was given a hero's welcome at the airport after
returning from 27 years of exile. In 1964 he had been sentenced to death by
his own country for political activity. The first man to welcome him was Gen
Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister and the central figure in the new ruling
council.
'It is not permitted to anyone, individual or group, to monopolise religion
for unholy interests. Islam is sacred, and no one must abuse it,' Mr Boudiaf
said.
His statement was seen as a clear warning to the Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) which planned to make Algeria an Islamic state after taking an
apparently unassailable lead in the general election.
President Bendjedid was forced out, according to diplomats, by military men
and senior officials angered at his determination to complete the poll. The
FIS has said it would pursue its goals and challenge the five-man
presidency.
'I have come to offer my hand to everyone without exception for
reconciliation, co-operation to build Algeria. . . an Algeria of fraternity,
tolerance and creative work,' said Mr Boudiaf.
Thursday should have seen the conclusive round of voting in Algeria's first
democratic general election. The FIS, which won 188 seats in December's
preliminary round, had seemed sure of the additional 28 seats it needed to
take power.
All three parties that won seats in the first round of the now aborted
elections - the FIS, the National Liberation Front and the Front des Forces
Socialistes - continue to describe the events of the past few days as
unconstitutional. However, none of them appears, to be prepared to risk
challenging those now ruling the country with more than words.
The FIS has accused the authorities of starting to arrest its members.

what he calls the 'remarkable developments. . . over the last few years with
the freeing of markets through trade and investment liberalisation,

One aim will be to increase UK trade with Mexico, which with exports in 1990

countries and Japan. Mr Lilley also intends to discuss the implications of
the North American Free Trade Agreement.

</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is 'drifting towards a preference for managed trade' which is
undermining efforts to secure an open multilateral trading system through
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), according to Sir Leon
Brittan, EC competition commissioner.
His remarks coincide with an increasingly sharp transatlantic trade
argument, which in the past week has centred on the farm subsidies row
within the Uruguay Round negotiations, and the renewed controversy over
German exchange rate support to the European Airbus consortium through
Daimler Benz.
Sir Leon, speaking to the Centre for European Policy Research in Paris,
highlighted 'political deals' the US has struck to gain Japanese market
share in semiconductors, public works, aeronautics, satellites and
telecommunications and, following President George Bush's visit to Tokyo
last week, cars.
He also noted the US's growing arsenal of protective trade measures, ranging
from export subsidies and the Buy American Act, to a broad definition of
national security which seals off the US defence market and supports related
sectors such as civil aviation.
He contrasted European car makers' efforts to attack the Japanese market,
and the EC's phased liberalisation of Japanese car imports, to the US's
'reaction . . . to demand a certain share of the Japanese market on
political rather than commercial grounds'.
Efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round, he said, would be 'weakened by the
evidence of a US drift towards managed trade'. Sir Leon warned, moreover,
that the European Commission would insist that any openings made in Japan to
US business would have to be extended to the EC.
He acknowledged that Japanese business culture all but excluded imports, but
insisted that the US counter-strategy would fail to narrow the productivity
and competitiveness gap with Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH insurance costs are threatening a big contract worth Dollars 90m
(Pounds 50m) won by Poland's Gdynia shipyard to build two tankers for
Burmeister and Wain from Denmark.
The contract for the two 90,000-tonne Aframax vessels, which marks a key
step towards recovery for the debt-burdened yard, was signed in mid-November
by the Danish shipping and ship-building company.
The Danes, however, are finding that the high costs of insuring the 75 per
cent down payment on the vessels, which are due for delivery at the end of
1993, could mean they will take the order elsewhere.
Ironically, Mr Henryk Ogryczak, the Gdynia yard's managing director, notes
that the problem comes as the yard is emerging from a time of considerable
uncertainty.
The new Polish government has adopted a more interventionist approach to
industry than its predecessors.
Indeed, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the deputy trade minister, has said,
referring to the Burmeister contract: 'Our shipyards are an important part
of Poland's export capacity and they must not be permitted to disappear.'
The Gdynia yard continued to be modernised until the end of the 1970s, when
shipyards elsewhere were being closed.
Mr Ogryczak, who left the yard in 1985 to start up his own business and
returned last year as managing director, is negotiating a restructuring of
Gdynia's Zl 2,000bn (Pounds 98m) debt with its creditors, who include the
government, suppliers and banks. He has also set in train plans to rent out
the yard's spare storage at maintenance capacity. The yard at the moment is,
among others, building three 150,000 tonne bulk carriers for Dreyfuss from
France and two 90,000 tonne tankers for Zenith of the UK. The value of
Gdynia's present orders exceeds Dollars 200m (Pounds 112m).

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) is asking more
companies to increase their purchases of foreign semiconductors, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
Miti said it would now ask 226 companies (up from 63) to buy at least 20 per
cent of their semiconductors from foreign suppliers. The new group accounts
for nearly 90 per cent of the Japanese semiconductor market, compared with
80 per cent previously.
Last July's semiconductor agreement between Japan and the US set a target
figure of 20 per cent for foreign makers' share of the Japanese market. The
actual share in the fourth quarter of 1991 was only 14-16 per cent.
The largest Japanese buyers of semiconductors already buy over 20 per cent
from foreign companies, but smaller companies remain more dependent on
domestic suppliers.
Japan reaffirmed its efforts to increase its purchases of foreign
semiconductors in an 'action plan' announced during US President George
Bush's visit last week.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and China last night narrowly averted a damaging trade war when
Chinese trade officials agreed to strengthen protection of intellectual
property rights for foreign companies.
China's capitulation in Washington, just hours before a midnight deadline
for settlement, will be seen as a big victory for Mrs Carla Hills, the US
trade representative, who kept the pressure on Beijing and took part in the
final talks.
China had vowed to retaliate if the US carried out its threat of imposing
trade sanctions. US farmers, who regard China as a major grain market, would
have been the likely target of any sanctions by Beijing.
The settlement is a victory for 'Special 301', the section of the 1988 US
trade law used frequently by American officials to enforce improved
protection of patents, copyright, trademarks and other intellectual property
under threat of trade sanctions.
A spokesman for Mrs Hills welcomed a 'good agreement'. China has promised to
improve protection of computer software, sound recordings, pharmaceuticals
and agri-chemicals. Copyrights will be granted for 50 years.
China will join the Berne Copyright Convention by October of this year and
the Geneva Phonogram Convention by June 1993.
Mrs Hills issued a statement saying the agreement provided 'significant
opportunity' for US businesses wishing to invest in China now that they were
assured that their intellectual property would be protected.
Both American and Hong Kong companies will be relieved by the settlement.
The threat by Mrs Hills to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Dollars 300m
(Pounds 167.5m) to Dollars 500m in imports jeopardised hundreds of importers
of textiles, clothing, leather and other products who have come to rely on
partnerships with Chinese companies offering cheap labour.
One of the main US beneficiaries of the agreement is Microsoft, a leading US
software manufacturer.
The company said MSDos, the company's IBM-compatible software, is the most
widely used operating system in Chinese personal computers.
However, a large part of it had been pirated and adapted for Chinese use,
costing the company millions of dollars.

NISSAN has suspended work at its car assembly plant in Peru, it said
yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Japan's second-largest vehicle maker had been producing finished cars in
Lima while Peru's 50 per cent tariff on finished cars made marketing of
imported cars there prohibitively expensive. But, since Peru cut that tariff
to 15 per cent last year, it has become cheaper to import finished cars than
to assemble them locally from imported parts, the company noted.
Nissan said suspension of work, in effect since last October, did not
necessarily mean permanent shut-down.

A SPECIAL court early today acquitted Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek
former prime minister, of charges of involvement in a Dollars 200m
embezzlement scandal at the Bank of Crete.
However, his two co-defendants - Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, a former finance
minister, and Mr George Petsos, a former industry minister - were both found
guilty on charges of breach of trust.
The verdicts came after more than 15 hours of deliberation by 13 senior
judges, who remained divided. Mr Vassilis Kokkinos, court president, said
the decision to acquit Mr Papandreou was by a 7:6 majority.
He had faced three charges arising from the Bank of Crete scandal, uncovered
in 1988: breach of trust, taking a bribe, and accepting the proceeds of a
crime. The socialist former premier dismissed the proceedings as a political
conspiracy against him by the ruling conservatives. He had refused to attend
the court hearings.
Mr Papandreou watched on live television, at his home in the Athens suburb
of Ekali, the verdict being delivered. His son, Mr George Papandreou, a
socialist MP, expressed relief, but added: 'It's a complex and unpleasant
outcome because of the two convictions.'
A small crowd of supporters of Mr Papandreou's Pan-hellenic Socialist
Movement (Pasok), gathered outside the supreme court building, cheered when
his acquittal was announced.
The not-guilty verdict seems to ensure that political stability in Greece
will not be threatened, but the conviction of Mr Tsovolas, one of Pasok's
most popular MPs, is likely to provoke angry demonstrations by socialist
supporters.
Pasok officials said they would consider proposing a no-confidence motion
against the conservatives, who have a two-seat parliamentary majority.
Sentences on the two convicted men are expected in the next few days.

advertising except at the point of sale.
The controversial proposal, which follows a 1989 EC ban on TV advertising of
tobacco, hit a procedural hurdle when some heavily-lobbied MEPs successfully
demanded an opinion from the legal affairs committee on whether the
Commission was right to propose the measure for adoption by majority.
If this measure ends up requiring unanimity among EC governments, its
chances of being agreed will be much reduced.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday launched a comprehensive package of measures
aimed at turning Frankfurt into a financial centre to rival London, New York
and Tokyo.
The proposals are also aimed at polishing up the country's tarnished image
in the wake of a series of financial scandals.
At the heart of the plan, is the development of 'effective and
internationally recognised' supervision of securities markets.
The plan, drawn up by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, would
also:
Make insider trading punishable with up to two years' imprisonment;
Give fairer treatment to investors and provide greater transparency in
companies' share registers in line with international rules of conduct;
Encourage the country's eight regional stock exchanges to establish a
'central stock exchange', providing essential services for the eight from
one base.
The measures also include important technical changes aimed at giving
financial institutions a competitive edge.
Mr Waigel wants the measures approved and written into the statute books by
the end of the year.
He said that as the third most powerful economy in the world, Germany needed
a fully developed financial market meeting the finest international
standards.
This called for a strong, dynamic, banking system, internationally
competitive stock markets and an efficient, flexible, high-capacity
insurance market.
The federal government is likely to face resistance to some of the proposals
from the state governments which fear the loss of autonomy.
The Bundesbank, the independent central bank, has in the past opposed some
of the liberalisation measures embodied in yesterday's plan.
Mr Waigel proposed legal amendments to give investment trusts greater
flexibility. At present these have strict limits on what they may invest in.
Under Mr Waigel's proposals they would be able to operate in the money
markets allowing them, according to a finance ministry document, to deploy a
full portfolio of investment instruments.
The Bundesbank has argued that such liberalisation would interfere with the
reserve requirements which financial institutions are required to maintain.
Mr Waigel also urged the increased use of technology, mainly to reduce
transaction costs.
However, this would also have the effect of increasing market transparency,
liquidity and market security.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Largest mortgage lenders cut rates by 1/2 point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE largest UK mortgage lenders yesterday unexpectedly lowered their
rates to borrowers in an effort to revive Britain's depressed housing
market.
Abbey National, the second largest lender, led the way by reducing its main
mortgage interest rate from 11.55 per cent to 10.99 per cent for mortgages
below Pounds 60,000.
The move - matched within hours by Halifax and Nationwide - was welcomed by
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. 'Lower mortgage rates, combined with the
stamp duty cut, will help to increase activity in the housing market,
benefiting home-buyers and home-owners throughout the country,' he said.
Monthly savings as a result of the cuts will be about Pounds 20 on a Pounds
50,000 endowment mortgage and around Pounds 10 on a Pounds 120,000 loan.
The government introduced legislation on Wednesday to remove stamp duty from
all house purchases under Pounds 250,000 before August 19. In addition, some
2.6m borrowers whose mortgage rates are fixed annually stand to benefit from
earlier mortgage reductions in the next few months.
Yesterday's news brought mixed reactions in the City where shares rose
slightly on the announcement by Abbey National.
Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, the US-owned
securities house, predicted that the cuts would have 'a catalytic effect' on
the housing market because most people had thought that mortgage rates were
no longer falling. 'It's not so much the pounds and pence but the
psychological impact,' he said.
Single figure mortgage rates were now a possibility later this year, he
added.
But Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at stockbroker UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, expressed serious doubts that the cut would revive the
market. 'This is not sufficient to provide the necessary kick-start that the
housing market definitely needs,' he said.
Mr David Holland, chief executive of Wimpey Homes, said the cut was
excellent news and could be just what the housing market needed to get
moving again.
Mortgage rates have now come down seven times in the past 16 months and are
around their lowest for almost four years. Yesterday's move was the first
time that lenders have cut their interest rates without a cut in base rates
by the government.
Their action reflects the ability of the lenders to finance their operations
through deposits from savers. However, Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage
lender with 1.8m borrowers, warned that it would have to raise its new base
mortgage rate of 10.95 per cent if the government increased base rates from
their current 10.5 per cent level.
Building society rates to savers are set to fall during February to match
the lower rates to borrowers.
Other mortgage lenders, including the clearing banks, said they were
reviewing rates.
Abbey National said rates on mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 would drop
0.56 points to 10.99 per cent. Rates for loans of between Pounds 60,000 and
Pounds 100,000 go down 0.3 points to 10.55 per cent and mortgages over
Pounds 100,000 are reduced 0.2 points to 10.4 per cent.
Halifax said rates on mortgages under Pounds 60,000 would fall 0.45 points
to 10.95 per cent. Rates on mortgages between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds
100,000 would fall to 10.5 per cent from 10.85 per cent, while on mortgages
over Pounds 100,000 the rate would fall 0.2 points to 10.3 per cent.
Nationwide cut 0.51 points off mortgages up to Pounds 60,000 to 10.99 per
cent. For mortgages between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 120,000 the rate is cut
0.25 points to 10.55 per cent , while over Pounds 120,000 the rate is cut
0.1 points to 10.4 per cent.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Conflicting polls leave election wide open: Labour ready to
soften planned increases in National Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW opinion polls last night left the outcome of the impending general
election as uncertain as ever as the Labour party confirmed that it is ready
to soften its planned increases in National Insurance contributions.
With one survey giving the government a 4.5 percentage point lead over
Labour, some senior ministers - buoyed further by yesterday's round of
mortgage rate cuts - were canvassing April 9 as the most likely date for an
election.
But the second pointed to a 3 point Labour lead, and other ministers
insisted that the prime minister was still keeping open the possibility of
May 7. They acknowledged, however, that the prime minister may face a
growing bandwagon in favour of an election within weeks of a tax-cutting
March Budget.
The date of the Budget is expected to be announced next week, with Whitehall
officials insisting that March 3, March 10 and March 17 all remain options.
The latter, however, would effectively rule out an early April election.
Facing a fresh Conservative onslaught on Labour's tax and spending
proposals, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said that he would keep
open the option of phasing in over a number of years the proposed ling on NI
contributions.
As shadow cabinet colleagues admitted that Labour had underestimated the
potential impact on voters in south-east England of taking another 9 per
cent from earnings over that ceiling, there were signs that Mr Neil Kinnock
now regards phasing as inevitable.
Mr Smith denied that the decision marked a retreat from the party's previous
policy, citing long-standing Labour commitments to avoid large disruption of
family budgets.
But amid angry clashes with Mr Kinnock, Mr John Major said Labour's tax and
spending policies had been reduced to a 'shambles'. He added: 'The only
thing that is certain is that a party that promises to spend and spend is a
party that has to tax and tax.'
The attack was followed up by Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman,
who demanded that Mr Kinnock spell out how and when NI contribution changes
would be phased in. The Tories issued figures showing that in London
abolition of the ceiling would bring higher bills for those on just above
average income.
As campaigning reached a new pitch, both parties drew consolation from the
two apparently conflicting opinion polls which suggest that they are running
neck-and-neck.
A Gallup survey for today's Daily Telegraph gave the Conservatives a 4.5
point lead with 42 per cent of the vote against Labour's 37.5 per cent and
the Liberal Democrats' 16 per cent. That compared with a 2.5 point
Conservative lead last month.
The survey also appeared to confirm recent private opinion polling showing
that despite the recession, the voters have more confidence in the
Conservatives' economic and tax policies. According to Gallup, 57 per cent
of voters believed they would pay more tax and NI under a Labour government.
But an NOP survey for today's Independent showed a 3 point Labour lead. The
poll put Labour support at 43 per cent (up 2 points), the Conservatives at
40 per cent (unchanged) and the Liberal Democrats at 13 per cent (down 2
points).
The most striking feature of both polls appears to be the confirmation that
the Conservatives' core support has edged up to around 40 per cent from the
38 per cent seen in much of 1991.
UNEMPLOYMENT RISES TO 9%
The unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 9 per cent in December. An
increase of 31,100 in the seasonally adjusted figure took the jobless total
to 2.55m. Page 9

FT  17 JAN 92 / Nissan to raise Sunderland capacity 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN plans to spend Pounds 200m at its Sunderland car plant in north-east
England, increasing capacity by more than a third to 300,000 units annually
by next year.
The move, to be announced in Tokyo this morning by Mr Yutaka Kume, Nissan
president, will intensify concerns of indigenous European vehicle producers
about the potential long-term volume of Japanese car production in the UK.
Nissan plans output next year of 270,000, more than double the 124,000
achieved in 1991. The latest move to raise capacity - the second within a
year - brings its output expansion far beyond what most in the industry
expected.
The latest spending at Sunderland will create 600 jobs and bring investment
at the 760-acre site to Pounds 900m. It will make the Nissan project the
single biggest inward investment by a Japanese company in Europe, overtaking
Toyota's Pounds 840m car and engine-manufacturing projects at Derby and
Shotton on Deeside.
Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, said the expansion
'demonstrates that we remain the most important home for inward investment
in Europe'. He said he did not expect objections from other EC members.
The increase will lift Nissan's UK production above the 200,000 originally
projected when the venture was announced in the early 1980s.
Last year, Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) had said it intended to raise
production to 220,000 in 1993. It produced 124,000 cars in 1991 and expects
to produce 175,000 this year after production of a second model, the Micra,
starts in the second half of the year.
The investment plan was welcomed by component makers which stand to gain
substantial new business. As the Micra replacement comes in, the number of
parts suppliers will grow from 179 to 195 with most of the extra suppliers
also British.
Of the Pounds 200m total, some Pounds 150m will go on expanding NMUK's own
facilities. The remaining Pounds 50m is being spent on expanding body
pressing capacity at Nissan Yamato Engineering, an 80 per cent Nissan-owned
joint venture adjoining the assembly operations.
With little left of the UK machine tool industry, the lion's share of the
plant and equipment spending is expected to go to overseas suppliers, mainly
in Japan and Germany.
The extra workers will bring the labour force directly employed by NMUK at
Sunderland to 4,600, with another 1,400 jobs spread among adjacent component
makers.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Swiss link in MCC share deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, IAN RODGER and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS believe that vital information on Mr Robert Maxwell's alleged
illegal attempts to support the Maxwell Communication Corporation share
price is held by Dr Werner Rechsteiner, a Zurich-based lawyer, who is
administrative president of Yakosa Finanzierungs, a secretive Swiss holding
company.
The Financial Times has established that Yakosa is one of two Swiss vehicles
which bought between 20m and 25m MCC shares, worth Pounds 50m, in April
1991.
Goldman Sachs, the leading US investment bank, acted as broker to a series
of transactions involving the sale of 25m MCC shares in April.
Yakosa and Servex, another Swiss company, are targets of an investigation by
the Serious Fraud Office and by accountants Arthur Andersen into the alleged
share support scheme.
Yesterday Dr Rechsteiner confirmed that Yakosa had held shares in MCC at one
point.
He also said that he had been approached by Arthur Andersen, the
accountants, which have been appointed administrators of the Maxwell private
companies under UK insolvency law.
Andersen is trying to trace around Pounds 1bn missing from the accounts and
pension funds of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's public companies, MCC and
Mirror Group Newspapers.
Andersen believes that Pounds 150m of the Pounds 1bn was channelled by Mr
Maxwell to offshore vehicles last year to buy MCC shares.
Speaking from his office in a smart residential district overlooking Zurich,
Dr Rechsteiner said that he did not think Yakosa had anything to hide but
could not answer questions or indicate if Mr Maxwell was a client without
getting approval from the client or an order from the Swiss authorities to
waive the lawyer-client privilege. He said he had told Arthur Andersen he
would co-operate fully if this happened.
Yakosa, registered in Chur, Switzerland, and Servex AG, registered in Zug,
are believed to have bought 20-25m shares in MCC in the last week of April.
During March and April the MCC share price rocketed from 150p to 240p.
Mr Maxwell needed to support the MCC share price because more than Pounds
300m of borrowings by his private companies were secured on MCC shares, and
as the MCC share price fell, banks demanded more collateral.
However, if the shares were being bought by vehicles connected to Mr
Maxwell, the trades should have been made public, under the UK Companies
Act. It is also illegal for public companies to assist in the purchase of
their own shares without obtaining shareholder approval.

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER and TSB Group, a couple of the weaker members of the
British banking establishment, yesterday both changed their chief financial
officers in two highly unusual moves.
John Burns (right) leaves NatWest, his stable for the past 40 years, most
recently as general manager and group chief financial officer, to become
group finance director at TSB. Burns, who is 56, had been a director since
1989. He succeeds Dolf Mootham who retires after the TSB annual general
meeting in March.
The incoming chief financial officer at Nat West is 49-year-old American
Richard Goeltz (far right), previously executive vice-president of the
Seagram company in New York. Goeltz yesterday described his mission at
NatWest as helping it to become a truly global bank in the banking markets
of the 1990s.
While his career has been in the US, he has visited London at least five
times a year for the past two decades.
He also already knows NatWest well from his days as a corporate finance
officer. 'The key thing that has struck me is that all the senior officers
of NatWest have a great team spirit and eagerness to work together,' he
says.
At TSB, which yesterday unveiled its first ever loss over a full year, Burns
is expected to bring sophisticated corporate banking expertise to a
boardroom dominated by marketing people.
It is understood he was attracted by the prospect of wielding very
considerable influence in his new position, possibly second only to that of
chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison.

FT  17 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS group Glaxo saw one of its biggest falls yesterday on
particularly heavy turnover. The shares tumbled sharply in early trading,
with one trader talking of 'complete panic from the word go'. They were down
76 points at one stage following a wave of selling in New York and a
downgrade by one securities house. They recovered to close 50 off at 866p on
14m turnover.
The origins of the slide this week were in heavy US selling of Merck, the
world's biggest drug company, which fell nearly Dollars 3 on Monday and
Dollars 4 on Wednesday. This was the first sign that US investors were
moving out of defensive pharmaceuticals stocks and into cyclicals. The
spotlight turned on Glaxo on Wednesday and, in the US, the American
Depositary Receipts fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 with the equivalent
of 10.4m shares dealt.
Then, in London, County NatWest reduced its forecasts for the company. The
house pharmaceuticals team cut its 1992 estimate by Pounds 67m to Pounds
1,395m and its earnings per share forecast to 32.9p from 34.6p. It said the
cut reflected concerns over currency, Glaxo's anti-asthma treatment Serevent
and growth prospects for its ulcer drug Zantac, which represents about 50
per cent of turnover.
Reports that Roussel-Uclaf, the French medical supply company, is on the
verge of winning approval to sell its Lansoprazole anti-ulcer drug in France
and other western European countries also affected investors attitudes.
Later the US investment house Smith Barney repeated a buy rating on the
entire drug sector and the pressure on the shares eased slightly.
The fall hit other big pharmaceuticals stocks. SmithKline Beecham fell 40 to
923p and Wellcome 16 to 1022p.
ICI in demand
The move into cyclical stocks was of particular benefit to ICI, which jumped
35 to 1222p with 2.6m shares traded, a heavy turnover for the stock.
There was interest from one institutional buyer and this accentuated the
effect of a bear squeeze as traders were caught short of stock by the heavy
overnight US buying.
The rise did not appear to be backed up by any particular company or market
stories although S G Warburg had been bidding for stock and James Capel
discussed the company with clients, pointing out its 'good inherent value'.
TSB firmer
Preliminary figures from TSB, the banking group, showed a lapse into losses
over the past year but were not as bad as some in the market had expected.
They helped the shares to rally strongly from their recent substantial
underperformance against the wider market and the banks sector.
The TSB share price, along with other bank shares, was also boosted by news
that a number of leading building societies had cut their mortgage lending
rates, a move likely to help the dormant UK housing market.
Analysts said there was widespread relief that TSB's figures did not include
any nasty surprises - some observers had expected TSB to record pre-tax
losses of Pounds 85m.
TSB shares, which fell away to 112p in early December, sped to 130p, before
ending a net 8 higher at 128p. Turnover was a hefty 10m shares.
Fisons was brought down by US selling, but was also affected by an article
in a newspaper which claimed to have obtained documents from the US Food and
Drug Administration showing 'the full extent of manufacturing defects' at a
Fisons plant in the UK. In spite of a Fisons rebuttal, the shares lost 6 1/2
to 361p with 12m traded.
Institutions were said to have been heavy buyers of bank stocks after
careful scrutiny of the TSB figures and news of the reductions in mortgage
lending rates. The mortgage moves were viewed as another move to reduce
pressure on borrowers suffering from the twin effects of high interest rates
and recession.
Abbey National, which instigated the latest round of rate cuts, jumped 11 to
295p on keen turnover of 3.4m. Barclays raced higher, closing 17 ahead at
382p on volume of 7.2m, the highest single day's turnover since early
November. Lloyds surged 15 to 400p on 4.2m shares, NatWest 12 to 287p on
8.6m (the busiest day since December 5) and Midland rose 7 to 224p.
Royal outperformed the composite sector, closing 11 higher at 252p on an
emerging stock shortage. Sun Alliance was heavily traded (6.4m) and edged up
3 to 279p, while Guardian Royal attracted sustained support to close 7
higher at 135p.
Excellent new business figures prompted a wave of support for Lloyds Abbey
Life which settled 18 higher at 368p.
The perception of Hanson as a cyclical recovery stock was behind a rise of 4
to 216 1/2 p with 12m traded.
Big dollar earners lost ground yesterday. Reuters fell 25 to 1068p, Reckitt
&amp; Colman dropped 14 to 683p and Unilever lost 10 to 910p.
There was substantial underperformance by BP against the market and the oil
sector, particularly Shell. BP settled 3 1/2 off at 292p on hefty turnover
of 13m and Shell ended up 9 at 503p on 4.3m. A number of big US and UK
institutions were aggressive switchers out of BP and into Shell.
Power generators were among the best performers in the utilities area of the
market with National Power exceptionally strong, ending 7 firmer at 139p on
talk of a James Capel buy recommendation. Turnover in National rose sharply
to 10m. PowerGen added 4 1/2 to 146p on 2.8m. Electricity stocks, however,
were mixed, with profit-takers prompting Northern to lose 11 to 249p.
Guinness was a penny easier at 532p with Smith New Court the latest
securities house to cut its profit estimate. The house is now looking for
Pounds 1,100m this year.
Talk of analysts' downgrades on Forte continued, although there was scant
evidence in the market, leading to suggestions of the possibility of a bear
raid. Kleinwort Benson became the latest broker to be said to have
downgraded, analyst Paul Slattery denying the story, although he added that
Kleinwort is undertaking a major review of the hotels sector. Goldman Sachs
did downgrade yesterday however, shaving around 8 per cent from its profit
forecasts. Forte gained a penny to 231p.
Volume in British Steel rose to 20m in busy trading late in the session, and
the shares gained 7 to 77p on buying from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, company
brokers, and from the US. UBS now believes British Steel's dividend to be
more secure.
Glynwed International was volatile. The shares retreated in early trading
after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew slashed its 1992 forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds
32m and raised fears about the dividend. However, the shares later recovered
to end only 2 lower at 199p after buying was reported at S G Warburg.
A cut in mortgage interest rates lifted P &amp; O, whose Bovis subsidiary is a
leading UK housebuilder. The shares jumped 21 to 453p.
Investors were cheered by the lack of bad news at Trafalgar House's annual
meeting and the shares responded by adding 4 to 129p. A B Ports gained 6 to
325p on buying at County NatWest.
Vickers closed 5 up at 181p on renewed talk of the imminent part-disposal of
its Rolls Royce Motors subsidiary.
British Land gained 5 to 255p, Land Securities rose 12 to 448p and MEPC
added 8 to 384p.
Worries that Greycoat was having difficulty with its refinancing package for
Embankment Place receded, the shares rebounding 15 to 68p.
BOC Group rose 11 to 646p after a well-received AGM.

FT  17 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery stocks attract the buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY switching from the pharmaceuticals sector into cyclical stocks in the
UK stock market yesterday appeared to reflect growing confidence that the UK
economy will soon begin to recover from the recession. The trend was set
from the US but confidence received a further boost when three leading UK
home loan groups cut mortgage rates by just over half a point.
Equities continued to display volatility, however, and the FT-SE Index moved
between a 13.8 fall and a 12.3 gain before closing firmly, albeit well off
the top. While drug stocks were badly hit, there were substantial gains
among the banks, building and construction issues and the stores.
The final hour of trading saw London reacting to an erratic opening on Wall
Street which was down 11 Dow points in UK hours.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,541.6, a net gain of 4.5. The
Index was distorted yesterday by substantial falls in such heavily weighted
stocks as Glaxo, which suffered one of its worst day's trading, and
SmithKline Beecham; between them, these two pharmaceuticals took nearly 12
points off the Footsie scale. Some Wall Street stocks were also left behind,
notably Reuters, the global financial data communications group, which gave
back some recent gains.
Fund managers were taking their substantial profits on pharmaceutical stocks
as analysts warned that the sector might have reached its peak for the near
term. Traders said that most of the cash raised by selling drug stocks was
put straight back into sectors now identified as recovery prospects.
Institutional business, which has been increasing this week, remained high
yesterday, with Seaq-recorded volume totalling 638.4m shares, against 673.6m
in the previous session. Stock Exchange statistics show that daily retail,
or customer, business in UK equities topped the Pounds 1bn mark in five out
of the past six trading sessions.
The cut in mortgage lending rates by the Abbey National, Halifax and
Nationwide, provided encouragement across the range of housebuilding and
construction stocks. It also helped the banking sector by offering some
relief for the weight of debt hanging over the customers of the high street
banks. Poor trading figures from TSB, the former Trustee Savings Bank, were
no surprise.
Store shares extended this week's gains, heartened both by the move towards
lower interest rates and the signs that the Budget, in March, may bring
reductions in personal taxation. Both moves are likely to put more money in
consumers' pockets.
Oil shares tended to lag behind the market and Lonrho continued to attract
nervous selling as the market awaits the trading news due this month.
Some market strategists expressed doubts about yesterday's apparent move
towards cyclical, or recovery stocks. An analyst at a leading UK investment
bank commented that while such moves might be rational in the US, where
interest rates are now historically low, it was less easy to justify them in
the high interest rate environment of the UK.
The market paid little heed to the disclosure that domestic unemployment
reached a four-year high in November. Rising unemployment this year has been
widely predicted by City analysts.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Appointments: Eyeing a 'spectacular turnround'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CROWN COMMUNICATIONS which, on Wednesday, announced a Pounds 6.79m loss for
the year ending September 1991, has appointed a new finance director. David
Whitaker comes to the group which owns LBC radio from the cable and
telecommunications industry.
Whitaker, 42, replaces Ian Stevenson, who is returning to Edinburgh to run
his own accountancy firm, but who remains a non-executive director. Crown
says that the latter's departure was unconnected with the poor 1991 results;
originally appointed for just a year to see the company through a difficult
patch, he had stayed for more than two and had made clear his intentions of
going some six months ago. Crown had then appointed another finance director
but he died suddenly, at the age of 40.
Whitaker was part of the cable tv revolution at its inception in 1984, first
with Windsor TV, then with Cable Communications, now owned by Southwestern
Bell; for the past year he has worked as a consultant to foreign companies
interested in breaking into UK telecommunications. While he acknowledges the
challenge of his assignment, he reckons that 'given the right conditions,
the turnround (at Crown) could be quite spectacular'.
At the same time, chief executive David Haynes, a New Zealander who has
spent a large part of his working life in Australia, has promoted Australian
Peter Benson to the position of group director. Benson joined Crown in July
1991 as group general manager; he had come from Sky Television where, as
general manager, he had been involved in its launch.

FT  17 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in Footsie futures was volatile, with the March contract traded
around its fair value premium for most of the session, writes Joel Kibazo.
March opened at a 42-point premium to the underlying cash market and
continued to advance until it was knocked back by a bout of mid-morning
institutional selling.
News of the cut in the mortgage interest rates by the UK's largest lenders
triggered another bout of buying which was further encouraged by
better-than-feared UK employment figures.
However, a poor US bond market coupled with a weak opening on Wall Street
caused March to retreat, in spite of a modest rally towards the close. March
closed at 2,568, down 11 on the day and some 4 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of 23. Turnover reached 7,266.
In traded options, volume of 41,447 was again high though lower than
Wednesday's 51,352 contracts. The Footsie 100 option traded 5,955 contracts.
Hanson was the busiest stock option, trading a day's total of 4,630
contracts with the May 220 calls the busiest series. Cable and Wireless was
the second busiest stock option with County NatWest reported to have carried
out a 'short synthetic'.

FT  17 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: European leisure sector's high-profile
trio - Share price prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 16 disgruntled French building contractors alleged this week that
Euro Disney, the theme park operator, owed them FFr850m (Dollars 155m) in
unpaid bills.
Euro Disney shares shrugged off the allegation to close last night at
FFr147.5, within squeaking distance of their all-time high of FFr153 on
January 3. Over the past five months Euro Disney has outperformed the French
market by about 20 per cent.
Analysts disagree on the commercial prospects for the theme park, which is
due to open on a 5,000-acre complex east of Paris on April 12. There is
agreement on one point, however: the time to take profits is fast
approaching.
Analysts think the hype leading up to the opening of Euro Disney could lift
the shares still further, but Ms Anita Hibbert of Smith New Court points out
that the stock is on a prospective price-earnings ratio of close to 100.
Some analysts worry that if there are early organisational or teething
problems, this could set the park back. They also fret about the effects of
the cold Parisian winter and unreliable summer.
Ms Hibbert is among the Euro Disney optimists, in spite of having visited
the site in December when visibility was only 20 yards. She argues that the
novelty factor will boost winter attendances, if only in the first year.
Investors interested in a more established profits record might want to look
at PolyGram, the London-based music company whose shares are traded in
Amsterdam and New York.
Only 20 per cent of the shares are publicly traded, the rest being owned by
Philips, the Dutch electronics giant. There has been speculation that
Philips might want to reduce its holding, but given that PolyGram is one of
the troubled group's star performers, analysts do not expect that to happen
soon.
PolyGram - whose artists include Luciano Pavarotti, Sting, Dire Straits and
U2 - reported a 24.6 per cent rise in net income to Fl 147m in the first
half of last year, in spite of the economic downturn in the UK and the US.
The company has benefited from the popularity of high-margin compact discs,
which accounted for 48 per cent of unit sales in 1990, compared to 37 per
cent for the industry.
In spite of vigorous criticism from consumer organisations, music companies
have been able to keep European CD prices well above those for vinyl records
and cassette tapes. Worldwide unit sales of CDs rose 28 per cent to 770m in
1990. In the same year, worldwide sales of cassettes fell for the first time
since their introduction in 1965, dropping 6 per cent in unit terms to
1.45bn.
Following the recent decision of retailers, such as W H Smith in the UK, to
stop selling records, the relentless rise of CDs appears to be good news for
companies like PolyGram. Mr Bert Jansen of Paribas Capital Markets cautions,
however, that the rate of growth of CDs will probably slow with increasing
market penetration in the developed countries.
PolyGram is heavily involved in the development of Digital Compact Cassette
(DCC), a Philips invention which looks like an ordinary cassette but has a
sound quality equivalent to CD. Prospects for DCC look reasonably good, but
they are unlikely to grow at the same rate as CDs. On a prospective multiple
of 15, the shares are trading at a premium to the Dutch market average of 9,
Mr Jansen says, and he would only recommend buying them below Fl 38. The
shares closed yesterday at Fl40.10.
Turning back to France, and its hotel group, Accor, Ms Dominique Carrel of
Paribas says that the acquisition of Wagons-Lits, the Belgian tourism and
travel group, will lead to short-term weakness, since the early days will
probably require substantial restructuring. However, there is scope for
management improvement at Wagon-Lits and the longer-term outlook is seen as
good.

FT  17 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking dominates
continental trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING was the dominant feature on most bourses yesterday, with the
effect emphasised in late-closing markets by Wall Street's opening decline,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, closing early, saw the DAX index end only 1.16 lower at 1,666.34,
after Wednesday's 2.4 per cent gain and a 3.34 rise to 676.01 in the FAZ at
midsession. Thursday's enthusiasm for dealing subsided, volume falling from
Wednesday's DM10.1bn to DM7.8bn. But the short-term vogue for cyclical
stocks continued, said Mr Michael Geiger at County NatWest.
Chemicals fell out of favour after a rise of a few days, suggesting that
Germany at the moment is a traders' market. Bayer led the way down with a
DM6 fall to DM294.50 after a DM12.70 rise on Wednesday, with BASF DM2.80
lower at DM240.50.
Steels took over the running to the dismay of fundamental analysts, who
heard Thyssen's involvement in the purchase of east German petrol stations
(along with the retailer, Asko, which rose DM18 to DM6.50) advanced as one
reason for the sector's improvement. Klockner-Werke put on DM6.90, or more
than 6 per cent to DM118.40 although, said Mr Geiger, its 1991 results are
going to be 'dreadful', and its 1992 performance is likely to be worse.
PARIS concentrated on special situations, as its rise was interrupted by
Wall Street's weak start. The CAC 40 index went as high as 1,877.57 before
closing 13.44 lower at 1,860.19 in estimated turnover of FFr3.1bn after
FFr4.3bn.
Eurotunnel bucked the trend and jumped FFr1.90 or 4.2 per cent to FFr47.40
with 261,620 shares traded, on talk that it was close to resolving its
dispute with TML, the consortium building the tunnel.
Lyonnaise-Dumez recovered from the day's lows of FFr436.50 to close just 90
centimes down at FFr442.50 on a company statement late in the day that 1991
net profit fell by about 20 per cent from 1990 levels, a smaller fall than
the market had been expecting.
The luxury group LVMH fell FFr150 or 3.4 per cent to FFr4,270 on rumours of
downgradings or a rights issue.
Among smaller stocks, Perrier rose FFr30 or 2.2 per cent to FFr1,388 on
volume of 55,000 shares on hopes that the company's controlling shareholders
would have to make a full bid. The media group, Hachette, rose FFr10.40 or
7.1 per cent to FFr157.90 on news that the Italian businessman, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, had offered to rescue the troubled TV station, La Cinq. Weakness
in US pharmaceuticals pulled Sanofi down by FFr44 or 3.8 per cent to
FFr1,090.
STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trade, the Affarsvarlden General index closing
5.7 higher at 980.4. Dealers said that advances among cyclically-sensitive
shares, such as those in the forestry sector, helped turn the trend after an
earlier fall on profit-taking.
The forestry sector rose 2.1 per cent with Stora B closing SKr13 higher at
SKr286. Turnover was SKr777m, up from SKr721m previously.
HELSINKI's remarkable resurgence continued, the market ending at a 1992 high
in the biggest volume so far this year. The Hex index rose 16.58 to 893.70.
'Demand remains strong, there are no signs of an end to the rally', said one
broker.
Nokia fell FM2.5 to FM60 on the announcement that Mr Jorma Ollila, the
president of Nokia Mobile Phones, would replace Mr Simo Vuorilehto as the
industrial conglomerate's chief executive immediately and will take over the
chairmanship in June.
COPENHAGEN's CSE index was down 2.34 to 362.95 on profit-taking brought on
by fears over how Wall Street would react at the opening. Banks, insurers
and industrial all declined.
Novo Nordisk's fall of DKr18 to Dkr546 followed the decline in
pharmaceutical shares in London and Wall Street, and helped depress the
market.
OSLO industrials were underpinned by higher aluminium and oil prices, and
the all share index rose 2.86 to 455.32.
MILAN closed firmer on the first day of the February trading account but
came off the day's highs on profit-taking. The Comit index rose 3.57 to
551.03 in turnover estimated at less than Wednesday's L172.2bn.
Pirelli continued its recovery, closing up 7 per cent or L79 at L1,202.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed as Wall Street opened lower. The CBS Tendency Index
fell 0.1 to 120.2. Profit taking and a weaker dollar sent Aegon 20 cents
lower to Fl 127.00 while Amev closed 90 cents down at Fl 54.30.
ZURICH ended lower after two days of gains, turnover tailing off in the
afternoon after active early dealings. The all-share SPI index fell 4.5 to
1,106.7 after rising three points in mid-morning.
MADRID, which liked Wednesday's consumer price inflation data, decided to
worry about the subsequently published rise in the core inflation rate from
6.1 per cent in 1990 to 6.5 per cent in 1991. The general index closed 1.82
lower at 256.68, in volume estimated at around Pta17bn.
ISTANBUL soared 9.2 per cent to its highest level since February 27, 1991,
on reports that the government would reveal measures to boost stock market
activity on Saturday. The 75-share index rose 431.67 to 5,128.91 in turnover
of around TL500bn.

FT  17 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Yen's sharp decline
wipes out Nikkei's early gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES received an early boost from New York's record close overnight but
quickly retreated on pressure from the yen and index-linked and arbitrage
selling, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 162.94 at 21,612.19, the lowest finish since
December 11 1991. It hit a daily high of 22,134.88 and a low of 21,500.55.
Volume rose to 240m shares after Tuesday's 179m. The market was closed on
Wednesday for a national holiday.
Declines outnumbered rises by 597 to 353 with 168 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first-section stocks fell 6.02 to 1,618.38 and in London
trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.35 to 1,228.88.
The early morning surge on index-related and foreign buying quickly ran out
of steam. Weakness in the bond market and the yen's sharp decline against
the dollar prompted unloading of shares and triggered sell programs among
foreign institutions.
Many investors took a wait-and-see stance amid continuing trust fund and
corporate sales and the unfolding scandal involving Mr Fumio Abe, former
secretary general of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's ruling party faction.
'Some people think that if the Nikkei breaks below strong (technical)
support at 21,600, it will hit 20,000 in the next few days,' said Mr
Masateru Igata of Salomon Brothers.
Speculative issues were the day's biggest losers, with Takuma off Y180, or
14 per cent, at Y1,080 and Clarion down by Y100 at Y830. Talk of financial
trouble among speculative groups led to the sell-off, in a sector which has
outperformed the Nikkei index by about 20 per cent in recent weeks, noted Mr
Igata.
Export-oriented shares fared well on the yen's decline, with TDK advancing
Y230 to Y4,230 and Sony Y80 to Y4,080. Financials also advanced, with
Industrial Bank of Japan up Y50 to Y2,950 and Daiwa Securities Y20 to
Y1,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 140.96 to 23,057.71 in volume of 27.4m
shares. Nissei Build lost Y160 to Y4,610.
Roundup
HONG KONG continued to power ahead, as Wall Street encouraged most of the
region.
HONG KONG advanced solidly to a third consecutive record high, helped by
Wall Street and optimism over US-Sino trade talks. The Hang Seng Index
climbed 29.48 to 4,412.14 in turnover of HKDollars 1.92bn, up from HKDollars
1.76bn.
Property counters turned in the day's best gains, while other important
sectors were moderately higher.
SINGAPORE rose for the second consecutive day and the positive sentiment
spilled over into KUALA LUMPUR. The Straits Times Industrials Index ended
19.75 or 1.3 per cent up at 1,529.05 in turnover of SDollars 305.7m after
SDollars 235.5m. The KLSE composite index climbed 16.95 or 3.1 per cent to
569.23, its highest close since August 14, in turnover of MDollars 187.6m
after MDollars 92.1m.
Singapore motor dealer Cycle &amp; Carriage jumped 45 cents to SDollars 6.90 in
an active 864,000 shares, on reports that the company's motor franchises
have been increasing their market share in spite of government measures to
control car growth.
TAIWAN closed above 5,000 for the first time in five months on expectations
of a cut in domestic oil prices. The weighted index, wavering in a 100-point
range all day, ended 83.89 or 1.7 per cent higher at 5,022.96 in turnover of
TDollars 49.3bn after TDollars 48.7bn.
AUSTRALIA lost ground on rumours that the budget deficit had soared to
ADollars 9bn from the official forecast of ADollars 4.7bn. The All
Ordinaries index closed at 1,673.5, down 2.1, in turnover of ADollars 275m.
The finance minister, Mr Ralph Willis, denied the rumours after hours.
The All Resources index held on to early gains, rising 5.5 to 954.4 with the
help of the lower Australian dollar.
Turnover included the placing of 5m MIM shares at ADollars 2.40 by McIntosh
Securities. MIM closed five cents lower at ADollars 2.39. The fall follows
Wednesday's announcement that interim net profit had slumped to ADollars 16m
from ADollars 67.5m a year ago.
NEW ZEALAND was lifted by a 22 cent rise in Fletcher Challenge to NZDollars

FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Four sites short-listed Pounds
25m abattoir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTEX, THE rapidly-growing New Zealand meat-processing company, is to set
up a Pounds 25m abattoir and meat plant in Europe.
It has identified four sites and will make a decision in May. The front
runners are thought to be Welshpool in Wales and Lockerbie in Scotland.
Fortex is also looking at a site in the West Midlands and a fourth thought
to be on the continent. The plant would employ 750 full- and part-time
workers and Mr Glyn Davies, chairman of the Development Board for Rural
Wales, said in Newtown yesterday that 'the scale of this proposal is so
enormous, and the impact on the UK lamb market could be so dramatic, that it
needs to be very carefully considered.'
The plant would essentially handle lamb and other sheep products.
Under European Commission regulations that come into operation in January
1993 a big shake-up will take place in the meat-processing industry. Many
small abattoirs, unable to meet more stringent health regulations, will
close, putting at risk the ability of producers to sell their stock to the
supermarkets under their own labels. There are 60 abattoirs in Wales but it
is thought that next year as few as four will meet the health regulations.
Some 2m lambs from Welsh farms are already slaughtered outside Wales and
many of the 2m slaughtered within the country would, without the Fortex
investment, then have to be sent, live, to other abattoirs around Britain.
Under present rules these could no longer be sold as Welsh lamb. Lamb can
only be sold under a generic label - Welsh lamb, Devon lamb - if it is
slaughtered in the area.
Forex has grown rapidly since it was set up 5 years ago and now has a
turnover of Pounds 100m. It has about a fifth of the New Zealand market and
would probably want to use a British food-processing plant for some exports
to the EC. A new plant would allow New Zealand not just an entry into Europe
but also a foothold in an expanding sector.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rally on hopes of
output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES bounced back yesterday as the market was cheered by willingness
among producers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
shave output. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil for March delivery was
22 1/2 cents higher at Dollars 18.12 1/2 a barrel.
The market has risen by almost Dollars 2 a barrel so far this week following
successive announcements from Opec members that they would cut output. The
cuts of some 50,000 barrels a day each are nominal, but the co-operation
between producers has led the market to hope that agreement will be reached
swiftly to make more meaningful cuts at February's meeting.
Nigeria became the latest Opec member to signal its unwillingness to accept
lower prices yesterday when oil minister, Mr Jibril Aminu, said the country
would cut back by 50,000 b/d. Nigeria followed the lead by Venezuela last
week and the announcement by Libya on Tuesday that it would cut 30,000 b/d.
Algeria also indicated yesterday it would be willing to make a voluntary cut
in output. The oil market is, in part, reacting to uncertainty cast over
Algeria's oil sector by the country's political problems and the rise of
religious fundamentalism, which could put off western investors.
The smaller producers who called for an emergency Opec meeting when prices
tumbled late last year, are giving a clear signal to Saudi Arabia, the
export leader, that they will co-operate with production cuts. Saudi Arabia,
Opec's largest producer, is unwilling to carry the burden of cutting back
alone.
Oil prices in New York rose by some 40 cents to Dollars 19.36 a barrel for
the March futures contract in late trading yesterday.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Plunge continues in UK farmers'
incomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FARM INCOMES plunged by 14 per cent last year to Pounds 1.22bn, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture's annual report.
The figure, which reflects income for farmers and their spouses, compares
with Pounds 1.5bn in 1989 and a peak of more than Pounds 2bn in 1984.
Total income from farming, which includes earning attributable to partners,
directors and other family workers, fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 2.17bn.
Mr John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, said 1991 was not an easy year
for British farmers, who continued to face uncertainty over the reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy and the Uruguay round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. While agricultural productivity continued to
rise (by 3 per cent), farm incomes had been hit by increased input prices
(up almost 4 per cent) and lower returns (averaging 1 per cent).
Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the report
made grim reading.
'These income statistics are appalling. They not only confirm the downward
trend of the past years but bring the industry's real income to its lowest
level since the last world war,' he said. The fall was all the more worrying
because it had occurred in spite of a better harvest in some parts of the
country.
The number of full-time farmers continues to fall and now stands at 178,000
compared with 183,000. The industry's bank loans and overdrafts stood at
Pounds 6.55bn at the end of December 1990, compared with Pounds 6.4bn the
year before. But the fall in interest rates last year reduced interest
charges to Pounds 899m from Pounds 1.05bn in 1990.
The report says the fortunes of different types of farm across the UK varied
considerably. 'In most of the country cereal and cropping farms fared
relatively well in 1991, but in Scotland the high yields of the previous
year have not been repeated and incomes are forecast to fall.'
Livestock farm incomes had improved, while those on dairy farms had
declined. Pig and poultry farmers had suffered a sharp reduction in prices.

Silver closed at the highest level for six months on the London bullion
market after a further strong technical rally on Comex. Sustained commission
house and fund chart-based buying on Comex pushed silver through key
resistance points at 420 and 425 cents a troy ounce, easily absorbing heavy
Middle East selling, dealers said. Analysts said the rally had also been
fuelled by sentiment that the US economy is recovering, potentially boosting
demand for silver, now widely viewed as an industrial metal. Silver's rise
inspired an advance in the London gold market, but stiff technical
resistance was hit at Dollars 357 a troy ounce, which attracted producer
selling. Platinum also closed higher in London. Nymex platinum futures were
ahead at midday, helped by news that South Africa's Impala had said that
some expansion plans are threatened by low metal prices and labour
disruptions. London cocoa prices closed ahead as sentiment was boosted by
the 10.8 per cent rise in UK fourth-quarter grind figures. Cumulative Ivory
Coast arrivals were reported to be more than 450,000 tonnes by the end of
last week but are expected to begin falling away. Chicago wheat prices were
again higher at midday, with traders reluctant to sell.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government decided yesterday to import 1m tonnes of wheat to
bring down the price of the grain in the open market.
Wheat prices have been rising in India despite releases from the official
stocks for the public distribution system. This is thought to be because
farmers and distributors have been hoarding stocks.
The surprise decision was taken by the cabinet committee on prices and will
mean that India, which is a surplus grain producer, will become an importer
again after many years.
India has substantial stocks of wheat, thought to be over 5m tonnes. This
figure is bound to increase with the harvesting of the winter grain crop,
which is expected to be bumper one.
The import plan highlights the determination of the government to check
inflation, running now at 14 per cent.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc missing from statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 100,000 tonnes of zinc cannot be accounted for by preliminary 1991
statistics drawn up by the International Lead and Zinc Study Group and some
of it is likely to show up in stocks early this year.
Already by mid-January London Metal Exchange stocks showed a rise of 6,000
tonnes and the ILZSG points out that this covered only Special High Grade
zinc and excluded any warehouse stocks of High Grade or GOB (Good Ordinary
Brand) metal, which go unreported.
The organisation also suggests that 'consumption in some countries may prove
to be slightly higher than the preliminary assessments when consolidated
annual data are fully complete'.
Preliminary figures indicate that zinc consumption last year fell by 58,000
tonnes or 1.1 per cent to 5.2m tonnes while both mine and refined metal
output advanced to new records: mine production was up by 127,000 tonnes or
2.4 per cent to 5.473m while refined metal moved up by 113,000 tonnes or 2.2
per cent to 5.298m tonnes.
Zinc supply was again swollen by large exports to the west from the former
eastern bloc countries. Net exports rose from 39,000 tonnes in 1990 to
80,000 tonnes.
Taking this into account, total apparent supply exceeded consumption by
about 170,000 to 180,000 tonnes. In 1990 there was a supply deficit of
68,000 tonnes.
However, compared with the indicated supply surplus of at least 170,000
tonnes last year, reported stocks at the end of 1991 were up by only 74,000
tonnes to 624,000 tonnes. The ILZSG is now start trawling through the
statistics for the 'missing' tonnage.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium leads advance in base
metals markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of aluminium, which usually leads metals in and out of recessions
because it is used in such a wide variety of products, rose steeply again
yesterday, recording an advance of 8 per cent in two days.
This triggered rises in other base metals prices on the London Metal
Exchange but most analysts suggested the movement was based on technical
factors and not by fundamental changes in outlook, which was still grim.
The nickel market did have some news to chew over, however, because a local
newspaper in the town of Nikel on the Kola peninsula quoted Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian President, as saying the huge nickel complex in the
area should be closed because it was uneconomic.
Analysts pointed out that Mr Yeltsin said this should happen after Russia
switches to a free market economy and that that could take a very long time.
They also doubted whether Russia would easily give up such a large foreign
currency earner.
Nickel's three-month price on the LME last night closed Dollars 195 a tonne
up at Dollars 7,597.50.
Aluminium's price moved up from Dollars 1,140 a tonne early on Wednesday to
a peak of Dollars 1,230 yesterday before easing back to close at Dollars
1,211.50, up Dollars 23. Analysts suggested that commodity investment funds
were active in the aluminium market this week and this attracted some
speculators.
There was also some selling by producers. Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group, said this indicated that
'aluminium producers feel that the market will get worse before it gets
better.'
However, Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, a Westpac banking group
subsidiary, said there were good reasons to believe that, for aluminium,
'from here on things don't get worse, they get better.' It was typical of
aluminium 'to recover early and powerfully' from recession.
The LME said again yesterday it would continue to monitor the zinc market
closely because of the technical tightness for metal for delivery in
February. But it lifted the Pounds 25 a tonne daily limit on the copper
backwardation imposed on December 3.

<TEXT>
ROBERT Fleming, the merchant banking group, is planning to launch a Dollars
100m Czechoslovakia investment trust with the backing of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The Czechoslovakia Investment Corporation will be the first closed-end
mutual fund open to foreign institutions, and will invest entirely in
Czechoslovak companies or commercial ventures, according to Robert Fleming.
The EBRD has agreed to be a leading shareholder in the investment trust,
with a view to lending to some of the companies which are selected for the
fund.
Robert Fleming has signed an agreement with Investicni Banka, the
Czechoslovak investment bank, whereby it has access to advance information
about companies seeking foreign capital. Investicni Banka is advising the
government on its privatisation programme. It already runs several domestic
mutual funds for which Robert Fleming is an adviser.
Robert Fleming has secured the right to invest on the same terms and
conditions as Investicni Banka's domestic funds.
The fund managers hope to raise more than Dollars 100m by placing units  -
each consisting of five shares and one warrant - with institutional
investors. The fund will be listed in London and in Prague once the stock
market opens there.
Several of the eastern European funds launched after the opening up of the
eastern bloc attracted considerable investor interest but faced problems
finding suitable investments.
Robert Fleming launched the Deutscheland Investment Corporation, a fund set
up for investment in eastern German concerns which is listed in London and
Berlin.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Percs re-emerges as Wall
Street buzzword - Patrick Harverson looks at the return of an attractively
simple stock derivative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN US investment bankers gather to discuss perks, the talk is usually of
company cars, golf club memberships and 'meetings' in Aspen.
This past year, however, whenever Wall Street's finest have gathered, the
talk is more likely to have been about 'Percs' than about perks.
Preferred equity redemption cumulative stock (Percs) is currently one of the
brightest stars in the corporate finance firmament. Between June and
November last year, a handful of big-name US issuers - including General
Motors, RJR Nabisco and K mart - raised more than Dollars 5bn through Percs.
Percs first surfaced in 1989 as a one-off issue for Avon Products designed
by Morgan Stanley. They then languished for three years, partly because
Avon's decision to cut its dividend alongside the issue, and the subsequent
failure of a vaguely similar product - Shearson Lehman's unbundled stock
units (USUs) - left a bad taste in investors' mouths about Percs.
However, when a cash-hungry GM reopened the file on Percs in the middle of
1991, Morgan Stanley was ready. Once the car-maker's issue was successfully
launched, other companies quickly jumped on the Percs bandwagon.
Unlike many fancy derivative-based products, the design of Percs is quite
simple. They are sold at the market price of the common stock, and are
mandatorily convertible at the end of three years. To attract investors, the
issuer offers a higher dividend than is available on the common, but in
return places a cap - usually 30 per cent - on the appreciation potential of
the Percs.
In effect, when investors purchase Percs they are really buying the common
stock from the issuer, and simultaneously selling the issuer a call option
on the stock - which is a right to buy it back at a predetermined price.
In the past this was known as a 'buy-write', and it involved two distinct
elements, the stock issue and the call option. The great strength of Percs
is that they combine the two in one, creating a simpler, more liquid product
with which investors feel more comfortable.
To the issuer, Percs are attractive in several ways. The company can raise
large amounts of money through an equity product without adding new debt to
its balance sheet. The ratings agencies treat them like common stock, and
they are a highly liquid financial asset.
Issuers also stand to benefit if their share price rises above the cap. Once
the cap has been passed, when conversion time comes around investors do not
receive one common share for each Percs share, but instead get less than
one, with the conversion ratio calculated so that the market value of the
common issued equals the cap. So for every cent or dollar the stock rises
above the cap, the Percs issue becomes more cost-effective and less dilutive
for the issuer.
Perhaps the biggest attraction of Percs is that they enable issuers to tap a
wider audience of potential investors, particularly those which would
normally steer clear of issues of common stock because of the poor yields on
offer.
For investors, the lure of Percs is also clear. In a low-interest rate
environment they offer higher yields than conventional forms of stock such
as common or convertible preferred, and they offer poten-tial for capital
gains on top.
General Motors, for example, issued Dollars 641m of Percs carrying a
dividend yield of 8 per cent - the common yielded only 3.9 per cent at the
time - and a cap of 30 per cent. Even with a ceiling on capital growth, if
the GM share price appreciates over the three-year life of the issue,
investors could enjoy an annual percentage return in the high teens.
The downside for the investor comes if the underlying common stock performs
badly over the three years. Then, the loss taken on conversion is
inadequately compensated by the higher dividend yield offered at the issue
launch.
Percs, therefore, should only be for sophisticated investors who understand
the relationship between the high yield and the equity risk. So far,
although there has been some overseas institutions among Percs buyers, most
have been from the US, primarily income funds and other institutions in
search of high-yielding, relatively low-risk equities.

CREDIT Lyonnais Securities (Asia) has extended the cut-off date for placing
its newly-launched Vietnam Growth Fund due to a disappointing take-up,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The securities firm said: 'It is taking longer to place than we had hoped.
The placement period is being extended and the reason for this is the
unusual nature of the fund.' The new deadline will be April 11.
The closed-end, 25-year fund for direct investment in Vietnam had only
raised about Dollars 25m of the targeted Dollars 50m by the January 14
deadline, sources familiar with the fund said, though CLSA declined to say
how much had been raised.
Launched in November, it is the first fund authorised to invest directly in
Vietnamese companies and is aimed at institutional investors with a minimum
investment of Dollars 525,000.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Further Ecu issues reflect investors'
shift to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW bond offerings in Ecu emerged yesterday, reflecting the shift of
investor interest from the US to European markets.
Dealers said medium-term bonds in D-Marks, French francs and the Ecu had
been the main beneficiaries of disinvestment from the US Treasury market, on
expectations that interest rates in European markets will move down rather
than up.
There has also been substantial selling of Eurodollar bonds in the secondary
market - as investors tried to take profits - as the surplus of dollar paper
now in the primary market forced spreads to widen.
With substantial amounts of unsold Eurodollar bonds weighing down
underwriters' books, spreads on many recent issues widened by about 10 basis
points yesterday.
ABB International, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Heleba
International Finance, the German bank arm, both launched four-year deals on
Wednesday, which widened from 50 to 62 basis points and from 38 to 52 basis
points respectively. A three-year offering for Finnish Export Credit,
meanwhile, widened from 43 to 53 basis points above the US Treasury yield
curve.
In the Ecu sector, General Electric Capital and Credit Local launched
five-year offerings totalling Ecu750m.
The Ecu500m Credit Local deal was considered reasonably, but not generously,
priced to yield 8.62 per cent, and met firm demand. But General Electric's 8
3/8 per cent deal yielding 8.41 was considered over-aggressive.
Dealers said that, although demand for the Ecu was firm, investors are
looking for fair value and are still relatively cautious, given the recent
volatility of market conditions.
However, Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead underwriter of the transaction,
said the GEC name would attract Swiss retail investors.
Elsewhere, Pubco, a UK brewing joint venture, raised a further 32.5m of 11
1/4 per cent debentures due 2006 via Kleinwort Benson. The stock is
fungible, bringing the total size of the debenture issue to Pounds 87.5.
The deal uses a joint-venture structure devised by Kleinwort to cut
borrowing costs for small companies: the structure is open-ended so that
more bonds can be issued via the joint venture and more companies can join
the group with the consent of the existing partners.
Boddington was admitted to the group for this transaction, which now
consists of five brewers - the others are Daniel Thwaites, Morland, Greene
King, and Shepherd Neame. Of the new stock, Pounds 25m of the proceeds will
be lent on to Boddington, and Pounds 7.5m to Morland.
An earlier transaction for a group of five investment trust companies raised
Pounds 55m, and the technique could be extended to other areas where a group
of companies with broadly similar credit quality and financing requirements
can be assembled.
In the dollar sector, Eurofima issued Dollars 153.5m of underwritten
one-year notes under its Dollars 500m medium-term note programme. The
underwritten structure, creating a hybrid between medium-term note and
Eurobond, was used under an MTN programme by Swedish Export Credit last
year.
Hydro-Quebec is issuing Dollars 1bn of 30-year debentures in the US Yankee
bond market, via First Boston.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Vietnam set to license
foreign bank branches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM looks set to begin licensing foreign bank branches in a move keenly
awaited by banks seeking to take advantage of the country's market-oriented
economic reforms.
The State Bank of Vietnam, the communist country's central bank, has told
seven banks they have approval in principle to open branches, according to
foreign business sources quoted by Reuter from Hanoi yesterday.
However, it was not clear whether other banks would also be given approval
at this stage. At present, foreign banks may only have representative
offices, and there is one joint venture with an Indonesian bank.
The seven did not include Standard Chartered, which has developed a strong
profile in Vietnam through an active representative office. Standard
Chartered said in London its office in Ho Chi Minh City was being upgraded
towards branch status. However, it could not speculate on the precise timing
of the award of a licence.
Four French banks with representative offices in Vietnam were reported to be
among those given the green light for a branch. They are: Banque Nationale
de Paris, Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur, Credit Lyonnais and
Indosuez.
The other three - Bangkok Bank, ANZ, and a Taiwanese bank - do not have
representative offices. Mr Vo Van Kiet, Vietnam's prime minister, confirmed
during a visit by Mr Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, that
Bangkok Bank would be granted a licence.
The permitted scope of branch activities has yet to be made clear, though
foreign banks are keen to expand their trade financing operations. Vietnam's
banking system is under-developed, and banks including Standard Chartered
have been training local banks in skills such as foreign exchange trading.
In the longer term, Vietnam offers large potential for retail banking as the
government seeks to develop the infrastructure of a market economy. Several
foreign banks, including some from the US, are believed to be anxious to
begin retail business, though US banks are currently prevented from doing
business with Vietnam by a US embargo.

THE STOCK Exchange of Singapore (SES) is to introduce trading of stock
options in six local companies by the middle of this year, Reuter reports
from Singapore.
Mr George Teo, SES deputy chairman, told a seminar on Asian capital markets
that the six - which he did not name - would be among the 32 main board
companies traded under a central automated settlement system.
'Both put and call options will be introduced on six scripless equity
stocks,' he said.
The exchange would also select foreign brokers for SES international
membership, which gives wholly foreign-owned securities companies rights to
trade directly on the main board, the secondary board and the
over-the-counter market.
SES officials said the selections would be made in the first half of this
year.
Stockbrokers said about a dozen foreign securities houses, mostly from Japan
and Europe, were seeking international membership on the exchange.
Securities companies in South Korea are expected to be allowed to deal in
forward foreign exchange contracts on behalf of their clients, Mr Koh
Byung-woo, chairman of the Korea Stock Exchange said.
He told the seminar Seoul was aware of foreigners' concern over the risk of
changes in the South Korean currency's strength when they invest in Korean
stocks. The Korean stock market was opened to direct but limited foreign
investment this month.

THE troubled financial empire controlled until last month by Canada's
Belzberg family is being dismembered, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
North American Life Assurance, a subsidiary of Security Life of Boston, is
to acquire First City Trust from Harrowston Corp, previously known as First
City Financial. First City Financial was the Belzbergs' flagship company
during their corporate-raiding heyday in the mid-1980s, but control was
recently ceded to a group of Swiss bondholders as part of a financial
restructuring.
North American will invest CDollars 51m (USDollars 43.9m) in a new
subsidiary, while the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation and Quebec
Deposit Insurance Board will take up CDollars 175m in senior secured
debentures. Under the deal, about CDollars 100m of First City's debt and
preferred share obligations will be eliminated.
The new North American unit will recapitalise First City, which lost
CDollars 115m in the first nine months of last year, mainly from leasing and
equities investment.
First City Trust, with assets of CDollars 3.9bn on June 30 1991, is a
mid-sized deposit-taking institution whose businesses include mortgages and
fiduciary services.
North American, with assets of CDollars 7bn, is the latest Canadian life
insurance company to expand. It already offers real estate asset management,
investment counselling and mutual fund services.

<TEXT>
COST containment and forward selling helped the gold mines in the Anglo
American group, the world's largest gold producer, record a 13 per cent
increase in distributable profits to R183.3m (Dollars 65.6m) in the December
quarter.
The rise in profits came despite serious labour unrest during November at
the President Steyn mine in the Free State.
Mr Lionel Hewitt, managing director of the gold and uranium division, said
the bottom-line cost to Freegold, the umbrella company for the group's Free
State operations, had been about R7m.
Production during the quarter dropped to 27,513kg from 28,185kg, but the
mine was able to increase distributable profits by 6.4 per cent to R73.2m.
Vaal Reefs had a successful quarter, with distributable profits up by 29.6
per cent to R64.4m. Gold production was virtually unchanged at 18,443kg, but
total working costs declined by 6 per cent to R426.3m.
Western Deep Levels failed to repeat the exceptional performance of the
September quarter, with distributable profit dropping to R25.6m from R32.2m.
It was hit by a drop in gold production, to 10,061kg from 10,404kg, unit
working costs rising by 3 per cent to R24,245 per kg, and a slightly lower
gold price received.
Of the other mines, Elandsrand had a good quarter, lifting gold production
by 6.3 per cent to 3,857kg. Distributable profit nearly doubled to R12.2m.
Ergo, the dump treatment operation, lifted distributable profit 67 per cent
to R7m.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group and the world's ninth biggest
semiconductor maker, announced yesterday that it planned to close down a
25-year-old semiconductor factory near Salt Lake City, Utah by the end of
1992.
Production of semiconductors built at the Orem site will be transferred to
other factories in the US, Europe or the Asia Pacific area. The move is part
of Philips' efforts to enhance efficiency in its global semiconductor
business. Signetics, Philips' US chip subsidiary, has manufacturing
facilities in New Mexico and California.
Philips said the closure was a matter of streamlining operations and was not
a response to market conditions.
It will earmark an unspecified sum for transferring, retraining and finding
jobs for the factory's 900 employees. Signetics has a global workforce of
about 6,000 people.
Mr James Dykes, president of Signetics, said the Utah factory, which makes
chips on three and four-inch wafers rather than on the more advanced
six-inch variety, 'has been a workhorse for many years, but by today's
standards is an almost outdated facility'.

INTEL, the leading maker of computer microprocessor chips, reported strong
fourth-quarter results, bringing revenues and earnings for the year to
record levels and well above analysts' projections.
Dr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive, said: '1991 was an
outstanding year for Intel.' Revenues for the year rose by 22 per cent to
Dollars 4.78bn, up from Dollars 3.92bn in 1990. Net income was Dollars 819m,
or Dollars 3.92 a share, compared with Dollars 650m, or Dollars 3.20.
Fourth-quarter results were strong, with revenue of Dollars 1.21bn, up 15
per cent from Dollars 1.05bn for the same period in 1990.
Net income of Dollars 189m, or 90 cents a share, increased from Dollars
164m, or 80 cents, for the fourth quarter of 1990. Wall Street analysts had
forecast fourth-quarter earnings of about 84 cents a share.
Intel's success, in spite of a decline in semiconductor sales stems from the
popularity of its microprocessor products. Its 486 and 386 microprocessors
form the 'brains' of most personal computers.
For the first time, Intel's international business in 1991 exceeded its US
business.

ALCOA of Australia, the aluminium, alumina and gold producer, yesterday
reported a 51 per cent drop in net profits to ADollars 381m (USDollars 282m)
for the year to the end of December.
It said the fall was caused by lower prices for alumina, aluminium ingots
and gold, higher raw material costs, and the introduction of corporate
taxation on gold mining operations.
Much of the decline occurred in the final quarter, when net profits fell to
ADollars 77.8m, compared with ADollars 189.5m the previous year. Sales for
the year fell by 16 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn.
The company said its alumina and aluminium facilities operated at record
levels throughout the year. However, gold production fell from 183,000
tonnes to 167,000 tonnes, partly because of lower recovery grades.
The directors said the result was 'satisfactory' considering the difficult
market conditions. However, they warned the current year would be
'challenging' as market conditions continued to deteriorate.
Alcoa is 51 per cent owned by the Alumina Company of America and 49 per cent
by Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group.
The directors earlier declared a fully-franked final dividend of 24.1 cents
a share, equivalent to a return of ADollars 100m to shareholders.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chevron restructure plan cuts
2,500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas company, is to cut its workforce
by 2,500 people, about 5 per cent, and record a Dollars 270m fourth-quarter
charge as part of a restructuring plan.
Mr Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman, said 500 of the 2,500 jobs being eliminated
related to the company's refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The refinery
represents about 20 per cent of Chevron's total petroleum refining capacity
and its partial or full closure has been under review for some time.
Mr Derr said the company would focus on reducing operating costs. He added
that low natural gas prices, poor refining margins, the recession and
reduced demand for petroleum products had hampered Chevron's financial
results.
He said a final decision on Port Arthur would be made later this year. Among
the options is a complete shut down except for chemicals manufacturing -
this would cut about 1,600 jobs. At a minimum the refinery will cut capacity
by a third to 200,000 barrels a day.
The other 2,000 Chevron jobs will be eliminated by way of voluntary early
retirement, organisational changes and asset sales.
Mr Derr said that Dollars 185m of the Dollars 270m after-tax charges would
relate to Port Arthur. If the refinery were shut down Chevron would incur an
additional Dollars 200m charge.
Mr Derr announced plans to accelerate Chevron's programme to sell off more
of its non-strategic US oil and gas fields. He said new US environmental
regulations contained in the Clean Air Act would lead to costs of more than
Dollars 2bn over the next five years at Chevron's eight US refineries.
In the third quarter of 1991 Chevron's net profit fell by 22 per cent to
Dollars 313m.
Deliveries of petroleum products in the US - an important measure of demand
 -declined by 2 per cent in 1991, according to the American Petroleum
Institute (API). The industry association said oil's share of domestic US
energy consumption fell to less than 41 per cent in 1991, the lowest level
in 40 years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Agnelli family yesterday came under pressure to launch a direct bid
for Perrier, the French mineral water group, when the stock exchange
authorities refused exemption from the obligation to launch an offer.
Ifint, an Agnelli holding company, last month launched a FFr5.6bn (Dollars
1.03bn) offer for Exor, the holding company which controls Perrier. The Exor
offer has been cleared by the stock exchange and expires on January 24.
Having to bid for Perrier as well would be a costly setback, though
officials pointed out yesterday that the various stock exchange authorities
involved have not come to a final decision.
Exor and its allies, Societe Generale, the privatised bank and Saint-Louis,
a paper and packaging company, have together held 49.32 per cent of
Perrier's voting shares since Saint Louis earlier this month bought a 13.8
per centstake in the mineral water group.
They asked the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the regulatory
authority, to release them from the obligation to bid for Perrier on the
grounds that it had already been controlled by Exor for several years.
However, the CBV refused their request on the grounds that it did not have
enough information on the conditions under which Saint Louis bought a stake
in Perrier, a transaction which is now being examined by the Commission des
Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock market watchdog.
The Agnellis' advisers are understood to believe it is unlikely that Exor
will in the end be forced to make a full bid for Perrier.
The Saint Louis deal tightened the Agnellis' control over the mineral water
group, incidentally staving off a planned counter-bid from Nestle, the Swiss
food multinational. The CBV said it could not could not give exemption
'without knowing whether the normal market rules were allowed to come into
play,' during the Saint Louis purchase of Perrier shares.
A COB spokeswoman could not comment on the precise subject of the inquiry,
which she said would be completed as soon as possible.

new chief
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, the leading Finnish technology group, has appointed Mr Jorma Ollila,
the 41-year-old head of the company's mobile phones division, as president.
He takes on the top job at once.
He will also become chief executive and chairman on June 1 with the
retirement of Mr Simo Vuorilehto, aged 61, from those positions. By
combining the two senior positions Nokia will ensure Mr Ollila becomes a
powerful head of the company.
Mr Ollila, who has run Nokia's mobile phone division for the past two years,
is seen as a surprising choice. The decision has precipitated the
resignation of 42-year-old Mr Kalle Isokallio who, as the company's chief
operating officer and president since January 1990, had been widely tipped
to take the top job.
However, the board has been impressed by Mr Ollila's ability in transforming
the performance of Nokia's mobile phones division, which accounts for about
17 per cent of company sales. It has turned into the one positive business
area for the company, which will make a loss this year.
While other divisions suffered declining sales in the first eight months,
mobile phones enjoyed 20 per cent growth and a 50 per cent expansion in
output.
When Mr Ollila was put in charge of the mobile phones business in February
1990 it was making an operating loss, but in his first year he increased
Nokia's net mobile phone sales by 33 per cent to FM2.3bn (Dollars 522m) and
expanded its production capacity by 65 per cent from its 1989 level.
Early last year Nokia acquired Technophone of the UK for Pounds 34m (Dollars
60.86m) in a deal that by bringing Europe's two largest cellular
phone-makers together turned Nokia into the world's second largest
manufacturer after Motorola of the US.
Last summer, Mr Ollila reached a FM400m agreement with Microtel
Communications of the UK to supply infrastructure and hand-portable phones
for a personal communications network in Britain.
Nokia's new president has only been with the company since 1985 when
appointed vice-president of its international operations and then spent
three years as the company's finance officer. Before joining Nokia he was
employed by Citibank where he was account manager in London for two years.
A noted Anglophile who was educated at the Atlantic College in Britain, Mr
Ollila is an engineer with economics degrees from the London School of
Economics and Helsinki University.
His financing and marketing expertise combined with his record with mobile
phones convinced the board he was the man to revive the company's fortunes
in the 1990s.

at end of the year
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rene Jaggi, who became chief executive of Adidas, the German sports shoe
and clothing equipment group, four years ago, has decided not to stay on
when his contract expires at the end of this year.
He gave personal reasons for the decision, which comes as the company -
controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the French financier - is earning increased
profits. Yesterday, it reported a 3 per cent rise in sales to DM3.4bn
(Dollars 2.1bn) last year.
Total brand sales, including licence revenues, were DM4.7bn; in 1990, the
figure was DM4.8bn, but the Le Coq Sportif, Arena, and Pony brands, which
accounted for DM330m, have since been sold.
Mr Hans Friderichs, the head of Adidas's supervisory board, regretted Mr
Jaggi's decision to leave. Under Mr Jaggi's direction, he said, 'the group
has been put back on track and in the last two years the company again
earned profits'.
Since Mr Tapie and Mr Jaggi both have strong personalities, it is thought
there may have been differences of opinion over the running of the company;
Mr Jaggi also wanted employees to be offered a stake in Adidas.
The company gave no profit indications, but has forecast that pre-tax income
would rise by around 50 per cent to DM60m, with a further gain in 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state holding company, was yesterday poised to gain
parliamentary approval to take over ASST, the government department which
runs Italy's trunk inter-urban phone service and some international links.
The reform follows the government's recent approval for a new 'price cap'
structure for SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, which is part of the IRI
group. The 'price cap' will allow SIP to raise call charges and equipment
rentals automatically each year, subject to certain performance criteria.
Together, the two steps should enable SIP, which reported a 54 per cent rise
in last year's first-half operating profits to L604.5bn (Dollars 506m), to
raise earnings further.
Yesterday's parliamentary debate marks a major step in the realignment of
Italian telecommunications. Under the new law, ASST is likely to be
transfered to STET, the IRI-owned holding company which controls much of the
country's telecommunications services.
In time, the functions of ASST, which is currently part of the post
ministry, will be handed over to SIP. The division of responsibilities
between the two, and internal rivalries, have been among the biggest
handicaps to a more efficient telephone service in Italy.
The new law also provides guarantees for ASST's 18,000 workers, who will
theoretically lose their jobs-for-life guarantee as civil servants should
they accept the transfer to IRI.

<TEXT>
ALCATEL, the leading French telecommunications equipment group, is to stop
making its own facsimile machines within the next six months and move to
selling other producers' equipment under its own label.
The move, by France's largest producer of fax machines, marks the final
abandonment of the government's hopes for nurturing a domestic fax-making
industry, embodied in an unsuccessful 1979 plan to promote a cheap machine.
It comes in response to falling prices and margins and intense Japanese
competition, said the group, which added that it would continue to be 'on
the offensive' as a distributor.
Alcatel's own machines last year accounted for 18.6 per cent of the French
market, rising to 27.8 per cent - a total of 62,000 units - counting in
machines made by Alcatel for sale under other suppliers' labels, such as
France Telecom, the telecommunications operator.
Fax machine production will be moved gradually over to other producers, led
by Hewlett-Packard, the US computer group, and Sagem, a French
telecommunications equipment producer, who will make machines to Alcatel's
specifications and under its label.
SNCF, the French state railway, expects profits in 1991 to be stable
compared with 1990 on a slightly higher turnover of about FFr53.6bn (Dollars
9.92bn), Reuter reports from Paris.
A spokesman said the profit figure had not been determined, but that it
would be between break-even and 1990's FFr17m.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: General Motors to pull out of
car production in Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle-maker, is planning to
withdraw from car production in South Korea with the sale of its 50 per cent
stake in the troubled Daewoo Motor.
GM said yesterday it was 'exploring the possibility' of selling its stake to
the Daewoo Group, holder of the remaining equity in Daewoo Motor.
The disposal is a severe setback to GM's plans for expansion in the
Asia-Pacific region.
South Korea is expected to be one of the world's fastest-growing car markets
in the 1990s, but GM has decided to pull out of car-making in the country in
the face of its prolonged conflict with the Daewoo Group over the management
of Daewoo Motor.
GM said it would maintain its presence in Korea through a number of
automotive components joint ventures, which would also continue to supply
Daewoo Motor.
The disposal of the 50 per cent stake in Daewoo Motor was subject to the
negotiation of an 'acceptable' price and other terms, it said.
Earlier this week, GM announced that it had agreed to enter its first
vehicle production venture in China, where is it planning to assemble light
commercial vehicles.

<TEXT>
UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's largest insurance group, will suffer large share
portfolio losses and take other non-related charges against 1991 accounts
totalling more than NKr1bn (Dollars 156m).
The company said that by the end of 1991 its share portfolio had run up
losses of NKr940m following negative developments on the Oslo bourse in the
third quarter.
Uni Storebrand also said a NKr150m charge is to be made against 1991
accounts to cover losses on motor underwriting.
In 1990, Uni Storebrand made a net profit of NKr403m and suffered a loss on
its share portfolio of NKr373m. Last autumn, the group paid NKr4.2bn to
acquire a 25 per cent stake in Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer.
The company stressed that a large part of its share portfolio losses are due
to its position as a leading shareholder in loss-making Den norske Bank
(DnB) and Christiania Bank, Norway's two biggest banks.
They were rescued from insolvency last autumn by the state which injected
NKr11.5bn into the banking system.
'These shareholdings reduced investment income in 1991 by around NKr230m in
the group's non-life company and by NKr320m in the life assurance company,'
Uni Storebrand explained.
Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, was taken over by the state
last October, after which the bank was forced to write down its shares to
zero.
Uni Storebrand held 3m shares in Christiania Bank and 2.5m in DnB, which
holdings have since been slightly reduced.

FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Siemens ahead 6% in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, yesterday reported a 6
per cent rise in first-quarter net profits to DM398m (Dollars 249m) and
indicated that earnings for the year ending September 1992 would be around
DM2bn.
It said profits on industrial activities would improve this year after a 20
per cent fall in 1990-91, mainly caused by heavy losses on computers through
its acquisition of Nixdorf and on semi-conductors.
Siemens' profits growth last year stemmed from the doubling of its financial
income to around DM2bn. Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, the finance director, said
this mainly comprised interest on its large cash and securities holdings,
with Siemens also benefiting from lower write-downs to reflect the value of
its DM15bn of securities.
This year, Mr Baumann expected financial profits to decline slightly. Last
year's jump propelled group pre-tax profits 21 per cent ahead to DM3.4bn.
Because of higher taxes, net profits were only 7 per cent higher at DM1.8bn.
Computer activities produced a net loss of DM781m, which Siemens expects to
be reduced sharply this year. It is also striving to reduce the much
increased semi-conductor losses of some DM500m.
Last year's net profit was a return on turnover of 2.5 per cent, and Mr
Heinrich von Pierer, deputy chief executive and chief executive-designate,
said Siemens hoped to maintain the rate of return in 1991-92.
This yield would produce net profits of about DM2bn, based on his forecast
that turnover should rise by 10 per cent to just over DM80bn. He also
expected new orders to grow by 5 per cent to DM86bn, a sharp slowdown from
last year's 21 per cent increase.
The consolidation of new businesses accounted for 9 per cent of the inflow,
the rest mainly reflecting heavy demand for infrastructure-related products
in the energy, transport, and telecommunications fields. New orders in east
Germany totalled DM3.3bn.
In the first quarter of this year, the new order inflow eased by 1 per cent
to DM20.1bn, with a 4 per cent rise at home and a 5 per cent fall abroad.
Mr von Pierer said the economic slowdown in important markets such as the US
and parts of western Europe would be reflected in the order books.

GROUP net earnings of Safra Republic Holdings, the holding company for the
European private banking group headed by Mr Edmond Safra, jumped 18 per cent
last year to Dollars 84.5m, or Dollars 4.75 per share.
The group said net interest income rose 19 per cent to Dollars 149.8m due to
improved margins and growth in interest-earning assets. Foreign exchange
revenues and commission income also advanced.
Total assets at December 31 were Dollars 9.1bn, compared with Dollars 8.2bn
a year earlier. Client deposits rose to Dollars 6.1bn from Dollars 5.7bn and
client portfolio assets jumped to Dollars 2.2bn from Dollars 1.5bn. The
group operates banks active in international private and commercial banking
under the Republic National name in Geneva, Luxembourg, France, Guernsey and
Gibraltar.
Provisions for loan losses more than doubled to Dollars 19m from Dollars
7.7m in the previous year. Loans represent 14.5 per cent of total assets,
with the remainder invested primarily in deposits with leading international
banks and highly rated bonds. Non-performing loans were Dollars 15.3m at the
year-end.
Book value per share stood at Dollars 61.77 at December 31, compared with
Dollars 58.44 a year earlier. Shareholders' equity rose to Dollars 1.09bn
from Dollars 1.04bn, with approximately Dollars 10m of the increase arising
from the currency gain on the increase in the value of the company's Swiss
franc net investment in Republic National Bank of New York (Suisse).

consortium

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand German privatisation agency, in one of its biggest deals, is to
sell eastern Germany's Minol filling station company and the Leuna refinery
to a French-German consortium of Elf-Aquitaine, Thyssen and SB Kauf.
The consortium plans to invest DM5bn (Dollars 3.1bn) to build Europe's most
modern refinery at Leuna with a capacity of between 10m and 12.5m tons as
well as a new pipeline linking it to a Baltic port. It will also modernise
Minol's more than 900 filling stations.
Elf, France's largest company and partly state-owned, is to take a majority
stake in both Minol and the refinery.
British Petroleum, heading a consortium of Total, Statoil, Agip and OMV, was
the other main bidder.
Mr Wolf Schode, the Treuhand spokesman, hailed the decision as a milestone
toward rescuing the antiquated east German chemicals industry. The
Treuhand's managing board is expected to approve the recommendation, and a
final contract is to be signed next June.
Mr Schode said the sale would save more than 7,000 jobs in the east German
chemicals industry by making the loss-making Leuna chemical site attractive
for western investors.
The winning consortium agreed to provide the Leuna chemical plant with
competitively-priced feedstock and to accept as partners in the refinery
other investors in the petro-chemicals site.
Originally, the Treuhand wanted to sell Minol, which is highly profitable,
individually, but then decided to add it as a sweetener to the obsolescent,
loss-making Leuna refinery.
Minol is to be kept as an independent brand and is also to be introduced
into west Germany. The German Cartel Office approved the sale on condition
that a fixed number of Minol's filling stations be sold to medium-sized
operators. The present Leuna refinery, with a capacity of 7m tons, is
inter-connected with the chemicals plant which had sales of DM2.1bn last
year and losses of DM360m.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Irksome sting on the body corporate -
Richard Waters on a kind of greenmail by preference shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A quiet backwater of the investment world, there are occasional windfall
gains of more than 50 per cent to be made. Yet that has not stopped some
investors holding out for more - as Bass, the brewer, is the latest UK
company to discover. For opportunists, the returns could be substantial.
The brewery group is seeking to repay preference share capital with a
nominal value of about Pounds 6.5m - insignificant in the context of its
Pounds 570m rights issue last year. Its two long-standing preference share
issues, each with more than 3m shares outstanding, are small and troublesome
to administer: like several other UK companies in recent months, Bass has
decided these historical issues are no longer worth the effort.
Next Thursday, at its annual meeting in the Queen Elizabeth Conference
Centre in Westminster, holders of the preference shares will be asked to
agree.
Step forward the opportunists. Bass's effort to tidy up its balance sheet
relies on the agreement of preference stock holders. By withholding that
agreement, there is always a chance that Bass, or any other company in the
same position, would choose to pay an extra premium to resolve the issue,
rather than continue as before. It is a sophisticated, and occasionally
effective, form of greenmail.
Even without the additional premium, holding such preference shares can be
an attractive proposition. Generally, preference stock trades on a yield of
about 10 per cent. When repaid, companies are usually prepared to pay
investors a gross redemption (or 'exit') yield of between 6 and 6.5 per cent
 -a level long considered the norm by corporate financiers. It is also one
which has proved acceptable to the investment protection committees of
investor trade associations like the Association of British Insurers (ABI)
and the National Association of Pension Funds.
The sharp reduction in yield (and hence uplift in price of the particular
stock) represents a substantial capital gain. Bass' offer is no exception:
holders of its 4 per cent cumulative preference shares, for instance, are
being offered 57.5p per share - equivalent to an exit yield of 6.5 per cent.
The shares were trading at 38p for most of the last half of 1991, according
to a circular sent to shareholders.
But is that enough? Bass' articles of association - as with many other
companies - require it to repay capital at par (ie, 100p). Some shareholders
argue that it should honour that commitment - or at least offer something
closer to par than 57.5p.
Mr Richard Male, a small holder of the shares, says that Bass has failed to
alert its preference share holders to their rights under its articles of
association. It is not enough to offer less than par, and to justify this as
fair simply by reference to the opinion of a merchant bank.
Mr Stephen Cockburn is a specialist in preference shares. He runs three
investment trusts within the Aberdeen Trust group and is adamant that Bass
is short-changing its preference holders.
Mr Cockburn argues that, where the coupon on a preference issue is low,
companies try to repay at a discount to par to keep in the generally
accepted 6.5 per cent exit yield range. But where coupons are higher,
companies never offer to repay at a premium over par, and so exit yields
rise correspondingly above 6.5 per cent. The calculation never works in an
investor's favour, always the company's, he says.
The 100,000 shares held by Mr Cockburn's Danae Investment Trust are unlikely
to prevent Bass getting shareholder approval to repay the shares at less
than par. The ABI, whose members account for the bulk of holders, has
already given its approval. But others have experienced problems in the past
 -and may do so in future.

<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED reverse takeover of Bioplan Holdings, the private healthcare
company, by Hospital Corporation International of the US was approved by
Bioplan shareholders at an extraordinary meeting yesterday.
Bioplan pioneered the setting up of private medical facilities alongside
National Health Service hospitals, with which it had partnership agreements.
Its shares were suspended at 44p in November, giving it a market value of
Pounds 19.3m.
The suspension came less than seven months after Bioplan had raised Pounds
22.8m in a rights issue and only four months after it moved up from the USM
to the main market.
Dealings in the company's shares, under its new name, Hospital Corporation
International Group, will commence today.
Mr Bob Nellist, chairman of Bioplan, is remaining as chairman of the new
group. Mr Dennis Sokol of HCI is to become deputy chairman and group chief
executive.
Under the deal HCI shareholders will gain initial control of 45 per cent of
the enlarged group.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sale by Polly Peck offshoot raises Dollars
24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A further rationalisation of Polly Peck International's Turkish
businesses, Vestel, its consumer electronics subsidiary, has raised Dollars
24m (Pounds 13m) to fund working capital needs with the sale of its new
Istanbul headquarters.
Mr Tahsin Karan, Vestel chairman, confirmed yesterday that Garanti Bank, a
privately owned Turkish bank, had bought the company's Maslak building.
Vestel paid Dollars 20m for the property in 1990 as the headquarters for all
Polly Peck companies in Turkey.
The sale follows a shake-up of the board in November, and moves to sell a
minority stake in the company by the administrators of Polly Peck. Vestel
sold 18 per cent of its equity on the Istanbul stock exchange in 1990.
The company last year secured short-term finance from a group of banks and a
Dollars 10m suppliers credit from Goldstar of South Korea.
The company is heavily dependent on imported components and has been badly
hit by the collapse of Polly Peck, which in the past provided much of
Vestel's short-term finance, through letter of credit.
Mr Karan said yesterday the proceeds would not be transferred to the
administrators but used for working capital and to reduce gearing.
He added that the administrators were still looking for a strategic minority
partner for Vestel, Turkey's largest exporter of televisions and the third
largest domestic white and brown goods producer. However, he ruled out any
early sale, particularly given the company's depressed price on the Istanbul
stock exchange.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lookers halved to Pounds 3.21m as new
vehicle sales decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR DEALERS are looking for a helping hand from the Budget rather than the
blows inflicted by the government last year in terms of company car taxation
and VAT, according to Mr Ken Martindale, chairman of Lookers.
Pre-tax profits fell 50 per cent to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 6.45m) in the year
to September 30 as the Manchester-based dealer suffered along with others in
the sector from a drop in new car sales from nearly 2m in 1990 to 1.59m last
year.
Mr Martindale said: 'There will be a recovery because replacement decisions
have been deferred. But it depends on the Budget.
'The government might reduce car tax, and it might not have the carelessness
to increase company car tax and VAT, as it did last year after 15 months of
falling sales.' He reckoned that new car sales might recover to between
1.65m and 1.7m this year.
Operating profit fell 22 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 14.2m) on turnover
of Pounds 359.6m (Pounds 370.5m). Interest costs rose to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds
7.71m).
The group incurred a retained loss of nearly Pounds 800,000. Mr Martindale
said this was roughly equal to the provision made for deferred taxation
following a decision to reduce contract hire.
About Pounds 25m of the group's net debt of Pounds 45m - gearing of 115 per
cent - was related to contract hire. 'Debt is a dirty word at the moment,'
he said. Gearing would be reduced particularly in 1992-93 and the year
after.
The main reason for the profit fall was motor distribution, including
contract hire, which contributed Pounds 5.27m after interest but before head
office costs.
The group's leading franchises are Vauxhall and Rover. A recent development
is the opening of three Nissan dealerships.
New car sales were down in numbers and margin; used cars were up on both
counts. Servicing and parts advanced and accounted for 70 per cent of group
profits, he said.
Conditions were worst in the south-east and Mr Martindale admitted that
expansion there could have been better timed - it paid Pounds 14m, mainly in
convertible preference shares, for SMAC in the summer of 1989.
Profit from caravans - mainly holiday parks - slipped to Pounds 427,000 and
the loss on agricultural equipment grew to Pounds 415,000.
Property gains of Pounds 513,000 (Pounds 408,000) were taken above the line.
Although earnings per share slid to 2.1p (16.8p), the final dividend is held
at 4.2p for a maintained total of 6.2p.

Chartwell Group, a maker of floor coverings, suffered from deteriorating
trading conditions and saw turnover fall from Pounds 8.24m to Pounds 6.09m
and pre-tax profit from Pounds 564,000 to Pounds 41,000 in the half-year
ended September 30 1991.
The results include sales of Pounds 1.49m and losses of Pounds 51,000
attributable to Plasmarc, which has since been sold for Pounds 675,000.
Directors said the disappointing results stemmed from the recession in
general and the severe slump in the construction industry. There was little
sign of recovery, they added.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.4p (5.9p).

<TEXT>
Careful control of cash and overheads boosted pre-tax profits at Technology
Holdings by 51 per cent in the year to June 30 1991.
Profits for this computer distributor, systems supplier and computing
services company, were Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3.5m) on sales ahead to Pounds
130.2m (Pounds 127.2m).
Privately held, the company was formed by a management buy-out from MBS, the
computer distributor, in February 1989. Retained profit for the year
totalled Pounds 7.08m (Pounds 3.52m) after taking into account an
extraordinary gain of Pounds 2.04m through the redemption of a vendor loan
note.
The final dividend is 2.5p for a total of 8.1p.
Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and managing director, said that comparatively flat
revenue growth hid a number of changes as the business was redefined.
High volume, low profit services were dropped in favour of products and
services offering higher margins.
Mr Lewis said distribution now comprised less than 20 per cent of turnover
and about 3 per cent of profit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SW Wood, the metals trader which recently diversified into packaging and
printing with August's acquisition of Proofed Packaging Printers, has made
another purchase in the sector.
It has acquired Grange Group, a specialist magazine printer, for an initial
Pounds 1.37m cash and the issue of 2.34m new ordinary shares. At Wednesday's
closing price of 72 1/2 p, the aggregate consideration is Pounds 3.06m.
Further consideration, up to a maximum of Pounds 1m, is dependent of
Grange's pre-tax profits in 1992 and is payable in cash or shares, as Wood
chooses.
Wood is financing the initial cash element of the acquisition with a placing
and open offer of 3.91m new ordinary shares at 65p apiece to raise Pounds
2.1m net. The offer is on a 1-for-2 basis. The balance of the proceeds will
increase cash resources.
Grange made pre-tax profits of Pounds 273,000 in the nine months to
September 30 1991 and net assets were Pounds 872,000 at that date. More than
half its current turnover derives from regular journal work from publishers
such as Euromoney, Centaur and International Thomson.

The restructuring at Norbain Electronics, aimed at focusing on the security
market, affected the performance in the half year to October 31 1991.
Sales fell 29 per cent to Pounds 5.75m (Pounds 8.14m) while pre-tax profit
slumped 84 per cent to Pounds 33,000 (Pounds 205,000). Earnings per share
came to 0.33p (2.06p).
The results reflected the disposal of the Technology division and an
increase in bad debts.
Despite difficult trading conditions turnover for the remaining security
business remained level with last year.
The improvement in the underlying sales trend, together with an estimated
temporary decrease in the CCTV market size of 15 per cent, meant the group
had substantially increased market penetration and turnover for its core
security business. Gross margins were being maintained.

Investment income totalled Pounds 190,000 (Pounds 182,000) and net rents
came to Pounds 5,000 (Pounds 8,000). Realised and unrealised surpluses on
sales and revaluations of properties and investment were credited direct to
general reserve.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hampson still waiting for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hampson Industries, the West Midlands-based industrial company, said it was
still awaiting a recovery as it reported interim pre-tax profits down by 39
per cent.
However, Mr John Wardle, chairman, said the second half should return to
normal patterns and show a marked improvement. Though he added that it would
owe nothing 'to any vague hopes of an improvement in the economic scene'.
Profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 2.64m)
on turnover of Pounds 37.1m (Pounds 36.6m). Earnings per share came out at
1.36p (2.48p) basic or 1.45p (2.38p) diluted and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.6p.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thos French doubles to Pounds 753,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas French &amp; Sons, which makes decorative products for home furnishing
including Rufflette curtain tape, showed a measure of recovery in the year
to September 28 1991, doubling its pre-tax profit from Pounds 368,000 to
Pounds 753,000.
However, that was still somewhat short of previous years - Pounds 2m for
1988-89 and Pounds 1.5m in the preceding period.
Sales fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 13.7m but trading profit improved
from Pounds 820,000 to Pounds 941,000. About 26 per cent of the sales ecline
was the result of withdrawing from some business areas, and 7 per cent was
attributable to continuing businesses.
But, said Mr Jeremy French, chairman, that potentially damaging reduction
was more than countered by cost-cutting measures, to the extent that sales
per employee increased 12 per cent and profit per employee almost trebled.
Interest costs were cut substantially to Pounds 188,000 (Pounds 452,000),
stemming from tight control of working capital and investment and the sale
of the surface heating business. Net borrowings were virtually nil at the
year-end, Mr French stated.
Earnings per share came to 4.41p (1.93p). The final dividend is again 2.175p
for an unchanged total of 3.625p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's reinsurance broker, expanded
some 7 per cent over the 12 months to end-September 1991.
However, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, chairman, was guarded on current trading:
'Prospects for the current year are mixed; the . . . markets in which we
operate are in a state of considerable change. It is not possible to be at
all definite about 1992.'
The profits increase - from Pounds 2.67m to Pounds 2.86m - was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 13.8m) and struck after interest charges
reduced from Pounds 944,000 to Pounds 217,000.
Earnings per share emerged at 9.2p, down from 9.5p reflecting increased
capital after the previous year's rights issue. A final dividend of 2.5p is
recommended, making 4p (3.5p).

AN IMPROVED second half enabled Davenport Vernon, the multi-franchise motor
dealer operating from 17 locations, to cut its pre-tax shortfall to 27 per
cent in the year ended September 30 1991.
The profit worked through at Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.96m) after being 50 per
cent behind at the halfway mark. Mr Ralph Denne, chairman and managing
director, said the increase in activity was particularly evident between
July and September, and reflected a better level of customer confidence
which continued into the current year.
Although difficult conditions continued, he said 'our experience at
Davenport Vernon is that this recession has not been as severe as those of
1975 and 1981'. Turnover was ahead to Pounds 99.7m (Pounds 94.9m) but
operating profit fell to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.1m). Interest charges took
Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.14m).
Earnings per share dropped to 7.3p (10.3p) and the proposed final dividend
is 2.5p for a same-again total of 4p.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Finnish zinc move angers Conroy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Conroy, chairman and chief executive of Conroy Petroleum, the
Irish natural resources company, claimed yesterday that Outokumpu, the
Finnish mining group, had tried to obtain 100 per cent control over the
marketing of zinc produced from an important ore discovery in Ireland.
Mr Conroy said that Outokumpu 'had demanded that the company sign over the
marketing of 100 per cent of the ore' in return for technical assistance in
making an application for planning permission to develop the 6.2m tonne
Galmoy ore deposit, located 70 miles south-west of Dublin.
'This could not be considered to be in the best interests of the other
shareholders' he said.
Mr Graham Mascall, a senior executive of Outokumpu, confirmed yesterday that
his company's offer of assistance to Conroy had been turned down, adding
that a 'commercial price was requested for our services'.
Last month, Conroy bought out Atlantic Resources, a struggling oil and gas
exploration company in a share-exchange deal valued at IPounds 7.7m (Pounds
7.2m).
This was widely interpreted as a move to dilute stakes in Conroy held by
Outukumpu's and Dundee Bankcorp, a banking offshoot of Corona International,
the Canadian mining group.
This provoked anger from Outokumpu and Dundee, which together held just over
50 per cent of Conroy's shares before the Atlantic deal.
The two shareholders then demanded an EGM with the aim of ousting the Conroy
board.
The EGM is scheduled for February 8.
Mr Mascall, and Mr Paul Carroll, a director of Dundee, said that their
companies will 'review' their investment in Conroy, if they fail in their
attempt to oust the board.
Mr Conroy said yesterday: 'I am prepared to talk with both companies' but
claimed that they were trying 'to carry out a takeover on the cheap'.
Should they decide to pull out of Conroy 'It might be healthy for the
company' he said.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lower overheads help Stanley edge ahead 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED overheads helped Stanley Leisure Organisation, the betting shop,
casino and snooker club group, inch ahead in the six months to October 27
1991, with a 6.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.73m.
The improvement was struck on turnover just 3.6 per cent higher at Pounds
100.3m.
Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said the difficult conditions of the first
half were continuing in the second six months, with sales in the casino and
racing divisions only marginally ahead of last year.
The casino division, which suffered severely from recession last year, had
shown a 'modest improvement'.
Cost-cutting had helped boost margins, although only slightly, he said.
The spend per head - which in 1989 stood at Pounds 100 - was beginning to
recover from last year's tumble and averaged about Pounds 90 in the first
half.
Stanley operates 17 provincial casinos, which contribute roughly 50 per cent
of annual profits.
Mr Steinberg said the group had considered buying the 19 Stakis casinos  -
which were taken off the block this week - but the Pounds 100m price tag had
been too high.
Turnover advanced slightly in the racing division, which includes the
group's 327 betting shops.
The company said about six of the shops were loss-making. Average bets still
languished at last year's levels of Pounds 3.39 but margins remained steady.
Since the end of October, Stanley has purchased 25 betting shops for Pounds
4m.
The acquisition has pushed up debt, which was Pounds 29m at the end of the
half. Gearing was just over 30 per cent, Stanley said.
Stanley's four snooker clubs continued to disappoint, and the group said it
was prepared to sell the businesses for the right price. It is believed the
clubs are making a marginal profit.
The group's loss-making printing business was sold during the six months for
a book profit of Pounds 347,000.
However, this was offset against a Pounds 1.9m extraordinary charge for the
goodwill written off on the business when it was purchased in 1988.
The recharging of goodwill through the profit and loss account is the result
of accounting standard changes introduced before Christmas.
As a result of the extraordinary charge, the retained profit was down
sharply from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 195,000. However, Mr Steinberg stressed
that, in real terms, 'reserves have increased by about Pounds 2.1m'.
Earnings per share rose from 6.75p to 7.28p. The interim dividend goes up by
0.1p to 1.9p.

FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: QED first possible MBO from MCC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QED TECHNOLOGY, a systems integrator and software supplier for the
publishing industry, could be among the first management buy-outs from
Maxwell Communication Corporation, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Charles Croker, QED's managing director, said he had been told by Price
Waterhouse, administrator to MCC, that non-core businesses like his 'could
be for sale'.
The news came the day after Mr Jonathan Phillips, one of the joint
administrators of MCC, told Norsk Data, the Norwegian mini-computer group,
that an offer from QED made last August to buy one of its loss-making
subsidiaries could not proceed.
However, Norsk Data confirmed that it was still willing to sell ND Comtec,
the subsidiary, to QED if the sale could take place before the end of
January. The offer depends on QED's ability to buy itself out from MCC
before then.
Mr Svein Sognen, executive vice-president at Norsk Data, said that a US, a
UK and a Norwegian company were also interested in buying the subsidiary.
ND Comtec, which also provides software to the publishing industry, was to
be sold to QED last November for an undisclosed sum. But Mr Croker said MCC
refused to approve the deal at the last minute.
It has also emerged that Berlitz International, MCC's language training and
travel publishing company, has been removed from the 'M&amp;O' group of
companies controlled by Mr David Shaffer under the joint US/UK
administration procedures agreed on Wednesday. M&amp;O is the vehicle under
these joint proceedings to handle Macmillan, Official Airline Guides and 15
other subsidiaries of MCC.
The announcement came after a hearing in the New York southern district
bankruptcy court that approved arrangements governing the control of MCC
jointly under UK administration and US Chapter 11 bankruptcy legislation.
Five US banks have claimed ownership of most of the 55.6 per cent stake in
Berlitz that is also claimed by Macmillan. Mr Shaffer said it would not be
appropriate for Berlitz to be within M&amp;O while there was dispute over its
ownership.
Credit Suisse, Swiss Volksbank, Advest of New York, Morgan Stanley and
Shearson Lehman are believed to claim ownership of the Berlitz shares as
collateral for loans extended to companies within the Maxwell empire.
The previous order governing control of MCC had been ratified in the UK and
US courts for just two weeks and was subject to approval by the group's
creditors. Nimbus Records pension funds, UK and US, have not been part of
the MCC pensions funds since the company's acquisition by MCC in December
1987.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Property problems increase losses at NatWest Bancorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bancorp, the wholly-owned US subsidiary of Britain's
National Westminster Bank, yesterday revealed a Dollars 371.5m (Pounds 207m)
loss for 1991, up from Dollars 352m in 1990.
The 1991 loss, struck after Dollars 567.7m of loan write-offs and Dollars
689.5m of bad debt provisions, was in large part the result of property
problems caused by NatWest's high lending to New York developers in the late
1980s.
Mr John Tugwell, the NatWest main board member who took charge of the New
York subsidiary last April in the wake of huge property loan losses,
yesterday said the fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 29.8m was significantly
lower than losses earlier in the year. He said the US bank is now trading
profitably and will be in the black in its first quarter.
He also noted that operating expenses last year were only slightly higher
(Dollars 790.8m compared with Dollars 746m) and the Dollars 88m bad debt
provisions in the fourth quarter were below the Dollars 292.6m of the last
quarter of 1990.
Mr Tugwell acknowledged that the Dollars 859.5m of cumulative losses since
1989 were high. But he argued that 'the pain has been taken and there is a
silver lining in that all thoses losses are tax credits which will mean we
won't pay any tax for some time'.
NatWest injected Dollars 450m into its troubled US operation last year as
loan loss problems mounted. Mr Tugwell stressed that non-performing loans at
year-end totalled Dollars 1.15bn, down from Dollars 1.3bn at the end of last
September. That means 8.16 per cent of the bank's total loan book is
non-performing. About 50 per cent of the non-performing loans is in
property. This means some 30.6 per cent of NatWest Bancorp's total property
loan book of Dollars 1.8bn is now non-performing.
Mr Tugwell stressed that the bank's core capital-to-assets ratio of 6.33 per
cent is strong compared with most US banks and claimed the ability to
improve operating profits while absorbing the impact of property problems
shows the bank's strength. Net interest income in 1991 was Dollars 706.8m,
down from Dollars 737.5m in 1990. Non-interest income rose to Dollars 283.9m
from Dollars 243.6m.

FT  17 JAN 92 / TSB losses hit Pounds 47m on Hill Samuel debt charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group yesterday announced a Pounds 47m loss for the year to October 31,
foreshadowing a series of results from UK banks which are likely to show
their worst domestic performance since they started to disclose figures
almost 20 years ago.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, said that 'the economy has been the
roughest in living memory for the banks'. TSB's poor result stems from a
charge of Pounds 654m, which it has made to cover the risk of losses on bad
and doubtful debts. In 1990, TSB made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 312m.
However, the peak of TSB's losses was in the first six months of 1991, when
it made an overall loss of Pounds 150m, mainly because of disastrous figures
from Hill Samuel, its corporate banking division. The group returned to
profit of Pounds 103m in the second half.
Sir Nicholas also disclosed that the group has recruited a new finance
director, Mr John Burns, finance director of National Westminster Bank, to
replace Mr Dolf Mootham.
Mr Don McCrickard, TSB chief executive, said that last April Mr Mootham had
told the board he wanted to retire. In September, after talking to the Bank
of England, Mr McCrickard came to an arrangement with Mr Tom Frost,
NatWest's chief executive, that Mr Burns would move across, but that he
would not join until NatWest had found a replacement.
NatWest said yesterday it has appointed Mr Richard Goeltz, currently
executive vice-president of Seagram, the North American drinks company.
In spite of the losses, TSB is holding its dividend at 6.4p. It made a per
share loss of 3.5p, compared with the previous year's earnings of 13.4p. Its
share price rose from 120p to 128p.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Fresh horrors on the high street: Robert Peston looks at the
impact of Hill Samuel's full-year losses of Pounds 409m on TSB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Don McCrickard, chief executive of TSB Group, held court yesterday in a dark
and gloomy neo-Gothic hall in the City, reminiscent of a Hammer Horror film
set.
The horrors were provided by the bank's results for the year to 31 October.
TSB has the dubious honour of being the first big UK bank to make
significant losses in a full year accounting period because of problems in
its domestic market. Hitherto, the banking sector's losses have stemmed from
ill-judged loans to less developed countries.
The story which Mr McCrickard unfolded was a version of Jekyll and Hyde. The
attractive face of TSB, its retail services division - providing insurance
and banking products to individuals - made a profit before tax and central
costs of Pounds 413m, a rise of 17 per cent. However, this contribution was
almost exactly matched by the Pounds 409m loss of Hill Samuel, the former
merchant bank which is now responsible for all of TSB's lending to
companies.
Hill Samuel was forced to make a charge - or provision - of Pounds 432m to
cover the risk of losses on its loans of Pounds 4.8bn. The ratio of this
charge to the loans is 9 per cent, which is high.
If the English clearing banks suffered losses on that scale, they would soon
be out of business. But TSB has significantly more capital than its rivals -
as a proportion of assets, almost twice as much - so it can absorb
relatively higher losses.
Further analysis of the results provides even greater cause for concern
about the quality of Hill Samuel's loan book. Hill Samuel has classified
Pounds 680m of loans as 'non-performing'.
Mr Dolf Mootham, the finance director who is soon to retire, provided an
explanation: 'When an account is wobbly, we classify a loan as
non-performing and stop taking interest on the loan through our profit and
loss account - though the borrower may in fact still be paying interest.'
However, Hill Samuel has made no provisions against these loans of doubtful
quality.
Mr McCrickard stressed that Hill Samuel was involved in very few of the
biggest corporate collapses of the past year. It did make provisions of more
than Pounds 60m to cover the risk of losses on around Pounds 100m of loans
to Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, whose balance sheet is being
reconstructed.
But Hill Samuel's exposure to the late Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies
and to Maxwell Communication Corporation - which are in administration under
UK insolvency legislation - is 'de minimis', he added. Two years ago, Hill
Samuel had more than Pounds 80m of loans to these Maxwell interests, but
this has been reduced to between Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m, far less than the
English clearing banks.
The damage to Hill Samuel has been done by its loans to small and
medium-size businesses. The total provision can be analysed as follows:
Pounds 129m is the aggregate of individual charges of less than Pounds 1m;
Pounds 150m represents individual charges to 70 companies of between Pounds
1m and Pounds 5m;
Pounds 153m is the sum of charges, each in excess of Pounds 5m, to 14
companies.
Because so many of Hill Samuel's corporate customers are in difficulties, it
is little wonder that Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB's chairman, said that the
current recession has been the worst ever for the UK banks. However, TSB
cannot simply blame economic conditions. It must bear much of the
responsibility for the scale of the losses.
In the 18 months after it bought Hill Samuel in November 1987, it expanded
its loan book by Pounds 3bn or 66 per cent, which is a rapid rate by normal
banking standards. It is not at all surprising therefore that there was a
deterioration in the standards used to assess potential borrowers.
Mr McCrickard blamed Hill Samuel's previous management, which has now been
replaced. 'The old management . . . could not cope with the bigger
business.' However, as a senior director of TSB at the time, Mr McCrickard
must take some of the responsibility for allowing the rapid loan growth and
for approving some of the bigger loans.
Hill Samuel can at least take some comfort from the bad debt trend during
the year. It made most of its provisions in the first half and made a
pre-tax loss of just Pounds 90m in the latter six months. Nonetheless Mr
Hugh Freedberg, chief executive of Hill Samuel, said that there had been no
improvement in the rate at which borrowers have been getting into difficulty
since the end of the year.
If TSB's attempt to become a bank for companies has been little short of
disastrous, its core activity, which serves 7m personal customers through
1,400 branches, has been modernised successfully, having been created out of
a series of dowdy regional savings banks.
It has the most successful life insurance operation of any bank, as measured
by the rate at which it sells policies to its own customers. According to
its market research, TSB is responsible for 40 per cent of all its
customers' purchases of life insurance and is now the UK's sixth-biggest
life and pensions company.
Its insurance operations made a profit before tax and central costs of
Pounds 118m, a rise of 19 per cent on an annualised basis. Meanwhile, TSB's
retail bank contributed profits of Pounds 295m, up 13 per cent.
Peter Ellwood, the chief executive of the insurance and retail services, has
over the past two years reversed a worrying trend of rising costs. In 1991,
there was no increase in the retail bank's staff costs. Total overheads rose
just 2 per cent.
As a result, the retail bank's ratio of costs to income - a key measure of
its efficiency - fell from 65.8 per cent at the end of last year to 59.4 per
cent.
However, Mr Ellwood admitted that the scope for further reduction in costs
is limited. He added that 1992 was going to be 'a tough year'.
The group as a whole should return to profit in 1992, the directors all
concur. Outside analysts expect around Pounds 200m before tax, although Hill
Samuel will probably remain in losses.
Sir Nicholas stresses 'management's confidence' in Hill Samuel's future. He
will know - from any of Hammer's great B-Movie shockers - that his own
livelihood is at stake if the ghoul is not tamed.

FT  17 JAN 92 / European helicopter group formed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE of France and Deutsche Aerospace yesterday merged their
helicopter interests into a new company called Eurocopter to form the
world's second biggest helicopter manufacturer after Sikorsky of the US.
Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, Eurocopter's chairman, said the new company
controlled by Aerospatiale wanted to attract other partners including Agusta
of Italy and Westland of the UK, its two European competitors, as well as
negotiate alliances with Asian partners and possibly with a Russian group.
He confirmed Taiwan Aerospace was interested in co-operating with Eurocopter
which already has ties with China, Japan and Singapore. The company is also
conducting preliminary studies of possible co-operation with one of the
Russian helicopter design groups.
In the face of shrinking government defence budgets and a depressed civil
helicopter market, Mr Bigay said he expected to see the number of leading
western helicopter manufacturers decline from eight to three or four by the
end of the decade.
Eurocopter is the first tangible move in this global rationalisation of the
depressed helicopter industry. But further rationalisation of the industry
in Europe is likely to prove difficult in the near term because Westland and
Agusta have so far shown little interest in associating themselves with
Eurocopter. Westland, which is also associated with Sikorsky, and Agusta are
co-operating on the EH101 naval and troop transport helicopter.
Mr Bigay said the combined Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace helicopter
operations were expected to show a net profit in 1991 of about 4 per cent to
4.5 per cent of their combined turnover of FFr12.65bn (Pounds 1.30bn) last
year. 'Anything below that would be disappointing,' he said. The combined
operations won 256 new helicopter orders last year worth FFr3.4bn with
Aerospatiale accounting for 216 of the new orders. This was lower than the
290 orders Aerospatiale's helicopter division won in 1990 and reflected the
depressed market.
Mr Bigay said military orders had reached their lowest level since 1960 and
prospects for 1992 remained bleak. A further uncertainty was the German
government's recent proposal to reduce its requirement for the new Tiger
anti-tank helicopter currently being developed by Eurocopter by DM2bn
(Pounds 700m) between 1993 and 2005.
He warned that the decline in defence spending could lead to more structural
problems for the helicopter industry. But Eurocopter planned to strengthen
its leadership position in the civil helicopter market to help offset the
decline in defence business.

FT  17 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: TSB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The unflattering reason for the 5 per cent surge in TSB shares yesterday was
that its Pounds 47m pre-tax loss could have been worse. That is scarcely
grounds for the market to revise its view about the bank's long-term future.
Admittedly, the retail bank has had a good year, as has the insurance
business. But much of this must be due to a squeeze on costs which may not
have much further to run, while there must also be a limit on how much
insurance the bank can sell to its existing customers. As for Hill Samuel,
the loan book may now have been cleaned up at the expense of Pounds 432m in
provisions. But its profit before provisions was only Pounds 13m, hardly an
appetising return on Pounds 750m of capital.
In the current year the bank should have no difficulty returning to profit,
if only because the provisions should shrink. The dividend payment should be
easily covered, which may justify the decision to dip into reserves this
time. The more difficult question is where growth is coming from once the
bad debts are out of the way. For a bank as well capitalised as TSB, the
natural answer might be through acquisition. It would take astonishing
courage to revert to a route which has proved so disastrous in the past.

FT  17 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: German regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bonn Finance Ministry was surely right to assert yesterday that
Germany's regional stock markets can compete internationally only if they
are regulated from the centre. The requirements of the European single
market and the need to attract capital to finance unification both mean that
the outside world can no longer be ignored. Whatever happens to the detail
of yesterday's reform proposals, the power of the Lander is waning
inexorably. More important, the same could also be true for the banks.
The ministry may not have offered much to satisfy international investors
over the flagrant if perfectly legal discrimination against minority
shareholders in cases such as the Krupp takeover of Hoesch. But it is
proposing a tighter and much more interventionist regulatory regime than
that operated by the Lander, who have allowed the banks considerable leeway
in setting standards of market practice.
Worse still for the banks is the proposed creation of money market funds,
long opposed by the Bundesbank on the grounds that it would weaken its
control over the money supply. The banks' concern is more prosaic but
nonetheless real. They fear it would push up the cost of their liabilities
in a market where they are already having to cope with the new attractions
of commercial paper.

FT  17 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's unemployment figures are perhaps of more political than economic
significance. The seasonally adjusted increase of 31,100 in December might
be taken as further evidence that the feared double dip is not
materialising, even though it took the national rate of unemployment to 9
per cent. But it is instructive to look at regional variations. More than
half the monthly rise was in south-east England, where the concentration of
marginal constituencies makes the government particularly vulnerable. By
contrast, unemployment in the north-west, where there is another less
publicised group of marginal conservative seats, is barely rising.
It would be tempting to conclude that this is simply a case of swings and
roundabouts, were it not for the fact that the north-west still has one of
the highest rates of unemployment in the country. Small wonder that the
employment minister preferred to focus on the increase in job vacancies.

FT  17 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The lure of cheap mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,541.6 (+4.5)
In its own small way, yesterday's cut in UK mortgage rates is distinctly
encouraging. In guessing that UK interest rates have peaked, the building
societies are no better informed than the rest of us. But they are seeking
to stimulate the housing market in the critical spring season; and if, as
the equity market is tentatively suggesting, retail spending is starting to
pick up, this could provide a fillip.
The equity market's confidence is perhaps more broadly based than that.
Yesterday's most striking feature was the collapse in drug stocks and the
surge in cyclicals such as British Steel and ICI. This mimics recent events
on Wall Street, where defensive stars of 1991 such as Merck and Coca Cola
have been savaged while cyclicals like steel have soared. As a measure of US
belief in recovery, this is a healthy sign. In the UK, it may be more a
matter of picking high yielders on the grounds that their dividends are not
so vulnerable after all. But that too represents confidence of sorts.
The fall in UK drug stocks - Glaxo alone accounted for 10 points off the
FT-SE yesterday - is simpler. As in the US, the sector benefited hugely last
year at the expense of the cyclicals. But in the UK the effect was much more
exaggerated in both directions, so that yesterday's 10 per cent rise in
British Steel and 5 per cent fall in Glaxo does little to close the gap. In
addition, it looks as if UK drug stocks have been supported lately by US
buying; and if US investors have fallen out of love with Merck, there is the
less reason for them to support Glaxo.
As for the direct effects of the mortgage rate cut, the lack of movement in
the housebuilders yesterday suggests that the market is not expecting too
much. Coming after the suspension of stamp duty and the attempts to stem the
flow of repossessions before Christmas, a half-point cut is not to be
sniffed at. But the housing market is locked in an unprecedented state of
depression, real interest rates remain high without the compensating
prospect of capital gains, and the approaching election is still a barrier
to confidence.
Abbey National's initiative may nevertheless have important consequences for
its competitors, not least the already struggling wholesale lenders which
rely for funds on the money market. Abbey has also widened its margins
significantly in the last couple of years, and is therefore in a strong
position if the battle for market share intensifies. Barclays' announcement
yesterday of a new capped mortgage could be a sign of things to come. It
could also be a reason for not getting carried away with bank shares,
whatever their yield attractions.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Letter: Completing argument on effect of rising interest
rates on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am happy to see that, although Mr Samuel Brittan does not appear to
believe that high and rising real interest can negate a recovery (Economic
Viewpoint, January 9), Lex (January 15) apparently does. Lex, however, fails
to complete the argument. He says that until the Bundesbank starts cutting
rates '. . . declining inflation in the UK will simply mean higher interest
real rates'.
But this is only the beginning of the process. And it is only just beginning
to get interesting. Higher real interest rates will depress monetary growth
(or, for non-monetarists, will reduce aggregate demand) and so result in yet
more rapid deflation. This increased deflation will, of course, increase
real interest rates yet again, and so result in an even steeper fall in
prices. And so on.
This process cannot go on for ever. Apart from unthinkable things such as
exchange controls, the exchange rate peg would have to be abandoned or, more
conventionally to stay within the terms of the ERM, there would have to be a
realignment of the sterling/D-Mark rate. Traders would anticipate a
revaluation of the pound against the D-Mark. (Incidentally, those who argue
that the source of all inflations/deflations is the exchange rate will
conclude that this move would exacerbate the deflation in the UK.) An
anticipated revaluation would bring nominal sterling interest rates down
below those in Germany. At last the interest rate moves in the appropriate
direction] But once the suitable large revaluation of sterling had occurred,
we would be on the same deflationary path again.
Of course something will turn up . . . it always does. Doesn't it?

Sir, While agreeing practically without reservation with Christopher Lorenz
('When service with a smile is missing by a mile', January 10),
unfortunately he pricked his own balloon of contentions in his very last
sentence, ie, 'take their business elsewhere'.
I am sure that Mr Lorenz is knowledgeable about IATA, the supra-national and
super-powerful union of the skies - aided by many cash-hungry exchequers,
and that where businessmen are concerned the option is either BA or its pool
partner.
Time being important, one frequently elects to travel BA after much
screaming to travel agents about Hobson's choice.

occasions, somewhere else]

FT  17 JAN 92 / Letter: 'Open season' attack is no cure for pensions ills,
while new structure is logical answer to abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender asks whether it is moral for employers to take holidays on
pension contributions and avers that the practice is not illegal. Maybe it
should be made illegal. Pensions have recently been defined in the courts as
deferred pay, and are therefore employees' property, effectively held on
trust by employers.
Perhaps the way to remove the opportunity for the abuse of company pension
funds is to do away with them altogether. Employees could be encouraged to
have personal pensions which would be fully transportable, and employers
would be obliged to contribute at a rate to be fixed and agreed. The
pensions would be provided by institutions such as the existing life houses
which clearly decide on merit where to invest the funds; any 'surpluses'
become bonuses.
This may seem revolutionary, but one only has to ask 'whose pension is it
anyway?' and the logic becomes increasingly attractive.

<BYLINE>
   From A E MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must take issue with John Plender. His whole argument hinges on the
statement that 'a pension fund exists to deliver the best possible
retirement benefits to employees or it is nothing'.
In the vast majority of cases pension funds do not exist for such purpose,
they exist to back up and support the benefit promises made to members of
the scheme by the employer.
If, by good management or plain luck, there turn out to be more funds in the
pension fund than are necessary to support the promises made, then to my
mind it is perfectly reasonable for credit for this surplus to be taken by
the employer, just as he will have to apply additional funding if the
reverse turns out to be the case.
Improvement in benefit promises is not a matter for the pension funds as
such. This is a question of terms and conditions of employment which should
be negotiated directly between the employer and the workforce through
whatever is the normal negotiating channel.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT K YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender's approach to the problem of pension fund security
('Sinking funds: The so-called pensions experts taken to task', January 15)
may have been more telling if he had first read the personal view on the
following page by Howard Davies on the accuracy of journalists.
His gross exaggeration and lack of balance will result in the important and
critical issues he raised being ignored in the heat generated. If 'warning
signals have been there for years' why have we only just heard from him?
'Since there have been countless cases where directors have looted pension
funds' why no hue and cry? The answer, of course, is that he overstates the
case and is joining the open season on pension fund trustees. Mr Plender
could also be accused of jumping on the 'bite Maxwell' bandwagon.
The National Association of Pension Funds, which recently issued more
guidelines on the responsibility of trustees, is also criticised, but no
mention is made of the fact that it has been pressing for some time for NO
self-investment when the government recommendation is to allow 5 per cent.
Tighter application of existing rules would cure most ills. Far more damage
is done by incompetence than 'scams' and dishonesty. If Mr Plender looks
seriously at the personal pension provision offered by insurance companies
which hand over 50 per cent or more of their customer's first contributions
to a salesman in commission and then refuse to disclose the fact clearly to
the customer, he would find millions being siphoned off every year.
Perhaps he could also turn his efforts in that direction. Only a few
journalists seem concerned. There are some notable exceptions, one at least
from the Financial Times.
If Mr Plender wants to go on the offensive that's commendable, but it does
require him to be accurate. Otherwise the 'dismal self-serving pensions
lobby' he reviles will not take him seriously. Worse still, neither will the
issues he raises be tackled.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A Gulf war balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE YEAR ago today, a great international military force, led by the US,
with substantial British and Arab participation and acting under the mandate
of the United Nations, went to war to free Kuwait from its occupation by
Iraq. Forty days later, its mission was complete. The venture was judged
worthwhile then and hindsight has not altered the judgment. But not all its
consequences were foreseen or calculated, which is often the case with
victory. An audit is therefore in order.
The legitimate government of Kuwait was restored and the country is in the
throes of reconstruction. It has, however, not been transformed into a
democratic model for the Gulf, although parliamentary elections are planned
for later this year. Nor have similar fond hopes for structural changes in
Saudi Arabia materialised, although it may have a consultative council soon.
However Saudi Arabia has reasserted its hegemony over Opec. With one third
of all output, it dictates production and pricing policies. This is
satisfactory to the US and the leading western oil-consuming countries.
Barring the unpredictable, security of supply and stability of prices will
remain the goals for the 1990s. The secondary war objective of securing Gulf
oil supplies has thus been achieved.
On the broader international economic front, it is clear that the war was
little more than a blip on any graph, contrary to the fears of a year ago.
The global economy remains vulnerable to disruption and inflation in raw
material supplies, above all oil, but its essential problems are much more
related to public and private indebtedness, labour market rigidities and
trade obstruction. In the US and Britain, it was shown that guns do not put
butter on the table.
In the Middle East, it is a sad fact that Saddam Hussein still rules Iraq.
This alone has brought great grief to its citizens, especially Kurds and
Shi'ites. Now, as then, it would be better if he were not there - but it
would be wrong to seek to overthrow him purely for reasons of vengeance or
political gain. It remains preferable that the Iraqis do it themselves - and
be rewarded by an end to commercial and diplomatic ostracism - than have the
US implement its plan to remove him by even covert force.
Arms bazaar
This does not mean that the international community is powerless to restrain
Saddam from violating his own people or that it should ease in any way the
pressure to root out all Iraq's offensive military and nuclear capability
and to deny it more. This task is made more urgent with the potential entry
into the arms bazaar of former Soviet weapons and nuclear expertise. Indeed,
all the fine words about controlling the arms trade and promoting regional
security have to date produced little. The only clear gain is the
recognition in Iran, a beneficiary of the war, that the US is more than 'the
great Satan'.
The western political fall out has been unpredictable. Both George Bush and
John Major have found war's benefits ephemeral, demonstrating that, in
election years, their respective publics tend to respond to more prosaic
domestic issues. Today, the continued presence of Saddam in Baghdad may be
an electoral liability for Mr Bush. Less so for Mr Major, although his
admirable initiative on safe havens for the Kurds in Iraq has had a
distressingly short shelf life.
Desirable change
Although Germany, like Japan, was vilified for contributing only money, not
troops, the war had a generally stimulative effect on the drive towards a
common European foreign and defence policy; Maastricht was an advance, if an
incomplete one. That the first test of EC resolve came in Yugoslavia was
unfortunate, but also salutary on the learning curve. If it comes, the
desirable change in the German constitution, allowing for the participation
of its forces in any collective security operation outside the Nato area,
may be said to have had its roots in the Gulf war. Equally, although
constitutional change in Japan is less desirable, both domestic and
international attention is now properly focused on the most effective ways
in which it can contribute to global security.
The war was unequivocally good for the UN system. Its security council
worked as never before, thanks, in part, to Mr Gorbachev. It is also right
that the international community, acting through the UN, increasingly
considers it legitimate to intervene in the internal affairs of a country on
humanitarian grounds. This would be the best justification for any future
active intervention in Iraq.
It is true, however, that no new world order, as promised by Mr Bush, has
been put in place, partly because of the disappearance of the Soviet Union.
But the lessons of the war point to that order's essential ingredients. They
are that no country, not even the world's remaining superpower, can do it
all on its own; that the UN, an effective European Community and a more
outward-looking Japan, must all play important roles. If, as we wrote a year
ago today, 'war is the result of miscalculation', (in this case by Saddam
Hussein) peace and security should not be.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Labour wobbles on tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S plans to eliminate the anomalies created by the interaction of
national insurance contributions with income tax are commendable. An
employee on Pounds 20,000 a year faces a marginal tax rate of 34 per cent
(income tax plus NI contributions); when earnings rise above Pounds 20,280,
the ceiling for employees' NI contributions, the marginal rate drops to 25
per cent. This is anomalous, and reform long overdue.
But eliminating the NI ceiling would impose losses on taxpayers which would
be politically difficult to digest at one sitting. For an employee on Pounds
25,000 a year, the cost would be Pounds 425; at Pounds 30,000 a year, the
cost would be Pounds 875. And even at much higher incomes, the loss created
by lifting the NI ceiling would be greater than that imposed by Labour's
plans for income tax.
About 3.5m voters would face tax increases of poll tax dimensions (the
additional higher rate band, by contrast, would probably threaten fewer than
1m). Anyone on more than the average full-time male non-manual earnings - 14
per cent of taxpayers - would pay more. The effect would be even greater in
the south-east: a draft IFS report suggests that a third of households would
pay more NI contributions.
Political implications
The political implications of such a tax increase are clear. And the
Conservatives have launched a ferocious - if somewhat mendacious - assault
on Labour's plans to ensure that anyone who aspires to modest income should
feel threatened. When an opinion poll published on Wednesday put the
Conservatives ahead of Labour, the Conservative chairman, Mr Chris Patten,
was quick to claim success for his tax campaign.
Within 24 hours, senior Labour figures had let it be known that the NI
reform could be phased in over years. Indeed, phasing-in had always been
intended: scrutiny of policy documents revealed that increases would be
introduced gradually to avoid disrupting family budgets.
Strange silence
Maybe, but it is strange that neither Mr Kinnock, Mr Smith nor Mrs Beckett
has mentioned such phasing during the myriad interviews they have given on
Labour's tax plans. The oversight is all the more inexplicable because
Labour could still honour its spending pledges if the abolition of the NI
ceiling were done in stages.
This is not the first time that a carefully crafted package of Labour tax
proposals has come unstuck under inspection. During the 1987 general
election campaign, Labour's manifesto was less than frank about its plans to
eliminate the married man's tax allowance. And prior to election day, Mr
Kinnock and Mr Hattersley found themselves embarrassingly at odds over how
far down the income scale their tax increases would reach.
Whether this was significant in the scale of Labour's defeat is impossible
to judge. But Labour has had almost five years since then to get its tax
policies right. The party can hardly complain if its belated endorsement of
phasing in the removal of the NI ceiling is portrayed as a panic measure in
response to an adverse opinion poll.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Arts: One Over the Eight - Stephen Joseph Theatre,
Scarborough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It might be surreal, but watching eight men in a boat, in a theatre, for
most of two hours, can be a very funny experience indeed. Peter Robert
Scott's One Over The Eight, directed by Alan Ayckbourn at the Stephen Joseph
Theatre, Scarborough, proves to be exactly that; a lightweight, uplifting
play about competitive rowing, energetically performed and crammed with
knowing jokes.
The plot, unashamedly, is even shallower than the river Cherwell: a
provincial university rowing club challenges the Oxford third boat, and then
tries to live up to its bravado. At the outset, the rowers bear out the
truth that only the mediocre are always at their best. They row according to
chaos theory: one slip and the whole crew disintegrates. Their cox has
abandoned them, and they are amazed the replacement is a woman. Their
macho-slobbish instincts subside as she kicks them into shape. En route,
there are arguments and intrigues, but the action makes directly for the
finishing line.
Movies thrive on this type of situation: a team of hopefuls come to believe
in themselves and each other. Scott's play resembles the training scenes
from Stepping Out or 42nd Street, only here the characters find themselves
through rowing, not dancing: the doubter finds faith, and the bully
humility; the fatty loses a few pounds, and the smoker his habit. The play's
serious concerns are lightly touched: it looks wittily at the relation
between cox and crew, between beefcake and brains; and wryly at the palpable
values of loyalty and trust which remain after the high-octane testosterone
has evaporated.
Scott dispenses platitudes like liniment to smooth things along and give
everyone a warm glow; they come mostly from Saskia Wickham's excellent cox
and John Robinson's all-American college jock. They are balanced by a surly
dissenter,
played with tact and judgment by Jonathan Cake. Throughout, the rowing
patois holds water; Wickham is native in it: bow-side, stroke,
half-pressure, feathering, catching crabs.
As director here, Ayckbourn refines himself out of existence; his actors
move around the boathouse set so naturally, interrupt each other so surely
and squabble so realistically that they hardly seem to be acting. The
setting - in the round - helps the cast of nine (crew plus cox) to generate
a winning energy and exuberance; this keeps the action going long after the
plot runs out of breath, and it is helped by John Pattison's efficient mood
music.
The crew of this unnamed university eventually loses to Oxford's third boat
by fourteen lengths; but they should feel confident when their show visits
the Oxford Playhouse next month (February 3-8; and Brighton Theatre Royal,
February 10-15).

<TEXT>
Sweet, funny, and occasionally surprising touching, this show does just what
its title purports, and then some. Thanks to Sting, you've heard the song
'Spread a Little Happiness' a hundred times, of course: it's a honey. But
you may well have forgotten, or not have known, that its tune was written
for Mr Cinders by Vivian Ellis, whose career in the London musical theatre
began in the glorious 1920s and continued till well after the Second World
War. He is still very much alive, and made a graceful speech on Tuesday's
opening night.
Spread a Little Happiness honours Ellis by showing, in more than 30 songs,
how much good work he has written. The pleasures it gives are largely mixed
with surprise: the 'So he wrote this' surprise on the one hand, and the 'Why
haven't I heard that before?' on the other. This celebration was devised by
Sheridan Morley, who narrates with just the right combination of information
and urbanity. It is deftly directed (by Dan Crawford), stylishly
choreographed (by David Toguri) and handsomely performed by six singers.
Ellis began under the aegis of Jerome Kern and grew in the great age of CB
Cochran's revues. One of the songs here - 'Wind in the Willows' - was
originally staged in 1930 by the greatest choreographer of the century,
George Balanchine, and another - Dancing with a Ghost from the 1934 Jill
Darling - was arranged by the greatest British choreographer, Frederick
Ashton. Sometimes he himself wrote the words for his own songs, but he
worked with other fine lyricists, including - for the post-War musicals The
Water Gipsies, Bless the Bride and more  - AP Herbert.
In fact, it is the lyrics that are the greatest factor of this evening's
success. Sometimes they are cleverly wordy, like 'On the Amazon' with its
list of the 'philosopedes,' 'isosceles' and 'hypodermics' that make the
Amazon so dangerous. Sometimes they're just jolly skits: 'I'm Horsa,' 'I'm
Hengist,' 'We're coarser than Genghis,' 'I'm Hengist,' 'I'm Horsa,' 'We're
mentioned in Chaucer.' Sometimes they're charmingly satiric, as in 'A Small
Abode off the Finchley Road,' the plaint of the lady who, from her married
exile in Eaton Square, pines for her native Cricklewood.
Ellis does not emerge from this as a great melodist, and yet he seems a
light year away from the decadence of the lyric-led shows of the Sondheim
school. Ellis's songs are all so shapely, singable, grateful in their vocal
lines, and they beam with freshness and innocence. They are sophisticated
without cynicism. (To my ear, however, his style loses its contemporary
spirit in the last show represented here, Bless the Bride, which reverts to
an operetta prettiness that I find resistible - even though 'This is my
Lovely Day' has the evening's finest melodic line.)
The cast catches all the charm and tone of these songs. The two most
experienced performers are Frank Thornton and Thelma Ruby; their timing and
manner are perfect. Ray C Davis is the most skilful dancer present, throwing
a neat double air turn and landing the moment before he starts to sing.
Maurice Clarke sings the tenor solos musically, but his style is more
pinched and nasal than suits these tunes. I think that music like Ellis's
can teach singers how to use their voices freely, without squeezing or
falsetto.
As you can hear with Rachel Robertson, who is the evening's best discovery.
Picture-pretty in a rather Olivia Newton-John way, she is 19 years old but
already able to phrase and point a song with skill. Her voice opens out in
the bigger lines (though at moments it is slightly too breathy), and she can
make much out of not a lot: eg 'Me and My Dog'. 'I've got a dog. Me and my
dog - Are lost in the fog. Can't any kind gentleman show me the way home?'
For me the great event of Spread a Little Happiness is the way she weights
those rhymes and repetitions - plaintive, winsome and yet deadly.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Arts: Dillis, an unexpected talent - Susan Moore visits
Munich in an attempt to solve the puzzle of a polyglot early 19th century
artist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the great revelations of the last 50 years is the extent to which the
revolutionary visions of Constable and Monet were foreshadowed in the oil
sketches of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The oil sketches made in
Rome in the 1780s by Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes were rediscovered in 1930;
and contemporaneous sketches executed in Rome and Naples by the Welsh artist
Thomas Jones turned up in the saleroom in 1954, and were exhibited in 1970.
Their immediacy, swiftness of execution and sensitivity to atmospheric
effects confounded audiences who regarded Valenciennes as a reactionary
neo-Classical landscape painter, and Jones as a dull pupil of Richard
Wilson.
As unexpected as the Valenciennes and Jones sketchbooks was the cache of
drawings and oil sketches exhibited in Munich for the first time in 1959.
They were by Johann Georg von Dillis, an amateur artist more widely
remembered as the keeper of the royal collections for the Crown Prince,
later King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and the first director of Munich's Alte
Pinakothek. As an artist he was something of a conundrum. His landscapes
were quite unlike any other painted in Germany in the late 18th and early
19th centuries.
A new exhibition at the Neue Pinakothek in Munich, organised to mark the
150th anniversary of his death, attempts to solve the Dillis puzzle. The
artist is placed firmly in an European context, and he emerges as an
intriguing Germany progeny of the parallel traditions of English and French
naturalism.
To understand Dillis it is essential to known something of his extraordinary
career. He was priest (briefly), painter, cicerone and connoisseur, gifted
linguist and bureaucrat. In 1784 he came into contact with the remarkable
Anglophile American Sir Benjamin Thompson, later Graf von Rumford, an
economic and social reformer and philanthropist in the employ of Karl
Theodor of Bavaria. Rumford introduced to Munich the notion of Picturesque
gardening in the form of the Englischen Garten, and Dillis to the art of the
English watercolour. He promoted Dillis's official career and his travels
abroad, recommending him as a travelling companion to English Grand
Tourists.
Most notable among them was Viscount Palmerston whose son, the future Prime
Minister, Dillis drew in 1794. Thomas Jones described the the former as a
'gentleman of taste', and it is quite plausible that he acquainted Dillis
with the work or Wright of Derby, William Pars and the other watercolourists
who had made the journey to Rome in the 1770s.
Dillis was to travel extensively in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy.
In Rome and Naples in 1805 he met Angelica Kauffmann, Gavin Hamilton, Sir
William Hamilton and Turner's American pupil Washington Allston. From the
first, certainly, his work shows an English bent. There is a specificity of
place and time and light that is absent in contemporary German art.
An atmospheric townscape by moonlight in grey wash could almost be by JR
Cozens, his manner of drawing foliage akin to that of Thomas Hearne. His
high-key 'Et in Arcadia Ego', set perhaps the Englischen Garten, is complete
with classical temple, grazing cattle and figures under a tree: Munich
through the eyes of Claude.
It is possible to walk around the show seeing a variety of masters guiding
the hand of Dillis. Such is his experimentation that his technique changes
from exhibit to exhibit. With a few notable exceptions, the less finished
and formal watercolours and oils are by far the more pleasing.
If Dillis's somewhat old-fashioned drawings are indebted to the English
watercolourists, his oil sketches - in Italy and at home - owe more to the
predominantly French community of artists working in Rome and Naples at the
turn of the century. Tree studies and rocky outcrops abound. He paints broad
hoary vistas, and light catching the tumbling forth of waterfalls, as did
his friend the Belgian Simon Denis, and Biddauld, Michallon and Corot.
Particularly close in spirit as well as technique to Valenciennes are the
three large and impressive panoramas of Rome painted in softening early
morning light from a vantage point at the Villa Malta.
Dillis is not the South German Friedrich as suggested, or even a Bavarian
Corot. He is, nonetheless, a fascinating witness to the flourishing exchange
of ideas in Europe at the turn of the 19th century.
Dillis: Landscapes and Portraits, plus a separate exhibition of Dillis
studies of Bavarian folk costume and landscape, continues at the Neue
Pinakothek in Munich until February 9. It can be seen at the Albertinum in
Dresden, March 1-May 3.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Arts: London International Mime Festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The London Mime Festival is upon us again, provoking the usual groans among
fogeys old and young about their least favourite four-letter word and the
usual fluster of spirited defences. Let us call a halt for the time being on
ancient prejudices and try to trace some sort of common denominator for the
20 or so ensembles currently giving their all in the capital. Tricky. Many
of them use language. They draw on cabaret, clowning, puppetry, staking
their identity, it seems, more to their origins than to the work in hand.
And what are those origins? A quick flick through the festival brochure
reveals that - except for a select band marked 'international' - all are
either European or North American. Even the international collaborations are
predominantly Euro-American. This could, of course, be an accident of
selection, or it could be a reflection on the festival finances (it is
cheaper to bring a troupe from Holland than Honduras; and for the purposes
of this festival, they must all be called 'mime').
A more interesting possibility is that the grouping reflects the stage the
English theatre and its audiences have reached in redefining themselves to
take on board European developments in visual and physical theatre. Many of
these companies would happily appear at festivals elsewhere in the continent
as part of a mainstream theatre programme.
The UK has not got that far yet, although the subsidised companies are just
beginning to take advantage of their expertise. (Linda Kerr Scott, who gives
her solo show Ave Maria at the festival this week, has appeared as Lear's
Fool for the RSC; Theatre de Complicite, of which she is a member, gave its
version of Durrenmatt's The Visit at the Royal National Theatre).
So we are left with a largely Euro-centric community of performers whose
passport to credibility often seems to be to have Jacques LeCoq on their
curriculum vitae (see how the name of the French mime maestro glisters in
the programmes of Theatre de Complicite). I couldn't say if this applies to
the personnel of Talking Pictures, which presents two shows at Battersea
Arts Centre, because the festival's efficiency did not extend to programmes.
This UK-founded company, classed with the international brigade because it
uses performers from a variety of countries, displays a typical patchwork of
influences and intentions. The director of its first show, the aptly titled
Europeans, is Stephen Daldry, director designate of the Royal Court whose
championship of European plays has done so much for the Gate Theatre over
the last couple of years.
Billed as 'a fast-forward comedy of European manners', the piece is a
slickly performed homily about the dangers of withholding help from the
newly democratised nations of the Eastern bloc. Arriving in Strasbourg for
the 'conferenzia', three tatty delegates from an unnamed Slavonic country
gawp their way into audience with the image-obsessed French, the chaotic
Italians and the poker-stiff English via the only common language language
they can find: text-book Latin. As their case is heard and rejected, the
lights go down, the conference table splinters into three and they trundle
round the stage in tanks, while a corrupted version of the Internationale
signals the ascendancy of a new nationalism and fascism.
As far as it goes, it is well done. The performances, by Jon Potter,
Clarissa Malheros and the superb Dominique Grandmougin, dig deep into the
lunacy of Euro-politics. But they are prevented by their chosen format from
moving beyond national stereotypes into any more complex or profound
reflection of realpolitik. A battery of skills is wastefully employed to ram
home a single message. This is mime teetering on the edge of textual
theatre, which reveals the danger of using words without a script.

At the time of writing no rating is available for the opening episode of
BBC1's Grace And Favour (8.00) but since this is simply 'Are You Being
Served' with added horse manure it seems likely it will be hugely popular.
The crowd that used to use double entendres to run a department store are
now running a country hotel using the same lines. Easily the best of the new
drama series this year is Love Hurts (9.30 BBC1), in which the delightful
Zoe Wanamaker plays a yuppie applying her skills to a charity and Adam Faith
is a cockney plumber made good who fancies her, but is having great trouble
getting his wicked way.
In The Washington Version (9.30) BBC2 continues its inside account of how
the Gulf War was managed. The Wicker Man (midnight BBC1) is a genuinely
scary movie, somewhat unexpectedly since it is set on a Scottish island and
stars Edward Woodward as a policeman. He discovers that old pagan rituals
are still going on. Anthony Shaffer wrote the script and (give a cheer) we
are promised this is the fully restored version lasting not 86 but 90
minutes. If you get really frightened you can always switch to C4 and sing
along to 'The Time Warp' in The Rocky Horror Show (12.05).

FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology: FDA sets record on approvals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time taken for new drugs to be approved in the US is falling quickly,
according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government agency
which controls what goes on sale in the Dollars 60bn (Pounds 33.5bn) a year
US drugs market.
It is also pushing through 43 per cent more products: 327 in 1991, compared
with 229 in 1990. Among these was a greater number of new molecular entities
(NMEs) - drugs with distinctly different structures from those already on
the market - than ever before.
The FDA has been under pressure for some years over the time taken to
approve drugs. The Waxman-Hatch act of 1984, for example, cut the time for
approval of generic (non-patent) drugs. The drug industry lobby has since
stepped up the pressure on the FDA for early approval.
In 1991, the average time taken for the top 30 new drugs, the NMEs, to be
given the green light was 22.1 months, a 9 per cent improvement on 1990. The
top 30 includes Glaxo's Zofran, used for treating nausea in cancer
chemotherapy patients. Only 23 NMEs were approved in 1990.
For the five most important drugs, those identified as providing the
greatest therapeutic improvement over existing treatment, the time was 11.4
months, about half the level two years ago.
These included Videx, Bristol Myers Squibb's Aids treatment. It was approved
in six months, failing to beat the three-month record set in 1987 by the
only other approved Aids drug, Retrovir, made by UK company Wellcome.
The Aids lobby has been at the forefront of pressure on the FDA to speed up
the approvals process. Some 194 drugs were not given approval, either as
outright rejections or withdrawn by the makers.
If the FDA's performance is improving, then its figures indicate the drug
makers are standing still. It took an average of 7.3 years for one of the
top 30 drugs to go from the first clinical trials to approval in 1991. In
1990, the figure was 7.9 years and in 1989, 7.4 years.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology: Operation Amazon - Christina Lamb describes
plans to put satellite images of the Brazilian rainforest on computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Name the remotest part of the Amazon rainforest to Diogenes Sales Alves and
with the flick of a few switches on his computer he can tell you how much if
any deforestation the area has suffered, when and how it happened, whether
it contains any Indian settlements, any mining or agricultural activity.
Alves is head of a research project at the Brazilian Aerospace Institute
(INPE) to compile from satellite images the first comprehensive analysis of
the world's largest rainforest. The project, detailing everything down to
the last nut gatherer, is expected to be completed by April. It is planned
to be one of the highlights of the UN Environment Conference, or Earth
Summit as it is known, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro in June.
Not only will the study enable examination of geological, hydrological and
botanical features (and changes caused by human activity) in the 5.2m sq km
of jungle, including areas which have never been penetrated, it will also
provide valuable information for some of today's most controversial
environmental debates such as whether forest burning is more detrimental to
climate change than automobile emissions.
In recognition of its work in using satellites to analyse the effect of
human development of the Amazon, INPE has been chosen to co-ordinate a study
of the world's forests for the Space Agencies Forum. The results will be
presented at the Earth Summit.
Surprisingly, INPE has only been studying the Amazon for three years. 'In
1988 when global warming became a general preoccupation the world started
wanting accurate information about the rate of Amazonian deforestation, so
we were asked by the Brazilian government to do a study,' explains Paulo
Serra, head of terrestrial observations.
Beginning in April 1989 INPE devised a method using computer algorithms to
calculate yearly deforestation from remote sensing satellite images taken by
the American Landsat 5. Since 1984 the satellite has passed over the same
point every 16 days from a 710km high orbit. This means that it always
photographs Brazilian territory in the morning when cloud cover is still
extensive so it is not ideal.
The satellite images are received in Cuiaba in the west of Brazil and
transmitted 1,400km to an INPE station at Cachoeira where they are processed
to generate photos. Landsat captures light reflected from the earth's
surface, producing an image on a scale of 1:250,000 in varying tones of
grey. The photographs are given artificial colours - green for forest,
darkening according to the density, pink for barren areas, grey for smoke
from burnings and blue for rivers and dams.
The best 229 photos in terms of clarity of those produced each year are
selected, each covering 185 sq km. Examination of these photographs was used
in 1989, 1990 and 1991 to calculate the yearly rate of deforestation. But,
says Serra: 'We realised this was an enormous amount of work just to get one
number - so we decided to analyse the photos so that we can say when, where
and how an area was deforested.'
To do this INPE has developed its own geographic information system.
According to Serra: 'It is not very complicated - really just a matter of
common language on what is deforestation - there is a lot of area in the
Amazon which is neither rainforest nor deforestation.'
Now when the satellite photographs are taken to INPE headquarters at Sao
Jose dos Campos to be interpreted, the images are colour coded to represent
deforestation of different years. The resulting maps are fed into the
computer and can then be used not only to evaluate more accurately the rate
of deforestation but also to study its effect on carbon- and hydro-cycles.
Some 334 maps will be created to cover the whole area.
'Rather than simply having photos in archives, we can call up any area on
computer from which we can make 1,000 observations,' Serra explains. 'I can
pick a piece of land near Manaus and say that it suffered X amount of
deforestation in 1988 because of this, nothing in 1989 and Y amount in 1990
because of something else. I can see what was deforested for agriculture,
for hydroelectric dams, for garimpagem (informal mining) or simply
disappeared, each of which has a different impact on the greenhouse effect.'
Other uses for the computerised maps include looking at areas inhabited by
Yanomami Indians and other indigenous tribes to see where their settlements
are and to follow their movements and discover where there have been
encroachments by garimpeiros or even cocaine smugglers building illegal
airstrips. The maps will be used for the zoning of the 9.4m hectares
recently declared a reserve for the Yanomamis.
Serra says the maps will also enable the study of the dynamics of forest
nutrients, in terms of soil, gases and the waterboard. It will look at how
deforestation has affected drainage and where streams have dried up because
of silt produced by mining or reduction of forest protection.
They should also end ambiguities in, for example, how much of the forest has
been destroyed and the efficacy of Brazilian government attempts to outlaw
burnings. The government environment agency claims that burnings were down
last year on the 14,000 sq km deforested in 1989-90, but ecologists say they
are back at 1988-89 levels of 23,800 sq km.
The INPE team does not underestimate the importance of the project. 'Not
only are we creating the first ever Amazonian database which can be used by
the whole world but we may also resolve some long- running debates in
Brazil's favour,' Serra claims.
With a sly smile, he adds: 'Imagine the enormous effect if we could show
through this that Amazon burning has much less impact on the carbon cycle
and thus climate change than burning fossil fuels or running cars?'

THE golf club industry may not seem to be the most obvious market for
computer-aided design systems, but at Dunlop Slazenger, in Normanton, West
Yorkshire, a Cad system from Silicon Graphics has enabled golf club
designers to design a whole range of high-performance clubs.
The design of a golf club is intricate - change one element of the club and
it is likely to have an unexpected impact on other parts. As a result the
design of clubs has been time-consuming.
With the Synergy range, however, computer technology enabled the company to
develop one club in the range on the screen and then generate the rest in
the set automatically.
The 3D graphics enable the designers to visualise the club and rotate it on
screen, analysing its performance. In particular, it has enabled the company
to move the centre of gravity in the clubs as required, and to accurately
calculate and position the 'cavity back' or hollow which appears in each
club.

<TEXT>
COMPUTER viruses are never far from the headlines, but as new ones are
identified and confounded, more pernicious ones are already worming their
way into corporate PCs.
To thwart the virus creator, Fifth Generation Systems, of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, has developed a piece of software which enables the PC user to
stay one step ahead of viruses, rather than running one pace behind.
When the Untouchable anti-virus software is loaded on to the PC it
identifies and eradicates any existing viruses. Then the software copies a
signature of all the files that are held on the PC. If a new virus enters
the system - even those that have not previously been identified - the
characteristics of this signature will change in a number of ways. This will
enable Untouchable to identify the presence of a virus before it can do any
damage. The software can be used with any PC running under the Dos operating
system.

from CIT Research, of London.
According to the survey, Mobile Communication in Western Europe 1992, the
number of cellular radio subscribers in Europe by the year 2001 will be
three times what they are today, and stand at around 13.8m. And 52 per cent
of all cellular phones will be digital, with the UK having 1.4m digital
cellphones, Germany 1.35m and France 1.2m.
The use of paging should increase by 69 per cent over the same period
predicts CIT, so that by 2001 there will be 4.2m pagers in use in Europe.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE problem for the horticulturist who has developed a new breed of potato
is that it can take years to breed enough of the vegetables to get them into
the shops. But a technique developed by scientists at the University of
Wisconsin, and licensed by Small Potatoes, of Madison, could speed up the
process.
Developers of the microtuber multiplication of potatoes process, which is
also being commercialised by Rayyan Nederland, of Aalsmeer, Holland, believe
the process can produce 30 tubers from a single parent 'seed' - about 20
times the rate of today's methods. This is done through the interplay of
light, temperature, the growing medium and gravity in proprietary
bioreactors.
The system requires only a low-cost growth environment - the only human
intervention is in inserting the original microtuber and harvesting the
result.

NEW portable and notebook PCs continue to roll off the production lines
packing even more power into the clam-shell box, writes Paul Taylor.
Now Toshiba has added to the top end of its range with the T6400DX and
T6400SX models built around Intel's 80484DX and 80486SX chips. The machines
are aimed at engineers and scientists who need heavyweight computing power.
The mains-powered portables, with thin film technology colour or monochrome
gas-plasma screens, boast 16-bit card expansion slots, memory expansion up
to 20Mbytes using credit card-sized memory cards and full-sized 102-key
detachable keyboards.
Toshiba has also introduced the mid-range T3300SL notebook driven by a
power-saving 25MHz Intel 80386SL chip and using nickel hydride batteries
which offer a third more power than their nickel cadmium equivalents. An
internal modem which can be plugged into a cellular telephone is also
available.

FT  17 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: DTI questions must be answered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RE LONDON UNITED INVESTMENTS PLC
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Dillon, Lord Justice Mustill and Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith): December 19 1991
THE Department of Trade and Industry has power to appoint inspectors to
investigate company matters which are the subject of allegations of fraud,
irrespective of whether they may also be subject to enquiry by the Serious
Fraud Office or the police; and an officer of a company questioned by the
inspectors for the purpose of the investigation cannot refuse to answer on
the ground only that to do so might incriminate him.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr Peter Stringer
Wilson, former chief executive of London United Investments plc (LUI), from
Mr Justice Scott's decision on an application by Department of Trade and
Industry inspectors, that his refusal to answer questions put to him by the
inspectors was unjustified.
LORD JUSTICE DILLON said that from January 1 1976 to October 4 1990 Mr
Wilson was a director of LUI.
LUI carried on business primarily as a holding company in the insurance
field, with two relevant wholly-owned subsidiaries, Walbrook Insurance and
HS Weavers (Underwriting) Agencies (HSW).
Mr Wilson was a director of Walbrook from December 3 1974 until August 2
1990. He was managing director of HSW from January 1 1976 until September
1989, when he became chief executive of LUI.
LUI ran into difficulties in 1989. On March 26 1990, following directions
from the DTI, LUI and its subsidiaries stopped writing new insurance
business. On May 22 an administration order was made in respect of LUI.
In October/November 1990 the secretary of state, in exercise of his powers
under section 432(2) of the Companies Act 1985, appointed inspectors to
investigate the affairs of LUI.
The inspectors were particularly asked to look at the circumstances
surrounding payments of commission on reinsurance contracts relating to HSW.
That raised questions with regard to arrangements made between HSW and a
German reinsurance company, Munich Re.
In an affidavit sworn on May 10 1991, the inspectors said it was apparent
from their investigations that between 1976 and 1989 HSW had entered into
reinsurance quota share treaties with Munich Re; and that during that period
deductions of 5 to 6.5 per cent, totalling Dollars 46m, were made from
reinsurance premiums and paid to various companies based in Germany or
Liechtenstein, referred to as the 'Smith companies'.
The inspectors said they regarded it as essential to their investigation to
determine why those deductions were made, what was the true nature of the
role performed by the Smith companies, and for whom they were acting.
They pointed out in their affidavit that Mr Wilson was the person who
carried out the negotiations with Munich Re and operated the Munich Re
facility throughout the whole period. They said he had told them he intended
the deductions should go to the Smith companies.
It seemed that the Smith companies took their name from Mr Graham Smith, an
English chartered accountant resident in Liechtenstein, and his wife Isolde,
a Liechtenstein citizen.
On October 30 1990 HSW started an action for fraud, against Mr Wilson and
others including Mr and Mrs Smith and the Smith companies, in respect of
diversion to the Smith companies of commissions payable by Munich Re.
It was not surprising that the inspectors wanted to question Mr Wilson about
the Munich Re commission and the Smith companies.
Mr Wilson had refused to answer.
Mr Brodie for Mr Wilson submitted that, as a matter of law, it was improper
for the secretary of state to appoint inspectors to investigate matters
which were the subject of allegations of fraud, because it was more
appropriate that suspected crimes should be investigated by the Serious
Fraud Office or the police.
That was an impossible contention in the face of the wording of Part XIV of
the 1985 Act.
Section 432(2) provided that the secretary of state might make an
appointment if circumstances suggested a company's affairs were being
conducted 'with intent to defraud'.
Where matters which came to light in the course of investigation had been
referred to a prosecuting authority, the secretary of state was not bound to
direct the inspectors to take no further steps. He just had power to do so
(section 437).
Moreover, he had power under the combined effect of sections 449 and 451A to
disclose information obtained by inspectors under section 434, to the
Director of Public Prosecutions.
Against that background it was impossible to conclude that there was any
basis in law which precluded the secretary of state from appointing
inspectors in the present case.
The first major question on the appeal was whether Mr Wilson was entitled to
rely on the Common Law privilege against self-incrimination as entitling him
to refuse to answer the inspectors' questions.
The privilege was deep-rooted in the Common Law. However, since R v Scott
(1856) 169 ER 909, it had been accepted law that parliament might take away
the privilege.
In Scott, where statute compelled a bankrupt to answer questions which might
show he had been guilty of felonies or misdemeanors, Lord Campbell CJ said
'the maxim of the Common Law has therefore been overruled by the
legislature'.
There was no express provision precluding officers of a company from relying
on the privilege against self-incrimination when questioned by inspectors,
either in the 1985 Act, or in the Insolvency Act 1986.
The court had to consider whether it was clear that parliament intended,
when enacting Part XIV, to take away the privilege.
Lord Campbell's judgment in R v Scott was an example of the sort of
reasoning which might justify the court in holding that the privilege had
implicitly been taken away.
Section 434(2) of the 1985 Act as amended by the Companies Act 1989 provided
that if inspectors considered an officer of the company might be in
possession of information relevant to their investigation they might require
him to '(b) attend before them, and (c) otherwise to give them all
assistance . . . which he is reasonably able to give'.
Section 436 provided that if he refused to answer, the inspectors might
certify that fact to the court, and '(3)the court may thereupon enquire into
the case and . . . punish the offender in like manner as if he had been
guilty of contempt of the court'.
On those provisions,the conclusion was that as (i) inspectors would in very
many cases have been appointed where the circumstances suggested fraud, (ii)
persons questioned were bound to answer their questions, and (iii) the
inspectors' report might lead the secretary of state to petition for
winding-up or to proceed in the company's name in the public interest, the
privilege against self-incrimination was impliedly excluded.
The second major question was whether it was fair for the inspectors to seek
answers, given that they admittedly would be self-incriminating.
It had long been held that the court was concerned to ensure that the
procedure of private examination was not exercised in a manner oppressive to
the person to be examined.
It might be that the court had power under section 463(2) to refuse to
compel a person to answer or to punish him for refusing to answer, if it
felt that the questioning was oppressive and therefore unfair.
But that was not this case.
If it was right that the privilege against self-incrimination was not
available to Mr Wilson, the mere fact that the answers might incriminate him
could not be enough by itself to make it unfair that he should be required
to answer.
In considering, in the absence of privilege, whether it was fair that
questions should be put to him, it was highly relevant that Mr Wilson's
position in the three companies made it likely that he knew the answers to
the questions the inspectors wanted to ask him, and highly relevant also
that because of that position he owed the fiduciary duty to the companies.
The appeal was dismissed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For Mr Wilson: Stanley Brodie QC, Stephen Nathan and Robert Howe (Tarlo
Lyons).
For the inspectors: Andrew Collins QC and Arthur Charles (Treasury
Solicitor).

FT  17 JAN 92 / The Property Market: Small inroads made into debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The property debt mountain is starting to erode.
For the second quarter running, total lending to commercial property has
fallen by some Pounds 500m, according to the Bank of England. At the end of
November, outstanding loans totalled Pounds 39.67bn, down from Pounds
40.21bn three months earlier.
It may be a step in the right direction, but the halting progress underlines
the magnitude of the problem. At this rate, the new funds from property
sales and capital injections will not, by themselves, let the banks off the
hook.
So what is to be done? The problem has taxed the financial profession, which
has tried to find ways to go beyond the traditional sources of funds.
One avenue being explored is the US commercial paper market, the largest
market for short-term non-government debt in the world.
The UK property industry made its first inroad into this market just before
Christmas, when Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments raised Pounds 100m to
refinance 135 Bishopsgate, occupied by County NatWest, in the Broadgate
office development in the City of London.
The advantage was two-fold. It should save the company as much as 50 basis
points or Pounds 500,000 a year. And it strengthened its negotiating
position with the banks. 'The syndicated loan market is very nervous. We
wanted to show we had other ways of financing Broadgate,' said Mr Paul
Rivlin, a director of Rosehaugh.
The snag with the deal stemmed from the complexities of breaking new ground.
Sorting out the legal, tax and financial implications took six months.
The deal has a symbolic importance in that it repays the banks which took
part in the largest development finance deal of its time. 'It gives the
banks an element of comfort that their loans can be taken out. There has
been concern that there will be a never-ending process of rolling over
loans,' says Mr Richard Mully of County NatWest which arranged the
refinancing with Sanwa International Structured Finance, part of the
Japanese bank.
It is not yet clear how far it will be copied. Sceptics may point to another
innovative securitisation, which was heralded in 1990 as an important new
source of funds but has spawned no imitators. This involved Pounds 90m of
credit-enhanced floating rate notes that were arranged for BHH, an
industrial property company, by the same team of financiers that engineered
the RSD deal (who were then at Paribas and are now at Sanwa).
BHH found that the up-front expenses of the issue were higher than expected,
although it expects to save money over five years as it takes advantage of
falling interest rates. Moreover, its funding has the great virtue that it
does not have to do annual valuations and thus risk breaching its covenants.
'It has enabled us to hold our entire portfolio together. The banks would
have been more nervous,' says Mr Robin Bagnall, BHH's finance director.
It is unsurprising that no companies have followed BHH's example, according
to Mr Gary Wilder of Sanwa. Margins in the asset-backed floating rate note
market have virtually doubled since the deal.
The US commercial paper market is currently a much cheaper option; several
companies are considering following RSD down this route.
But the main limitation of securitisation, in whatever market, is that it is
only relevant for well-let property (which is often able to take its pick of
the bank loan and debenture markets anyway). Moreover, the costs of
arranging an issue are too high to be worthwhile for portfolios much under
Pounds 100m. At most, the US commercial paper market could apply to Pounds
2bn to Pounds 4bn of UK property.
So where most of the debt-encumbered industry is concerned, there is no hope
that the US commercial paper market will come to its rescue.
Given the finicky appetite of property investors, it is not clear who or
what will replace the property loans made to second-rate property with poor
tenants. 'That is the big conundrum,' says Mr Rupert Clarke of Jones Lang
Wootton. 'If there is a single wart on a property it will not be
refinanced,' says Mr Mike Riley of Chesterton.
In the worst cases, the banks will have to bite the bullet and make write
downs, which might add up to billions of pounds of loans. Others will have
to convert debt to equity, even though this damages their capacity to make
further loans.
Many lenders will simply be forced to roll over their loans. 'The banks are
going to be long-term providers of mortgage finance to the property
industry,' says Mr Mully. Much of the debt mountain is here to stay.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Break-up of British Gas is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEPARATION of British Gas' pipe network from its sales and marketing
operations and creation of regional gas companies by the end of the decade,
were proposed yesterday by the Liberal Democrats.
Legislation forcing British Gas to lose 60 per cent of its industrial market
share by 1997 was also suggested by Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment
spokesman. The pipe network would form a new privately owned company.
The plans are the latest in a series by the party on breaking up the
privatised utilities and British Rail. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, aims
to make Liberal Democrat policy appear more pro-market than the
Conservatives.
Mr Hughes also envisaged British Coal being privatised, with coal reserves
being controlled by one operation which would be separate from private
licensed mining companies.
Liberal Democrats did not object to privatisation of British Gas but the
form of the sell off had led to a 'tremendous abuse' of the company's market
power, Mr Hughes said.
He said the company faced a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission after trying to compensate for the expected loss of its
industrial market share by charging higher prices for domestic gas users.
Liberal Democrats wanted domestic users to have a choice of gas suppliers.

FT  17 JAN 92 / The Property Market: Bottom fishing for the brave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US, property values are predicted to bottom out in 1992. That is
about the only good news from the Real Estate Research Corporation's recent
report Emerging Trends in Real Estate 1992*.
The report, a 40-page booklet published by Equitable Real Estate Investment
Management, is based on interviews with a large panel of property
professionals. It warns that 'conditions will get worse before they get
better'.
Property financed a few years ago, and still in the pipeline, is expected to
add to the glut this year, particularly in cities such Los Angeles and
Chicago.
Signs of recovery are not expected until 1993 or 1994. Meanwhile, property's
continued poor performance will hurt investors, including commercial banks,
pension funds, insurance companies, foreigners and wealthy individuals.
Returns, dismal last year, 'will remain disappointing,' the RERC report
says.
Values are predicted to drop 10 per cent in 1992. Only apartment-type
investments are expected to rise in value in the next two years by an
appreciable amount - 6.3 per cent on the forecast.
A modest increase in transactions is, however, expected this year, if only
because the principal issue for many investors now is how to exit. Since
1990, transaction volume has been gridlocked, in part because the bid/ask
gap was too wide. But pressures on investors have grown and some insurance
companies, pension funds, commercial banks and desperate developers may have
more reasonably priced offerings.
For those with courage, patience and deep pockets, the RERC suggests it may
be a good time to pick up bargains. It believes many of these deals,
especially those by wealthy individuals, are more likely to be done quietly
than through the open bidding that characterised the 1980s.
The Japanese and Europeans are not expected to want to increase their
exposure, though the British and the Dutch, who both have long experience in
the market, may go bottom fishing for bargains.
Farmland is a bright spot. The report says prudent, gradual investment by
institutional capital is likely during the next few years.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Management (My Office): Pursuing policies in a very big way
 -Lucy Kellaway takes the lift to meet Mick Newmarch, the top man at the Pru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What matters most to the man who controls Britain's biggest pile of money?
To Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the Prudential, a big leather swivel
chair is the best aid to managing the insurance company's Pounds 50bn. 'Most
of my job is thinking, so a comfortable chair is essential,' he says.
Indeed, everything about his office, up on the tenth floor above the hi-fi
shops of the Tottenham Court Road, is comfortable; it is also big. The
panoramic view, stretching over to the City is certainly big. So are the two
leather sofas and leather arm chairs. But then, so too is Newmarch.
The building is a temporary home while the Pru spends four years and well
over Pounds 100m making its old headquarters in High Holborn 'look quite
respectable' - as Newmarch puts it. In the meantime, he has tarted up his
new office by covering the dark wood panelling in fake moire silk to make it
feel lighter.
Otherwise there is only a handful of personal touches: he has chosen a
sentimental picture of two small girls by Hornel, the Scottish painter, out
of the Pru's large art collection to hang opposite his desk. 'I am an
absolute dilettante about art, but I like that one.'
On a shelf he has a bronze owl and a sculpture of rice maiden, given to his
wife 'in the days when the Japanese still thought giving presents to
westerners was the best way to do business'. His wife considered it so
hideous, she would not have it in the house.
Newmarch - known as 'The Bruiser' in Private Eye - has the reputation of
being somewhat overbearing. He is well known for striking a tough bargain -
last year he managed to secure a pay rise of 43 per cent despite the Pru's
falling profits; earlier he persuaded the company to put more than Pounds
500,000 towards a smart flat in Regents Park.
But his office, which has a strong functional feel, does not reinforce the
impression. His desk displays signs of hard work, with an outsize brief case
and piles of papers. Next to them are three big screens and a large
calculator.
'I've got Reuters and Topic - it's a bit of an indulgence, me not wanting to
give up my roots as an investment manager,' says Newmarch, who still does
not feel quite right unless he knows what is happening in the market. He
also has a computer linked to the company's mainframe of which he makes
little use. 'I'm a two finger computer man,' he says.
Neither is he dependent on what he calls any 'printed aid'. Fifteen minutes
is enough to scan the newspaper cuttings that his staff start pasting at 7
o'clock each morning. There are none of the trendy management text books on
his shelves - indeed, there are no books at all. Newmarch, who joined the
company straight from school in 1955, believes in learning-by-doing.
Since he became chief executive two years ago he has been trying to 'develop
a total strategy for the Pru', and two or three times a week he keeps a slot
in his diary to 'liaise' and 'interface' with his team of eight strategy
experts.
He spends most of his time talking on one of the three telephones on his
desk, and walking around the Pru's many offices meeting his staff. He says
his colleagues are invited to pop in and see him whenever they like. However
Newmarch is not known for being a democrat; his office is at the end of a
corridor, protected by a secretary and a PA.
But a democrat is not what the Pru needs at the moment, as it shuts down its
estate agencies, divides and rules among its sales force, and cuts layers
out of its insurance business. A tough touch is perhaps what is called for.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Football pools at risk, MPs warned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTBALL pools would not survive the introduction of a national lottery,
according to a letter circulated to MPs yesterday. A private member's bill
which would make a national lottery possible comes before parliament today.
In a letter to Littlewoods Pools, the largest UK pools operator, Mr Frank
McFadden, manager of the European office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy firm, said: 'The introduction of a UK national lottery would
effectively kill off the football pools within a period of weeks.' He based
his claim on the experience of Littlewoods Pools in Belgium which survived
only three weeks after a national lottery was introduced.
Mr McFadden wrote a report for the European Community last year on the
gambling and betting industry.
His letter said: 'The UK has the largest gambling and gaming market within
the European Community. There is a limited elasticity of demand for
additional gambling and gaming products in Britain.'
Mr Ivan Lawrence, Conservative MP for Burton and sponsor of today's bill,
described Mr McFadden's argument as 'manifest nonsense'. He added: 'It
totally misses the point that football is a passion in this country. The
Italian experience shows that where there is a strong footballing nation the
pools continue side by side with the lottery successfully.'
Mr Lawrence pointed to a Gallup poll in October which found that 92 per cent
of pools players would continue to play if a national lottery was
introduced, and that only 5 per cent would stop.
Mr McFadden's letter was circulated by the Advisory Forum on Gambling, a
lobby group funded by companies including pools operators and betting
offices. It also warned that loss of pools revenue because of a national
lottery would lead to many job losses, particularly in Liverpool.
Some charities have been actively supporting Mr Lawrence's bill. Others have
said that a national lottery would divert money away from other forms of
charitable giving.
Mr Frank Flannery, deputy chairman of UK Charity Lotteries, which last year
launched an instant lottery game to raise money for charities and the arts,
said having one national lottery would be unfair. He called for legislation
to create a 'level playing field' so organisations could run lotteries
nationally.

THERE were 35 industrial disputes in progress last November, the lowest
November total since 1933, according to provisional estimates from the
Department of Employment, David Goodhart writes.
It is provisionally estimated that 45,000 working days were lost in
Nov-ember last year, compared with 83,000 in October, and an average of
533,000 for November during the 1980s.
During the 12 months to November last year it is provisionally estimated
that a total of 800,000 working days was lost as a result of 371 industrial
disputes. The comparable figures for 1990 were 2.2m working days lost and
629 stoppages in progress.

showing that specialist provision for offender training fell by 57 per cent
last year.
Apex Trust announced on Wednesday that it would have to call in receivers
this week unless the government stepped in.
Mr Barry Sheerman, a Labour home affairs spokesman, said yesterday that at
the beginning of las year Apex Trust and Nacro, the two main providers of
specialist training for offenders, ran 95 centres for 15,000 trainees. Since
April, cuts in the employment training budget and a revised system of fund
allocation through Training and Enterprise Councils had resulted in the
number of centres being reduced to 48 and the number of trainee places to
6,400.
Mr Sherman said Apex Trust research had shown that ex-offenders in
employment were three times less likely to re-offend than those who were
unemployed.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said on BBC Radio yesterday: 'We
can't write blank cheques, and we can't keep writing cheques for money when
an organisation keeps coming back for more.'
He added that there were other bodies providing training for ex-offenders
and that training would still be available if the trust collapsed.
Twelve companies which have sponsored Apex in recent years are meeting today
at BT's London headquarters in an effort to save the charity. Apex said:
'It's our only flicker of hope at the moment.' Several leading employers and
customers in the construction industry have expressed concern that
self-employment is leading to a decline in the number of adequately trained
people, according to a report from the National Economic Development
Council's construction group.
The report recommends that the industry should phase in a
qualifications-based operative registration scheme to be applied generally.
The report expects skill shortages to re-emerge when the recession ends and
also suggests poor training is a cause of the industry's poor safety record.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Corporate tax 10th highest in OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE rate of corporate tax in the UK is the 10th highest among the 24
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
according to a survey published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies
yesterday.
The study also shows that corporate tax rates in OECD countries tend to
discourage cross-border investment and leave companies vulnerable to the
effects of inflation by favouring debt finance over equity or retained
earnings.
The analysis shows that when the real interest rate is 5 per cent, the rate
of return required before corporate taxes to persuade someone to invest in a
business enterprise would be 5.9 per cent across OECD member states. This
ignores personal taxes, and assumes average inflation at 4.5 per cent and
average weightings on the different sources of finance. The figures reflect
all corporate taxes and take into account available deductions.
Turkey has the highest required rate of return at 7.2 per cent, while the
lowest is 5 per cent in Greece and Sweden. The UK comes in the middle, at
5.9 per cent. The figures also show that the required rate of return on debt
 -an average of 2.8 per cent across all countries - makes it preferable to
new equity (at 6.1 per cent) and retained earnings (7.9 per cent).
A separate part of the study showed that across member states it is
substantially less attractive for companies to invest abroad than
domestically. The overall average transnational rate of return before tax is
5.9 per cent for domestic investment. That compares with 7.5 per cent both
for countries in one state investing abroad and for foreign companies
investing in the typical OECD country.

SOME OF the country's most deprived inner-city areas are to be helped by an
urban aid package announced by the government yesterday.
Initial allocations for 1992-93 to 57 urban programme authorities amount to
Pounds 248m.
The biggest allocations go to Birmingham (Pounds 22.5m), Manchester/Salford
(Pounds 20.8m), Liverpool (Pounds 18.2m), and Newcastle/Gateshead (Pounds
16.2m).
Smaller amounts go to Islington and Lambeth in London (Pounds 8.5m each),
Sheffield (Pounds 5.9m), Hackney in London (Pounds 5.4m), and Leeds,
Nottingham, Wolverhampton, Middlesbrough and Sunderland (all about Pounds
5m).
Under the urban programme the 57 local authorities receive grant at 75 per
cent on approved capital and revenue expenditure, and supplementary-credit
approvals on the remaining 25 per cent.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Baker faces a fear of failure far from home: Lionel Barber
assesses the Washington conference next week on aid to the former Soviet
republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, called last month for an
international conference on aid to what used to be the Soviet Union, some of
his closest colleagues felt they had been ambushed.
He offered no date, no firm list of invitations, and only a sketchy preview
of the conference's objectives.
Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, was reported as livid at the
failure to consult. European allies scrambled to respond.
Now, with less than a week until the conference in Washington on January
22-23, the mood is more favourable.
Some 50-60 governments are expected to send delegations, supported by the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Mr Baker can claim to have rounded up an impressive posse.
US officials say the immediate purpose of the conference is practical: how
best to ensure efficient distribution of food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies this winter and next, amid widespread reports of
official corruption, waste and incompetence in the former Soviet republics.
Western donors have their own problems, too. The flood of well-meaning
visitors to Moscow, Kiev, Minsk and other reformist centres has reached a
point where Soviet reformers risk being smothered with kindness.
'We need an orderly division of labour,' said one US official.
A second US goal is to avoid creating a new bureaucracy to co-ordinate aid.
The Treasury and the State Department are wary of putative efforts by
Europeans to create a new superstructure which could dilute US influence on
the Continent, along the lines of the EBRD.
The picture has shifted since 1989, when President George Bush awarded the
European Commission the task of co-ordinating aid to Poland and Hungary.
Then, Mr Bush wanted to show he was a good European, unafraid of sharing
political burdens with the EC.
On Soviet aid, the balancing act is more difficult: the US remains loath to
cede too much of the initiative to the Europeans.
In his speech at Princeton University last month, Mr Baker staked out a
bolder US policy toward the disintegrating Soviet Union.
He may have been responding to a general drift within the administration as
the senior ranks waited for the resignation of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, but other observers argue that he wanted to put the US in the
driving seat before it was too late.
Yet Mr Baker's well-honed rhetoric, suggesting that the west had a duty to
respond to the historic opportunities created by the new Russian revolution,
stopped short of a commitment to direct US financial aid. Instead, the State
Department prefers to talk about 'collective engagement'.
Some senior US officials compare this, in glowing terms, to the global
coalition assembled by Mr Bush against Iraq a year ago. Hence Mr Baker's
call for a 'coalition in support of freedom', in support of democracy and
free markets in what was the Soviet Union.
Allies are more sceptical, describing 'collective engagement' as a fancy
phrase to cover up the real goal of using other people's money to serve US
foreign policy goals.
In 1991, the US persuaded allies such as Germany, Japan and Gulf Arab states
to stump up more than Dollars 50bn to pay for the war against Iraq, and to
finance aid to 'front-line' states such as Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. By some
calculations, the US even turned in a small profit.
In 1992, there is a real difference. 'At least the Americans provided
half-a-million troops to fight the war,' said one western diplomat. 'What
are they offering now?'
The US response is that the meeting is not a 'pledging' conference (if
countries wish to offer money, though, they will not be turned down). More
important, officials say, is the US bestowing that rare, elusive quality
called political leadership.
As the self-styled powerbroker extraordinaire, the US may well be best
placed to persuade other countries to agree to a division of labour. One
obvious option is to play on fears about German domination of Soviet aid
policy, says one US official.
Taking a less cynical view, the US could offer, as Mr Baker suggested in his
Princeton speech to launch the initiative, scientific expertise to help the
ex-Soviets dismantle their nuclear weapons; the Nordic countries could focus
on the Baltic states; western US states such as Oregon and Alaska, as well
as Japan and South Korea, could develop the Soviet far east.
The big question next week is whether Mr Baker will put the conference
agenda onto US lines or whether other countries - notably Germany - will
broaden the debate to include a discussion on how the West should support
economic reform in the space vacated by the Soviet Union.
This might include, for instance, a proposal for a Russian Economic
Development Bank pressing micro-economic reform in concert with the
macro-economic efforts of the IMF and World Bank. These and other ideas
about fostering 'grass-roots capitalism' have been floated in recent weeks
in Washington.
So far, the administration is treading cautiously, aware that the mood in
the US has turned markedly introspective and hostile to foreign aid of all
shapes and sizes.
This is mainly due to the sluggishness of the US economy, but it also
reflects a fear of failure in dealing with the gigantic task of overhauling
the economy of its long-time adversary.
Reconciling this fear of failure with the desire for leadership on Soviet
aid will be Mr Baker's trickiest task next week - a task worthy of the
master of political stage-management.

AID donors are being asked to channel some of their assistance to the former
Soviet republics through the countries of eastern and central Europe, so
helping them to maintain some of their lost Soviet export markets, George
Graham reports from Washington.
Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are hoping for a triangular trade in
which donor nations would finance the purchase of food and pharmaceuticals
from their countries, to be delivered as aid to the ex-Soviet lands.
Officials of the three countries met in Budapest this week to agree their
approach, and are hoping to use the aid conference in Washington next week
to secure commitments by donors such as the Gulf states and Japan.
In an operation that could be a precedent, the European Community last year
funded a shipment of 300,000 tonnes of wheat from Hungary to Albania.
However, eastern European diplomats are concentrating their efforts on
donors lacking large agricultural surpluses, which they are keen to supply
as aid.
Eastern European diplomats say they would like to divide these triangular
deals roughly in line with the market shares they used to have for various
types of product in the Soviet Union, but cannot be precise on aid sought.

<TEXT>
MODERATE price increases in December left US inflation at 3.1 per cent in
1991, its lowest rate for five years.
The Labour Department said yesterday its index of consumer prices rose by
0.1 per cent in December, or 0.3 per cent after seasonal adjustment.
The low inflation rate in 1991 was much helped by a 7.4 per cent drop in
energy prices (compared with an 18.1 per cent rise in 1990), but inflation
in almost all sectors stayed moderate. Food prices rose only 2.5 per cent,
their slowest advance since 1976.
The main exception was medical care, where prices rose by 7.9 per cent in
1991. There is a long-established pattern of this outstripping general
consumer price inflation.
Other components of the index to rise sharply included alcoholic drinks,
which climbed 9.9 per cent largely as a result of higher federal excise
taxes; tobacco products, up 11.1 per cent; and school tuition and fees, up
9.8 per cent.
The seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent December price increase was slightly
higher than private-sector economists had been forecasting, but it remained
relatively modest.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Health care gaffe shows up Buchanan
</HEADLINE>

   CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PATRICK Buchanan, the right-wing challenger to President George Bush for
the Republican presidential nomination this year, made a big gaffe on health
care policy yesterday, telling a group of pensioners he was so wealthy he
did not have to bother about health insurance.
The television commentator and former speechwriter to presidents Nixon and
Reagan, complained that the present US health-care system was suffering from
excessive bureaucracy, waste and form-filling. 'When I go to the doctor -
and I am a wealthy man - these (insurance) forms are so complex I can't fill
them out. I just tell my wife: 'Send them a cheque'.'
Mr Buchanan was addressing more than 150 members of the American Association
of Retired Persons in an event billed as a chance for him to outline his
policy for health care reform.
The response in the audience was hostile. Several pensioners said Mr
Buchanan had confused private insurance company forms with federal
government programmes such as Medicare.
Earlier, he had delivered a blistering attack on Mr Bush for having broken
his pledge to impose no new taxes, which rescued the president's faltering
for election campaign in 1988. Mr Bush faces his first campaign test in the
New Hampshire primary contest against Mr Buchanan next month.
The president, who had visited New Hampshire on Wednesday, said he would
unveil a wide-ranging health care plan in his State of the Union address
this month. One proposal under review is to offer health care tax credits to
low-income groups and the uninsured.
Mr Buchanan said he favoured tax credits and opposed a nationalised health
system, such as that in Britain. 'The doctor-patient relationship
disappears,' he said, referring to the UK. 'You have bureaucrats dealing
with bureaucrats.' He also said US medical technology was far superior to
Britain's.
His main theme is 'America first'. He repeated his attacks on foreign aid
and on defence spending abroad, saying countries such as Germany should
defend themselves. 'Can't the Germans defend Munich? I mean, their tradition
is not wholly pacifist.'

<TEXT>
MR MOHAMED BOUDIAF, Algeria's new head of state, returned to Algiers
yesterday, from 28 years' exile in Morocco, to a hero's welcome.
The 72-year-old veteran of Algeria's independence war, sentenced to death in
1964 by his own country for political activity, will head the five-man High
Council of State, set up following the resignation of President Chadli
Bendjedid on Saturday and the cancellation of a second round of elections.
The poll was widely expected to have catapulted the fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front into power.
The first man to welcome him was Gen Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister and
a key member of ruling council.
'As in the past, I promise the Algerian people that I will give all my
efforts to guarantee their prosperity and to serve them,' Mr Boudiaf said on
arrival yesterday.
All three parties that won seats in the first round of the now aborted
elections - the FIS, the National Liberation Front and the Front des Forces
Socialistes - continue to describe the events of the past few days as
unconstitutional. However, none of them appears, to be prepared to risk
challenging those now ruling the country with more than words.
The parties have held meetings over the past two days, apparently aimed at
co-ordinating their response towards the new council - which has made no
promise as yet so far to hold elections of any kind.
The FIS has pledged to oppose the new leadership legally. In a communique
issued after Mr Boudiaf's arrival, it called for calm and patience, telling
its militants to avoid provocation.
The FIS has accused the authorities of starting to arrest its members. There
has been no official confirmation of this.

<TEXT>
TOKYO department store sales fell 2.4 per cent in December from a year
earlier, the largest fall since 1965, and a sign of easing consumer demand
and of a more general slowing of Japanese economic growth.
Japanese retailers, who regard the Tokyo figures as an important indicator,
said unusually warm weather had caused a decline in winter clothing sales,
but that sharp falls in sales of art works and other luxury items were
clearly linked to the collapse of the financial 'bubble'.
The fall was the steepest recorded by the Japan Department Stores'
Association since it began releasing sales figures in 1965, apart from the
distortions caused by the introduction of a value-added tax in 1989.
Sales of art works and crafts were down 15 per cent on a year earlier, sales
of household items fell 3.5 per cent and clothing sales fell 1.8 per cent.
For the full year, sales rose only 2.4 per cent on 1990, the third lowest
increase since 1965.
Meanwhile, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation yesterday reported that the
country's crude steel production last year totalled 109.6m tons, down 0.6
per cent from 1990.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Wily Shamir's coalition on last legs: Disappointment at
partners' resignation may belie Likud gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a brief but eventful life of almost 20 months, the coalition
government habitually labelled the most extreme in Israel's history looks to
be on its last legs.
As is often the case with Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the wily prime minister, it was
hard to tell yesterday whether he was happy or sad.
Officially, he was said to be disappointed that Tehiya and Moledet, two
extreme rightwing partners in the coalition led by his Likud party, had
decided to quit.
Their action was in protest against offering a limited form of
self-government to the Palestinians of the occupied territories in the
current Middle East peace process.
The coalition, of right-wing and religious parties, weathered the Gulf
crisis and presided over a huge influx of Jewish immigrants from the former
Soviet Union.
Above all, from the point of view of Likud ideology, it produced an
unprecedented expansion of Jewish settlement in the occupied territories
while simultaneously achieving Middle East peace talks largely on its own
terms.
It might seem that Mr Shamir would want to continue such an arrangement
until the due date for a general election in November.
However, there are clear reasons why he may be quite happy if it indeed
collapses early next week.
Mr Shamir has the option of running a minority government that might survive
until November. But his aides say he would prefer an early election, given
that Likud is well ahead of the opposition Labour party in the polls.
The faltering economy could well be in worse shape in November and an early
poll would pre-empt attempts by rivals within Likud to challenge Mr Shamir's
supremacy.
Freed of the far right, Mr Shamir may find it easier to reach agreement with
the US on Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees - due to be settled over the next
few weeks - which are of great importance to the immigration-burdened
economy.
Meanwhile, by continuing the peace talks, he could present himself to the
electorate as a leader who sacrificed his government for the sake of the
peace process, undermining opposition claims that the Likud is not serious
about the negotiations.
There are, however, flaws in this scheme of things. Under Israeli
parliamentary law, Mr Shamir cannot call an election without winning a
majority to do so in the Knesset. For this he is seeking Labour party
co-operation to engineer a date in the late spring or summer - but Labour
will want to exact a price for its help.
Mr Shamir also faces a dilemma over the loan guarantees. The Likud cannot
lightly give in to the main US condition that Israel curb settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip - something which Mr Shamir has resolutely refused,
to date.
But with an election pending, the leverage President George Bush can exert
on Mr Shamir through the loan guarantee issue is undoubtedly enhanced. A
serious clash with the US, with which relations have already deteriorated
during the life of the present government, would not go down well with most
Israelis who fear both the political and economic consequences.
A significant shortfall in the amount requested would seriously jeopardise
Israel's ability to borrow large amounts elsewhere and would almost
certainly trigger unpopular compensatory measures at home, such as tax rises
and expenditure cuts, at a time of fast-rising unemployment and economic
hardship.
The precarious state of the economy is Labour's most promising election
weapon against Likud. But Labour has failed to mount an effective opposition
to Mr Shamir since its own grand coalition with Likud broke up two years
ago.
Before a general election takes place it is due to mount its own leadership
battle, pitting current leader Mr Shimon Peres against Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a
former prime minister, and at least two other candidates. The contest will
sharply expose to voters the deep internal splits within the party - hardly
an election -winning formula.
Mr Shamir's less than anguished reaction to the crumbling of his government
stems from his confidence that he holds most of the cards in the domestic
political poker game that will ensue in the coming weeks.
However, the joker in the pack for him may prove to be the issue of the loan
guarantees held firmly in the grasp of President Bush.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Australian jobless at post-war high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate rose to a post-war record of 10.6 per cent in
December, increasing pressure on the troubled Labor government to take
urgent action to stimulate the economy.
The government statistical service said the number of unemployed increased
to 910,300 from 900,700 in November, when 10.5 per cent of the workforce was
unemployed, also a post-war record.
However, the gloomy message about the continued fragility of the economy was
tempered by a rise of 39,200 in employment which provided some hope that the
jobless total may be close to peaking.
The unusual increase in both the employment and unemployment totals was
caused by an increase from 63 per cent to 63.3 per cent in the participation
rate, which measures the proportion of the workforce which is working or
actively seeking work.
Mr Kim Beazley, the employment minister, said the figures indicated that the
employment level had stopped falling. Leading indicators released by the
employment department also suggested that further large declines in
employment were unlikely.
However, the government is still expecting unemployment to reach 10.75 per
cent later this year. Some independent economists believe unemployment will
peak at 11 per cent and remain above 10 per cent until next year.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the unemployment rate was 'far too
high,' and promised that an economic statement planned for late February or
early March would 'turn it around'.
Mr Keating replaced Mr Bob Hawke as prime minister last month after pledging
to 'get the economy moving again' following flat or negative growth in seven
of the last eight quarters.
Business leaders have told Mr Keating the economy is in even worse shape
than the official figures suggest, and are pressing him to deliver a
significant fiscal stimulus. Trade union leaders also want a relaxation of
fiscal policy.
Economists expect a package of measures designed to stimulate private sector
investment and finance government infrastructure projects, probably worth
between ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 610m) and ADollars 2bn.
Mr Ari Ben-Menashe, an Israeli who claims to have been a middle-man in
secret negotiations between the US and Iran, has been ordered to leave
Australia by the end of the month.

ISRAEL'S prospects are receding of obtaining the full Dollars 10bn (Pounds
5.5bn) of loan guarantees it has sought from the US to help finance the cost
of absorbing Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
Although President George Bush is not expected to seek any further
postponement on the loan guarantees, the administration is unlikely to back
the full Israeli request for guarantees on Dollars 2bn of borrowing a year
for five years unless Israel agrees to new conditions on its settlements in
the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
President George Bush won a battle of wills with Israel last September when
he asked Congress to delay considering the loan guarantees for 120 days. He
said the issue would jeopardise the Middle East peace conference which was
then due to open in Madrid.
The administration is now expected to come up with a proposal by early
February.
Mr Bush is extremely sensitive about the Israeli settlements.
He is said to feel that Israel has reneged on promises not to use earlier
US-guaranteed loans for construction in the territories.
Arab delegations to the US-sponsored Middle East peace talks, meanwhile,
insist that the settlements are obstructing the peace process.
'There can be no progress in any area, in any sphere, unless all settlement
activity ceases,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian delegation's
spokeswoman.
Mr Bush is expected to insist either on more explicit pledges from Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, or on a formula such as that suggested by Senator
Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate foreign aid appropriations
sub-committee, which would deduct any money spent on settlements
construction from the guarantees.
Few analysts in Washington, however, believe Mr Shamir can concede enough on
settlements to satisfy Mr Bush.
But without the White House's explicit backing, congressmen who favour the
loan guarantees believe it will be politically difficult to win enough
support.
Politicians are finding foreign aid, of which Israel is the principal
recipient, with Dollars 1.8bn of military assistance and Dollars 1.2bn of
economic support this year, increasingly unpalatable when their constituents
are suffering from recession and the federal government is strapped for
cash.
And although Israel is only asking the US to guarantee its borrowings, not
provide fresh grants, the request is not cost-free: new budget rules require
the US to set aside a proportion of the guarantee to cover the estimated
subsidy element behind the loans.
Credit analysts suggest Israel would probably not be able to find such large
sums at all without the guarantees, except through very short-term
borrowings - rather than 30-year loans.
But if Israel cannot give way on its right to continue building new
settlements in the occupied territories, it may have to give up at least
part of the Dollars 10bn guarantees it has requested.

SOUTH KOREAN riot police yesterday surrounded the troubled Hyundai car
plants where defiant union workers, armed with steel pipes, settled down for
a drawn-out occupation, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'We have hundreds of police outside the plants keeping watch. And over 1,000
more are coming from Pusan,' said the police in the nearby south-eastern
city of Ulsan.
Workers sporting red headbands built elaborate barricades at the 13 main
gates, using two fire engines, cars, tyres and doors, and ordered company
officials and non-union workers out of the main buildings.
Hyundai ordered the plants to close temporarily from today after unionists
voted on Tuesday to upgrade a five-month dispute into full-time industrial
action.
The company said Hyundai would withhold 70 per cent of workers' salaries
during the closure.
The union said workers were demanding the release of several employees
arrested in sporadic labour disputes five months ago. They want 11 unionists
sacked this year - for what the company said was illegal labour activity -
to be reinstated.
The union had threatened to begin a full-scale strike from next Monday if
the management rejected its demands.

<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, the UK trade and industry secretary, starts a visit to
Mexico on Monday, at the head of a business delegation to take advantage of
what he calls the 'remarkable developments. . . over the last few years with
the freeing of markets through trade and investment liberalisation,
deregulation and privatisation'.
One aim will be to increase UK trade with Mexico, which with exports in 1990
of Pounds 262m and imports of Pounds 172m lags considerably behind the US,
other EC countries and Japan. In addition, Mr Lilley intends to discuss the
implications of the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US,
Canada and Mexico, which subject to approval by the US Senate should come
into force this year.
Also on the agenda will be the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
On this subject, Mr Lilley said that Mexico and the UK 'tended to see
eye-to-eye' with a view to completing the round - whose negotiators are
studying Gatt's final and comprehensive proposals - as soon as possible.

FT  17 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Italians rush to build ties with Moscow -
The search for business opportunities in the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Rome just before Christmas, the
Italian government and the country's captains of industry rushed in almost
unseemly haste to obtain his ear.
Recognising that Mr Yeltsin had finally emerged as the strong man of the
former Soviet Union, they were anxious to lay claims to play a leading part
in the new commonwealth dominated by Russia. The Italian treasury obligingly
waived earlier objections over credit guarantees and unblocked credits worth
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 670m) to purchase essential clothing, footwear and
foodstuffs. Formal approval from the Italian export credit guarantee
institute Sace was given yesterday to cover 90 per cent of the credits.
For his part, Mr Yeltsin made grandiose promises of collaboration, including
an early agreement with Fiat on an automotive joint-venture. He also assumed
the all-important responsibility for the unblocked Italian credits.
Such Italian self-interest is not surprising. Both the Italian public and
private sectors spent much time and money cultivating links with the former
Soviet Union. Only Germany among European Community countries devoted as
much attention as Italy to building commercial ties with Moscow.
Italy and Germany shared a common interest in importing energy, but the
Italians also regarded the Soviet Union as particularly apt for a whole
range of intermediate technology goods as well as cheap consumer items.
By the time of the Soviet break-up, Italy accounted for a quarter of all EC
trade. Between 1989-90 Italian imports rose from L2,471bn to L4,938bn
(Pounds 2.3bn), almost half of which consisted of oil and gas; exports grew
more slowly, from L2,403bn to L3,104bn, leaving a substantial deficit.
Although this is only 2 per cent of total Italian trade, Italy, anxious to
narrow the deficit, went to great lengths to provide credit guarantees to
stimulate business. The government agreed to guarantee credit lines worth
L5,000bn between 1990 and 1995.
Italian business therefore now wants to ensure existing contracts are not
overtaken by events and to take quick advantage of new opportunities backed
by the government commitment to provide export credit guarantees.
Government officials and public- and private-sector businessmen all say the
main problems are:
confusion over the juridical nature of the ties within the new commonwealth.
doubts over the extent to which Russia can act as leader, both in assuming
responsibility for old and new debts, and in catalysing contracts which span
more than one republic.
This is highlighted by the refusal of the treasury to unblock a L1,200bn
credit line agreed in September 1990 with the former Soviet foreign trade
bank, VEB, of which less than 10 per cent has been disbursed. Officials at
Mediocredito, the medium-term credit institute responsible for disbursing
the funds, say no organisation has been satisfactorily identified as capable
of assuming the responsibilities which the VEB would have discharged, unlike
the Dollars 1.2bn unblocked during the Yeltsin visit.
Despite these difficulties, contacts are going ahead on a number of deals.
Fiat is keen to negotiate a joint venture with Vaz, the former Soviet state
automotive producer, and believes a letter of intent could be initialled
shortly. The terms of the proposal involve Fiat in taking a 30 per cent
stake in a privatised Vaz, modernising and retooling the plant to produce a
new car model. No price tag has yet been placed on the proposed investment.
Fiat had for some time sought to strengthen its ties with the Soviet Union,
where the potential demand for cars is seen as quadruple the present level,
but the Vaz deal was put on hold in early 1990 because of political
uncertainties. The Turin-based group now clearly hopes it can reap advantage
from obtaining a privileged position in an undemanding, expanding market.
Meanwhile, the need to balance trade and secure energy supplies is a key
strategic consideration in a number of Italian state companies active in the
former Soviet Union.
Mr Franco Nobili, head of the Italian state holding company IRI, laid
special emphasis in his December talks with Mr Yeltsin on going ahead with
energy-based deals. Principal among these is a joint venture between
Ansaldo, its power engineering subsidiary, and Russia, Belarus (formerly
Belorussia) and Ukraine, to convert exist power stations against the supply
of electricity.
Before the Soviet Union broke up, Ansaldo formed the joint venture
Energo-Engineering, envisaging the reconversion to gas of some 16 power
stations in these republics. Payment was to be in the form of electricity
supplies carried by a new power line through Hungary, Austria and
Yugoslavia. Ansaldo would build new sub-stations in an overall arrangement
worth L5,000bn.
Ansaldo says Russia is anxious for the deal, but there is considerable
confusion over how the Ukraine part of the proposal can be incorporated.
Also with an eye on payment through energy supplies, the Italian state oil
concern ENI has agreed to set up a co-ordinating committee with the Russian
authorities.
ENI is expected to go ahead with negotiations to modernise the Russian
gas-pipeline network, help upgrade seven Russian refineries and assist in
the development of Siberian oil.
While big projects are likely to be given priority and benefit from
counter-trade payments, many small business deals (other than the purely
speculative) are expected to be delayed until the situation is clarified. As
it is, the Soviet political turmoil saw Italian exports fall in the first
nine months of last year by 22 per cent to L1,853bn.

NISSAN has suspended work at its car assembly plant in Peru, it said
yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Japan's second-largest vehicle maker had produced finished cars in Lima,
when Peru's 50 per cent tariff on finished cars made marketing of imported
cars there prohibitively expensive. But since Peru cut that tariff to 15 per
cent last year, it has become cheaper to import finished cars than to
assemble them locally from imported parts, the company noted.
Nissan said suspension of work at the plant, in effect since last October,
did not necessarily mean the permanent shut-down of production in Peru, But
a start-up of production at the plant was unlikely in the near future.
In 1982, at the peak of production, the company said its plant in Peru
assembled roughly 9,500 vehicles, largely small passenger cars and trucks.
In May last year, Toyota Japan's largest car maker, also suspended its
vehicle-assembling operation in Lima.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government yesterday approved L10,000bn (Pounds 4.6bn) in
much-needed funds for IRI, the state holding company, and Efim, the state
industrial holding.
The money will be made available under a complex formula intended to
circumvent a supreme court block on the funds, and to satisfy the European
Commission which has been scrutinising state aid to Italian industry.
IRI has debts exceeding L55,000bn and has had no significant fresh injection
of funds since 1989. Efim has debts of L7,000bn and has been nearly
bankrupted by supporting its loss-making aluminium activities.
Last February, the government agreed to cover up to 4 per cent annual
interest and guarantee loans and bonds on maturities of up to 12 years
totalling L10,000bn for the two organisations. This was blocked by the
public audit office, an action subsequently supported by the supreme court
which ruled that, since government financial planning was on a three-year
programme, it was unconstitutional to create obligations for future
administrations beyond this period.
The new formula envisages three cash injections of L400bn, L400bn and
L1,200bn covering 1991-1993, plus a guarantee to cover up to 4 per cent of
interest on credits and bonds during this period. According to an IRI
spokesman this will be regarded as the equivalent of the state, as
shareholder, injecting fresh funds - even though IRI remains in the
anomalous position of being a holding with no formal capital merely an
endowment fund.
On the basis of these cash injections, IRI would be able to raise up to
L8,450bn between 1991 and 1993; Efim would be able to borrow up to L1,550bn.
IRI plans to invest some L70,000bn in its various holdings over the next
four years, and maintains that it has only received L2,58bn in direct state
aid since 1986. These funds are needed to develop advanced sectors such as
telecommunications. However, substantial investment is also needed to
restructure traditional industries like steel (due to absorb L3,000bn),
ship-building and defence, in addition to heavy continuing commitments such
as that to RAI, the state-run television.
At the same time IRI is gearing up to meet the government's demands to raise
L15,000bn this year from privatisation. Privatisation measures, including
the right for the private sector to own majority stakes in state companies,
are a key element of revenue raising in the 1992 budget. However, political
disagreements are still holding up final approval of the form privatisation
will take.

THE number of attacks on foreigners in Germany increased tenfold in 1991 to
2,368, according to a confidential government report disclosed by a Berlin
newspaper yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin.
'The drastic increase has led to serious unease among asylum-seeking and
(resident) foreigners in Germany,' the report said. The problem has prompted
a police crackdown on neo-Nazi gangs and greater effort to protect
foreigners.
The report recorded hundreds of fire bombings of hostels for asylum-seekers
as well as physical assaults on individuals. It said most of the culprits
were neo-Nazi skinheads and right-wing high school students, apprentices or
unemployed young people.

<TEXT>
MR Gerhard Stoltenberg, the German defence minister, yesterday called for
the German armed forces to be given the green light to take part in
peace-keeping and peace-making exercises across the globe.
The debate over the future role of the Bundeswehr, and its involvement in
operations outside the area of the Nato alliance, has blown up once again,
at the same time as a parliamentary committee starts work on an overhaul of
the German constitution.
The Gulf war, the need for international peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia,
and the possibility of other conflicts in the former Soviet Union, have
focused public attention on the constitutional restrictions on Germany
taking part in such exercises.
In spite of a degree of political consensus over participation in United
Nations peacekeeping exercises, government and opposition are divided over
the limits to be put on it.
Thus the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), whose support is needed for any
constitutional amendment, are adamant that German troops should only be used
for peace-keeping, not for peace-making or intervention.
Mr Stoltenberg presented to parliament the report of an independent
commission into the future role of the Bundeswehr, recommending its use in
'international actions to secure peace and maintain international law'. He
said the Bundeswehr should also be involved in the building of a defence arm
to the future European political union, and that German armed forces 'should
be able to take part in the whole spectrum of international actions in the
framework of the United Nations charter'.
The defence minister said that the defence budget for the coming years had
been reduced to DM9bn (Pounds 3.1bn) a year, a real cut of almost half in
the level of spending of the mid-1980s. Any further cuts were unacceptable.
Mr Walter Kolbow, a defence spokesman for the SPD, said the demand of the
government for such a sweeping 'out of area' role for the Bundeswehr
remained unacceptable to the opposition. He also insisted that further
budget cuts were feasible, including abandonment of the European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA).

SIGNIFICANT changes in the accounting practices of publicly-quoted companies
in Ireland have been recommended in a report published yesterday by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (ICAI).
The report says Irish accounting practices should be brought into line with
those in the UK, as established under the Accounting Standards Board there
in 1989.
It said that under the existing system, 'many published financial statements
do not at present provide enough information to enable users to judge the
performance of directors and management and make decisions about their
future relationships with the reporting company.'
The report recommends that 'all companies should be required by law to
include a statement in their annual report of directors' responsibilities in
relation to the financial statements' and that audit committees should be
established by reporting companies to ensure that their financial statements
'fully comply with company law, accounting standards and best practice, that
they make adequate disclosure, that they are comprehensible and consistent
and comparable with previous statements and disclosures'.
The IACI recommends that a Financial Reporting Review Panel should be
established 'as a body responsible for examining material departures from
accounting standards'.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday vowed to speed up privatisation and smash
monopolies in the face of what he called 'sabotage' by powerful forces,
including former communist officials.
Defending his cabinet of economic reformers, he also dismissed attacks,
including a resignation call by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Russian
parliament's ambitious chairman, as 'unacceptable' attempts to reap
'political dividends' from present difficulties.
'The market is being set up in difficult conditions - economic crisis,
collapse of the union. . . . the resistance of mafia structures striving to
retain dominance in distribution, open sabotage by the former party
nomenklatura,' he told parliament.
Warning that the reforms were not yet irreversible, he urged deputies to
show 'real support, mutual trust and joint action'. He said, for instance,
that in an attempt to bring down prices, he would cut the profit margins
allowed producers to half of their costs.
Just back from a national tour, Mr Yeltsin said lower-level authorities had
failed to pay salary increases for state employees and subsidies for the
poor in many parts of the country - fuelling discontent.
Mr Yeltsin said special committees were being set up in 40 regions to
oversee the implementation of reforms. In another measure likely to prove
popular, he announced that Communist party money frozen in Russian bank
accounts would be used to finance social welfare for those hit hardest by
price reforms.
In the parliament yesterday Mr Khasbulatov sneered as Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
deputy prime minister responsible for economic reforms, spoke. But his
deputy, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, said that parliamentary and government leaders
had met the previous day to narrow their differences.
He described legislation to put trade on a market footing as excessively
bureaucratic, but Mr Gaidar countered that it had produced results. Out of
70,000 state shops in Russia, said Mr Gaidar, 20,000 had already opted for
'commercialisation' - the right to act as independent legal entities,
concluding their own contracts and holding their own bank accounts. He also
said that a budget for 1992 had been submitted to parliament for approval.

'I AM not sure what passport I will carry or what country I live in,' said
Jovana, a student at Belgrade University, the day after the European
Community recognised Croatia and Slovenia.
In spite of Serbia's propaganda that Yugoslavia still exists, many Serbs
yesterday expressed a mixture of sadness, confusion and relief at the formal
break-up of the Yugoslav federation.
Mr Petar Lukovic, a journalist at Vreme, a liberal news weekly, said:
'Yugoslavia actually ceased to exist some time ago. It is not the same
country if I cannot call my friends in Zagreb and Ljubljana. It takes 24
hours to reach Zagreb from Belgrade, because you have to go via Budapest.
But no one should be surprised. It's not as if people were asleep and
suddenly awoke to discover that Yugoslavia no longer exists.'
Mr Dusan Simic, a Belgrade journalist, said: 'We have lost the most
beautiful parts of the country. What remains is the rump.'
Mr Srdjan Saper, a film maker, commented: 'The break-up is painful. It
represents the victory of provincialism over something that was a fairy
tale,' referring to the multinational country of 24m people. He added: 'But
at the same time now there is the chance to create something new which has
all possibilities.'
Mr Budimir Loncar, the former federal foreign minister, said: 'The most
tragic events are in the past. Sooner or later there will be six independent
republics and we can set up finding some sort of common existence.'
The international recognition of Croatian and Slovene independence appears
to offer the chance for the war to end, and the possibility that people will
reject the policies of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, which
forced the break-up of Yugoslavia. But public opposition in Serbia to the
war is mostly confined to a minority in Belgrade, where it is still possible
to summon a crowd for a nationalist rally.
'Milosevic many times rejected the chance for a confederation with Croatia
and Slovenia, a community with loose economic and political ties, but now we
have lost that chance,' said Mr Lukovic.
He added: 'People will only rise up against Milosevic when instead of the
idea of a Greater Serbia or a smaller Yugoslavia, they ask not where they
live but how.'
Mr Milosevic has excelled in deflecting criticism and controlling Serbia's
political agenda.
'Serbia broke up this country. Milosevic lost the war, and people are living
worse than ever before,' said a Belgrade lawyer, who asked not to be
identified.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG-RUNNING scandal over corrupt fund-raising by political parties has
resurfaced in France, following a police raid on the Paris headquarters of
the governing Socialist party.
The investigation, ordered by Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, an examining judge,
has not yet led to any charges, but it is an embarrassment for the
Socialists in the run-up to the regional elections in March.
Police have been investigating allegations of local authority corruption,
involving thousands of elected politicians of all parties, for the past
three years.
It has been claimed in court that building companies paid phoney consultancy
firms owned by party supporters, in exchange for the use of political
influence to obtain contracts.
Parliament voted an amnesty for wrongdoers two years ago, but this is
supposed to cover officials and not MPs.
Socialist officials say they have nothing to hide, but have condemned the
latest inquiry as 'partisan', pointing to the coincidence that it took place
only hours after a ceremony in the same building at which Mr Pierre Mauroy
handed over of the job of party first secretary to Mr Laurent Fabius, a
former prime minister.
The inquiry centred on the office of the party treasurer, Mr Henri
Emmanuelli, ironically focusing party support on the formerly unpopular
selection of Mr Emmanuelli to succeed Mr Fabius as leader of the national
assembly.
Opposition parties have reacted with restraint to the inquiry, conscious of
the fact that the spotlight could also fall on them.
Mr Francois Bayrou, general secretary of the centre-right UDF, said: 'There
is no political commentary to make . . . . when a judge does his work in a
dispassionate manner.'

the 1920s.
Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Peter Lorre, Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Joseph
von Sternberg and Robert Siodmak were only a few of the stars and directors
who worked for Universum-Film at one of Europe's largest film production
sites.
Today the dingy studio buildings resembling obsolescent east German factory
halls are virtually empty. Tours of the film site are offered in an attempt
to emulate those at Universal Studios in Hollywood. But visitors to
Babelsberg, after paying DM11 (Pounds 3.80), find themselves being
shepherded through the bleak studios by dejected former employees of
Deutsche-Film (DEFA), the East German successor to Universum-Film.
They explain that their guide jobs are part of a public work-creation
programme and speak wistfully of the glorious film-making past in
Babelsberg.
But, if the Treuhand privatisation agency has its way, the Babelsberg site
will be resurrected as an ultra-modern media and entertainment centre
serving Berlin, the resurgent German capital across the Havel river.
The agency wants to see film and television production in Babelsberg along
with other media. The Treuhand, which is investing DM5m this year to
modernise DEFA's infrastructure, has agreed to let Brandenburg Radio begin
operating on part of the site and wants the highly-regarded Film Academy,
located in several nearby villas, to move there.
It has set a date of February 28, by which time bidders must present their
concepts for using the site. Two large European groups with extensive media
activities are among those who have already shown strong interest.
Bertelsmann, the giant German media group with large US investments, and
Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), the French conglomerate which is an
important film producer, are battling to become the main investors at
Babelsberg.
Claims and counter-claims have been leaked to the German media and one
exasperated Treuhand official said Paris was exerting considerable political
pressure on Bonn to get the Treuhand to decide in favour of CGE.
'The competition is so intense that I would not be surprised if my telephone
is being tapped,' he remarked.
Mr Herbert Kuppers, CGE's director in Germany, stressed last month that it
wanted to take over the entire DEFA, including the 432,000 square metre site
and buildings. It was prepared to invest up to DM150m in the near future and
'billions' later on.
The company set a deadline of last December 31 for its bid but still remains
in the running, according to the Treuhand. Neither the agency nor the state
of Brandenburg, in which Babelsberg is located, wants a takeover of the
entire site by one investor, which explains an apparent delay in reaching a
decision. Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, a spokesman for the agency, said it planned
to reach a decision by next May and would not be 'put under pressure' by
bidders.
Bertelsmann, which is based in Gutersloh, has kept its cards closer to its
chest but has the decided advantage of already owning the Universum-Film Ufa
title and the rights to its films.

THE Portuguese presidency of the European Community said yesterday that
recognition of remaining Yugoslav republics seeking independence was for
individual EC states to decide.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign minister, said 'recognition is
a question of national sovereignty' for individual EC states. 'There is
nothing in the Treaty of Rome or the Maastricht treaty which obliges us to
move together. We will try, but there are no guarantees (of success),' he
said.
Portugal has thus signalled it does not intend to spend much of its EC
presidency over the first half of this year in an attempt to maintain
diplomatic unity on the Yugoslav crisis, as happened to the previous Dutch
presidency. None the less, Mr Pinheiro predicted that there would be no
immediate rush by the majority of EC states to recognise Macedonia against
the wishes of Greece.
Though the EC-commissioned Badinter report has cleared Macedonia for
recognition, Athens is unhappy that the name of the putative state implied a
claim on the loyalties of Greek Macedonians.
'Where the interests of one member state are at stake, we must make an
effort and try not to reach a solution unacceptable to it,' said Mr
Pinheiro.
In Belgrade, Serbian leaders yesterday said the newly-recognised Croatia
would have to cede its territory controlled by Serbs after the EC decision
to recognise Croatia and Slovenia, though President Franjo Tudjman of
Croatia has vowed to regain all of the republic's lost territory.
Mr Borisav Jovic, a member of the rump federal state presidency, said:
'Croatia can be recognised only within the borders where it actually has
authority,' reported Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency.
The Serb-dominated federal army and Serb militias control about a third of
Croatia's territory.
'In the present situation, the arrival of peace-keeping forces on the
territory of Krajina (southern Croatia) is of great importance.' The very
presence of UN forces limited Croatian sovereignty in those areas,
regardless of recognition of Croatia, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TOP official of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) has
resigned after being linked to a Washington court case, Reuter reports from
Geneva.
Iata said Dr Edward Spry had submitted his resignation as managing director
of the organisation - which with 204 members groups almost all the world's
airlines - on Monday after only three months in the post.
'We have learnt of the involvement of this official of Iata in a court case
in Washington DC and we are investigating,' the spokesman, Mr John Brindley,
said. 'Dr Spry has resigned from his position.' Dr Spry, a Briton who had
worked for Iata for nearly 20 years, could not immediately be contacted for
comment.
An economist, he took up the post in November following his appointment last
May on the retirement - after eight years - of his predecessor, Mr Neil
Gleeson.
As managing director, he was number two in the Geneva-based organisation and
was responsible for its day-to-day internal administration, reporting to Mr
Gunter Eser, director-general.
The Washington court case was a civil suit brought by Airline Economics, an
aviation consulting firm, against its former president, Mr Harold Pareti,
alleging misappropriation of funds and other acts.
A report in the Washington-based Travel Weekly on January 6 quoted papers
filed in the US district court by Mr Pareti as denying the allegations and
accusing the firm's principals of lying to him about its finances.
The weekly also said Mr Pareti accused them of paying what he called
unlawful kickbacks.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Dispelling German scent of scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is one word which is not mentioned in yesterday's long and carefully
argued paper from the German finance minister on financial market reform:
that word is scandal.
And yet scandal is the word that has been the word on every Frankfurt
financier's lips in the last year, and there is no doubt that it is scandal
that has driven the Finance Ministry to launch yesterday's comprehensive
package of reforms.
For 1991 was a year when the Frankfurt tax authorities launched
investigations into the private tax affairs of 400 traders at prominent
brokers and banks, amid widespread allegations of longstanding tax evasion.
It was also the year when the Frankfurt Stock Exchange undertook an
investigation into alleged insider dealing at the mighty Deutsche Bank, and
when the Economics Ministry of the state of Hesse - in which Frankfurt is
located - unleashed a probe into local brokers and a market practice known
as 'dividend stripping'.
Senior German financiers never use the word scandal to describe any of these
individual cases without prefacing it with the phrase 'so-called'. They are
able to find good reasons why each case was not really scandalous. The tax
problems of traders reflect the problems of private individuals, they argue.
They note that all those scrutinised for alleged insider dealing were
exonerated.
Yet, they tacitly admit that the collective impact of this unfortunate
sequence of events is bad for the image of Germany and bad for the German
financial services business. Behind the scenes, senior bankers, market
officials and representatives of regional and central government have been
meeting regularly to decide what they ought to do to counter the damage. The
result is yesterday's announcement from Bonn.
The central proposals, floated individually before but bound together for
the first time in yesterday's document from the Finance Ministry, are as
follows:
There should be a central authority for stock-market regulation, 'as is
usual in the most important financial markets and already exists in banking
and insurance'. There are few details about the scope of the new body's
authority, but it will be responsible for policing insider trading and
liaising with international stock-market authorities over issues such as
regulation.
A new insider law will be introduced. This is necessary, the minister says,
because the present system is limited by the fact that it relies on the
voluntary co-operation of market participants and lacks tough sanctions.
There will be legal sanctions against insider offences with the possibility
of confiscating any financial gains. Legal, investigatory and other powers
will be vested in the new regulatory body.
It is intended that these measures will be implemented in law by the end of
1992, giving plenty of time for all parties involved to agree detailed plans
for implementation.
As the minister says, it is hoped that these and other measures will make
Germany's financial services industry fitter. What he does not say is that
it is hoped it will make Germany scandal-free.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Brussels gives ground over waste plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has dropped key provisions of a plan to reduce the
amount of discarded packaging dumped on Community rubbish tips following
intense pressure from industry and trade, Reuter reports from Brussels.
It latest draft proposals, as yet unofficial and subject to change, aim to
bring into line differing national schemes for combating mountains of
discarded packaging, from wooden crates to toothpaste tubes.
But industry officials expressed disappointment yesterday that the proposals
were unlikely to force Germany to ease important parts of its controversial
packaging recycling law. This has imposed tough obligations on industry and
trade to take back and recycle used packaging.
There have been several formal complaints to Brussels alleging it breaches
the EC's free trade rules.
The paper abandons the idea, which industry had hated, of freezing
per-capita output of packaging waste at 1990 levels.
Governments and industry would have to ensure that within 10 years at least
90 per cent of all used packaging was 'recovered' - reused, recycled into
new products, burned to produce energy or turned into compost. At least 60
per cent would have to be reused or recycled within the same time.
Earlier plans for achieving a 60 per cent recovery rate and 40 per cent
recycling within five years no longer figure in the text, giving member
states greater flexibility.
Also gone are controversial proposals for an EC-wide charge on packaging to
fund national waste management schemes. Member states are left instead to
decide on such measures themselves.

FT  17 JAN 92 / (CORRECTED) Childcare: The double bind for working parents -
The childcare dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 22nd January 1992) appended to this article.
Childcare in Britain is both more expensive and less widely available than
in any other European country. Many people in Britain are frustrated by
their inability to afford convenient and high quality childcare. Little
wonder that, with an election pending, childcare provision is rising towards
the top of the political agenda.
But is this lack of affordable, quality childcare a matter of concern for
public policy? Those concerned solely with economic efficiency, remain
sceptical: childcare, they argue, is expensive, so no one should be
surprised that most people cannot find quality care that is affordable and
accessible. The pro-childcare lobby is, in reality, a vociferous,
special-interest group, comprising well-paid and skilled working women, who
want the state to subsidise them to employ lower-paid child-minders.
Yet there is more at stake than economic efficiency; and can these
economists be sure that there is no economic case for government
intervention? Perhaps by disregarding the actual and potential skills of
married women, the UK is wasting an important economic resource.
The state could try to improve the skills and therefore the earning
potential of women with children, by subsidising childcare. This would
increase the incentive for employers to invest in the skills of their women
workers. A more direct way would be for the government to subsidise their
training.
But the notion that state childcare should be used to encourage women back
to work to offset an impending 'labour shortage' is absurd. Declining entry
of young people into the labour market will not cause a shortage or workers,
any more than the rise in female participation caused a glut in the 1980s.
Instead, the rise in the demand for women's labour will raise the relative
real wages of employed women. Conversely, subsidising women who enter the
labour force will depress wages for unskilled workers.
This failure to understand the wage effects of changes in labour
participation leads to wild claims about the savings from increased state
childcare provision, as a recent study from the Institute for Public Policy
Research demonstrates. The report describes three increasingly ambitious
ways to improve childcare in Britain towards European levels, which would
cost between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 11bn a year, equivalent to an extra 2p-5p
on the basic income tax rate.
The report argues that the extra tax revenue generated by an estimated
33-150 per cent rise in female employment would more than pay for the
scheme. This startling conclusion rests on the unrealistic assumption that
this large influx of largely unskilled labour will neither reduce the wages
of, or taxes paid by, unskilled women or men.
Yet non-economic arguments may justify a greater role for government in the
care of pre-school children if the electorate is willing, as in other
European countries, to pay higher taxes to cover the costs.
Subsidising children:
Why should individuals bear the main cost of raising their children? Society
has an interest in children, too, and should contribute to the cost of their
upbringing. If society wants generous maternity leave, maternity pay and
childcare, to encourage people to have children, it should share the cost.
Level playing field:
The UK tax system discriminates against two-parent households in which both
work by requiring them to pay for childcare out of their net income.
Families in which one parent does not work pay no tax on the effective
income they derive from parent-provided childcare. Tax relief for childcare
expenses would offset this distortion. In the UK it applies only to
employer-subsidised workplace nurseries.
Equity and redistribution:
Extending tax relief to all forms of childcare would make what is a highly
regressive tax break even more unfair. Tax relief for childcare
disproportionately transfers income to above-average wage-earners, with the
largest benefits going to top-rate taxpayers. If the government has
redistributive goals in mind, it should target support on low-income and
single-parent households. Income-related childcare vouchers or a childcare
tax credit would make it easier for low-income families to work. But
relieving poverty, especially among single-parent families, might be better
achieved by improving financial support to parents on low incomes, whether
or not they want to work.
Education:
There may be a separate social or educational case for providing nursery
education for 3-4-year-old schoolchildren. In the UK, only 35-40 per cent of
children in this age-group are in publicly funded nursery education or
childcare, compared with 65-70 per cent in Germany and 95 per cent in
France.
Gender equality:
The state could also decide to subsidise skilled women to remain in work
through their child-bearing years as one way of raising the economic status
of women to an equal footing with men, both within the workplace and within
the household. Women do not, in practice, have the same career-chances as
men. The cost of having children is usually borne at the expense of the
woman's career and wages, regardless of whether this makes economic sense
for the family; at the same time, women with children may be passed over for
promotion.
Subsidising childcare is one way of enabling more women to challenge
society's deep-seated assumptions about their career prospects. This social
argument for subsidising childcare, in a way which would inevitably favour
skilled women, could be economically costly and would be distributionally
regressive. Whether there is a compelling public interest argument for doing
so is not a question economics can answer.
This is the second article in a series on childcare.
CORRECTION (PUBLISHED 22ND JANUARY 1992).
The article should have read: 'The report argues that the extra tax
revenue, generated in part by an estimated 33-150 per cent rise in
full-time equivalent employment of women with children under five, would
more than pay for the scheme.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the engineering group with interests in the power, automotive
and building products sectors, has made two acquisitions for a total
consideration of up to pounds 4.98m.
For an initial pounds 2.75m, it is buying Paralloy, a specialist producer of
horizontal centrifugally-spun high alloy tubing, fabricated assemblies and
static cast fittings, mostly for the petrochemical industry. Further
consideration of pounds 750,000 will become due if profits for the year to
March 31 1992 exceed pounds 672,000.
The initial payment will be financed via the issue of some pounds 1.96m new
ordinary shares placed with institutional investors at 140p apiece.
Paralloy's net assets are expected to be pounds 2.2m on completion,
including assumption of its pounds 3m overdraft.
The other company acquired is Precision Castparts - to be renamed Centaur
Precision - which is a specialist investment casting producer of vacuum and
air cast components for the aerospace, impeller and medical markets. The
pounds 1.48m purchase price is to be financed out of Triplex's own
resources.

Zetters Group reported a 21 per cent expansion in pre-tax profits for the
six months to September 30 1991.
The increase - from pounds 372,111 to pounds 451,010 - was achieved in spite
of a fall in turnover from pounds 11.4m to pounds 11m.
The pools operation maintained turnover, directors said, with tight control
over operating costs helping to lift profits.
In contrast, turnover in the competitions and marketing side dived from
pounds 680,051 to pounds 231,655 reflecting the end of the News
International Lotto competition which ceased in June of last year.
Nevertheless, profitability of the Spotting the Ball competition was being
maintained.
Earnings per share were at 4.1p (3.4p), and, in a move to reduce disparity,
the interim dividend is lifted to 4p (1.75p).

Supplies and Telewig (UK). In the year to March 1991 Tyne Tees made profits,
before non-recurring items and tax, of pounds 180,000. Net assets were then
pounds 142,000.
Ingram, an electronic components manufacturer based in Airdrie, Scotland,
made pounds 107,000 pre-tax in the year to March 31 and had net assets of
about pounds 192,000.
Turnover at Beales Hunter amounted to pounds 20.8m (pounds 19.1m) in the
half-year to end November, with operating profits up at pounds 1.39m (pounds
1.29m). However, after the issue of almost 1m new shares in February's open
offer, earnings slipped to 12.4p (13.2p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN WOOD Group, the Aberdeen-based oilfield services company which is one
of Scotland's largest privately-owned concerns, is broadening its
shareholder base by placing pounds 8.3m worth of convertible preference
shares with 13 institutions, most of them Scottish.
No cash is being raised for the company but the new shares will, on
conversion, account for 8.7 per cent of John Wood's equity. The proportion
of the company held by institutions will rise from 9.3 to 18 per cent, and
the stake held by the Wood family will fall to 73 per cent and that of
management and staff to 9 per cent.
Mr Ian Wood, chairman, said that the move was part of the evolution of John
Wood away from being a family concern.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Falling house prices curb Israeli inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI inflation totalled 18 per cent in 1991, less than had been feared
and only slightly up on 17.6 per cent in 1990.
The biggest single factor was the surge in housing costs, which rose 28 per
cent overall as fears of an immigration-induced housing shortage drove up
prices and rents.
But Russian immigrants' reluctance to take on high levels of debt to
purchase property, and rising availability of new stock arising from a
construction boom, abruptly reversed the trend in the last quarter, when
house prices fell 4 per cent.
As a result inflation quickly fell back from annual rates approaching 25 per
cent, a level which threatened government efforts to maintain economic
stability in the face af large-scale immigration. Prices in the last quarter
rose less than 1 per cent, against 6 per cent in the third quarter.
Officials are forecasting a further modest cooling in inflation this year.
But the relatively good news on prices also contains some bad news:
construction was the main engine of growth last year and this has flattened
as the building boom has tailed off. There are fears that unemployment,
already at record levels of close to 11 per cent, will go on rising as more
immigrants enter the job market.

<TEXT>
ALCOA, the world's largest producer of aluminium, suffered a sharp fall in
fourth-quarter earnings as a result of heavy charges, amounting to Dollars
217m, relating to environmental clean-ups and restructuring costs.
Before the charges, fourth-quarter earnings were Dollars 25.6m, or 30 cents
a share, compared with Dollars 134.6m, or Dollars 1.58, for the 1990
quarter.
After the charges, Alcoa posted a loss of Dollars 191.4m, or Dollars 2.26,
in the final quarter of 1991, against a loss of Dollars 140.4m, or Dollars
1.61, for the year-ago period.
The company had warned it would take the charges earlier this month.
They are primarily related to cleaning up several operating plants around
the globe, though the costliest is for its smelting and fabricating plant in
Massena, New York.
With prices having dropped for virtually all aluminium products last year,
the company reported that before the charges, its 1991 net income was
Dollars 279.7m, or Dollars 3.27 a share, compared with Dollars 570.2m, or
Dollars 6.59, in 1990.
Once the charges were taken, the 1991 net income shrank to Dollars 62.7m, or
71 cents, compared with Dollars 295.2m, or Dollars 3.40, in 1990.
For the fourth quarter, Alcoa's revenues were Dollars 2.4bn, down from 2.7bn
in the year-ago period, while revenues for all of 1991 slipped to Dollars
10bn, down from Dollars 10.9bn in 1990.
Shipments increased last year to 2.8m metric tons from 2.7m 1n 1990.

Kuwait and Saudi Arabia each have a 10 per cent stake in the Arabian Oil

barrels per day.
'Japan expressed its desire to increase production from these fields
 .Kuwait welcomed this offer,' Mr Raqba said. 'Kuwait expressed its desire
to invest in Japan, especially in refining, storage and marketing. Japan has
oil investment in Kuwait ..so why shouldn't Kuwait have in return an

Mr Raqba said he had proposed setting up a joint economic commission to
boost co-operation in joint ventures and transfer of technology between the
two countries.
Both Japan and Kuwait wanted to speed up signing of a mutual tax exemption
treaty, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUXEMBOURG bankers have breached the Grand Duchy's strict banking secrecy
legislation to avoid infringing laws aimed at preventing the laundering of
drug profits, according to the defendant in a money-laundering trial.
Lawyers believe the allegations by Mr Franklin Jurado, a Colombian accused
of recycling cocaine proceeds on behalf of the Cali drug cartel, could
undermine Luxembourg's hard-won reputation as a centre for private banking.
That reputation, partly founded on the country's tradition of banking
secrecy, was shaken last year when the Luxembourg-registered Bank of Credit
and Commerce Internation al (BCCI) collapsed following the discovery of
massive fraud.
Mr Jurado claims a number of Luxembourg banks contacted investigators to
voice their suspicions about his transactions. He has lodged a complaint
because under Luxembourg law banking secrecy can be lifted only once an
investigation has begun.
In the course of Mr Jurado's trial, an official of Credit Lyonnais, the
French bank, has admitted that he and members of the bank's audit department
met Luxembourg authorities in December 1989 to discuss their client's
activities. Mr Pierre Kohnen, the investigating officer, told the court that
'between seven and nine' Luxembourg banks volunteered information on Mr
Jurado's transactions, and said bankers often contacted detectives about
suspicious funds or transactions.
The allegations may arise partly from confusion about Luxembourg bankers'
legal rights and obligations. Legislation was introduced in July 1989 which
obliges banks to refuse suspect business.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Renault defends alliance with Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT'S chairman, Mr Raymond Levy, yesterday defended the state-owned
car-maker's two-year-old alliance with Volvo in response to anxiety voiced
by the French government.
'The accord must be allowed to live', said Mr Levy, replying to a press
interview by Mr Abel Farnoux, special adviser to Mrs Edith Cresson, the
prime minister, claiming that the alliance was 'damaging to Renault, because
it is unbalanced'.
Under the alliance Volvo has a 20 per cent stake in Renault, which in turn
has taken 10 per cent of the Swedish group. Their subsidiaries have also
exchanged minority stakes.
The two factors behind the government's anxieties are the losses of Volvo's
car division  - the equivalent of FFr1.5bn (Pounds 150m) in the first nine
months of last year  - and the Swedish company's growing links with
Mitsubishi, with which it has agreed to begin joint car production in the
Netherlands.
Volvo has emphatically denied French press suggestions that it is
negotiating to sell a minority stake to Mitsubishi. However, it has
repeatedly reminded the French government that, as a minority shareholder,
it expects to be consulted on the choice of successor to Mr Levy, who is due
to retire in the summer.
The French government is unlikely to demand a big change in the
Renault-Volvo alliance. In fact, the partners are planning to strengthen
their links and have ruled nothing out, including even a possible merger.
However, the debate is exposing the disarray in several areas of French
industrial policy. The government is divided, for example, over whether to
choose IBM or Hewlett Packard as a partner for Bull, the state-owned
computer-maker, as it is over the detailed terms for a wholesale
reorganisation of the electronics and nuclear industries.

LABOUR ministers from the industrialised countries have agreed on the need
for concerted medium and long-term measures to combat high unemployment,
starting with steps to improve the efficiency of labour markets.
The ministers, meeting at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, endorsed a three-part programme of action, in
which improved labour markets were coupled with the provision of skills for
the future and the improvement of coherence between different aspects of
economic and social policies.
There was broad agreement by the ministers that 'positive incentives to
participate in employment should be provided through appropriate gradual
adjustment of income support measures'.
They also recommended 'more effective and comprehensive training and
re-employment programmes for the unemployed and those on welfare and social
assistance, while assuring necessary support mechanisms, thereby breaking
dependency cycles'.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Italy and Germany lead the volume
declines in 1991 - Review of last year's European trading, which petered out
after an exciting first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Convergence may be a pattern to look forward to on European bourses,
according to some theorists, but the main similarity in their trading
statistics in 1990 and 1991 was that each year enjoy-ed an exciting first
six months, followed by an increasingly morose second half.
History can be blamed for that. The year before last started in a fever of
excitement over German reunification, and palled in a nervous autumn after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Last year built up rapidly from the outbreak
of the Gulf war on January 17 and fell away later, dramatically in some
cases, as the growth rate in Germany began to slow down and recessionary
clouds started to gather elsewhere.
Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, which produces the figures, has provided
monthly averages for 1990 and 1991 which show severe falls in trading levels
in Germany, Italy and Switzerland; marginal declines in three more, Belgium,
France and the Netherlands; and useful gains for Spain and the UK.
Germany dropped 22.5 per cent to a 1991 monthly average of DM104.8bn,
falling from a high in July and, more worryingly, by nearly 28 per cent to
DM66bn in December, its lowest since March 1989.
Part of December's problem, says Mr Cornish, was an exaggerated Christmas
effect, traders and investors using the approaching holiday as an excuse to
do nothing while the domestic economy suffered in the aftermath of the
reunification boom, wage demands mounted and the Bundesbank eventually
bumped up interest rates on December 19.
While German share prices rose in late-December, lifted by the
record-breaking climb on Wall Street, the real recovery in volume was
delayed until this week as strategists decided that wage rises were going to
be constrained in 1992 and that European interest rates, as a result, were
likely to ease this summer.
Italy was even more severely depressed last year, the monthly average
dropping by 37 per cent year to year, and running latterly at less than
one-tenth of the daily peaks of L700bn to L800bn which it reached in 1986.
The Milan equity market has had little to cling to in the face of sick
national and corporate economies, the latter reflecting poor to
near-disastrous performances by Italy's big industrial blue chips such as
Fiat, Pirelli and Olivetti. The succession of stockbroker bankruptcies,
which disrupted the running of the equity market, were an almost continuous
drain on sentiment.
Switzerland's monthly average fell by 18.6 per cent to SFr11.3bn. Here, says
Mr Cornish, the economy was a mix of high inflation and almost nil growth
with very low unemployment, making it hard for the national government to
take any initiative but to defend the Swiss franc by keeping interest rates
high.
In the middle, France recovered in rising volume towards the end of
December. For a long time, people have been saying that it is a cheap
market, looking at domestic political worries but also at a prospective 12
per cent earnings per share growth this year. Mr Cornish thinks it 'the most
attractive market in Europe'.
As for the two 1991 winners, the UK, for a lot of the year, reflected the
belief in an 'Anglo' economic recovery, the theory which expected both the
US and UK economies to pick up. In that context, British equities attracted
both domestic and quite a lot of international investment; the market was on
a 5 per cent dividend yield and this, historically, seems to have been a
good anchor for equity levels.
Spain, in December, repeated what it did in 1990. Fund managers seemed to be
buying blue chips to dress up their portfolios for the year-end; however, it
did appear that there was a genuine surge of investment interest in Madrid
in the second half of December, as ordinary investors came bargain hunting
after a steep fall in share prices, in low volume, early in the month.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Turkey struggles to control Kurdish genie: New premier
Suleyman Demirel will need steady nerves in dealing with Ankara's rebellious
minority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHO are these Kurds? Why are they rebellious? What do they want?' These
were the questions asked by US historian William Westermann, in the
periodical Foreign Affairs, in July 1946. In today's Turkey the debate has
moved on, but Mr Suleyman Demirel, now in his seventh spell as prime
minister, still must seek a solution to bring peace to the country's Kurdish
region.
It will require a steady nerve to keep Kurdish reform at the centre of his
political programme. It will be particularly difficult to convince some
hard-line colleagues in Ankara of the need for magnanimity. But no one
doubts the urgency of the situation.
The habits of violence are deeply rooted in Turkey's impoverished south-east
provinces. More than 3,000 people have died in the seven-year conflict
between the security forces and the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), which is
fighting for a separate state. The military is conducting air and ground
operations against rebel positions in the Cudi mountains near the Iraq
border. No casualties have been given.
In separate clashes yesterday eight people died - six of them guerrillas,
the others a policeman and a soldier.
Turkey is committed, at least legally, to some form of democratic reform as
a signatory to the 1990 Paris Charter, which emerged from follow-up talks
within the context of the Helsinki accord on human rights. A key part of the
charter relates to the treatment of national minorities.
The problem has also acquired an added international dimension following the
Gulf war and the allied relief effort to help the Iraqi Kurds. Attention has
inevitably focused on the shortcomings of Turkey's treatment of its own 10m
Kurds. As one Turkish official put it at the time: 'The Kurdish genie is out
of the bottle.'
Mr Demirel is a stubborn politician and his path, will be strewn with
hazards. But he may have a personal motive to push for reform; certainly
there is little domestic electoral mileage in the issue. Having been twice
ousted by the military, he may feel he has something to prove to secure his
place in history. At 68, he will probably never get another chance.
His foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, is of Kurdish origin. So is Mr Mehmet
Kahraman, who heads the newly established Ministry for Human Rights.
Indeed, the government - a coalition between Mr Demirel's True Path Party
and the Social Democrats (SHP) - may come to find human-rights reform the
easiest policy to implement, given mounting difficulties with the economy.
Perhaps more significant, for the first time, the Turkish parliament can
provide a forum for extreme Kurdish opinion, after the election of 22
radical deputies on the SHP ticket.
Mr Demirel is aware of the danger of pressing ahead without broad party
support: his argument is that it is in the interests of all Turks to support
civil reforms, rolling back the authoritarian constitution inherited
following the military coup of 1980. He says that Kurdish reform is
inseparable from broad democratic reform.
Nevertheless, there will be fireworks in parliament. An unholy alliance
opposed to reform has already emerged between conservative and left-wing
nationalists.
On the other hand, Mr Demirel's programme will almost certainly fall short
of the demands of Kurdish intellectuals. Even official support for the study
of the language - one of the proposals of the Paris accords - remains
controversial. As for devolving administrative powers to the Kurds, which
some diplomats now believe is the only way to save the situation, this is
not even being discussed.
What Mr Demirel does offer is legal and institutional change, to stamp out
torture, cut detention periods where most police abuse occurs, and
discipline the security forces, particularly the hated special forces whose
job it is to take the fight to the PKK, but who have too often used this
mandate to terrorise local people.
The prime minister must have been greatly heartened at the warm reception
when he visited the provincial capital Diyarbakir last month, where he
publicly acknowledged what he called the 'Kurdish reality.'
His immediate task is to keep the coalition together. His SHP partner
already faces an awkward party congress this month, and the party's leader,
Mr Erdal Inonu, will have to contend with outright rebellion from radical
Kurdish deputies.
Short-term, the crisis can only deepen if the security situation
deteriorates when guerrillas, as is probable, greet any reforms with further
violence in a bid to provoke reprisals. But one thing is certain. The longer
Mr Demirel waits to implement real change, the more intractable Turkey's
Kurdish problem will become.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Verdict in Papandreou corruption case today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andreas Papandreou, the former socialist prime minister accused of
corruption, will not be in court today when a 13-member tribunal delivers a
verdict in what the Greeks call 'the mother of trials.'
Like the rest of the nation, Mr Papandreou will watch the proceedings live
on television. However, his main co-defendant, Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, the
former finance minister, has threatened to barricade himself inside
parliament and put up violent resistance if convicted.
According to legal analysts, there is little likelihood of Mr Papandreou
being found guilty of taking a bribe and receiving the proceeds of a crime.
The bribery charge collapsed early in the 10-month-long hearing when it was
revealed that a bank foreign exchange transfer of DM250,000 (Pounds 88,000),
allegedly used by Mr Papandreou to cover expenses arising from his
open-heart surgery in London in 1988, had no connection with the socialist
leader.
The second charge, that Mr Papandreou funded his Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (Pasok) with some of the Dollars 200m embezzled from the Bank of
Crete by its owner, Mr George Koskotas, was based on a document rejected as
a forgery by a team of graphologists.
However, a breach of faith charge against Mr Papandreou, holding him
responsible for the scandalous state of public finances during his
government's final days, could be upheld. Nobody in Greek political life
expects the 72-year-old ex-prime minister, whose health is frail, to be
jailed. But even a suspended sentence could revive the bitter political
divisions of the 1980s.
Mr Akis Tsochatzopoulos, Pasok's secretary general, yesterday ruled out the
possibility of violent political confrontation if the decision goes against
Mr Papandreou. He said: 'Pasok will voice its reaction in parliament and in
society in a constitutional way.'
Some prominent conservatives now admit the rush to prosecute Mr Papandreou
and three socialist former cabinet ministers was over-hasty. 'After eight
years of high-handed socialist rule, the conservative grass-roots were
baying for revenge,' said one.
Mr Papandreou's political future may be decided today. If convicted on
charges he steadfastly denies, Pasok supporters will forget their criticism
of his autocratic style of leadership and rally behind him. An acquittal,
even for lack of evidence, would close a chapter of Greek political life,
allowing a succession battle in Pasok to begin in earnest.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Gibraltar to re-elect nationalist leader

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GIBRALTAR'S 14,000 voters are today expected to overwhelmingly re-elect as
chief minister Mr Joe Bossano, the nationalist politician who has
steadfastly boycotted negotiations between Madrid and London over the future
of Britain's disputed crown colony.
Opinion polls indicate that Mr Bossano's Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party
(GSLP) could win more than 70 per cent of the votes, up from 58 per cent in
1988. The GSLP is certain to retain its eight seats in the 15-member House
of Assembly, the maximum allowed under Gibraltar's electoral rules.
Mr Bossano's popularity reflects both the marked improvement in Gibraltar's
infrastructure, particularly in housing and essential public services,
during his four year term and his uncompromising opposition to any deal with
Spain that would threaten Gibraltar's constitutional arrangements.
Mr Bossano blocked a 1987 agreement between Spain and the UK on the dual use
of Gibraltar's airport, a move that subsequently excluded Gibraltar from the
EC's air liberalisation process. Mr Bossano has also refused to attend
bilateral talks between Spain and Britain.
His stand has tested the patience of London and Madrid and has delayed
agreement on the EC's External Frontiers Convention, which governs entry
points into the Community. Spain refuses to consider Gibraltar as an EC
entry point unless there is agreement on the use of its airport and the UK
has signalled it will not ratify the convention if Gibraltar is excluded
from it.
Gibraltar has markedly reduced its dependency on the UK over the past four
years. Britain's Defence Ministry, which used to account for 45 per cent of
Gibraltar's revenues, now contributes around 15 per cent, and Gibraltar is
busy marketing itself as a financial centre.
In an ill-tempered campaign, the main opposition party, the Gibraltar Social
Democrats (GSD), accused the GSLP of a 'secretive and dictatorial' style of
government and claimed the population was 'gagged by fear of reprisal and
intimidation'. Mr Bossano in turn has accused the GSD of being 'soft on
Spain' because it is prepared to attend talks on the future of the colony.
Opinion polls suggest that the GSD, which is identified with the colony's
financial sector, looks unlikely to gain more than 25 per cent of the vote.

FT  16 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVE markets saw one of their busiest sessions in recent weeks, as
turnover in both equity futures and traded options soared to high levels,
writes Joel Kibazo.
In Footsie futures, the squeeze in the March contract, up to around 2,600
early in the session, soon gave way to heavy institutional selling as
dealers tried to avoid being left with long positions.
That selling continued for most of the day, further prompted by the poor
opening in the US bond market and on Wall Street, though March saw a modest
rally in the dying minutes of the session.
March closed at 2,579, up 18 on the previous day and around 20 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of 22. Turnover reached 9,157
contracts.
In traded options, volume swelled to 51,352 lots, well exceeding Tuesday's
29,608.
Asda, which reported big interim losses, was the busiest stock option. It
had 10,641 contracts dealt, with the April 43 calls the busiest series.
Hanson, also heavily traded in the underlying market, was the second most
active stock option with 3,558 lots transacted. This was followed by Boots
with 1,783 contracts and Scottish &amp; Newcastle with a day's total of 1,600
lots.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Appointments: Challenge for Dobson at Do It All
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steve Russell is to be the new managing director of Do It All, the
do-it-yourself company jointly owned by Boots and WH Smith.
Peter Dobson, who joined Do It All as managing director when the company was
formed in June 1990, is retiring at the age of 56 and will be succeeded by
Russell, who is currently director of merchandise at Boots the Chemist.
Dobson was not available to comment yesterday, but WH Smith says he is
retiring because he has completed his task - that of integrating the Boots
and WH Smith DIY businesses. 'He's at an age when people are beginning to
think about early retirement,' says WH Smith.
Dobson was managing director of Payless, Boots's DIY division, before it was
merged with Smith's DIY business. Although the joint venture's non-executive
chairman was to be appointed in turn from each of the parent companies,
Russell's appointment is based entirely on his qualifications, WH Smith
says.
Russell will have a formidable task in turning round Do It All; turnover
fell by 13 per cent in the six months to December 1, and the company is
having to define and establish its new concept store in a difficult UK
trading climate.

FT  16 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bear raid on Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of Lonrho fell very sharply in midsession yesterday as a number of
adverse stories circulated in the market. The shares closed 20 down at 143p
with 8m traded.
UK investment bank SG Warburg has been selling the shares steadily for some
time and continued to do so yesterday. There were lines of 1m and 1.4m
shares traded around 160p. Traders said the shares had also been hit by bear
raids. Lonrho is in its closed period ahead of the announcement of full-year
results on January 23, and therefore not permitted to comment on its
financial position. There is also a large number of shares believed to be
seeking buyers in a market where no-one appears willing to pick them up.
Speculation that Warburg had lowered its profits forecast for Lonrho was,
however, strongly denied. On Monday, County NatWest cut its dividend
prediction to 12p from 16p. The shares have further been affected recently
by 'the tycoon factor', the belief that a company run by one dominant
individual is vulnerable to unexpected developments.
Negative press comment following the resignation of executive director Mr
Terry Robinson has also upset Lonrho, which has been buffeted by very low
metal prices, still bumping along the bottom yesterday.
C and W doubts
Cable and Wireless continued to respond to stories of an imminent deal with
AT&amp;T, of the US, but closed well below the day's best after intermittent
bouts of profit-taking during another active trading session.
The shares were hoisted to an all-time peak of 632p at the outset of
trading, but quickly ran into a squall of selling, mostly inspired by BZW,
before stabilising and then moving up again to close a net 7 higher at 625p.
Turnover was a hefty 4.6m shares.
BZW responded to the strength in the C and W share price by removing the
stock from its buy list. The investment bank said a bid from AT&amp;T was
'possible but unlikely', listing many practical and financial obstacles to a
full bid. Prominent objections included AT&amp;T's 70 per cent gearing, earnings
dilution, the rarity of hostile US bids in the UK, and the 'golden share' in
C and W and C and W's overseas licences, which would require bid approval
from the relevant authorities. The broker did, however, point out the
credibility of AT&amp;T taking a substantial stake in Mercury.
Gas busy
News that British Gas had avoided a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC) by agreeing to the proposals put forward by the Office of
Fair Trading triggered a flurry of activity in British Gas shares.
The stock, depressed over recent sessions by the prospect of an MMC
referral, raced up from an initially easier 239p to 254p as the news
emerged, before slipping back and ending a busy session 3 better on the day
at 245p. Turnover in the stock reached a well-above-average 14m.
Specialists have long expressed concern at the prospect of an MMC referral,
which some said could have led to an enforced dismemberment of the company.
While some analysts said they would have preferred British Gas to have faced
up to the rigours of a full MMC inquiry - 'they are already staring at a new
pricing formula of RPI minus 5, increasing competition and a tough 1992
trading year', said one - others were relieved at the news.
Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull, long-term bulls of British Gas, said
the news was 'highly positive' for the shares. 'The progressive dividend
policy is now likely to be maintained,' added Mr Toalster. Smith New Court
also adopted a bullish view of the latest manoeuvring. Mr Steve Turner at
Smith said: 'It was always unlikely that the MMC could have offered a better
deal than the OFT; it was not a pleasant choice but really Gas had no
alternative.'
Hanson active
Acquisitive conglomerate Hanson saw very heavy turnover for the second day
running, with the shares adding 8 1/2 at 212 1/2 p by the close, one of its
biggest price moves for many months. Turnover of 16m shares was the highest
since Hanson launched its bid for Beazer in September, and the heaviest
among FT-SE 100 stocks yesterday.
Analysts said the shares were continuing to receive a strong push from the
dollar's advance as half of Hanson's turnover is achieved in the US. There
was also support from a news wire story, following a company meeting with
analysts, that Hanson is more likely to buy into continental Europe now that
rules governing hostile bids are clearer.
Fall in Guinness
Guinness was one of the weak spots in the Footsie, the shares losing 11 in a
strong market to close at 533p with 4.9m traded.
Although most analysts in the sector have the stock on their buy lists a
spate of selling was prompted by a rumour, largely discounted, that the
spirits giant was considering a bid for Pernod Ricard.
Some analysts have been adjusting profit forecasts to reflect poor general
trading conditions. Strauss Turnbull cut its 1991 estimate by Pounds 5m to
Pounds 960m and 1992's by Pounds 10m to Pounds 1.115bn but said it remained
a buyer. Strauss's figures are still around the top of the range of
analysts' estimates.
SmithKline Beecham rose sharply after its Belgian unit said it had developed
the first vaccine against Hepatitis-A, a viral disease that affects the
liver. The unit said the vaccine has still to be commercialised but hoped it
could go on sale later this year. The shares showed a gain of 33 at midday
but eased to close 18 up at 963p on turnover of 3.2m. Glaxo was volatile,
moving up 15 in early trading before slipping back on profit-taking. The
shares closed 9 down at 916p with 6.5m traded. Broker recommendations were
said to have been behind a flurry of buying in the bank stocks. NatWest
raced up 12 to 276p on heavy turnover of 5.3m, with Kleinwort Benson and
County NatWest said to have given the stock a push.
Utility shares gave a ready response to the whiff of a Conservative victory
in this year's general election. Water shares in particular, the regional
electricity stocks and the power generators all came in for strong support
after a national newspaper opinion poll indicated that the Tories had
overtaken Labour.
Water issues have come under periodic bouts of downward pressure after a
series of opinion polls showed Labour ahead of the Conservatives. The Labour
party has consistently said it would renationalise the water companies.
Labour also recently criticised the level of profitability of the
electricity companies.
An early gain in Rolls-Royce was curtailed after UBS Phillips &amp; Drew weighed
in with a harsh profits downgrading and took the stock off its buy list.
The broker now forecasts 1992 profits of Pounds 110m against its previous
estimate of Pounds 150m. Explaining the cut Mr Paul Compton said there would
be 'more redundancies in 1992 and a delay in spare parts recovery'. Having
risen 5 initially, the stock ended a penny down on the day at 138p; turnover
swelled to 11m shares.
Associated British Ports closed 4 down at 319p after the company warned that
profits for 1991 will be around half of 1990's Pounds 60m because of falling
property values.
Forte receded 7 to 230p, depressed by hints of profits downgradings. UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, Forte's broker, emphatically denied market stories that it
had lowered its estimates for Forte.

FT  16 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reduced before the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL and domestic factors turned more favourable for the UK stock
market yesterday and London followed the upward trend of other European
bourses. The 60-point jump by the Dow Industrial Average overnight, quickly
supported by a strong rise in the US dollar, drove the Footsie ahead by more
than 40 points in early trading. Later, however, UK stocks began to flag,
and when Wall Street opened the new session 13 Dow points down the early
Footsie gain was halved.
Most of the early advance reflected widespread marking up of share prices by
UK marketmakers. But other factors were also in the market's favour. The
latest UK public opinion poll indicated that the Conservative government
headed by Mr John Major was one point ahead of the Labour opposition, the
first time since last February that this poll has put the Tories ahead.
Also, Mr Major appeared to fuel speculation that the UK Budget in March may
include some tax-cutting measures.
The strength of the dollar boosted the international blue chip stocks, while
the pound's firmness against the D-Mark continued to soothe fears of a rise
in domestic interest rates. And once again, a strong premium on the March
futures contract on the FT-SE Index set the pace.
Against this background, the first half of the session was very optimistic
and some institutional buying was seen, in particular of the privatisation
stocks, which are influenced by the government's re-election prospects. The
electricity issues, regarded as threatened in the event of a Labour party
victory, responded strongly to the shift in public opinion polls.
Sellers appeared, however, when the market broke through the Footsie 2,550
mark, and share prices were already coming off their peaks before Wall
Street disappointed London by failing in early trading to extend the strong
advance of the previous session. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at
2,537.1 for a gain of 20.8.
Trading volume increased sharply to 673.6m shares through the Seaq network,
compared with 519.7m on the previous day. Stock Exchange data disclosed that
customer, or retail, business remained strong on Tuesday, just topping the
Pounds 1bn level seen as the sign of a healthy and profitable stock market
in London. Traders said institutional business was good yesterday but warned
that the big funds were selling as well as buying. One leading UK-based
house said the day's trading balance was 'skewed towards the sell side'.
The Footsie was driven ahead by widespread gains in the dollar-orientated
stocks, with BAT Industries, Reuters and SmithKline Beecham all sharply
higher. The oil sector, where a setback last week dragged down the rest of
the internationals, continued to recover yesterday in response to a change
of view among UK based analysts.
Overall optimism brushed off on to the retail and building share sectors,
both of which would respond readily to any moves to stimulate the UK economy
by tax-cutting or similar measures.
A handful of weak spots in the market were seen as reactions to specific
situations. Lonrho, with trading news due shortly, ran into sellers, and
both Glaxo and Wellcome gave back some of recent gains as attention switched
elsewhere.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities pause before firming
to set new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER Tuesday's sharp gains, US stock markets paused for breath yesterday,
although a steady stream of demand from individual investors ensured that
share prices ended at new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.30 at 3,258.50,
another all-time peak. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a
slight 0.33 firmer at 420.77, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks powered ahead 5.07 to 630.82, both record closes. Turnover on the New
York SE was very heavy at 312.8m shares, and rises finally led falls by
1,138 to 660.
One of the main influences behind Tuesday's 60-point Dow rally was the rush
of individual investor money out of maturing certificates of deposit and
equally low-yielding money market funds and into equities, which in the
current low interest rate environment appear attractive compared to many
other assets. That movement continued yesterday.
Another feature of recent trading has been investors switching out of
certain sectors and into others, searching for the sector that will
outperform the market.
A notable victim of this intra-market trading yesterday was the drugs
sector, which lost ground amid concerted selling. Merck dropped Dollars 4 to
Dollars 156 1/8 , Pfizer Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 , Glaxo Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 and Schering-Plough Dollars 3 to Dollars 64 3/4 .
Airline issues appeared to have benefited from selling in other areas of the
market. AMR, parent of American Airlines, advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars
74 1/4 in spite of reporting a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 125m after
a Dollars 59.6m charge to cover write-down of aircraft values.
Among other airlines, UAL rose Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 156 3/4 , USAir
added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 16 5/8 and Delta forged ahead Dollars 4 3/4
to Dollars 75 1/4 . The sector may have been helped by positive comments
from AMR's senior management about the outlook for pricing in the industry.
IBM moved up Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 95 1/8 on reports that Mr Donald
Young, an analyst at Shearson Lehman, had told his firm's sales force that
the computer giant could produce a pleasant surprise in its fourth-quarter
earnings report tomorrow.
Citicorp continued to race ahead, adding Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 15 1/8 in
turnover of 12.2m shares. The stock has been in great demand this week, and
yesterday it received a further boost when Goldman Sachs upgraded its
investment opinion of Citicorp and put the bank on its recommended list.
In the same sector, Bank of Boston put on Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 on
news that its merger talks with rival New England banking group Shawmut
National had been terminated. Shawmut firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 10 3/8
.
Canada
TORONTO stocks continued their rally in heavy trading, posting gains for the
sixth straight day. The composite index added 21.7 at 3,656.7, another
52-week high. Rises outscored declines by 388 to 234 after a volume of 41.1m
shares, exceeding Tuesday's 35.2m.
Nova fell CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 7 1/2 on more than 2.2m shares traded.
The company said it will issue for sale in Canada 35m common shares at
CDollars 7.15 apiece. It also announced that it has received letters of
credit to finance initial costs of Nova facilities for the proposed Pacific
Gas Transmission and Altamont pipelines.
Quebecor said it plans a two-for-one stock split on its class 'A' and 'B'
shares. The 'A' put on CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 25 1/4 but the 'B' lost
CDollars 1/2 to CDollars 25 1/4.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK SHORT money rates eased for a while yesterday before closing little
changed, as sterling gained ground against a weaker D-Mark on the foreign
exchange markets, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.15bn liquidity shortage during early
morning, later revised to Pounds 1.25bn. The main factors contributing to
the squeeze were exchequer transactions totalling Pounds 735m and maturing
assistance from previous sessions of Pounds 288m.
In early assistance, the Bank of England relieved some of the pressure,
injecting Pounds 489m through a small outright purchase of band 1 bills at
10 7/8 per cent and the purchase of Pounds 475m paper for resale to the
market on February 3 at 10 7/16 per cent.
Later in the morning a further Pounds 150m was bought for resale on the same
date and on the same terms. Afternoon assistance comprised the purchase of
Pounds 342m band 1 and band 2 bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Late assistance amounted to Pounds 290m, bringing the total liquidity
injection for the day to Pounds 1.27bn.
The unsecured overnight money rate traded mostly at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent in
the morning session, the same as Tuesday's closing level, but was down to 9
per cent during the afternoon as the liquidity injection took effect.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange streng-thened through the day, reaching 89.69 by the close,
from 89.62 on Tuesday. This level implies base rates of 10.31 per cent by
the spring, from a current rate of 10.5 per cent.
In Frankfurt, the Bundesbank relieved pressure for higher money market rates
at its repurchase operation. Faced with maturing repurchase pacts totalling
DM33.8bn, the Bundesbank injected a total of DM41.1bn.
This comprised DM31.1bn paper for resale in 35 days time at 9.4 per cent and
DM10bn for resale in 63 days at the same rate.
The net injection of DM7.3bn had only a marginal effect on money market
interest rates. Call money traded at around 9.45/55 per cent, down from
9.55/60 on Tuesday. In Paris, call money rates eased  3/16 point to 9 3/4 to
9 7/8 per cent, encouraged by the strength of the French franc against the
D-Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism, which may give the
French authorities more room to lower lending rates.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar resumes strong rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR continued on its upward path on the foreign exchange markets
yesterday, rising a full four pfennigs against the D-Mark in hectic morning
trading in London and holding on to the best of the gains through the
afternoon session, writes Simon London.
Overnight trading in the Far East was subdued, with Tokyo closed for a
national holiday. The dollar opened the day in Europe little changed from
its closing levels in New York on Tuesday night at around DM1.5930 and
Y126.75.
However, any hopes that the US currency would simply consolidate the gains
made on Tuesday were soon dispelled. The dollar climbed to a peak of
DM1.6280 and Y128.65 by mid-morning as dealers rushed to close short
positions and take advantage of the bull run.
The US unit surged to pass both the DM1.60 and DM1.62 barriers, as automatic
stop-loss trading programmes kicked into action. By the London close the
dollar stood at DM1.6220, from DM1.5905 on Tuesday, and Y128.40, from
Y126.80. In New York it finished mildly higher at DM1.6235 and Y128.55.
As on Tuesday, the best of the gains were at the expense of the D-Mark.
Analysts pointed to continued uncertainty over the current round of wage
negotiations in Germany as a reason for this weakness.
In addition, a speech given by Mr Wilhelm Noelling, a Bundesbank board
member, the text of which was released in advance, suggested that German
interest rates would be reduced if wage claims were not too high and if the
global economy continued to slow.
The D-Mark weakened within the European exchange rate mechanism. Sterling
gained ground to stand comfortably above DM2.85 by mid-morning.
However, this was still only just above its effective floor in the ERM,
which rose as the Spanish peseta also appreciated against the German
currency. The peseta improved to Pta63.41 against the D-Mark, from Pta63.57
on Tuesday. But in the afternoon session the Spanish currency drifted back
to close at Pta63.4950. One reason was the release of unexpectedly weak
inflation data for December, suggesting that the Bank of Spain may be able
to cut interest rates earlier than previously supposed.
The consumer price index rose just 0.1 per cent on the month, the same rate
as during November, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase. This
left inflation for the full year running at 5.5 per cent, from 6.5 per cent
in 1990. Many analysts had been expecting a year-on-year rate of growth of
around 5.8 per cent.
As the peseta fell back, so did sterling's floor, and the UK currency ended
the day at DM2.8475, from DM2.85 on Tuesday.
The strength of the US dollar also hit the Canadian currency, subject of
intervention only last week to cap its rise. The Canadian dollar traded down
to CDollars 1.1570, from CDollars 1.1470.

off closure threat

CENTROMIN, Peru's financially-crippled state-owned mining company, has
averted a threat of temporary closure for its huge La Oroya refinery and
smelter.
In a statement issued yesterday afternoon, the company said that 'we have
not halted production at the La Oroya complex, nor do we plan to.'
The statement admitted to 'certain temporary financial restrictions which
are affecting normal operations", but said that talks were already underway
with suppliers to negotiate conditions which would 'guarantee all internal
and external commitments.'
Centromin's financial position, however, is precarious. This week's crisis
arose when the state oil company Petroperu refused to continue supplying
Centromin with fuel on credit in the face of an unpaid bill for Dollars
200,000 (Pounds 111,731). Centromin has an estimated total debt of Dollars
60m (Pounds 33.50m) to a wide variety of suppliers.
Centromin is high on the government's privatisation list and an
international tender for valuation of the company has been called. Former
mines minister Mr Sanchez Albavera estimated the company's total worth at
about Dollars 600m.
Closure of the La Oroya refinery and smelter would have a dramatic effect on
Peru's already beleaguered mining sector. Centromin is the principal
purchaser of 'dirty' concentrates from many of Peru's medium-sized mines.
Some 2,500 local companies and an estimated 100,000 families depend directly
or indirectly for their livelihood on Centromin.
On its own account, Centromin employs more than 15,000 workers and exports
metals and minerals worth Dollars 350m annually. The company accounts for
about a third of Peru's lead and zinc, a quarter of its silver, and upwards
of ten per cent of its copper.
Centromin has been technically bankrupt for many months, having posted
Dollars 105m in losses for the first half of 1991. In early January, a
government decree authorised Centromin to sell off non-essential fixed
assets.

EUROPEAN government bond markets yesterday showed strong gains, helped by
overseas buying interest, particularly in the five-year sector.
Traders reported outright buying in Germany, France, Spain, Denmark and
Sweden, with investors anticipating interest rates cuts in these bond
markets.
Activity in the German government bond market was fairly volatile, but the
Liffe bund futures contract closed higher on the day, having reached a
significant resistance level. The Liffe contract opened at 88.30, and moved
between a low of 88.17 and a high of 88.47 before closing at 88.39.
Traders said bund prices rose on news that the Bundesbank injected DM7.3bn
of liquidity into its money market operations yesterday. At its allocation
of 35-day and 63-day ments, the Bundesbank allocated more liquidity than had
been expected. Traders said this could be taken as a sign that the
Bundesbank wants to ease short-term rates.
The French market also showed strong gains, with the Matif futures contract
reaching a high of 109.12 on heavy volumes. The contract traded between a
low of 108.86 and closed at 109.08.
AFTER a mixed opening, US Treasury prices fell sharply across the board as
investors sold amid dwindling hopes of another interest rate cut and in
response to an unexpected revision in the latest purchasing managers' index.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/16 at 104
15/16 , yielding 7.571 per cent. The two-year note was down 5/32 at 99 7/8 ,
yielding 5.050 per cent.
After four days of consecutive declines, the long end of the market appeared
to have reversed the trend in early trading. Comments from Mr Wayne Angell,
one of the Federal Reserve governors, who said in a television interview he
would not be against trimming the size of 30-year bond issues if it was
economically necessary, boosted sentiment at the opening.
Prices turned down, however, after the National Association of Purchasing
Management revised its December index from an originally estimated 46.5 per
cent to a marginally more bullish 47.4 per cent. Market sentiment was also
affected by a Market News Service report claiming Fed officials were
increasingly optimistic about the economic outlook, and that the chances of
further monetary easing were dwindling.
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices gained up to half a point. They were helped by
sterling stability in the foreign exchange market and the strong lead from
other European bond markets.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 115 1/16 to 115
19/32 , to yield 9.44 per cent by late afternoon. In the futures market, the
Liffe gilt contract rose from 97.04 to reach a high of 97.15 before falling
back to 97.11 on a volume of over 35,000 contracts.
Traders said market sentiment was also helped by an opinion poll released
yesterday which showed the Conservative party one point ahead of the
opposition Labour party.
THE strengthening of the dollar against the yen pushed Japanese government
bond prices lower in London trading.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB moved from its opening of 5.365 per
cent to 5.4 per cent as the yen weakened from 126.50 to the dollar to
128.70. The Tokyo market was closed for a public holiday.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: CrossLand ruling expected soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US BANK regulators are expected to decide shortly on the fate of CrossLand
Savings, the loss-making New York savings and loan that has been for sale
since signing a consent order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) last July.
The leading bidders for the 49-branch CrossLand are Chase Manhattan and
Republic National Bank of New York.
Republic, which is 30 per cent owned by Mr Edmond Safra, the Swiss-based
Lebanese banker, yesterday officially confirmed for the first time that it
had submitted a bid for CrossLand's New York retail deposits to the FDIC.
CrossLand, an aggressive real estate lender in the New York area during the
late 1980s, suffered losses of Dollars 308m in the first nine months of
1991, and its asset bank was lowered from Dollars 11.7bn to Dollars 9.2bn.
Some Dollars 1.5bn of CrossLand's assets are non-performing.
Whether Chase or Republic are awarded CrossLand, the cost to the US
government of salvaging the bank is expected to be at least Dollars 1bn, and
possibly as high as Dollars 2bn.
Republic, meanwhile, yesterday said its net income for the fourth quarter of
1991 rose by 17.7 per cent to Dollars 58.2m. For the whole of 1991,
Republic's net profit was 13 per cent higher at Dollars 227.4m.
Republic's net interest income in 1991 totalled Dollars 581.2m, compared
with Dollars 457.3m in 1990, while loan-loss provisions were a low Dollars
62m last year. Non-performing assets rose only slightly year-on-year, from
Dollars 164.4m to Dollars 173.98m.
The bank has an unusually low lending profile, and its deposits are divided
among private banking (38 per cent), retail (37.5 per cent) and
institutional funds (24.5 per cent).
Republic's share price fell Dollars 1 1/4 at close of trade yesterday to
Dollars 46.
Bank of New York yesterday reported Dollars 66m fourth-quarter net income, a
slight improvement over the Dollars 65m earned a year ago. But a heavy loan
loss provision taken in the first quarter of last year resulted in a 60.4
per cent slump in full-year 1991 net income, to Dollars 122m, down from
Dollars 308m in 1990.

AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday turned in a
14 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net earnings on strong sales of several
drugs for women.
For the three months to end-December, the company earned Dollars 372.6m, or
Dollars 1.18 a share, against Dollars 328.2m, or Dollars 1.04, a year
earlier. Last year's earnings included a one-time gain which lifted net
income by about Dollars 35m in the quarter.
Sales in the 1991 fourth-quarter rose 13 per cent to Dollars 1.82bn from
Dollars 1.61bn.
For the full year, net income grew 14 per cent to Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars
4.36 a share, from Dollars 1.23bn, or Dollars 3.92, in 1990. Sales advanced
11 per cent to Dollars 7.08bn from Dollars 6.78bn.
Non-recurring items in 1990 added about Dollars 105m to American Home
Products' net income last year.
Although the results were in line with analysts' expectations, its shares
eased Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 79 3/4 yesterday.
The company surprised Wall Street in the third quarter with exceptionally
strong earnings, but it continues to lag behind the leading pharmaceutical
companies, such as Merck.
Pre-tax income increased 12 per cent in the quarter. For the full year,
earnings before taxes fell 4 per cent, reflecting several one-time items.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bank of Boston's merger talks
with Shawmut fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS on a merger between Bank of Boston and Shawmut National Bank that
would have created the largest bank in New England, collapsed yesterday
after Shawmut found the terms of the planned merger unacceptable.
Shawmut said the reason it had terminated discussions was the extent of its
financial recovery.
Mr Joel Alvord, chairman of the Connecticut-based Shawmut, said an
improvement in earnings, asset quality, loan-loss reserve coverage and
capital ratios had persuaded the bank that its best interests would not be
served by the merger.
Mr Alvord said Shawmut would next week report fourth-quarter results showing
the improved performance.
Mr Ira Stepanian, chairman of Bank of Boston, said he also expected improved
fourth-quarter results. He said that after an independent review of the due
diligence study of the merger the terms for the proposed deal were found to
be unacceptable to Shawmut.
Both Shawmut and Bank of Boston have been hard hit by the real estate crisis
in New England and both suffered heavy losses in the first six months of
1991, of Dollars 175.4m (Shawmut) and Dollars 138m (Boston). Both banks
achieved a small profit in the third quarter; Shawmut earned Dollars 2.3m
and Bank of Boston Dollars 18m.
Last October, Shawmut entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston that required Fed approval for the payment of dividends and
other decisions. At the time, the merger talks appeared to be on track.
Analysts have said Shawmut and Bank of Boston were having difficulties
assuring bank regulators they would be able to raise an estimated Dollars
625m in fresh capital in conjunction with the merger.
Wall Street nonetheless seemed cheered that the merger was off. Bank of
Boston's stock price rose by 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 yesterday, while
Shawmut's price jumped by Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 10 3/8 .
Fleet/Norstar, the Rhode Island-based bank that joined forces last year to
acquire the failed Bank of New England (BNE), yesterday reported
fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 35m, compared with a loss of Dollars
59m a year ago.
The bank earned Dollars 98m for the whole of 1991, following Dollars 73m of
after-tax charges related to the BNE acquisition and Dollars 321m of loan
loss reserves.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: AMR signals better year for
airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines, one of the largest US carriers, yesterday sparked a rally
in US airline stocks when its parent company, AMR, accompanied news of a net
Dollars 239.9m loss in 1991 with suggestions that ticket prices and yields
are finally firming.
Mr Michael Durham, finance director, said that bookings so far this year had
been 'a bit softer than expected', but that domestic yields were currently
'a bit better' than AMR had anticipated. He added that the mix of lower
interest rates and lower fuel prices should help significantly. AMR is
currently paying around 60 cents a gallon for jet fuel, compared with 82.5
cents a year ago.
The carrier, which traditionally kicks off the US industry's reporting
season, had warned that it would probably make losses in the fourth quarter
and 1991 overall, and analysts' expectations had been pitched accordingly.
In the event, AMR's after-tax deficit for the final three months totalled
Dollars 124.9m, or Dollars 1.83 a share.
This figure, however, included an aggregate Dollars 59.6m charge for the
write-down in value of certain Boeing 737 and 747SP jets, which are to be
retired soon, plus some commuter aircraft. At the operating level, AMR
showed a much smaller fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 41.4m, and a tiny
Dollars 5m profit for the year. Operating revenues were Dollars 3.4bn in the
final three months and Dollars 12.9bn for 1991 overall.
Mr Durham suggested that the figures were at the upper end of market
expectations - largely thanks to a sharper-than-expected fall in fuel prices
in December and a strong Christmas week. He added that, in the balance
between yields and load factor, American had tended to push for the former.
The fourth-quarter yield rose 2.3 per cent to 13.37 cents, while the load
factor edged down from 60 per cent to 59.3 per cent.
Comparisons with the previous year are heavily distorted by the impact of
the Gulf war and the associated rise in fuel prices. This savaged airline
profits in late-1990, and AMR itself made a fourth-quarter operating loss of
Dollars 245.1m.
Mr Bob Crandall, AMR chairman and one of most gloomy voices in the industry
over the 18 months, made no excuses for the 1991 figures, describing them as
'terrible'. 'The best thing you can say about last year is that it's over,'
he said.
But even he sounded a much more optimistic note about current trends. 'In
recent weeks, we have been encouraged by the downward trend in fuel prices
and by some modest indications that some semblance of rationality may be
returning to the airline pricing environment,' he said.
Many of the US airline industry's problems have stemmed from cut-throat
discounting in the domestic market, with financially-troubled carriers
proving particularly aggressive. During 1991, however, three big carriers
ceased operations and, although some bankrupt or defaulting airlines remain
in business, industry observers have noted some firming of domestic prices
recently.
On Wall Street, AMR's own shares rallied by Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 74 1/4.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXTREMELY poor aluminium prices depressed results at two of America's
largest aluminium companies, Alcoa and Reynolds Metals.
Alcoa, the world's biggest producer of aluminium, suffered in addition from
heavy charges of Dollars 217m related to the costs of environmental
clean-ups and a restructuring.
In the fourth quarter, before the charges, Alcoa earnings were Dollars
25.6m, or 30 cents a share, compared with Dollars 134.6m, or Dollars 1.58 a
share, for the 1990 quarter.
After the charges, the fourth quarter came in at a loss of Dollars 191.4m,
or Dollars 2.26, compared with a loss of Dollars 140.4m, or Dollars 1.61,
for the year-ago period.
For all of 1991, Alcoa's net income, before the charges, fell to Dollars
279.7m, or Dollars 3.27 a share, on revenues of Dollars 10bn, compared with
net income of Dollars 570.2m, or Dollars 6.59 per share, on revenues of
Dollars 10.9bn in 1990.
While this was bad enough, once the charges were taken, the company's net
income dwindled to Dollars 62.7m, or 71 cents a share, down from Dollars
295.2m, or Dollars 3.40, in 1990.
At Reynolds, net income in the fourth quarter rose to Dollars 23.7m, or 40
cents a share, compared with Dollars 15.1m, or 25 cents, in the year-ago
quarter. However, in the fourth quarter of 1990, results were hit with a
Dollars 93.9m charge for environmental clean-ups.
For 1991, the company's net income dropped to Dollars 154.1m, or Dollars
2.60 a share, on revenues of Dollars 5.78bn, compared with Dollars 296.6m,
or Dollars 5.01, on revenues of Dollars 6.08bn.
Mr William Bourke, chairman of Reynolds, said the poor results were
attributable to 'the obstinate recession and a worldwide oversupply of
aluminium which has pushed prices, in real terms, to their lowest levels
ever'.
Margins were seriously eroded for both ingots and fabricated products, he
said.
Both companies had increased their shipments last year. Alcoa shipped 2.8m
metric tons, up from 2.7 m metric tons in 1990. Reynolds shipped 1.47m
metric tons, up from 1.42m in 1990.

<TEXT>
GENGOLD, the gold arm of the Gencor group, saw attributable profits drop
sharply in the December quarter as a result of a weaker gold price and
higher capital expenditure, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
Profits after tax and capital expenditure dropped by 56 per cent to R22.4m
(USDollars 8m) from R51m in the September quarter. The December figure is in
line with profits earned in the March and June quarters. Mr Gary Maude,
managing director, said the figures disguised positive trends which augured
well for the rest of the year.
The main cause of the lower profits was an R18m increase in capital
expenditure to R52.3m compared with the previous quarter. Future capital
expenditure will be lower.
Profits were hit by the lower average gold price received by the 11 mines in
the group. At R32,578 per kg, it was 2.4 per cent lower than the R33,385
price of the previous quarter. Total gold produced during the quarter rose
by 1.6 per cent to 18,114kg, at an average grade of 5.1 grams/tonne.

CITICORP, the biggest US bank that has been struggling to bolster its

Citicorp said Ambac had lodged a filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission (SEC) saying it may offer all or part of the 17.4m shares now
owned by Citicorp. At yesterday's share price of Dollars 32 3/4 , that would
place a market value of Dollars 569.9m on Citicorp's 49.7 per cent of Ambac.
Last July, Citicorp sold 50.3 per cent of Ambac, once a crown jewel in the
bank's portfolio, for Dollars 352m.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) and its two partners in a new Ukraine
joint venture set up earlier this week plan to invest a total of Dollars
150m over the next few years in establishing and operating a
telecommunications network in the former Soviet republic.
AT&amp;T and PTT Telecom, the Dutch telecommunications authority, are to lend
the majority partner in the venture, the Ukraine state committee of
communications, the capital it needs to take part.
The two western companies will be repaid from revenue generated by the
telecommunications system, which encompasses a new international network and
a long-distance domestic network that will link 13 of Ukraine's 25 telephone
networks.
The Ukraine state committee will own 51 per cent of the joint venture, AT&amp;T
will hold 39 per cent and PTT Telecom 10 per cent.
The venture is the first time that either AT&amp;T or PTT Telecom has owned and
operated part of a telephone network outside their own countries.
Mr Sam Willcoxon, AT&amp;T's international group executive, said the former
republics of the Soviet Union were now confronting decisions on how to set
up modern communications as independent states.
'Some appear to be interested in arrangements like this, others are not,' he
said. Until now, Ukraine's international telephone traffic and that of the
other former republic have largely been routed through Moscow.
The Ukraine agreement, signed on Tuesday in Kiev, will continue for 15
years, with an option on a five-year renewal. AT&amp;T's portion of the
investment will take the form of 13 digital switching stations which will be
used to connect half of Ukraine's telephone districts.
Mr Ben Verwaayen, president of PTT Telecom, said his company expected to
break even on its investment after four to five years and then reap a profit
over the rest of the life of the contract.
Besides helping to create international and long-distance networks, AT&amp;T and
PTT Telecom will assist Ukraine in drawing up a short-term proposal for
nearly doubling the number of telephone lines in the country to 13m.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chevron to axe 2,500 jobs and
reduce costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas company, is to cut its workforce
by 2,500 people, about 5 per cent, and record a Dollars 270m fourth-quarter
charge as part of a restructuring plan.
Mr Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that 500 of the 2,500 jobs being
eliminated related to a decision to downsize the company's refinery in Port
Arthur, Texas. The refinery represents about 20 per cent of Chevron's total
petroleum refining capacity and its partial or full closure has been under
review for some time.
Mr Derr said the company would focus on reducing operating costs. He said
low natural gas prices, poor refining margins, the recession and reduced
demand for petroleum products had hampered Chevron's financial results.
Mr Derr said a final decision on Port Arthur would be made later this year.
Among the options is a complete shut down except for chemicals manufacturing
 -this would cut about 1,600 jobs. At a minimum the refinery will cut
capacity by a third to 200,000 barrels a day.
The other 2,000 Chevron jobs will be eliminated by way of voluntary early
retirement, organisational changes and asset sales.
Mr Derr said that Dollars 185m of the Dollars 270m fourth-quarter after-tax
charges would relate to the Port Arthur refinery. If the refinery is shut
down Chevron would incur an additional Dollars 200m charge.
Mr Derr announced plans to accelerate Chevron's programme to sell off more
of its non-strategic US oil and gas fields. He said new US environmental
regulations contained in the Clean Air Act would lead to costs of more than
Dollars 2bn over the next five years at Chevron's eight US refineries.
The Chevron chief said the company's 1992 capital and exploration budget
would total Dollars 5.3bn, 6 per cent higher than last year.
In the third quarter of 1991 Chevron's net profit fell by 22 per cent to
Dollars 313m.
Deliveries of petroleum products in the US - an important measure of demand
 -declined by 2 per cent in 1991, according to the American Petroleum
Institute (API). The industry association said that oil's share of domestic
US energy consumption fell to less than 41 per cent in 1991, it lowest level
in 40 years.
Mr Edward Murphy, API's finance director, said the statistics gathered for

petroleum industry in the US have entered a period of accelerated decline,
while there is accelerated growth overseas'.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Intel's strong results beat
analysts' predictions

<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading maker of computer microprocessor chips, reported strong
fourth-quarter results, bringing revenues and earnings for the year to
record levels and well above analysts' projections.
Dr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive, said: '1991 was an
outstanding year for Intel.' Revenues for the year rose by 22 per cent to
Dollars 4.78bn, up from Dollars 3.92bn in 1990.
Net income was Dollars 819m, or Dollars 3.92 a share, compared with Dollars
650m, or Dollars 3.20.
Fourth-quarter results were strong, with revenue of Dollars 1.21bn, up 15
per cent from Dollars 1.05bn for the same period in 1990. Net income of
Dollars 189m, or 90 cents a share, increased from Dollars 164m, or 80 cents,
for the fourth quarter of 1990. Wall Street analysts had forecast
fourth-quarter earnings of about 84 cents a share.
Intel's success, despite a broad decline in the semiconductor market, stems
from the popularity of its latest microprocessor products. Its 486 and 386
microprocessors form the 'brains' of most personal computers.
'In 1992, these chips will be the centre of our product line. We will expand
their production and offer several new products in these families,' said Dr
Grove.
Although Intel is facing increasing competition in the microprocessor
market, particularly from Advanced Micro Devices which last year launched
its own version of the 386, Dr Grove declared his determination to maintain
Intel's dominant market position.

<TEXT>
MR LAURENT Beaudoin, chairman of Bombardier, the aerospace and transit
equipment group, is expected to confirm tomorrow his company's imminent
takeover of De Havilland Canada (DHC) from Boeing.
Bombardier has been negotiating details of the deal, following the European
Commission's refusal to allow acquisition of DHC by France's Aerospatiale
and Alenia of Italy, makers of the successful ATR, on competition grounds.
Bombardier will basically pay CDollars 51m (USDollars 43.9m) for 51 per cent
of DHC, builder of the Dash 8 commuter aircraft. The Ontario government,
anxious to save jobs in Toronto, where DHC's plant is located, will put up
CDollars 49m for 49 per cent. Bombardier will have an option to buy out
Ontario's stake, but will immediately take full operating control.
Nearly 400 Dash 8 aircraft in 30- and 50-seat configurations have been built
or are on order. But Bombardier will push subcontracting work for Boeing and
Airbus into the DHC operation.
Two key agreements have been needed to complete the deal. Bombardier wanted
at least CDollars 300m from the Ontario government to compensate for
expected losses on existing DHC contracts.
It also wanted guarantees of federal export finance to help DHC compete in
foreign markets.
Bombardier also expects significant long-term government help to finance a
larger version of the Dash 8, plus training and research grants. Its demands
for pay concessions and job flexibility have already been accepted by the
Canadian Autoworkers' union.

<TEXT>
BOISE CASCADE, the US forest products group, yesterday reported a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 15.8m, compared with net income of Dollars
4.8m in the same period of 1990.
The company was hit by depressed prices in its key pulp and paper
businesses.
Boise's net loss worked through at 51 cents a share, against profits of 4
cents in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Results for the latest period included a gain of 61 cents a share from the
sale of its interest in a European corrugated container joint venture.
Sales totalled Dollars 963m, down from Dollars 1bn a year ago.
The company said the fourth quarter was modestly stronger than the third,
and cited four main factors for the weak performance.
One was adverse market conditions, which had driven down prices for all of
the company's grades of pulp and paper over the year.
Another was the high costs of wood in the Pacific north-west, where
environmental pressures to save a species of owl have led to constraints on
timber supplies.
Costs had increased for wood chips to the company's pulp and paper mills.
For the full year, the group reported a net loss of Dollars 79.5m, or
Dollars 2.46 a share, compared with a profit of Dollars 75.3m, or Dollars
1.62, in 1990.

THE development of a western-style capital market in China took a further
step forward yesterday when the Shanghai Stock Exchange announced the first
public offering to foreign investors of shares in a Chinese company.
The exchange said that 1m 'B' shares in Shanghai Vacuum Electron Devices
Company, a maker of core components for the Chinese television industry,
will be offered to foreign investors on Monday and would be available for
three days.
The shares, with a face value of Yn100 (Dollars 18.5), will be sold to
foreigners for Yn420 each, to raise Yn420m, or Dollars 78m. They will be
listed on the Shanghai exchange for trading on February 20.
Shanghai Vacuum is the most important company listed on the Shanghai
exchange, representing 70 per cent of the exchange's total market
capitalisation.
The success of the issue will be regarded as an indicator of China's likely
success in the future with similar offerings to foreign investors.
The Chinese government and its agencies, which currently control 73 per cent
of the company, expect their shareholding in Shanghai Vacuum to fall to
around 50 per cent as more of the company is sold to foreign and domestic
investors.
Recently 2m 'A' shares were issued to the Chinese investing public.
The 'B' shares on offer confer the same rights of ownership on foreign
investors as the 'A' shares do upon domestic investors, with respect to
voting rights, dividends and participation in new share issues.
They will, however, only be able to be traded on the Shanghai exchange which
will keep a registry of ownership.
As one foreign broker to the issue said yesterday, the Chinese government
would always outnumber other investors on the company's share register and
decisions concerning the company would always be influenced by the state.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Daiwa, Bankers Trust advise
Rosneftegas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust, the US merchant bank, and Daiwa Europe, the European arm of
the Japanese investment banking house, have been appointed joint financial
advisers to the Russian Oil and Gas Corporation (Rosneftegas).
They will assist in planning and implementing a comprehensive
re-organisation of the industry into competing, vertically integrated oil
companies open to foreign investment and technical assistance.
The corporation, which groups together the 47 main Russian oil production,
exploration and related service enterprises, was responsible for about 90
per cent of the estimated 500m tons of oil produced in the former Soviet
Union last year. It is essentially a reincarnation, under the guise of a
joint stock company, of the former Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry which it
replaced in October 1991.
The decision to involve leading US and Japanese bankers as advisers in the
re-organisation of the ailing industry reflects the top priority given to
raising the efficiency of the Russian oil and gas industry.
Production has declined by around 100m tonnes over the past three years. A
report prepared for the Russian government by Moscow's Institute of World
Economy and International Relations predicted this week that Russian oil
output could fall to between 280m-300m tonnes by the mid-1990s.
It blamed low investment, poor extraction techniques and maintenance,
out-dated equipment and poor management.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cityvision rebel holders expect 10% support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER executives of Cityvision expect to have the backing of 'well
over' 10 per cent of shareholder votes in an unusual call to oust the
company's current management following its agreement to be acquired by
US-based Blockbuster Entertainment.
Cityvision, the UK's largest video rental chain which markets itself under
the Ritz name, was the subject of an agreed Pounds 75m cash and shares offer
from Blockbuster last November. Cityvision shares, which had been
languishing at 25p, rose sharply when the deal was announced and are now
trading at 50p, the value of the offer.
However, some shareholders had been unhappy with the offer, saying that
despite the price premium, Cityvision's franchise operation, by far the
largest in the UK, is worth more than that.
Yesterday, in a circular to shareholders, Mr Philip Crane, a video
entrepreneur who sold out to Blockbuster, and Mr Ray Hipkin, founder of the
Ritz video chain, urged shareholders to reject Blockbuster's offer which
closes on January 22.
Instead, shareholders will be notified of an extraordinary general meeting
at which they will be asked to name Mr Hipkin and Mr Crane to replace the
current management.
In the circular, Mr Hipkin and Mr Crane charged that the company's current
directors had failed to capitalise on the Ritz brand name and had failed to
use innovative marketing techniques to gain market share.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Electricity companies merge retail and
repair operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WESTERN Electricity and South Wales Electricity are merging their
retailing and appliance repair businesses into a new company, SWEB Retail.
The new company will be 80 per cent controlled by South Western Electricity,
which will contribute 43 of SWEB's 67 retail outlets. The balance of the
shares will go South Wales Electricity, which has also retained the right to
sell its minority shareholding to South Western after 1996 for an estimated
asset value of about Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m.
Annual turnover for the new company, which is planned to come into effect in
early April, is expected to be in the region of Pounds 70m.
The freehold and leasehold property rights will remain with the parent
companies.
Mr David Jones, managing director of South Wales Electricity, said that the
utility had been reviewing its retail business for some time.
The merger with South Western's retailing operations would provide it with
an opportunity to move out of a business that was not profitable. In the six
months to end-September, South Wales' retailing business incurred a loss of
about Pounds 1m on turnover of just over Pounds 20m.
For South Western, the merger would enable it to increase volume, which, in
electrical retailing, is crucial to profitability. South Western only came
close to break even at the interim stage last year.
Mr Jones said the merger would lead to significant cost reductions through
the elimination of 80 to 90 jobs, the rationalisation of warehouses,
nationalisation of infrastructure and joint purchasing benefits.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pressure on margins as Wyko dives to Pounds
279,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP AND sustained pressure on margins led to a collapse in interim profits
at Wyko, the West Midlands-based manufacturer and distributor of bearings
and power transmission components.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 279,000 for the six months to October 31 were 80
per cent lower than the corresponding period's Pounds 1.42m. This translated
into a fall in earnings per share from 3.8p to 0.66p.
But the group is maintaining its interim dividend at 1.4p despite having to
dip into reserves to meet the full cost. Mr Philip White, chairman,
explained that the move was a sign of confidence.
'We feel we possibly have seen the worst of it now. The thing has bottomed.
We've seen some slight signs of improvement here and there,' he said.
The figures were indeed better than in the second half of 1990-91 when
pre-tax profits of just Pounds 101,000 were recorded. The problem has been
the pressure on margins. First half turnover of Pounds 25.4m was only
fractionally down from that in the corresponding period; operating profits,
however, fell from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 853,000.
During the second half Mr White is expecting a better performance from UK
manufacturing activities. There is, he noted, 'a reasonable order book,' but
the main hope of higher second half earnings comes from the UK distribution
network where the group will have a full six month contribution from EW
Bearings' outlets, acquired last October.
Recently there have been signs that prices and margins were stabilising in
the international distribution business, although general trading conditions
remain unsettled.
Gearing, now running at 50 per cent, is expected to be under 40 per cent by
the end of the year despite capital expenditure of Pounds 1.3m.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Colorvision pushed into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNDERSTATEMENT of creditors led to Colorvision, the Liverpool-based
retailer of television and satellite systems, incurring an interim deficit
of Pounds 545,000 before tax.
The outcome for the six months to September 30 compared to profits of Pounds
148,000 last time. Following a change of year-end, the latest figures
comprise the second interim period for the 18 months to March 31 1992.
An exceptional debit of Pounds 808,000 was needed after payments made to
creditors, which had not been accounted for, came to light after the
accounts were computerised.
It then emerged that the head office had repeatedly, for more than a year,
paid out money owed to shops, for advertising on Colorvision's behalf for
example, without recording it.
Profits before exceptional items and taxation increased to Pounds 263,000
(Pounds 148,000) on turnover ahead from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 24.1m.
Mr Neville Michaelson, chairman, said that during a period when national
markets in television and video recorder sales had fallen the company
continued to increase its market share.
Gross margins fell from 37.2 to 34.3 per cent as the group phased out
finance pur-chases in favour of cash purchases.
Colorvision has continued its expansion of retail outlets. It now has 80
compared to 77 at end-March 1991 and anticipates having 85 by the end of
March 1992.
Losses per share were 1.7p compared to earnings of 0.5p. A second interim
dividend of 3.1p is declared.

in IPounds 100m deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WATERFORD FOODS, the Irish dairy and foods group, has agreed in principle to
buy Express Ireland, a dairy offshoot of Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks,
food and retailing group.
Excluded from the deal is Express Ireland's 80 per cent interest in Carbery
Milk Products, which is to be sold to Carbery Creameries, the minority
shareholder which is owned by four Irish dairy co-operatives.
The deal is estimated to be worth IPounds 100m (Pounds 93.6m) to GrandMet
and ends weeks of speculation over the future ownership of Express Ireland:
GrandMet last November revealed plans to reduce its dairy interests in the
UK and Ireland to concentrate on more strongly branded segments of the food
industry.
Last December GrandMet sold its Express Dairy liquid milk business in the UK
and its Eden Vale chilled products business to Northern Foods for Pounds
359m.
Since then, as many as 10 contenders have been negotiating the takeover of
Express Ireland in a battle between Irish food groups for scale and market
share.
Express Ireland comprises: Carbery milk products, the Republic's biggest
cheesemaker; Virginia Milk Products, which supplies cream to Bailey's, the
GrandMet subsidiary which makes cream liqueur; Premier Dairies, the main
liquid milk supplier to the Dublin market; and an Italian-style cheese
production plant in Northern Ireland.
Waterford's main interests are in: Premier, in which it already has a 50 per
cent stake; Virginia, which purchases about half of Premier's milk supplies;
and the Northern Ireland plant at Magheraglin, although this last may
subsequently be sold off.
As part of the deal, Virginia will continue to supply cream for the
production of Bailey's Original Irish Cream.
The deal comes at a difficult time for Waterford, which last October bought
United Co-operative Dairies in the north of England for Pounds 37.5m.
This followed the 1989 acquisition of Healds Foods, also based in the north
of England. The two deals left Waterford with a considerable debt burden of
some IPounds 45m. The Express Ireland acquisition is expected to be financed
by a rights issue of about IPounds 30m together with long-term debt, and is
likely to cost Waterford between IPounds 50m and IPounds 60m after
subtracting what Carbery will fetch, and cash reserves within Express
Ireland.
Stockbrokers in Ireland have been recommending Irish food industry stocks in
recent months, and analysts say that a Waterford rights issue would be
well-timed now, despite the company's debt.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: A pension scheme with no guarantees - The
gloomy prospects for MCC pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAXWELL Communication Corporation may not have to repair the Pounds 45m
deficit in its pension fund, which could mean that its present employees
lose all their pension benefits, according to a confidential report by Price
Waterhouse, the accountants.
In a startling assessment of MCC's debts, Price Waterhouse says that there
may be 'no liability under the pension fund's trust deed to make good a
deficit' if the scheme were wound up this year before the full provisions of
the latest pension legislation come into force.
The report shows that the late Mr Robert Maxwell siphoned off Pounds 40m
from the MCC pension fund - part of a total of up to Pounds 700m raided with
apparent ease from all his companies' pension funds to support his tottering
private business empire.
If the MCC scheme is not wound-up then MCC has a clear obligation to make up
the deficit.
A decision whether to wind up would be made partly by Law Debenture Trust
Company, independent stewards which Price Waterhouse recommended as new
trustees of the fund, replacing a company run by Mr Robert Maxwell.
However Price Waterhouse, who are administrators of MCC under UK insolvency
law and could also have a say in a wind-up decision, conceded that there was
a potential conflict between the company's pensioners and its creditors. The
fund's trustees act on behalf of present and future pensioners, but the
administrators act for MCC's creditors and want to realise the maximum value
from the company.
The MCC fund, which covers only its UK subsidiaries - Macdonald, Nimbus and
the MCC head office staff - is thought to have lost some Pounds 40m of its
Pounds 65m assets when its investments were lent without security to Mr
Robert Maxwell's private companies.
That could leave it with a Pounds 45m deficit on its potential liabilities,
estimated at Pounds 70m.
und can probably keep up payments to those now drawing a pension, according
to the presentation by Price Waterhouse to MCC's bank creditors on December
18.
But it may not be able to meet obligations to deferred pensioners - those
who have left the company but are still below retirement age - nor those to
existing employees.
That means that employees - who have been paying 5.75 per cent of their pay
into the scheme - may have lost most of their benefits.
They also risk getting nothing back if they continued to contribute - their
payments might be set against the fund's deficit and so help only existing
pensioners, according to Price Waterhouse.
Law Debenture is understood to have written to the scheme's members to say
that until this risk is clarified, it would be wrong for it to accept more
contributions.
The 1990 Social Security Act includes provisions to create a debt on the
employer when schemes are wound up, but these will not come into force until
1992 or 1993.
MCC's US pension funds for Macmillan and Official Airline Guides, the US
companies which are its main businesses, appear to have suffered no losses.
Price Waterhouse yesterday met MCC's bankers, who face huge write-offs on
their loans of Pounds 1.6bn, to agree extra funding for MCC over the next
three months.
The administrators 'hope to progress soon' on selling small MCC businesses,
which they assess could raise Pounds 105m to Pounds 159m after tax. Sales of
US offices, including the OAG and Macmillan headquarters, could raise
another Pounds 17m to Pounds 21m after tax.
However MCC's rivals have said that Panini, an Italian printer of stickers,
and Collier, the US encyclopedia business, have been up for sale for more
than 15 months, and are minor compared to MCC's main US businesses.
The report exposes how MCC's Pounds 1.1bn of shareholders' funds at March
1991 had been wiped out by Mr Maxwell's plundering in the months before his
death.
Mr Maxwell's private companies owe MCC Pounds 252m which they now cannot
pay. MCC's subsidiary Berlitz, the language instruction company, was
included in its assets at Pounds 318m but its shares have been pledged to
banks as security. US tax losses slice another Pounds 40m off the value.
Foreign exchange dealing also lost it Pounds 27m since March.
The overall result is that MCC's liabilities could exceed its assets by more
than Pounds 500m.
London &amp; Bishopsgate Group and Robert Maxwell Group, two private Maxwell
companies, yesterday won an extension of the High Court's Mareva injunction
against assets of up to Pounds 4.35m of Mr Sheldon Aboff, a former executive
of several private Maxwell companies.
LBG and RMG allege that two transfers were made from their funds in October
1991 of Pounds 3.1m and Pounds 1.25m to Mr Aboff's account, and that this
money was used to buy MCC shares.
Mr Kevin Maxwell was in court yesterday to hear the third day of his appeal
for the right to silence in answering questions about missing pension fund
money.

Granada chief
</HEADLINE>

   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA Group, the television and leisure group, received a welter of
telephone calls yesterday from outsiders concerned about payments to one
former and one current director revealed in its latest annual report.
The company attempted to play down the furore over a Pounds 579,550 payment
to Mr Derek Lewis, the group's former chief executive who resigned last
September.
With Mr Lewis leaving soon after the start of a three-year contract paying
him some Pounds 200,000 annually, the compensation package mostly
represented fulfilment of the contract.
Defenders of Mr Lewis said yesterday that Granada's successful Pounds 9m bid
for the north-west television franchise in October owed much to him.
The annual report also revealed that Mr David Plowright, the current
chairman of Granada TV, had exercised his right to purchase a house in
Cheshire previously owned by the company. He paid just over Pounds 81,000,
against an estimated market value of some Pounds 400,000. Granada TV granted
Mr Plowright the option at a price equalling Granada's costs.

stored in a disused coach terminus in Glasgow - as a result of the collapse
of the Maxwell publishing empire.
The Koenig &amp; Bauer presses, capable of producing 80-page newspapers with top
quality colour, were destined for Mirror Group Newspaper's Scottish titles,
the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail.
They were ordered in the days when the late Mr Robert Maxwell was still
expanding his interests.
Now they are stranded a couple of streets away from the Daily Record
headquarters at Anderson's Quay under 24-hour security in a covered section
of the terminus.
There seems little chance in the foreseeable future that MGN will be able to
afford the Pounds 50m-plus needed to build a new press hall and install the
presses.
Meanwhile, the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, which had advertising and
circulation revenues of Pounds 76m in 1990, have to pay leasing charges on
the presses of more than Pounds 6m a year. Three belong to Barclays and the
other two to the Royal Bank of Scotland.
It seems likely that their future will not be determined until the future of
MGN itself is decided when the administrator of the Maxwell private
interests manages to sell the 51 per cent now effectively owned by the
banks.
The five presses were ordered in the days when Mr Maxwell had grand visions
of printing The European in Paris and becoming a leading contract printer in
France. When that came to nothing, the presses were then diverted to
Anderson's Quay.

SMITHKLINE BEECHAM has received approval for the first vaccine against
hepatitis-A, a disease usually contracted though contaminated food and
water.
The drug, Havrix, was approved in Switzerland at the end of December, but
the news was not published until yesterday. Its price will be revealed on
January 27.
Investors were caught by surprise by the approval and the company's shares
rose 18p to 963p, having been another 15p higher than that during the day.
Between 3,000 and 6,000 hepatitis-A cases are reported in the UK each year,
but the figure is much higher in developing countries. Hepatitis A causes
fever, jaundice and occasionally liver disease.
Mr Paul Woodhouse of stockbroker Smith New Court estimated that the drug
could make sales of up to Pounds 75m a year.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Worldwide revamp for commercial side of
Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is restructuring
its commercial activities worldwide with the principal aim of sharply
increasing sales outside the UK.
Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, has set a long-term goal for the
company to export 60 per cent of its annual output of about 500,000 cars and
4-wheel-drive vehicles. This compares with a record 45 per cent last year -
when just under 200,000 vehicles were exported - and only about 25 per cent
in the period before privatisation.
The revamp announced yesterday includes the creation of Rover Europe, under
which the UK and continental Europe will be treated as a single market for
the first time.
The creation of a total of three new groupings - Rover Europe, Rover
International and Rover Marketing - is also intended to strengthen Rover's
efforts to be perceived as an upmarket producer.
As well as combining UK and continental sales activities, as part of
preparations for the single EC market post-1992, Rover Europe will also
merge previously separate sales and marketing operations for Rover cars and
Land Rover/Range Rover 4wd vehicles.
It will be headed, as managing director, by Mr Graham Morris, formerly
president of Rover's Sterling Motor Cars subsidiary in North America until
collapsing sales forced Rover's withdrawal from the US car market last year.
Its 4wd subsidiary in the US, Range Rover of North America, is still fully
operative, however, and will be grouped with Rover's other subsidiaries
outside Europe within Rover International.
Its managing director, Mr Chris Woodwark - formerly managing director of
Land Rover - will also take responsibility for developing new business
elsewhere, including Eastern Europe.
Among projects already underway for the region are possible production of
the Maestro in Bulgaria and the setting up of a Russian distribution network
for Rover vehicles through Orbicom, a UK-headquartered east-west trade
group. Longer term, Montego production could also be moved to Russia.
The third new division, Rover Marketing, is to be under the managing
directorship of Mr Kevin Morley, hitherto managing director of Rover Cars.
Mr Morley, whose responsibilities have been primarily for Rover's commercial
activities, including sales and marketing, will lead Rover's drive to
reposition its cars at the premium end of the market. He is also to become
chairman of a new, independent and as-yet unnamed company to be set up by
Rover Marketing to provide integrated marketing services to the group.

six months to September 30.
At the pre-tax level, profits fell by 50 per cent from Pounds 263,000 to
Pounds 131,000. However, last year's figure was enhanced by an exceptional
gain of Pounds 192,000 on the sale of properties.
Turnover advanced by Pounds 205,000 to Pounds 2.83m. Mr Roger Myers,
chairman, said that Pelican now had 14 restaurants and intended to open a
further six Cafe Rouge outlets by the spring, thereby doubling the total.
Earnings per share declined to 1.1p (3.9p).

Triplex Lloyd, the engineering group with interests in the power, automotive

consideration of up to Pounds 4.98m.
For an initial Pounds 2.75m, it is buying Paralloy, a specialist producer of
horizontal centrifugally-spun high alloy tubing, fabricated assemblies and
static cast fittings, mostly for the petrochemical industry. Further
consideration of Pounds 750,000 will become due if profits for the year to

The other company acquired is Precision Castparts - to be renamed Centaur
Precision. The Pounds 1.48m purchase price is to be financed out of
Triplex's own resources.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Progress in hunt for missing Maxwell money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pursuit of Pounds 1.3bn missing from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's public
companies, Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell Communication Corporation,
has homed in on six secretive Liechtenstein foundations and two Swiss
companies.
The six foundations or 'stiftungs' - Corry, Allandra, Baccano, Akim, Kiara,
and Jungo - have been targeted by accountants Arthur Andersen and
liquidators of the collapsed Maxwell empire searching for the money.
In other developments yesterday, members of parliament renewed their efforts
to discover where the Maxwell money went.
Concerns over the Mirror Group pension fund also deepened yesterday with the
revelation that pensioners of MCC could lose all their pension benefits.
There may be 'no liability under the pension fund's trust deed to make good
the deficit', according to a confidential report to MCC's bankers by Price
Waterhouse, the accountants.
Most of the money appears to have flowed out from MCC and MGN to the web of
400 private Maxwell companies - and then out again to Liechtenstein,
Switzerland, the US and Panama.
Arthur Andersen, who are administrators of the private Maxwell companies
under UK insolvency laws, now suspect that some of these foundations were
used to conceal the origin of funds.
The Swiss-based companies Yakosa Finanzierungs and Servex are thought likely
to have had a central role in the alleged scheme in which Mr Maxwell
illegally supported the share price of MCC, now the subject of an
investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.
Meanwhile, members of the House social security select committee decided to
send written questions on the Mirror Group pension fund to Mr Maxwell's sons
Kevin and Ian, after they refused on Monday to respond to oral questions.
Some time after they receive the written questions they will be asked to
return to the Commons to give their answers.
Acknowledging that the threat of possible legal proceedings against the
Maxwells provoked legitimate concerns over the citizen's right to stay
silent, Mr Frank Field, chairman of the select committee, said he believed
the decision addressed the problem of witnesses' fears of incriminating
themselves.
The committee was not prepared to make itself vulnerable to public criticism
for failing to probe the MGN pension fund at a time when it might soon be
unable to pay its beneficiaries, he added.
'We do not wish to put them in a position where they might incriminate
themselves,' Mr Field said. 'We also do not want to conduct our inquiries in
a way which lawyers for the Maxwells can claim they cannot get a fair
trial.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / Cable &amp; Wireless in talks with AT&amp;T over alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN TELEPHONE &amp; Telegraph and Cable &amp; Wireless have been discussing a
global alliance between the two telecommunications groups, but negotiators
failed to make progress in talks last week.
Executives remain hopeful that a less ambitious deal - in which AT&amp;T would
take a minority stake in Mercury Communications, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary - can
still be concluded.
One reason that agreement has yet to be finalised is that AT&amp;T is concerned
that UK telecommunications regulations may change if the Labour party wins
the general election. It is understood to be considering postponing any
action until after the election.
Another problem is that it has not been possible to agree whether an
alliance between the two groups should cover only Mercury, the whole of
Europe, or markets in other parts of the world. C&amp;W wants a wider agreement
than just the UK.
Expectations in the City that a deal is imminent, which drove C&amp;W's share
price to a record closing high of 625p last night, seem unlikely to be
fulfilled. But executives believe it is possible talks could begin again in
the next few weeks.
The central element of any deal would be the acquisition of part of Mercury
 -perhaps a quarter to a third for around Pounds 1bn - by AT&amp;T. The US group
would also agree to invest in Mercury to build it up into a more formidable
competitor for British Telecom.
One of the main attractions to AT&amp;T of any deal would be the prospect of
being able to operate a telephone service on both sides of the Atlantic,
instead of having to hand over most of its UK calls to BT in the
mid-Atlantic.
Such a move, though, would probably be viewed as threatening by BT which
earns more than Pounds 100m in annual profits on transatlantic calls.
BT might therefore feel it had to respond by linking up with one of AT&amp;T's
main rivals in the US, such as MCI, so that it could also operate on both
sides of the ocean.
The negotiations between AT&amp;T and C&amp;W, which have been taking place in both
the US and the UK since last September, have been complicated by regulatory
considerations.
The UK government still holds a 'golden share' in C&amp;W preventing any single
share-holder owning more than 15 per cent of the company.

FT  16 JAN 92 / ABP hit by property provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED British Ports Holdings, the UK's biggest ports group since
privatisation in 1983, said that provisions on its property portfolio had
wiped out the group's profits in the second half of last year.
The continuing deterioration of the British property market caused the group
to review the portfolio of Grosvenor Square Properties, its wholly-owned
subsidiary, and make provisions against the cost of developments completed
and in progress at the end of 1991.
ABP said these exceptional provisions were likely to absorb most, if not
all, of the profits achieved within the group's other businesses during the
second half of 1991, so full-year pre-tax profits were likely to be little
different from the Pounds 31.7m achieved in the first half.
The group said income from the group's port and transport business and from
investment properties continued to be satisfactory, and directors expected
they would be able at least to maintain the final dividend of 4.5p per
share.
ABP's shares fell 4p to 319p yesterday, having fallen more than 40p last
week on speculation of provisions and write-downs on property.
The group said it had organised a revaluation of the investment portfolio of
Grosvenor Square Properties, comprising three shopping centres transferred
from the development portfolio during 1990 and some other income-producing
properties transferred from the development portfolio during the second half
of last year.
The ports group inherited considerable property assets at the time of
privatisation and extended further into property when it bought the
USM-quoted Grosvenor Square Properties for Pounds 15m in 1987. At the peak
of the property boom, more than half of the group's profits came from the
property side.
ABP sold its largest development, Aldwych House, in June for Pounds 75.2m,
but the company still has completed developments worth about Pounds 200m on
its books.
ABP said its balance sheet remained strong, with net borrowings at the
year-end of Pounds 335m, a reduction of Pounds 60m since the previous year.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Wakeham intervenes in British Gas row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT stepped into the row between British Gas and its regulators
yesterday, heading off a far-reaching investigation by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission that had threatened to cast a shadow over the industry
for most of this year.
The intervention by Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, in the row between
British Gas, its regulator Ofgas and the Office of Fair Trading preserves
his ambition of encouraging more competition in gas supply without causing
upheaval in the industry.
Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, appealed to Mr Wakeham after failing
to get assurances he wanted from Of-gas on the company's room for manoeuvre
on domestic prices. The government's action enabled British Gas to climb
down from conditions it had attached to its agreement with the OFT to halve
its share of the industrial gas market and hive off its pipeline division.
Mr Wakeham assured British Gas that, in light of those changes to its
industrial business, Ofgas would review a tough new pricing formula for
domestic customers which is due to come into force in April.
'I am very pleased that the secretary of state will effectively use his good
offices with the regulator,' Mr Evans said yesterday. He said this meant the
company could appeal to the government if Ofgas failed to make the required
adjustments to the pricing formula.
However, Ofgas said yesterday that 'there can be no question of prices in
the tariff (domestic) sector increasing as a result of developments in the
industrial market'.
In talks leading up to yesterday's agreement's British Gas displayed its
distrust of Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, by asking for the
MMC to arbitrate in any dispute over pricing between them. The company says
Mr Wakeham's assurances now make this unnecessary.
Ofgas objects to what it sees as British Gas's aim to raise customer prices
to offset losses resulting from cuts in its industrial business.
The OFT had threatened to refer the company to the MMC unless it dropped the
conditions attached to its agreement on cutting its industrial market share
by today.
The details of British Gas's undertakings with the OFT must now be worked
out. As part of its agreement, British Gas must auction off large amounts of
gas to competitors and separate its pipeline system into a different
com-pany.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Work smoking bans set to spread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS will have to provide separate no-smoking rest areas from the end
of the year or ban smoking in rest rooms altogether under rules being
brought in to comply with a European health and safety directive.
Pregnant women and nursing mothers will also, for the first time, have to be
provided with their own separate rest facilities at work under the
regulations.
An increasing number of organisations are moving towards workplace smoking
bans. These regulations could speed the process as employers decide it is
simpler to outlaw smoking altogether, rather than having to find separate
rest rooms for non-smokers.
The Health and Safety Executive, which published a consultation document on
the rules yesterday, said it would not be introducing more general
restrictions on smoking at work.
The 'prescriptive' measures relating to smoking and rest areas, as well as
the rules on rest areas for pregnant women, were not in line with British
legislation but had been imposed by the EC, the health body said.
The law surrounding smoking at work remains largely untested. The decision
of an industrial tribunal in Scotland, expected today, could mean extra
complications for employers in the introduction of workplace smoking bans.
A former nursing auxiliary in Glasgow, who said she could not endure eight
hours without a cigarette, is claiming constructive dismissal after the
health authority she worked for banned smoking.
No special provision was made in the building where she worked for smokers,
and there was no time to go out to smoke during meal-breaks, the tribunal
heard.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Adviser warns of Russian power struggle threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN economic reform could be destroyed 'within weeks' if the power
struggle within the Russian leadership is not resolved in favour of the
cabinet of ministers, the chief foreign adviser to that cabinet said
yesterday.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist and architect of Poland's
recovery plan who who works closely with Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime
minister in charge of economic reform, said in an interview that 'it is fair
to say that there is a power struggle, and on it depends the success of the
reform programme'.
He blamed the Russian central bank's credit policies for the disastrous
state of Russian finances and said the bank had refused government and
International Monetary Fund officials access to its books.
'The west must understand what is happening. If the struggle is not resolved
in favour of a tight monetary policy, then the programme is in jeopardy. The
issue is very urgent - it is a matter of a few weeks,' he said.
Prof Sachs was speaking against a background of rising opposition to the
price and other reforms which began with the new year. Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, has called for the
government to resign and for President Boris Yeltsin to 'stand aside' as
head of the cabinet of ministers in order to safeguard his presidency.
At the same time, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the central bank, has
strongly criticised the western advisers, including Prof Sachs.
Prof Sachs said that 'the bank has not merely been a passive player in
issuing credit to cover the budget deficit. Over the past year it issued
hundreds of billions worth of credits to commercial banks and enterprises at
an interest rate of 6 per cent - an absurd rate at a time of high inflation
. . . Even now it has no policy on credit for this year'.
The west had so far barely supported the 'courageous actions' of the Russian
government, Prof Sachs said, adding that next week's conference in
Washington on humanitarian aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States
must be expanded to include urgent consideration of structural assistance.
'I estimate that the west must give between Dollars 15bn (Pounds 8.3bn) and
Dollars 20bn this year - to support the balance of payments and Dollars 5bn
as a stabilisation fund for rouble convertibility.'
The proposed agenda for the conference failed to take account of the
economic realities in Russia, Prof Sachs said. 'In the past year governments
and banks pulled their money out of Russia: they woke up to what was
happening and killed their credits. It means that this government has almost
no funds. It is in a desperate position.'
Although the west's recognition that Russia must be admitted quickly to the
IMF was encouraging, he said that: 'Russia will need more than the IMF could
give, and (will need such aid) before it is admitted to it. The west cannot
shelter behind the IMF and the World Bank.'
Prof Sachs dismissed the tide of complaint against the vastly increased
prices, and the taxes levied on enterprises, as 'yak yak yak'. He said: 'The
government did not cause inflation: by releasing prices it merely brought
inflation into the open - inflation which had been caused by the credit
policies of the bank.'
Leyla Boulton in Moscow writes: Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated a warning that
Russia could introduce its own currency if neighbouring Ukraine, the second
richest state, abandoned the rouble. 'We would not introduce a Russian
currency if some of the republics were not trying to outstrip us. We are
watching them and we have some information where and how Ukraine is printing
its banknotes', he said.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush hit the campaign trail in New Hampshire yesterday with
a pledge that his State of the Union address to the US Congress later this
month would include details of a comprehensive plan to reform health care.
Mr Bush, seeking to reverse the slump in his popularity, said the plan would
be part of a growth package to revive the US economy, but he vowed to avoid
'quick fix solutions' and to focus instead on long-term measures to promote
investment.
'Stay tuned,' said the president during his whirlwind one-day trip to the
state where he faces a critical first primary election test on February 18.
Mr Bush had hoped to defer unveiling proposals for health care reform until
after the November election, but the Democrats have turned it into a big
campaign issue.
Mr Bush has been wounded by criticism that he is paying too much attention
to foreign affairs and not enough to problems at home, such as the 35m
Americans who have no health insurance.
Without offering details of his plan, Mr Bush said it would not lead to
increased federal spending on health care entitlement but would 'bring
protection' to Americans without insurance. One option believed to be under
review is a health care tax credit for lower income groups, with a means
test applied to wealthier Americans.
Mr Bush tried to respond to his critics yesterday, casting himself as a man
of the people and not the patrician portrayed by Mr Patrick Buchanan, his
Republican opponent in the New Hampshire primary.
Mr Buchanan, a former speech writer to presidents Nixon and Reagan, is a
rightwing pugilist who seems to be drawing support in this fiscally
conservative state.
During his face-to-face meetings with voters yesterday, Mr Bush ate plenty
of humble pie as he heard criticism about his handling of the economy.
Although he stressed that interest rates were low and said this would boost
the economy, he admitted he had made mistakes in forecasting an early
turnround.
'I will accept the blame,' he said, though quickly adding that 49 out of 50
blue-chip economists had also made the same mistake last year.
The economic downturn has left New Hampshire as one of the hardest-hit
states in the union. More than 50,000 jobs have been lost over the past
three years, virtually tripling the unemployment rate. Five of the top banks
have failed, corporate bankruptcies have soared and property prices are
barely two-thirds of their value in 1988, when the state was booming.
Mr Bush started the day at Pease air force base, which is scheduled for
closure with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs.
Speaking to hand-picked business leaders, who did not include any
minorities, the president played the role of local boy made good, reminding
his audience that he had gone to school in neighbouring Massachusetts and
that his summer home was in Maine.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The UK economy is in such deep recession that unusual measures to stimulate
economic activity without causing inflation need urgently to be considered
and promoted.
The principal political parties will need to come up with original ideas to
meet the public demand for fundamental new thinking.
Rather than wait for them, industrialists have been searching for a business
solution.
Construction, the fundamental economic kick-starter, is in deep stagnation.
Everything from concrete and bricks and steel to window frames, wallpaper
and lighting are, or soon will be, feeling the knock-on effects.
Architects and surveyors, electricians and plumbers have become unemployed
or underemployed and the effects are felt in the High Street.
Currently there are more than 2.5m people without work who in 1991 cost the
state more than Pounds 800m in unemployment benefits alone.
Banks, insurance companies and building societies are affected. Yet
throughout the UK, local authorities are sitting on massive balances of
funds from the sale of council houses. The total is estimated at Pounds 6bn.
Yet the Treasury will not permit more than 25 per cent of these balances to
be spent. Why not?
Every local authority has a massive repair schedule it cannot meet.
Potentially good housing stock is deteriorating. The effect on surrounding
property is bad and probably leads to other drains on the public purse in
terms of street crime and vandalism.
At the same time, many thousands of people are living in overcrowded
conditions - particularly in London - in bed and breakfast accommodation
costing many thousands of pounds a month. What other problems is the
community storing up for itself in terms of disease and violence?
If a housing repair and modernisation drive involving smaller companies as
well as the big builders were launched, there would be an immediate stimulus
to the construction industry. This would feed through to the rest of the
economy without being inflationary.
The same sort of programme could be applied to schools. Too many of them are
falling apart and cannot be upgraded for want of resources.
The lighting industry, which has a turnover of Pounds 650m and employs
17,000 people, believes the time has come to get a grip on this situation.
It is, of course, an interested party. It wants to start moving sales too.
Merely to stand back and observe a continuing run-down will not do much for
business, and may present too easy a market opportunity for future imports.
The Lighting Industry Federation would like the government to match the
funds held by the local authorities, and so give councils an incentive to
move fast to seize a share of Whitehall 'new money'. A better partnership,
long overdue, between central and local government might be established.
Everyone would like to see the back of the so-called cardboard cities which
disfigure city centres. These too could be tackled by a more active building
industry.
Blocks in inner cities that need refurbishment could be converted to single
people's accommodation, to provide, say, maximum two-year tenancies before
the occupant had to make his or her own arrangements. Much concrete, piping
and timber, and many bricks, and, yes, light fittings, would soon be needed.
This activity would create jobs and, above all, homes, and could be begun
very quickly.
Architects, surveyors, builders and plumbing and electrical contractors
would leap to respond to this challenge.
Can the politicians?

director of Arrow Plastics.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Regulator takes up the baton: The OFT's new boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg was yesterday sporting an unseasonal tan, courtesy of a
holiday in the Maldives. The idea that Sir Bryan takes holidays, especially
winter breaks on luxurious islands in the Indian Ocean, will probably come
as a surprise to the companies that have been the objects of his unrelenting
scrutiny during his seven years as director general of Oftel, the
telecommunications industry watchdog.
Sir Bryan has been the British pioneer of utility regulation. He helped to
privatise BT and then exposed it to tighter regulation and greater
competition. He has had more influence than any other individual on
regulation in electricity, gas and water, as well as telecommunications.
His influence will expand significantly in June when he takes over from Sir
Gordon Borrie as director general of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), the
most powerful post within the British system of competition policymaking and
enforcement.
Sir Bryan will be an active and inquisitive competition chief. 'My approach
will not be to assume that everything is all right,' he says. 'My attitude
will be that there is probably quite a lot to be done.'
Certainly he comes to the post with a formidable record. At Oftel he was a
proactive regulator, seeking out opportunities to promote competition rather
than merely reacting to complaints about restriction.
One of his strengths is his ability to combine a general understanding of
the economics of competition, which comes from his academic background, with
an intensely practical interest in how markets and companies function, a
product of his long experience as an accountant. BT has learned to its cost
that Sir Bryan is a formidable opponent in arcane arguments over how much
deposit a customer should be charged for a telephone, as well as the grander
arguments about how much competition is good for an industry.
Like Sir Gordon, he seems able to work effectively with Labour and
Conservative politicians. He said there would be no problems if Labour was
the next government, as there was 'quite a large measure of agreement'
between the parties on the sort of work the OFT does.
Sir Bryan, 53, a trim former marathon runner, still has healthy reserves of
the stamina and tenacity that have kept him going in his continual battles
with BT. However, the personal character of his struggle with BT is also a
clue to Sir Bryan's shortcomings.
Critics accuse him of intellectual arrogance. He is a technocrat who
believes in taking decisions behind closed doors, without much public
consultation. He has been better at making policy than ensuring tively
pursues customer complaints against BT. Most of the OFT's work is similarly
humble stuff. It spends only 8 per cent of resources considering mergers,
compared with 37.6 per cent on regulation of consumer credit agreements and
estate and 15 per cent on other humdrum consumer protection work.
Former colleagues also say that he is not a good delegator. Dealing with a
single industry, it may have been possible for Sir Bryan to keep a tight
grip on all the reins. To deal effectively with the wide range of industries
covered by the OFT - from soft drinks to financial services, gas to car
retailing - Sir Bryan will have to draw upon the expertise of others.
Sir Bryan has no firm views on whether the OFT's investigative powers or its
structure need changing. However, he will certainly have to think about a
number of issues that go to the heart of the OFT's role.
He sees no reason why specialised utility regulators should be incorporated
within the OFT at this stage, although it is possible that he may want to
bring the Monopolies and Mergers Commission within its ambit to create a
single competition authority responsible for policy, investigation and
enforcement.
One of the most controversial issues may be whether competition should
remain the guiding light of merger and regulatory policy. In the energy and
water industries, environmental considerations are becoming influential. The
government has recommended that the OFT should consider state ownership,
foreign ownership and financial gearing in considering bids. A Labour
government would seek a new balance between competition, the environment,
job protection and other factors. There is also the question of the
relationship between British policy and EC policy, which is increasingly
impinging upon national markets.
BT may be giving out a sigh of relief at Sir Bryan's departure from Oftel;
but the rest of British business had better be on its toes. He is unlikely
to be taking a long summer break.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Peace, but no plenty: The growing calm in Central America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the splendid setting of Mexico City's Chapultepec Castle, one of Latin
America's last 'dirty wars' will formally end today. The government of El
Salvador and its rebel opponents are to sign a treaty to end a 12-year civil
war that claimed 75,000 lives, most of them civilian.
Country by country, a sort of peace is reclaiming Central America. Only in
Guatemala is a civil war still being fought. Elected civilian governments
rule in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua; a decade
ago there was only one, in Costa Rica.
In the past 12 years, close to 200,000 people in the region have died
violently and 2m to 3m central Americans - as much as 15 per cent of the
population - have been displaced from their homes.
In part, these countries were victims of the Cold War. President Ronald
Reagan's secretary of state, Mr Alexander Haig, once declared that he would
'draw the line' against communism in El Salvador, a country the size of
Wales with a population of 5.1m. President Reagan himself saw the left-wing
rebels there as attempting to destabilise the whole region and moving 'chaos
and anarchy toward the American border'. The US poured more than Dollars 4bn
into El Salvador during the 1980s, one quarter of it military aid.
The end of the Cold War has sharply reduced America's fears. At the same
time, funding for the extreme left from outside the region has ebbed away,
as has its intellectual raison d'etre. The once bitterly divided isthmus is
now ruled by like-minded centre-right politicians. When they meet (which is
often) they talk about economic integration, market-based reforms and the
struggle to raise living standards to the levels of the 1970s.
Peace in El Salvador should help to reinforce this process, and reduce the
still huge influence of the military on governments in the region. It will
increase pressure on the Honduran army to cede more power to the civilian
government. Foreign attention will turn to the Guatemalan government in a
bid to force it to reach agreement with its rebels, with whom it has been
fighting for 30 years. The Nicaraguan army, still under the command of the
left-wing Sandinistas, who lost control of the government in elections in
1990, is expected likewise to be reduced in size.
Beyond its effects on the military, the peace accord reflects and reinforces
a genuine narrowing of once sharp ideological differences in Central
America. The guerrillas in El Salvador, once the hardest-line Marxists in
the region, changed their tune after witnessing the collapse of Nicaragua's
economy and its Sandinista government, and the fall of communist eastern
Europe. For the most part they now support a mixed economy; many talk
approvingly, for example, of privatisation.
The 18-month negotiations between the Salvadorean government and the rebel
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front were thus mainly over political,
rather than economic, rights: the reduction of the size of the army and
redefinition of its role, and the admission of the rebels into the national
police force, in particconcluded, Mr Abraham Rodriguez, a distinguished
Salvadorean Christian Democrat, said of the rebels' negotiating position:
'There is not one point dividing them from us.'
The traditional ruling oligarchies and the right-wing businessmen who
support them have conceded many of these political rights, in part because
of a fear that continued war would leave them behind in Latin America's rush
to open itself politically and economically.
President George Bush's pragmatic approach to Central America could hardly
contrast more with the ideological stance of his predecessor. The Bush
administration has shifted the emphasis of relations with the whole of Latin
America towards one of economic partnership. It has actively and faithfully
supported the UN-mediated negotiators in the Salvador talks.
The chief UN mediator, Mr Alvaro de Soto of Peru, hails the willingness of
the US to take a back seat in the Central America peace talks as the end of
the Monroe doctrine - the rationale for US intervention in the western
hemisphere first enunciated in 1823 by US President James Monroe.
The Mexicans, who have long been at the centre of efforts to resolve the
regional conflict, are similarly complimentary. Mr Sergio Gonzalez Galvez,
head of the Americas section in Mexico's foreign service, says Mexico has
not had a single difference with the US over the Salvador peace talks - in
marked contrast with their bitter disputes over Central America in the
1980s. 'The US,' says Mr Gonzalez Galvez, 'is convinced that actions taken
in Central America must be co-ordinated with countries like Mexico,
Venezuela and Colombia, and not alone.'
As the US withdraws from Central America, the Mexicans, and to a lesser
extent the Venezuelans, will partly fill the vacuum. After spending their
time in the 1980s proposing peace plans, they are now concentrating on
economic aid and advice. Mexico hopes to have free-trade agreements with
each of the Central American republics by 1996.
Both Venezuela and Mexico sell oil to Central America at a discount,
channelling money received into development projects in the region.
According to the Mexican Commission for Co-operation in Central America,
Mexico has signed 1,451 agreements with Central America in the past three
years, covering matters such as transport, customs clearance, education,
cultural exchanges and border issues.
The region has a long way to go to become a model of reformist zeal. Despite
the peace agreement, to be monitored by 1,000 UN observers, violence seems
unlikely to end soon. The ethnic divisions between Indians and people of
Spanish origin, the great inequalities of wealth and income, the hate
between former enemies are not going to melt away overnight.
In El Salvador, even if, as Mr Gonzalez Galvez suggests, the bulk of the
army supports the treaty, death squads - right-wing groups within the army
that killed thousands during the 1980s - may well return.
The treaty could also come unstuck in its implementation. The provisions for
handing over to the rebels the large swathes of territory they control are
messy, and reflect a last-minute compromise.
To make matters worse, the economic and social problems across the isthmus
remain huge. The war-ravaged economies of the region are heavily dependent
on exports of a few commodities such as bananas, sugar and coffee. Yearly
incomes per head of the population range from Dollars 830 in Nicaragua to
Dollars 1,800 in Costa Rica.
Two years ago, an international commission reckoned that the region would
need Dollars 2bn a year in economic assistance over five years for
reconstruction and to set in train sustained economic recovery. The
Salvadorean government has estimated that it alone needs Dollars 1.8bn over
five years for reconstruction. The World Bank is to convene a conference
within the next few months to co-ordinate foreign aid for El Salvador. But
will the money be forthcoming?
On the face of it, the expected presence in Mexico today of Mr James Baker,
the US secretary of state, and the leaders of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela
and Spain bodes well. But as Central America loses the world's attention,
total foreign aid is likely to fall. That fall will be sharper if, as some
observers fear, the US disengages from the isthmus economically as well as
politically.
The US emphasis on economic co-operation with Latin America notwithstanding,
Mr Kenneth Carter of the Council for Foreign Relations in New York says he
senses a mood in the US that Washington should 'wash its hands' of Central
American governments.
The region is no longer on anybody's front line. Economically, it carries no
great importance: the combined gross national product of the five countries
in 1990 was just over Dollars 23bn, less than that of Wales. Politically, it
may remain significant only to its Latin neighbours - whose ability to pump
in money is limited. Despite El Salvador's hope for better prospects, the
region may be forced to rely on its own limited resources, along with a
trickle of foreign investment.
For the people of Central America, the peace has been long enough in coming;
emerging from the economic and social troubles will take substantially
longer.

Wonders of Observer's in-tray, volume 17. Milton Keynes Development
Corporation, due to self-destruct after its twenty-fifth anniversary in
April, has decided to send out one last press-pack.
Here are 10 things you never wanted to know about the UK's fifteenth-biggest
city.
It has:
Europe's largest roller-skating rink. The UK's first purpose-built Japanese
boarding school. More Swedish than French firms. A life-size stegosaurus.
The first peace pagoda in the Western hemisphere. Over 15m new trees and
shrubs. Counting canals and ponds, a coastline longer than that of Jersey.
Central streets planted with plane trees which benefit from heat reflected
off pavements. A mere 15-minute car-drive from one side of the place to the
other. And 20 per cent of its residents unhappy with the way it is planned.

Columbus's voyage of discovery to America seems to have been a relatively
straightforward affair compared with the complications of establishing a
foothold for him in London half a millennium later.
Plans to erect a statue on the Thames Embankment near Lambeth Palace have
been bedevilled by controversy over his actions, which has seen him vilified
as a butcher of indians and plunderer of the environment, not least by
Harold Pinter.
Fortunately, the uproar has failed to deter the Spanish government from
agreeing to fund the project, masterminded by the Hispanic and
Luso-Brazilian Council at Canning House (president Viscount Montgomery of
Alamein).
Even so, the planners are taking no risk of further fuelling anti-Columbus
fervour ahead of the unveiling. They are keeping secret both the location of
the statue - believed to be locked up somewhere in Madrid - and the date
when it will be smuggled into Britain.

Someone, at least, feels sorry for UK chancellor Norman Lamont. The Treasury
has reported a dramatic upturn in what it rather quaintly terms 'voluntary
donations' to the exchequer's coffers.
Good citizens, perhaps worried about the impact of the recession on the
nation's finances, sent unsolicited contributions totalling Pounds 147,012
and 95 pence to the Treasury in the 12 months to October. That compared with
a meagre Pounds 2,587 and 50 pence in the previous year.
Some unkind onlookers at Westminster were last night pointing out that the
surge in generosity coincided almost to the month with Margaret Thatcher's
departure. But they had perhaps forgotten that in her first year of office
such donations reached a record of over Pounds 310,000.
So perhaps now it is Lamont's baleful countenance which is pulling in the
cheques. He would not mind a few more to pay for those pre-election tax
cuts.

Meanwhile British Alcan's recycling plant in nearby Warrington is evidently
in danger of being wound up because it can't get enough cans. The reason is
that the native Brits are unusually resistant to the environment-friendly
habit of saving their drinks-tins after swallowing the contents, preferring
to throw them away.
The plant plans to stave off liquidation by importing a billion used cans a
year from North America, where 60 per cent of citizens save their
drinks-tins for recycling as against a mere 10 in the UK.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Observer: New fair trader
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Britain is more competitive than it was 16 years ago, you can thank Sir
Gordon Borrie.
When he took over from John Methven, the first director general of fair
trading, Shirley Williams was running the department of prices and consumer
protection, and he has had over a dozen different political bosses since
then. Amid the whirligig of the UK's sometimes erratic competition policy,
Borrie has been the one constant factor.
Although the 60-year-old law professor was appointed by an interventionist
Labour government, he has keen political antennae as well as a robust
intellect which have served him well. He gives the impression of being
impervious to pressure, yet has been able to adjust his policies to the
political mood of the day.
During his term, the job of director general of fair trading has grown in
importance. This may be partly due to the fact that under Margaret
Thatcher's free-market regime, politicians did not want to be seen to be
interfering. But it also reflects Borrie's own distinct contribution.
All the same, he had been doing the job for too long. After 16 years of
dealing with civil servants, even the strongest personality is liable to
start acting like one. Promoting Sir Bryan Carsberg makes obvious sense. He
has been the telecom watchdog for long enough and also needed a change.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Leading Article: The future of Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S, the insurance market, is an organisation built on business
structures that pre-date the industrial revolution. Yesterday, a task force
set up to investigate Lloyd's workings and prospects - the fourth such
report in two decades - offered an escape into the modern world. It may be
too late.
Consider the story the task force's report tells, with admirable clarity and
force. Lloyd's has been losing market share for years. Its geared capital
structure heightens its members' vulnerability to periods of loss, which
have become more deadly as the insurance industry's cycle oscillates ever
wider. Its managing agents pay themselves too much, without enough exposure
to market forces. Its costs exploded in the 1980s, at the same time as it
sucked in large amounts of excess capital. Too much of that capital came
from new members who did not possess enough personal wealth to cope with the
risks.
Lloyd's cannot predict its liability to US damage claims, which may continue
rising uncontrollably. Half its members are locked into 'open years', past
trading periods that carry an open-ended exposure to unpredictably rising
losses. Angry members are suing each other and Lloyd's itself. Its principal
asset, a sterling international reputation, is threatened by those lawsuits
and by growing concern over its future capital stability.
In short, Lloyd's is in crisis. In response, the task force offers a curious
mixture of short-term conservatism and long-term radicalism. This may be the
right prescription for the market as a whole but it offers little
consolation to Names seeking a way out of the errors of the past. Indeed, by
recommending that Names' bank guarantees always be called in, regardless of
the underlying security, it has increased the likelihood that the worst-hit
Names will lose their homes.
Afflicted
The task force has firmly rejected any retrospective sharing-out of the
losses of the past few years, despite the evidence that they have fallen
disproportionately on a relatively small number of Names. Yesterday Mr David
Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, offered afflicted Names his sympathy, but
little else.
In the short-term, the task force proposes a sensible scheme for capping
future losses, at a level still high enough to inflict pain, but probably
low enough to protect against devastation. Its other short-term
recommendations are similarly level-headed, although one of them - the
strengthening of Names' rights - is no more than a basic code of fair
dealing. After three centuries, Lloyd's should not need a task force to
teach it such elementary principles.
Radical vision
In the longer term, the report offers a much more radical vision. Although
it preserves the principle of unlimited liability - above all, for tax
reasons - most individual Names would end up as participants in what amounts
to little more than a tax-advantaged, mildly risky unit trust. A smaller
number of truly wealthy individuals, 'Super-Names', would continue business
as before, but a growing proportion of the market's capacity would be
provided by insurance company subsidiaries. Syndicate places would be bought
and sold, like securities. Costs would shrink by 30 per cent; many jobs
would go.
This vision has much to recommend it. Unlike many blueprints for reform, the
report offers a way to get from here to there with minimal disruption. Yet
events may conspire against its successful achievement. Much hangs on the
trading year in progress. If this year is healthily profitable for the first
time in half a decade, Names who are thinking of leaving will grit their
teeth and carry on. Lloyd's capital will stabilise, and its prospects of
achieving the profitable growth on which the task force pins its hopes will
greatly strengthen.
If this year goes badly, the flight of Names will accelerate, and Lloyd's
prospects of maintaining its place in the world insurance industry will
vanish. The task force report is timely and welcome; but the underwriting
experience of 1992 may prove more important.

FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE (18) Odeon West End
DERSU UZALA (U) ICA
'Frankie And Johnny were lovers, Frankie and Johnny . . .' And there memory
fails me. What else were Frankie and Johnny? What else did they do in their
short but chart-topping lives?
According to Frankie And Johnny the film, their pop song fame created the
coup de foudre conditions whereby Al Pacino as a short-order cook called
Johnny met and fell in love with Michelle Pfeiffer as a plain (sic) waitress
called Frankie. The scene is a Brooklyn greasy spooner called the Apollo
Cafe. Here hamburgers and eggs-n-fries and patty melts keep whizzing past
director Garry Marshall's camera as if to show that two hearts in love had
better get a move on if their arteries are not to clog up first with
saturated fats.
Meanwhile down in the Deep South in Mississippi Masala, directed by Mira
Nair of Salaam Bombay, two more hearts try to interlock in the face of
difficulties. Mina (Sarita Choudhury), an Indian girl from Uganda, loves
Demetrius (Denzel Washington), a black carpet cleaner from Greenwood,
Mississippi. But tribal factionalism is rife in the South, even among
immigrant brethren. So a one-night passion in a motel brings the young
couple's dynastic worlds crashing around them. Aunts and uncles throw fits
and brothers and cousins throw fists.
Each of these love stories sets its alarm clock by the 'two hours' traffic'
(give or take five minutes) of Shakespeare's influential Romeo And Juliet.
But while this is a short time in which to watch passions flare and clans
clash in old Verona, it seems like forever when watching trumped-up screen
romances where Love's Tragic Obstacle, hereinafter referred to as LTO, seems
either non-existent (Frankie And Johnny) or politically contrived
(Mississippi Masala).
Hollywood - meaning Frankie And Johnny - specialises in invisible LTOs. As a
critic you have to hit yourself over the head with your press handout to
remind yourself that Michelle Pfeiffer is meant to be unattractive; hence
the hesitancy and 'last chance' element in her romance with Mr Pacino. For
the poor girl, we are told, has not had a serious date in three years. (In
Terrence McNally's original stage play Frankie was played more plausibly by
pudgy Kathy Bates of Misery).
So please ignore Pfeiffer's Gene Tierney bone structure and perfect lips and
concentrate on her hair. This has been made telegraphically dowdy. Except
when she curls it for a mid-movie night out and looks fit to slay le tout
Brooklyn. For this occasion her gay flatmate also picks out for her the One
Wearable Frock in her wardrobe, another slayer of course, hereinafter
referred to as the OWF. But love is blind. Peering through the New York
night or through the Apollo Cafe steam as he swings his big cucumber
chopper, Mr Pacino, acting with a charm far beyond the call of duty, sees
only an ugly duckling awaiting his transformative kiss.
Of course the OWF helps to overcome the LTO - except that we keep forgetting
what the LTO is, having been socked between the eyes by the form-fitting OWF
 -and Frankie and Johnny end up effecting the destined emotional merger.
The film, I may have indicated by now, is almost completely dotty. When not
focusing on Mr P and Miss P, director Marshall (late of Pretty Woman) whirs
around the cafe taking in such only-in-a-movie lovables as owner Hector 'I
breeng you all the way from Greece' Elizondo and his wife; easy-lay waitress
Kate Nelligan, plus heart of gold; and assorted wacky customers. And just
when you think sentimental folly can go no further, we have Mr Marshall's
one bid for stylistic virtuosity. This is a tender-talking street scene
between Pacino and Pfeiffer in which the couple's words sonically dissolve
into music while a florist's lorry behind them opens up to reveal a million
flowers. Oohh. Aahhh.
Mississippi Masala is, as one would expect from the British-produced item in
the week's romantic twin-pack, at once more serious and less fun. No
Hollywood schmaltz, no peak-condition screen goddesses playing plain Janes.
The LTO is racial bigotry and OWF stands not for One Wearable Frock but for
Only Way Forward. The OWF in the world today, as Sir Richard Attenborough
has so often told us, is for creeds and colours to unite. And here is Sir
R's very own Cry Freedom star Denzel Washington playing the nice black boy
who will rescue our Ugandan-Indian heroine from the
coloureds-versus-coloureds prejudice of his and her families.
A running joke is provided for American audiences, who need of course to be
told what an Indian is. So people keep saying 'Send them back to the
reservations' and Mr Washington keeps saying 'How many times I got to tell
you, they're not that sort of Indians.' And so the long day wears on.
Unlike Salaam Bombay, Mira Nair's new film is painfully alphabetical in its
guide to modern-day race attitudes and painfully contrived in the way it
routes its central romance through the appropriate stations of bigotry. In
Sooni Taraporevala's screenplay the message clearly took shape first, the
plot and the people second: always an error in priorities.
The week gets worse, I fear. Little Man Tate is the directing debut of
actress Jodie Foster. She also stars as the mother of an infant prodigy
(Adam Hann-Byrd) who could read at one, write poetry at four and play the
piano at competition level at six.
We meet him at seven, which should be about drinks time in a life as
hard-working as this. But despite Miss F's profession as a cocktail waitress
 -somewhere in Chinatown to judge by the Shanghai Lili dress she wears to
and from work - the boy is a goody two-shoes and so, alas, is the film. Like
a television problem-of-the-week movie, it slaloms between triumph and
tragedy, plinked out with piano music and with lines like 'Oh, what have I
done?'
This last is uttered by Dianne Wiest as the boy's unthinkingly cerebral
teacher-guardian. An ex-prodigy herself, she is America's answer to a
Hampstead intellectual. She feeds Fred macrobiotic drinks (he throws up),
pushes him into university ten years before his time (he is miserable) and
is then surprised that she has a crisis on her hands.
Happily - for Fred, that is, we the audience being too numbed to care - Miss
Foster rushes into the waiting emotional vacuum in the last scene and clasps
the boy to her bosom. The boy, still the only sensible presence in the film,
looks as intelligently frightened as he has throughout. Like us he seems to
be thinking: Why are two Oscar-winning actresses running around inside this
stalled vehicle trying to make it move by footwork alone? Scott Frank of
Dead Again wrote the script; the video is due out later this year; you may
wait.
Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is the latest and we are assured the last
visit from Old Pizza-Face. I have a dreadful feeling that I enjoyed this
film. For 90 minutes I was in the presence of a ghoulish janitor who, if he
ever met an infant prodigy, would know what to do with him.
This adventures climaxes with a 3D sequence in which various creatures come
out from the screen and dip their toes in your 7-Ups. You need to don the
cardboard glasses, which I perched precariously on my spectacles, but it is
only for ten minutes. Prior to this it is a walpurgisnacht for special
effects and the plot bravely tries to keep up.
I shall miss Freddy Krueger, played here with even more relish than usual,
not to mention more pizza toppings, by Robert Englund.
Finally, one from the arthouse. Kurosawa's 17-year-old Dersu Uzala, sombre
and resplendent, unfurls at the ICA. Made in Siberia, this tale of snowbound
friendship between a Russian explorer and a peasant has a rough majesty that
keeps out sentimentality and an epic humanism that never keeps out humour.
Do not wait for the video.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Technology: Barnacles forced to jump ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a summer's night in 1988 a fireball engulfed one the largest oil
platforms in the North Sea, the Piper Alpha, killing 167 workers and
throwing burning metal and spouts of fire and smoke into the sky.
The heat from the blaze was so intense that the MSV Tharos, the firefighting
vessel assigned to the rig, was forced out of the area.
Survivors of the disaster condemned the reaction of the Tharos, a ship built
on the advice of Red Adair, for failing to turn its high-powered hoses on
the rig.
Research scientists now claim Tharos was ineffective on the disaster night
because its cooling systems were so clogged with marine organisms that it
could not develop full power in its engines and firefighting equipment.
The organisms - ranging from barnacles and mussels to microscopic bacteria -
flourish in the seawater taken on-board ships through cooling pipes below
the waterline.
On the Tharos and other vessels 'fouling' by such organisms has been blamed
for blocking pipes and jamming valves, causing serious corrosion and leading
to a loss of power.
Concerned at criticism of the Tharos, the owners, Occidental, turned to
scientists at the University of Sheffield who have pioneered a system which
prevents the build-up of marine organisms in ocean-going vessels.
Occidental, whose North Sea assets have since been sold to the Anglo-French
joint venture Elf Enterprise, abandoned the old anti-fouling system on its
firefighting ship and installed equipment developed by Biofouling and
Corrosion Control (BFCC), a company which was set up by academics in
Sheffield under a technology transfer scheme.
Led by Brent Knox-Holmes, the BFCC team discovered that they could nearly
eliminate fouling in pipes by creating an electrolysis in the sea water
using a metal oxide electrode producing chlorine and a copper electrode
producing copper ions.
The current from the metal oxide electrode converts the sodium chloride  -
or salt - in seawater into chlorine, which deters marine organisms.
The scientists found the chlorine acted in synergy with copper ions from the
other electrode to disrupt any further settlement of algae or molluscs.
In the past, fouling was controlled by either dousing pipes with large
amounts of sodium hypochlorite - a hazardous chemical not easily stored at
sea - or dissolving copper directly into the water, an expensive and
environmentally damaging solution.
Following commercial tests at laboratories in the UK and US, the BFCC system
has been adopted by AP Moller, the Danish shipping line, which has fitted 21
vessels with the new copper-chlorine treatment. According to Knox-Holmes,
the Danes were attracted by the low environmental impact and reduced
maintenance costs of BFCC.
He claims the BFCC system is 90 per cent more efficient than dousing with
sodium hypochlorite and 80 per cent better than using copper on its own.
His arguments have convinced not only the environmentally-aware
Scandinavians (Fred Olsen Line and J Lauritzen Shipping are using BFCC too),
but also industrial concerns such as Amoco and Conoco.
Orders from the two oil exploration companies have marked the successful
move from anti-fouling on ships to other applications. Amoco has fitted BFCC
equipment on four gas platforms, while Conoco uses the system on three oil
rigs.
With patents awarded in Britain and the US, and others pending in the Far
East, the academics at BFCC are now looking at ways of adapting their system
for power stations, desalination plants and fresh water use.
'We are setting new standards for biofouling control', says Knox-Holmes.
'Had the MSV Tharos had our system installed at the time of Piper Alpha, it
might have developed full power to hose down the rig,' he adds. 'Our system
is not just cleaner but safer.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / Technology: Pen is mightier than the board - Computers
without keys are proving their worth in business and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many businesses the laptop computer represents the latest in blue-sky
technology - of a piece with nuclear fusion or rocket research. No so at the
London &amp; Edinburgh Insurance Group, where the most sophisticated laptops are
already been edged towards the door.
They look set to be ousted by pen-based computers, electronic tablets
reminiscent of a Victorian school slate, complete with a stylus or 'pen'.
The insurance company is using them for assessing the damage claims made by
garages for the repair of crashed vehicles. 'We hope generally to save time
and money,' says Clive Fletcher, claims director at London &amp; Edinburgh.
At the moment when London &amp; Edinburgh engineers visit the repair centre they
take a laptop computer and a sheaf of report forms which represent the
vehicle diagrammatically in an exploded form. The assessor notes the
sections of the damaged vehicle which need replacing and marks sections on
the report forms.
Code numbers referring to each part are then typed into the laptop and the
data are sent over a communications link to a mainframe computer belonging
to Audatex, the Watford-based vehicle damage assessment company. The
mainframe calculates the cost of parts and repairs, even down to items such
as whether the paintwork is matt or metallic. This repair cost is then sent
back to the laptop.
The time-consuming part of the operation is transferring the data from the
worksheets into the laptop. Geoffrey Sharp, chief staff motor engineer at
London &amp; Edinburgh, hopes the pen-based machines will do away with that
duplication. 'We're engineers and although we've taken to keyboard skills
quite well, we're still not that quick at it.'
Instead of the worksheets, the trials have put Gridpad pen-based machines,
from Victor Technologies, part of the Tandy group, into the hands of the
assessors. Displayed on the screen are the expanded vehicle diagrams. But by
touching individual components of the car on the screen with the pen, the
machine automatically records the parts that need replacing. That data can
then be sent over the communications line directly from the hand-held
machine.
Sharp believes that the drawbacks in the system are more with the software
than the hardware - London &amp; Edinburgh is looking at systems from both Grid
and the US computer company NCR. In particular, it has proven impractical to
put diagrammatic descriptions of every car on the market on to the Audatex
software.
Each expanded diagram takes up about 700 kilobytes of memory, says Alex
Leonard, managing director of Audatex. Audatex is now supporting 32 vehicle
models on the Gridpad, which includes more than 1,100 derivatives and
accounts for about two thirds of the cars on UK roads.
But, says Leonard, repairers should choose about 15 of the cars that they
repair most frequently and keep copies of the appropriate diagram on floppy
discs. 'For example, a Porsche dealer is unlikely to want to repair a Ford,'
he says.
Bill Clough, president of Microslate, the Montreal-based pen computer maker,
believes the only answer to memory limitation is to use CD-Roms (compact
disc read only memory). Then when an accident assessor visits, say, a Ford
garage he or she could insert the Ford disc, and replace that with a Toyota
disc if visiting a Toyota repair centre.
In North America Microslate is targeting blue-collar workers with its pen
computer - delivery men, warehouse overseers, or retail floor staff. 'This
is because in the US the white-collar market is 95 per cent saturated with
computer technology,' says Clough. 'The blue-collar workforce is only 11 per
cent saturated.'
In Europe manufacturers take a different view, says Alasdair Macgregor, UK
marketing manager for workstation systems at NCR. 'Initially we're aiming at
the mobile white-collar worker. That is where most corporations can get the
best return on their investment.' Included on Macgregor's list of
professions, which he describes as 'very, very, very varied' are engineers,
insurance personnel, doctors and even architects.
One software developer working with NCR to produce a package for architects
and surveyors is SurvSoft, of Weston-Super-Mare. The company expects to have
a system on the market before the middle of this year to aid surveyors when
they are called in to refurbish buildings.
The SurvSoft software, now in the final testing stage, contains a visual
collection of building components - walls, floors, ceilings, wiring and so
on. By touching the appropriate component with the pen, the surveyor can put
them together to give an accurate representation of the building in what
Pitman calls 'two and a half D' - the height, length and depth are included
but the diagram has no true perspective. The appropriate measurements are
inserted by calling up a calculator pad on the screen and then indicating
the appropriate figures.
Pitman points out that at Pounds 4,500 for the hardware and software
combination the equipment costs about the same as surveying of a high-street
premises. 'As it doubles the speed of the survey we believe it pays for
itself after just two surveys,' he says.
Such applications could speed the acceptance of pen-based systems, says
Chris Fell, an analyst at information technology research group Dataquest.
'It's an applications- driven market,' says Fell.
'In the past company X has come out with a wonderful new box and people have
bought it. That is no longer the case. Now people see they can get by with
all the equipment they've got and that is one reason why we have seen a fall
in the personal computer market,' he adds.
The software developed by SurvSoft relies on the surveyor only to use the
pen to highlight pictures and figures - no keyboard is needed, nor does the
surveyor have to write information on the pad. Fell refers to this category
of machines as pen and notebooks, and believes this will be the first stage
in the development of the technology.
The second stage will be true 'slates' on to which the user can scribble
words which the system will be able to recognise. Fell predicts it will be
1994 before such systems become reliable enough to find widespread
acceptance. However some small handwriting recognition elements are already
proving useful.
A further factor which could inhibit the growth of the market is the choice
of operating system for the pen systems. SurvSoft, for example, uses
'windows' software, enabling the software developer to put pictures or
'icons' on the screen. This approach is being pushed by Microsoft with its
Pen Windows adaptation of the popular Windows software environment.
Although this will enable users to adapt Windows applications for use on
pen-based systems, many believe its lifespan will be limited because it is
merely the adaption of a desk-top operating system for use with a hand-held
machine.
More promising in the longer-term, believes Fell, is the Penpoint operating
system developed by Go, the California start-up company, specifically for
pen-based portables.
Whatever the outcome, many believe that the emerging pen technology could be
the next revolution in computing. 'I think this is a piece of technology
which is really here to say,' says London &amp; Edinburgh's Fletcher. 'Not just
in our industry but in many others as well.'

MR Kevin Maxwell and his brother Ian are to be given a second opportunity to
answer MPs' questions about missing pension funds from their late father's
companies.
The Commons social security committee met in private yesterday and decided
to put questions to the Maxwells in writing. The brothers will be asked to
reappear before the committee to give their answers in public.
On Monday, Mr George Carman QC, counsel for Mr Kevin Maxwell, said he was
prepared to answer some questions in writing, provided the answers were not
passed on to the Serious Fraud Office.

EC FUNDS: The political impartiality of Mr Bruce Millan, the EC Commissioner
for regional policy, was questioned by Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and
industry minister, in the Commons yesterday.
He accused Mr Millan, a former Labour cabinet minister, of holding back
Pounds 109m in EC funds intended to benefit coalfield communities in
Britain.
The minister claimed Mr Millan chose to withhold only grants due to Britain
because of arrangements to ensure that the level of public expenditure was
determined at Westminster and not in Brussels.
*****
COAL INDUSTRY: The coal industry bill completed its Commons passage
yesterday as Labour renewed charges that safety standards in Britain's mines
were being jeopardised to facilitate privatisation.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, urged ministers to encourage
overseas mining industries to bring standards up to British levels.
*****
GREEN PARTY: Ms Jean Lambert and Dr Richard Lawson have been elected as the
Green party's two principal speakers.
Their election follows a decision taken at last September's conference to
replace the 25-member party council with an 11-member executive. Both
principal speakers will sit on the executive as non-voting members.

AGRICULTURE: Spending to encourage farmers to use more environmentally
friendly methods of cultivation to preserve the best of the English
countryside is to be increased by Pounds 52m a year, Mr John Gummer,
agriculture minister, told the Commons yesterday.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Officials aware of uses for Iraqi
gun, MPs told - Trade and industry committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and US officials were told about the military uses of the Iraqi
supergun project before parts were delivered to Saddam Hussein's regime, the
project manager told MPs yesterday.
Dr Christopher Cowley said in written evidence to the Commons trade and
industry committee that Dr Gerald Bull, the inventor of the 'supergun', had
told British intelligence contacts about his work with Iraq in 1988.
He also claimed that in the same year Space Research Corporation, Dr Bull's
company, informed the US State Department about the project, which included
the design of a 210mm self-propelled gun, 'ballistic programmes', and the
supergun known as Project Babylon.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the claims
appeared to be at variance with previous official statements made to the
committee by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Brown said last night: 'I am writing to the prime minister to demand an
urgent statement which makes clear exactly who knew what and when in
government about the export of supergun parts to Iraq, and whether, despite
an arms embargo and all previous statements to the contrary, the government
did indeed know that British exports were building up Saddam Hussein's
military machine.'
There was no response yesterday from Downing Street or the US State
Department.
The DTI said it had no comment but was willing to answer any further
questions from the committee.
In written evidence to the committee, Dr Cowley said that Dr Bull had openly
discussed his security contacts within International Military Services, a
government defence sales company, Rothschilds Bank, and the defence sales
department of Midland Bank.
He told the committee that he had been at a dinner in Baghdad with Dr Bull
and a senior official of Midland Bank in June 1988. Midland had secured most
of the British contracts with Iraq at that time, he said.
Midland said last night that it was a matter of record that the bank had led
a number of ECGD-backed credits to Iraq for the supply of goods and services
and pharmaceuticals.
It also denied financing any of the supergun contracts.
Dr Cowley, who was at one point arrested by UK customs officials and accused
of illegal arms exports - charges that were subsequently dropped - told the
committee that it had been Downing Street that decided that he should be
detained in jail after his arrest, although previously UK customs had
indicated to him that he was free to leave.
He admitted being aware that SRC had deceived Sheffield Forgemasters, the
company that made the barrels for the supergun, when it said that the
sections of the pipe were for the petrochemical industry.
He insisted that the Supergun programme itself was for launching a satellite
and had no military aims, An Iraqi official, he said, had negotiated with
Saudi Arabia for test projectiles to land in its territory.
But, he said, after he left SRC in May 1989 a subsequent order for a 350mm
gun barrel had gone from Iraq to Walter Somers, of Halesowen, one of the
British contractors involved. That, he said, had been for military use.
The committee was believed to be considering recalling company and DTI
officials.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wakeham warns on electricity -
Energy committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales may be breaking
the rules of the new electricity market, Mr John Wakeham told the Commons
energy committee yesterday.
The energy secretary said that if any of the regional companies were found
to be buying electricity above market prices, they would be investigated by
the electricity watchdog, Offer.
The committee meeting, which was considering the consequences of electricity
privatisation, asked Mr Wakeham whether the many new gas-fired power
stations being built would really create more competition.
Because the regional electricity companies have equity stakes in many of the
new projects, suggested committee member Mr Peter Rost (C Erewash), they
might take their power at above market prices and then pass the cost on to
captive domestic consumers.
Mr Wakeham said the regional companies could not do that without breaking
their licences, which oblige them to buy power economically.
British Coal, he pointed out, had told an earlier meeting of the committee
that the new stations would produce power at 2.9p a unit, compared with the
2.2p cost of power from existing coal-fired stations.
If that were true, Mr Wakeham said, then Offer would have to investigate the
regional companies.
However, several regional electricity companies yesterday rejected British
Coal's figures, and the implication that their gas projects were
uncompetitive.
'It's utter rubbish,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands
Electricity, which has a stake in the big gas-fired station being built on
Teesside.
His company's power purchasing policy was not influenced by its investment
in gas stations, he said.
Those stations would be more likely to produce power at about 2.4p than
2.9p, while British Coal's 2.2p figure was unrecognisably low.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems target taxation plan -
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrats would wield the power they would have in a hung parliament
to implement policies promoting public investment but also to block Labour
tax plans for middle managers, Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday.
The Liberal Democrat leader said Labour's tax proposal would mean those with
gross earnings above Pounds 27,000 would be liable both to the 40 per cent
top rate tax and to 9 per cent national insurance contributions.
Such a 'swingeing' burden would affect the section of the workforce that
formed the 'motor' of economic growth, he said. Mr Ashdown said debate so
far in the phoney election campaign had been dominated by taxation, but the
public was more interested in investment.
He said: 'We need responsible economic management and we need to sustain
investment, particularly in education and training. Mr John Major should
make those his priority.'
In a letter to Mr Major, Mr Ashdown said the government seemed to want both
tax cuts and increased investment in public services at a time when economic
growth was zero. That could only be achieved by increased borrowing.
If any tax cuts were contemplated, they should be in VAT, Mr Ashdown added.
Under the Liberal Democrat's tax plans, National Insurance contributions
would be merged with income tax and administered by a single bureaucracy. On
incomes up to Pounds 33,000 there would be a tax rate of 34 per cent, rising
to 42 per cent for incomes up to Pounds 50,000. Over Pounds 50,000 there
would be a 50 per cent rate.
Labour also proposes a 50 per cent top rate of tax, plus nine per cent NICs,
at a so far unspecified starting point but officially described as 'well
over' Pounds 30,000.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour says 23 apply for each
Jobcentre vacancy - Employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EACH Jobcentre vacancy is being chased by 23 unemployed people, according to
the latest estimates, Labour said yesterday.
Labour renewed its attack on the government's economic record by publishing
a study of the economic performance of every constituency.
In London, it said, there were 60 unemployed people for every vacancy.
The paper, compiled by Mr Henry McLeish, an opposition employment spokesman,
points up particular pressures arising from youth unemployment and long-term
unemployment in southern England. It also illustrates the continuing
economic difficulties in the north of England, Scotland and Wales.
It gives a warning especially that London is taking on some of the
characteristics of long-term decline seen in the north of England.
The launch of the report was intended to highlight employment in advance of
today's monthly unemployment figures.
That aim was shared by the Liberal Democrats, who yesterday pledged to
intensify campaigning in the regions on the basis of their Pounds 3.3bn
scheme to increase jobs.
Labour's study uses employment and unemployment indicators to reflect
overall rates of unemployment and the changes brought by the recession. It
ranks the performance of 80 critical constituencies for Labour against
national averages.
Of the 200 constituencies performing better than average in fewer than three
of the eight indicators, 143 are held by the Tories, with almost 60 of them
likely to be key battleground seats in the election.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said the government's
emergency initiative, Employment Action, which was launched more than six
months ago, had dismally failed to live up to expectations.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, said youth unemployment in
Britain was below the EC average and long-term unemployment was at less than
half its 1986 level.
Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, emphasised the report's
value as a campaigning tool in bringing home the Tories' record to people
'many of whom are the bedrock of Tory support and who now feel betrayed by
what happened to them and their families'.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Parties divide on
reform proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR was dismissive yesterday of the task force report, but among Tory
MPs, many of whom are underwriting members, there was a cautious welcome.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's voice on the City, said Lloyd's had had the
opportunity to take a 'decisive first step' in rehabilitating its
reputation. 'That opportunity has been missed,' she said.
Labour wants Lloyd's controlled under a regime similar to that applying to
other parts of the City under the 1986 Financial Services Act, including its
provisions for compensating investors. It opposes extra tax concessions to
help soothe losses such as proposed last year by some Tory MPs.
Ministers are privately concerned about Lloyd's future, particularly in
competing with other European financial centres, but believe its management
is an internal affair. Officially, the Department of Trade and Industry
would yesterday only welcome the extent of the task force's work.
Legislation needed to implement the report's proposals would probably be
undertaken under the private-bill procedure rather than as
government-sponsored business.
Tory MPs - of whom about 50, including cabinet ministers, are members - will
watch the reform proposals carefully. In spite of widespread concern at the
extent of recent losses, most accepted that unlimited liability had to
remain an integral part of Lloyd's There was broad support, however, for the
proposed compulsory 'stop loss' scheme.
Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry
committee, said the chairman of Lloyds might be called to explain the
reforms.
Mr Ian Taylor, Tory MP for Esher, said: 'I welcome any proposals which would
lead to a return of confidence for people staying, or becoming, Lloyd's
members. Whether these proposals go far enough will need to be carefully
considered.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Strong action urged
to reduce costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRM ACTION will be needed if Lloyd's is again to deliver attractive
returns, according to the task force. The corporation lost its traditional
competitiveness in the 1980s as costs soared and productivity plummeted.
Mr David Rowland, the insurance broker who chaired the task force, wrote to
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, ahead of its recommendations: 'At
almost every level, the Lloyd's system of raising and servicing capital and
transacting business has become too costly. Expense has to be reduced
dramatically.'
Some factors driving costs up were admittedly out of the market's control -
and a turn in the insurance cycle would obviously improve ratios - but the
message conveyed by the report is straightforward.
The cause appears to be the Pounds 770m of costs in 1990 covering the
corporation, the syndicates, agency fees excluding profit commissions, and
Names' contributions to the central fund.
Those represented 13 per cent of calendar-year premiums, compared with 7 per
cent in 1982.
Three structural difficulties are identified.
One is the additional cost of regulation, which led syndicates to install
more detailed record-keeping and risk-control systems in the 1980s.
The task force believes that the cost of regulation will become less
burdensome now that those are in place.
The second is that there has been a sustained decline in productivity. The
threefold increase in the Lloyd's head count since the mid 1960s compares
with a 45 per cent rise in real premiums.
The long-term decline became most marked in the late 1980s, when cost growth
continued at a high real rate and real premiums fell.
The company sector, by comparison, appears to have improved productivity,
holding expense growth below premium growth in the 1980s.
The final issue facing the market has been lack of tight cost discipline.
That can be blamed partly on the bull market in mid decade. The absence of
keen competition between agents over fee levels and poor information were
also responsible.
The task force sets a 30 per cent overall cost reduction target. That is
consistent with a pre-tax return to Names of about 5 per cent of premium
income limits. It assumes that underwriting results and investment income in
future are in line with the 10-year average between 1979 and 1988.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Cautious optimism
abounds in clubby atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, JOHN AUTHERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY insurance professionals yesterday doubted whether the task force
recommendations would help Names already in difficulties. However, the
general reaction of professionals to the proposals was positive.
In the clubby atmosphere that has survived at Lloyd's while London's other
financial exchanges have been turned upside down, business went on as usual
while one of the biggest ever reforms was announced.
Early in the day, syndicate heads and senior officials were called to a
briefing on the proposals, leaving underlings to rely on the rumour mill for
information. 'We're waiting to read it in the papers tomorrow,' said a clerk
at one underwriting syndicate.
The welcome from those who had been briefed was cautious, as brokers,
underwriters, advisers and Names - the individuals whose wealth underpins
the market - digested the 240-page report.
'I have to admit I'm only on page 52 at the moment,' said Mr Max Lehrain,
managing director of Grimston Scott, a tax and financial adviser to Lloyd's
Names, late in the afternoon. 'But what is encouraging is to see the council
responding in a positive way.'
Mr Chris Burton, joint managing director of AJ Archer, a quoted underwriting
group, said: 'It's a very comprehensive document. My immediate reaction is,
it's a breath of fresh air for the whole marketplace. The whole concept of
the report is getting back to the commerciality of Lloyd's'
He also welcomed the importance given to the Names and enhanced links to
brokers. He did not feel the new rights for Names would make managing agency
business less attractive.
Mr Ken Carter, chief executive of insurance broker Lloyd Thompson, said:
'The report is not very radical. It is what one would have expected. The
original aim was to look at Lloyd's capital base. That has moved slightly
into the background.'
The proposal to allow Names to reinsure their 'open years' with CentreWrite,
in particular, had a lukewarm reception. 'If they can afford that, they can
probably afford the losses,' said Mr Mike Voller, Lloyd's specialist with
the accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, which advises about 1,000 Names.
Mr Mark Farrer, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents 9,500 Names - 40 per cent of the total - said the proposals for
CentreWrite 'are going to be extremely useful for Names, because nobody at
present is really prepared to assess the individual risk. I don't doubt that
what is proposed is an excellent idea.'
Brokers were generally enthusiastic. 'The instantaneous applause that David
Rowland received when he made his presentation said it all,' said Mr Alan
Colls, chairman of the Lloyd's insurance brokers committee and chairman of
Nicholson Chamberlain &amp; Colls, a Lloyd's brokerage.
Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Names, was positive
but added: 'It's done nothing to help the injured Names.' He welcomed the
report's recommendations for the future. 'For the first time in its 300-year
history, it's putting the outsiders first, and not the insiders.'
Overall, there was relief that a cap was to be placed on Names' personal
liability. 'For unlimited liability they should be getting a 25 per cent
return every year,' said one underwriter. 'They've been getting 10 per cent
and you can get that out of the stock market.'
There is discomfort, though, that losses above the new cap would be spread
around the market. 'If a Name makes a 100 per cent profit, does that mean
now that he's going to share that with everybody?' said one underwriter.
'And I don't want to pay for somebody else's bad underwriting,' he added.
Mr Reg Brown, underwriter at RE Brown, said: 'We're trying to catch up on
300 years of business. Up until now, syndicates haven't regarded themselves
as businesses.'
For all its significance in the world's insurance business, the revolution
of the 1980s appears to have touched Lloyd's little. For instance, the
number of female underwriters can be counted on one hand, although a number
are brokers.
Members insist there is no sex discrimination. 'We make a special effort to
get the ladies,' said one underwriter. 'Any one that comes within a whisker
of our box on February 14 gets a chocolate heart.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Council balks at
regulatory changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNCIL of Lloyd's, the insurance market's governing body, will not put
task force recommendations about the way the market is regulated into
effect, Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, said yesterday.
Mr Coleridge said that to alter the existing framework of regulation 'would
delay the implementation of the recommendations'.
The decision has already drawn a protest from the Association of Lloyd's
Members, the main organisation representing Lloyd's Names, which has urged
the council to review its initial reaction.
The task force says that the future success of Lloyd's will depend
increasingly on the collective reputation of the marketplace. It says:
'Increasingly, the outside world sees Lloyd's as one business organisation.'
Some business activities - such as claims handling, technology and marketing
 -can best be handled centrally, the report says, in order to achieve
economies of scale. Yet the council's need to focus on business activities
can conflict with its regulatory role.
The report says: 'While public opinion requires that some of those
responsible for regulatory policy have a degree of independence and distance
from the market . . . independence and distance are not helpful in
developing and supporting Lloyd's collective business performance.'
The task force therefore proposes that a new Lloyd's Market Board should be
set up to look after business issues. Such a board should lead the market,
promote a central business strategy and co-ordinate the provision of
centralised services. Its members would be elected by the market's
businesses and be supported by a full-time chief executive.
A regulatory council composed of nominated external members, elected
external members and working members would be responsible for regulatory
matters.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Task force calls for
abolition of rule on divestment - Accounting, management and the rights and
duties of names and agents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TASK FORCE calls for abolition of the rule obliging Lloyd's brokers sell
any majority interests in managing agents. That proposal is one of several
put forward by the task force which would require an amendment to the
Lloyd's Act 1982.
'We believe that the regulatory regime at Lloyd's is now strong enough to
provide assurance in the areas that led to the imposition of divestment,'
the task force comments.
It adds that the ownership restriction is an unnecessary curb on the
commercial freedom of Lloyd's. 'At the time it was being implemented, the
provisions of the Lloyd's Act 1982 contrasted sharply with the opposite
action in the Stock Exchange,' the task force comments.
Expectations of a call to move from a three-year to a one-year accounting
system at Lloyd's have been dashed by the task force, even though more than
two thirds of submissions to it from operators in the market favoured the
change.
The task force maintains that a one-year basis would lead to inaccuracy and
would be inconsistent with the need to preserve equity between Names on
successive years of account.
It says also that many competitors to Lloyd's in the company market in
specialised insurance sectors - such as marine, aviation, transport and
treaty reinsurance - use a two-year or three-year accounting system.
The task force says more information is needed about the development of an
account. It recommends publication of a global profit forecast after 24
months of the account, and publication of a syndicate's solvency position in
the annual accounts.
One Lloyd's handicap in the past has been its inability to respond rapidly
to rises in insurance rates. The report suggests that Names should be
allowed to increase the amount of insurance they underwrite in mid year
rather than only at the end of the year.
The report says syndicates should be allowed to increase the business they
write by making more use of reinsurance from outside the market. Lloyd's
syndicates make extensive use of reinsurance. In 1988, they ceded 37 per
cent of gross premiums to reinsurers.
The proposal would in effect allow syndicates to co-operate with outside
reinsurers to do more business without increasing their capital base. The
report adds that consortium arrangements - where Lloyd's syndicates and
companies co-insure certain risks - should be encouraged.
Other recommendations:
Improved accessibility of Names' capital.
Close monitoring of market liquidity.
Individuals to be allowed to apply to become Names at any point during the
year.
Managing agents to be able to state in mid year that they do not foresee a
syndicate utilising total capacity for that year and to reduce each Name's
line pro rata.
Encouraging consortium arrangements between syndicates and companies, with
Names benefiting from any fees or commissions received from the consortium.
Global profit forecasts for the market as a whole should be published by the
corporation after 24 months of the account.
The council, with professional advisers, to consider proposals to permit
explicit discounting of old-year liabilities.
More centralised management of old-year claims, and a working party to
develop a detailed proposal for an old-year claims centre of excellence.
Investigations by the council into any mergers that would result in a
managing or member's agent controlling more than 25 per cent of capacity,
with a view to preventing any merger not in the interests of Lloyd's.
Endorsement of profit commission 'clawback' in the event of prior-year
deterioration.
A working party to develop detailed 'best practice' guidelines to establish
tighter budgetary discipline, more openly negotiated fees and expenses, and
greater disclosure.
An independent chairman for the agent review body.
Guidelines for competence in the agency system, similar to those for new
active underwriters, to be developed by the Lloyd's Underwriting Agencies
Association and the corporation.
Names should be given rights akin to those enjoyed by shareholders,
including the right to continuing participation in a syndicate, the right to
ask the council to replace the managing agent, the right to approve major
syndicate transactions, the right of access to syndicate information and the
right to regular meetings of Names on a syndicate.
Reinsurance to close - the reinsurance premium paid by the Names on one year
to close their syndicate into its following year - should be calculated more
cautiously, leading to bigger reinsurance-to-close premiums, reducing
syndicates' tax bills but increasing the security of members of the
syndicate in the subsequent year.
Specific qualifications for managing and members agents.
Mandatory non-executive board members for all agents.
A review process of involvement of non-executive directors in approving
remuneration levels within the agency.
The council to endorse target expense ratios and report progress towards
reaching them.
A project to evaluate options for minimising run-off costs.
Market associations and the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers' Committee to develop
proposals to refine the broker remuneration structure to create 'a clearer
match' between broker incentives and Names' interests.
A joint initiative to assess profitability along the total
underwriter-broker chain in selected areas of business.
An investigation into the feasibility and cost of initiating a quality
management programme across key processes within the market-services area.
The council should work towards a future in which market infrastructure is
identical across the bureaux of the entire London market.
Publication of the percentage of business placed by Lloyd's brokers into the
Lloyd's market.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Fund would be financed by
levy on premium income - Cap to limit losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recommendation by the task force of a high-level cap to limit excessive
losses for Names does not abolish unlimited liability, but is a radical
modification of the principle.
The market's recent losses have highlighted the risk of bankruptcy for Names
and many submissions to the task force urged an end to unlimited liability.
The task force's proposal calls for losses to be limited to an amount
equivalent to 100 per cent of a Name's annual premium income limit. It is a
cumulative scheme covering losses over four consecutive years which together
exceed the 100 per cent limit.
The fund would be financed by a compulsory levy on all Names equivalent to
0.25 per cent of their premium income limit (the maximum amount of premiums
a Name is allowed to accept under Lloyd's rules).
Names can now pull their exposure below that limit by purchasing stop-loss
reinsurance. Unlimited liability would remain, however, because a Name would
face further losses in circumstances that 'threatened the continued
existence of the market'. If the fund could not meet calls on Names,
liability would again fall on the Names. The scheme is expected to come into
effect at the beginning of next year but will not cover losses of Names
incurred before this year.
The task force says the scheme will provide more certainty to existing Names
and make the market more attractive for individuals. 'At present a wealthy
Name's upside is limited by the maximum premium limit allowed, but the
downside is unlimited.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Names may get 'route to
leave' - Open years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPORT offers no immediate respite for the thousands of Names who are
members of syndicates with 'open years', Richard Lapper writes. Those are
accounts that cannot be closed because of uncertainty about future claims,
for example those arising from US liability business underwritten up to 40
years ago.
Nevertheless, it suggests changes that might help to improve matters and
indicates a way in which Names might be able to buy their way out.
It says Lloyd's 'must offer Names a route to leave if they so wish, albeit
at a price which fairly reflects their outstanding liabilities. Unless the
society (Lloyd's) can demonstrate that Names can resign if they wish, it
will be hard to persuade new Names to join'.
The task force says long-tail liabilities, in which claims emerge sometimes
decades after policies are written, represent 'one of the greatest problems
facing the society'.
It was unable to develop reliable estimates about the size of future claims
arising from asbestos-related diseases and environmental pollution.
Rejecting mutualisation - in which all Names would pool resources to pay for
the losses of those worst affected - the task force suggests that Lloyd's
must seek to trade out of its difficulties.
That strategy 'implies maintaining a steady pattern of profitable growth,
enabling existing Names to pay their losses from future profits while
attracting new capital to the market to participate in new business'.
It suggests that CentreWrite, the reinsurance company created by Lloyd's in
July last year, should shift its focus away from reinsuring syndicates with
open years towards reinsuring individual Names.
The task force suggests a reversal of policy on syndicates unable to close
years. Instead of pressing syndicate managers to close years, as Lloyd's
does at present, it should accept that leaving a syndicate open provides
'the most pragmatic response to grave uncertainties such as major latent
liability exposures'.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Insurance companies might
join syndicates - Long-term plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TASK force report contains three important proposals that would require
detailed changes to the Lloyd's Act or further debate. If carried out, the
introduction of limited-liability capital, the restructuring of the agency
system and the creation of a secondary market for syndicate participation
would change Lloyd's more than all the short-term reforms put together.
Limited-liability capital is seen as a sort of back-stop in case too few
Names return to the market. It would be admitted in the form of 'corporate
members', structured as authorised insurance companies, who would have to
meet very high minimum-solvency levels and size qualifications. They would
participate alongside Names on syndicates.
If corporate members - which could be owned by corporate or institutional
bodies - went into liquidation, the Lloyd's central fund would meet
outstanding liabilities on valid claims.
Significantly, the report points out that changes to the Lloyd's Act would
also offer the option of moving to a fully incorporated basis of trading if
the present capital structure failed to sustain growth.
This implicitly recognizes that Lloyd's needs to boost its profitability to
attract significant levels of corporate capital. That is certainly a key
part of the aim behind the second long-term proposal: a restructuring of the
agency system.
All individual Names would be required to spread the first Pounds 500,000 of
their premium income limit via a Members' Agent Pooling Arrangement (Mapa),
which would diversify risk more effectively than at present. Corporate
members and wealthier individuals writing business above that limit, or
'Super' Names, could have direct agreements with syndicate managers.
The members' agency system would be divided into three different functions,
performed either separately or by specialist firms. Fund managers would act
as agents for Names in respect of Mapas. Licensed advisers would advise
Super Names on agency participation and others on the choice of fund
managers. Administrative utilities would carry out administration. The
syndicate manager's role would be largely unchanged from that of today's
managing agent. Syndicate managers, moreover, could be part of wider
groupings.
Probably the most radical element is the proposal for a market in syndicate
participations. Names, in other words, would have to pay to join a
syndicate, buying capacity from a Name seeking to leave on a matched bargain
basis.
The report says the idea could resolve some of the structural difficulties
arising from the fact that syndicates are 'annual ventures' and have no
legal identity in themselves. Names' returns would no longer depend on a
single profit contribution. In addition, the returns would be based on the
appreciation or depreciation in the value of their participation.
Apart from legal obstacles, the report admits to doubts about the
feasibility of creating an efficient capital market with adequate
information and sufficient liquidity.
Increased volatility would also change the nature of Lloyd's. For those
reasons, it suggests that the case for a market in syndicates should be
re-examined in three years.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Changes are intended to
spread risks and rewards - Pooling by agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the least expected of the task force's recommendations is the
setting-up of members' agents pooling arrangements, or Mapas, to allow
agents to pool all the syndicate participations of the Names whose affairs
they handle, to spread risks and rewards more evenly, Richard Lapper writes.
The agent would pool all portfolios and allocate units in the pool to Names,
constructing a kind of unit trust, as distinct from a separate portfolio of
participations on separate syndicates for each Name.
The idea was mooted in the summer of 1990, but after extensive discussion in
the market the Lloyd's council took the decision at the beginning of last
year not to introduce it.
The task force says that was 'an unfortunate decision' and - given the
market's troubles - 'there would now be much more interest in this scheme'.
In particular, it says, a large slice of the market's losses in 1988 were
heavily concentrated among a minority of Names. 'The extreme losses of a few
Names bring not only great hardship to those Names but also considerable
damage to the reputation of the society as a whole.'
The introduction during the past year of new techniques to streamline
managing agent accounting - known as managing agent unitised accounting
(Manuac) - would make the introduction of Mapas easier and simpler. Such
techniques eliminate 'the need for managing agents to prepare syndicate
accounts for each Name.'
Under Manuac, the managing agent will declare an overall result for the
syndicate and distribute a payment to each members' agent pro rata.
The task force suggests that savings, perhaps up to Pounds 12m a year, can
be realised by the introduction of Mapas.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Evolutionary rather than
revolutionary overhaul - Proposals for reforming an antiquated business
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday presented plans to reform its antiquated
business structure.
The changes advocated by a 14-man task force advised by McKinsey, the
management consultants, entail a series of piecemeal reforms to support a
restructuring already under way as a result of the market's recent heavy
trading losses.
The emphasis is on evolutionary change rather than revolutionary overhaul.
Mr David Rowland, the Sedgwick insurance broker who chaired the task force,
said: 'All our recommendations seek to preserve and build on Lloyd's truly
distinctive strengths, and in most cases seek to improve structures that
exist today, rather than sweep them away and look for completely new
structures.'
Faced with the dilemma of reconciling the potential conflict between the
need for strong central leadership and 'the preservation of the
entrepreneurial character of the market', the task force opted for the
piecemeal approach.
At the same time, the task force says more radical changes may well be
necessary in the long term. As the market moves towards realising the vision
of its future sketched out in the task force's 240-page report, radical
changes in the way business is conducted are inevitable.
The club-like atmosphere that has dominated trading at Lloyd's for much of
its history seems finally set to disappear as professionals adapt to a more
hard-headed, business-like approach.
Initial indications are that the council, the market's governing body, will
carry out change and that yesterday's report will not, like one of its
predecessors, be largely ignored.
The Cromer Report of 1969 advocated radical changes but it was not published
and gathered dust, largely unread.
The council, the market's governing body, has accepted the bulk of the
report's 65 recommended reforms.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman of the market, said work on turning the report
into action would begin 'at once and forthwith'.
Most Names - the wealthy individuals whose wealth backs the market - will
have copies of the report by Saturday, and during February and March a
Lloyd's roadshow will travel to 32 international venues to present the
conclusions of the report and take soundings from meetings of Names.
Mr Coleridge hopes that plans to cap Names' liabilities - the most
controversial proposal - will be complete by April so that they can be in
operation for the beginning of the 1993 underwriting year. There are also
hopes at Lloyd's that members' agents pooling arrangements (Mapas), designed
to allow less well-off Names to spread risks more widely, will also be ready
for next year.
The capping proposal marks a watershed in Lloyd's 300-year history, during
which it has clung tenaciously to its principle of unlimited liability,
whereby the losses of its Names or underwriting members must be paid, even
if it means selling their personal possessions.
The principle, which stems from Lloyd's origins in the 17th century, when
wealthy merchants banded together to insure ships and their cargoes, has
been a mixed blessing. Many potential wealthier members of Lloyd's have been
dissuaded recently from joining by the prospect of personal bankruptcy.
The task force recommends that the tax advantages and other advantages of
unlimited liability are sufficient for its maintenance, but the introduction
of a cap - even at a relatively high level - radically alters its
significance.
The central fund that will bear all losses over the cap will be replenished
with a cash call from Names if it is needed, and only if the claims then
overwhelm the market as a whole will the Names bear liability. The task
force hopes the change will encourage Names to join Lloyd's - only 100 did
so last year - and help to stem the steady erosion in the market's capital
base.
'In effect, the principle has gone,' said the managing director of one
Lloyd's agency. 'Unlimited liability is now more of a symbol than anything
else.'
In the longer term, the task force's proposal to admit corporate capital
into the market opens the way to the possible dominance of Lloyd's by
limited-liability capital and the eventual disappearance of unlimited
liability as a guiding principle.
The task force acknowledges that the present tide of litigation involving
Lloyd's Names and the agents who manage their affairs might eventually
threaten the relationship between individual Names and their agents which is
one of the pivots of Lloyd's business structure. More than 2,000 Names -
about 10 per cent of the total - are currently involved in such legal
action.
In addition, if the market's profitability is insufficient to persuade
enough new Names to join Lloyd's, limited-liability capital might rapidly
become the 'predominant form of capital in the market'.
Beyond that, one of the biggest challenges faced by the task force is to
reduce costs in order to improve its competitiveness and win back its share
of the international market for specialised commercial insurance and
reinsurance which it has lost in recent years.
Mr Rowland says that the market's difficulties over the past two years have
already prompted a number of important changes, leading to a rationalisation
in the number of agencies and syndicates. Lloyd's reported its first global
losses for more than 20 years in June last year and will report even heavier
losses for 1989 and 1990. A number of syndicates have folded as a result and
many managing and members' agents have either closed or merged. In the
medium term, the market hopes that costs can be cut by 30 per cent.
Perhaps, though, the biggest challenges concern the troubles of the past.
The task force admits that the demands stemming from US asbestosis and
environmental liability claims are incalculable. It admits that the woes of
syndicates with open years - where liabilities are so uncertain that
accounts cannot be closed - are likely to worsen.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: 300 years of change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1688: First mention of Edward Lloyd's Tower Street coffee house. It moved to
Lombard Street in 1691.
1700s: Lloyd's becomes gambling den. Sample bets: survival chances of people
condemned to death.
1769: Scandal leads some underwriters to persuade waiter Thomas Fielding to
set up breakaway Lloyd's in Pope's Head Alley. The new one survives.
1771: Most important document in Lloyd's history signed. Sets up ruling
committee, which still survives, albeit with increased powers and duties.
1781: Lloyd's first constitution, The Trust Deed, written after secretary
John Bennett fails to pass on information that would have allowed
underwriters to avoid losses during Napoleon's Baltic blockade.
1838: Lloyd's home The Royal Exchange burns down. Lloyd's chairman George
Richard Robinson moves business to coffee house.
1871: Lloyd's Act is passed when underwriter AB Forwood makes Pounds 500 on
insider information that a ship, the Venezuelan, is only slightly, not
badly, damaged. Act gives sanctions under criminal law against members.
1874: Henry Hozier sets up signal stations that gave Lloyd's a virtual
monopoly on shipping information. Hozier later resigns over extravagant
expenses, spending more than Pounds 25,000 on luxurious trips around the
world.
1954: Many Names stand to be ruined by underwriter Alec Wilcox who has been
falsely accounting for years. The committee bails them out, establishing an
important precedent that qualifies unlimited liability.
1970: Cromer committee recommends that Lloyd's allows women, foreigners and
the less well-off to become Names.
1973: Sylvia Horsey becomes first woman underwriter.
1975: Body blow to Lloyd's reputation for paying without quibbling comes
when business done by underwriter Tim Sasse leaves Names liable for Dollars
40m - 63 refuse to pay and sue.
1982: Gemini, sea lion star of BBC's Animal Magic, visits Lloyd's and is
filmed at the position where her cover was underwritten.
Loch Ness monster insurance was written for a film company that wanted cover
against a real monster appearing during production.
World's largest cigar, 12 1/2 ft long and retailing at Pounds 17,933.35, was
insured for 50p premium.
Film stars covered by Lloyd's included Betty Grable and her 'million-dollar
legs'.
There are now 22,500 Names of whom 22.5 per cent are women.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Part-timers get few jobs with 'status'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOO MANY higher-status managerial and professional jobs are regarded as
being unsuitable for part-time workers, according to a Department of
Employment study published in this month's Employment Gazette.
Only 16.5 per cent of Britain's 5m part-time workers, representing 23 per
cent of employees, work in the top five occupational categories and most of
them are concentrated in education, welfare and health.
The study says: 'Without arguing that all jobs can be done on a part-time
basis, it is clear that opportunities do exist and could be increased for
both men and women.'
In some cases, it is workplace or organisational culture that makes managers
reluctant to allow higher-status part-time work. 'This may be because it
just does not fit in with preconceptions about what constitutes a proper
job,' the authors say.
The study looks at six companies that have made a special effort to attract
higher status part-timers: KP Foods, British Gas, J. Sainsbury, Barclays
Bank, the Wellcome Foundation and ICL.
The key findings are:
Higher-status part-time work is not widely available in the workforce, but
opportunities are increasing.
Some employers are breaking down traditional barriers between jobs suitable
for part-time workers and full-timers, and a range of jobs, including
managerial jobs, is available.
Employers gain by retaining skilled and experienced staff.
Employers find that higher-status employees are as committed and productive
as full-timers.
Higher-status employees confirm that. They also gain from flexible working
arrangements and find that by working part-time instead of leaving the
labour market they retain their skills and get job satisfaction.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Water improvements will need 50% charge rise, Heseltine says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WATER industry's Pounds 28bn investment programme over the next decade
amounts to Pounds 130 for every household in England and Wales and will have
to be paid for by a 50 per cent increase in water charges in real terms by
the end of the century Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, warned
yesterday.
He sought to blame the increased charges, needed to improve water quality
and the environment, on 'starvation' of investment under the Labour
government when the water industry was still in the public sector. He
accused Labour of 'hopeless confusion' over water and challenged the party
to say whether it would carry out its policy of renationalising the
industry, which was privatised under Mrs Thatcher's Conservative government.
Mr Heseltine said at a seminar held by the Water Services Association in
London: 'I think the environment will play an important part in the election
campaign.
'This government has one of the most comprehensive and effectively managed
environment programmes in any part of the world. The Labour party has a
vacuum.'
He said Labour did not seem to know what its policy was on the water
industry. The policy on renationalisation depended on who you spoke to - the
left wing said yes and the right wing said 'not yet'.
'Neither the consumer, nor the industry, nor the economy, nor the
environment would benefit from the uncertainty and indecision that Labour
would bring,' he warned.
Over the first five years of privatisation, 1990 to 1995, investment would
be double what was spent in 1974 to 1979 under a Labour government - at
least Pounds 2.7bn a year against Labour's average of Pounds 1.3bn.
Nevertheless, Mr Heseltine said water charges in Britain were among the
lowest in Europe, averaging only 43p a household a day. The French, Germans
and Italians all paid substantially more.
He claimed that the quality of drinking water and rivers in Britain compared
well with other West European na-tions.
Mr William Courtney, the chairman of Southern Water and new chairman of the
Water Services Association, said the water companies were investing a total
of Pounds 7m a day and 70 per cent of profits were being ploughed back into
new investment.
They were having to increase prices very significantly to pay for that, but
would keep them as low as possible.
Mr Heseltine's speech provoked a political row with Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's
spokeswoman on environmental protection, who said the increase in water
bills of 50 per cent would come as a shock to many on top of the 'record
increases' in prices since privatisation.
She said there had been 'shocking and outrageous' salary increases for water
company chairmen, the use of compulsory water metering 'and putting of
profits before pollution control'.
'Mr Heseltine's words are alarming in their complacency,' she said.
A party official said it remained party policy to take the water industry
back into public ownership. 'We will do it as a priority.'
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said Mr Heseltine
had not considered the effect of price increase on the elderly and low
income families. 'Water bills should be based on need, not the greed of
water bosses,' he said.
Ms Liana Stupples, Friends of the Earth water campaigner, said: 'The
Government has presided over the continued abuse of the water environment.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Grattan cuts bonuses for workers to
reduce pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRATTAN, the mail-order company, told 600 employees yesterday that it
planned to change bonus payments to reduce weekly earnings by an average of
Pounds 20, Michael Smith writes.
Although pay freezes have become increasingly common, few companies have
operated measures that have reduced pay.
Grattan, a subsidiary of Otto Versand of Germany, said each of the 600
workers affected, who are based in Bradford, would receive an ex-gratia
lump-sum payment equivalent to the bonus reduction for a full year.
Typically that would be about Pounds 1,000, but in a few cases it might be
up to Pounds 2,000. Grattan said it was also giving 12 months' notice of the
changes.
Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said some workers would lose up to Pounds 40
a week.
Grattan, which employs 4,000 people, said the 600 affected earned an average
of Pounds 240 a week including bonuses of Pounds 95.
The alternative to the bonus cuts was job losses.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Lucas unit wins Toyota wiring order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOINT venture between Lucas Industries and Sumitomo of Japan has been
awarded a Pounds 10m-a-year contract by Toyota to provide electrical wiring
systems for the cars it is to produce at Burnaston, Derbyshire.
Lucas said last night the contract, starting in December, would initially
lead to the creation of 100 jobs in the joint venture company, Lucas SEI
Wiring Systems. The jobs will be at a plant in Newcastle-under-Lyme,
Staffordshire, assigned to the joint venture by Lucas's Rists Wiring Systems
subsidiary.
Employment is expected to rise further as car output increases in the 1990s.
Toyota plans to produce 31,000 cars - to replace its current Carina range -
in 1993, its first full year of production at the plant. Output is due to
rise to 100,000 a year by 1995 and to 200,000 in 1997. Industry observers
believe the figure may rise significantly by the end of the decade.
The Lucas-Sumitomo contract is one of 150 that Toyota is awarding to
European-based suppliers.
Initial European content of the cars will be slightly less than 60 per cent.
Toyota is understood to have set a long-term local-content goal of 90 per
cent.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Directors urge Pounds 3bn reduction in taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX CUTS of Pounds 3bn and a freeze on business rates and would stimulate
business investment and nudge the economy towards recovery, the Institute of
Directors said yesterday in Budget recommendations to Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
I urged him to make cuts in in corporation, capital-gains and investment
taxes the Budget's priority. It urged a freeze in excise duties on vehicles,
alcohol and tobacco and a halt to increases in the uniform business rate to
speed up the battle for zero inflation.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IOD said: 'Government spending
plans for 1992-93 have pre-empted any large reduction in the overall tax
burden this year, but we believe there is still scope for a Pounds
2bn-Pounds 3bn cut targeted at rebuilding the private sector's capital
base.'
Proposals included a 20 per cent reduction in inheritance tax with the
threshold raised to Pounds 300,000; the abolition of capital gains tax; a 32
per cent cut in corporation tax on 1991-92 profits and a 31 per cent cut on
1992-93 profits.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Ex-offenders body poised to call in
receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APEX TRUST, the training organisation for ex-offenders, announced yesterday
that it would have to call in receivers this week unless the government
stepped in to give it financial assistance.
Government intervention is unlikely because Mr Michael Howard, the
employment secretary, announced in the Commons yesterday that he had
instructed officials to contact those Training and Enterprise Councils which
had contracts with Apex to make alternative arrangements for Apex trainees.
Another voluntary training organisation, Fullemploy, which provides training
mainly for ethnic minorities, announced earlier this month that it was going
into liquidation.
Apex was set up 27 years ago and employs 150 staff in eight locations in the
UK. Each year it helps about 8,000 ex-offenders. Its difficulties have been
caused by a combination of cashflow shortfalls after the setting-up of Tecs,
which pay training providers in arrears, and muddles over government
payments.
The move by Tecs to arrears funding last year meant that Apex received no
funding from Tecs in April or May on contracts worth Pounds 700,000.
Then in January the Department of Employment asked for repayment of Pounds
250,000 which it said it had paid to Apex last year.
Apex had believed this money to be ex gratia, to tide it over contractual
changes in the number of training places it provided. The department said
the payment was made in error.
The crisis deepened when the Home Office cancelled its promise of core
funding of Pounds 250,000, as it could not be certain of Apex's solvency.
Since then, grants of a further Pounds 20,000 have been stopped by the Home
Office.
Mr Howard insisted that the decision to recover the Pounds 250,000 paid to
the Apex Trust 'in error' was not the critical element in its financial
difficulties. Mr Howard said the government had been prepared to consider
the repayment of the Pounds 250,000 'over a substantial period of time'.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Post Office sell-off ruled out by Lilley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, trade and industry secretary, used an Adam Smith Conference
on postal services to make clear yesterday that his proposals to inject more
competition into the Post Office did not amount to wholesale privatisation.
While restating his determination to liberalise postal services, he
frequently referred to the government's commitment to a nationwide letter
service with a uniform, affordable price structure. He later added: 'There
are no government plans to privatise the Post Office at present.'
Labour said that did not amount to a clear undertaking from the government
that rural communities would not suffer from privatisation.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'I have
discovered that both Mr Lilley and Mr Edward Leigh, the minister responsible
for the Post Office, have recorded views which show their commitment to
privatising Britain's postal services.'
That would mean the closure of hundreds of rural post offices, he said.
Mr Lilley attempted to play down the possibility of future privatisation. He
said he would only look at proposals to inject more competition into the
Post Office as long as they did not harm the universal letter service.
After the minister's speech, Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post
Office, warned that the government's plans to reform postal services might
lead to excessive bureaucracy if there were too many regulatory bodies.
The government plans to establish a regulator, Ofpost, to advise it on how
low it could reduce the letter monopoly 'floor' level, which at present
stands at Pounds 1. The government plans to reduce it closer to the
first-class stamp price.
Sir Bryan said: 'We already have the Post Office Users' National Council,
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the parliamentary select committee on
trade and industry and, of course, the secretary of state himself and his
officials, not to mention the European dimension.
'We do need to be careful that the new regulator adds value for the customer
to the regulatory process rather than just being a layer of bureaucracy
building in delay - and cost - to the management process.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOME Office was last night urgently considering possible action after
the first of thousands of poll tax cases due to be heard in Liverpool was
adjourned after a claim that the city council's computer evidence against
alleged defaulters was inadmissible.
The Home Office said: 'Although it is not for the Home Office to interpret
the law, we have no reason to suppose that computer-generated records are
not admissible in civil proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of
the Evidence Act 1938.'
Magistrates in Liverpool decided to postpone for two weeks more than 200
cases of non-payment and await a decision expected next week about similar
prosecutions in Camden, north London.
About 250 of the 5,500 people summoned in Liverpool arrived for the hearings
at specially convened courts. Those who did not attend will be issued with
liability orders.
Mr Jo Cooper, who represented Ms Lesley Mahmood, a leftwing councillor and
former by-election candidate, met the council's legal representatives for
more than an hour before the cases were adjourned.
More than 145,000 people in Liverpool may be prosecuted for non-payment of
poll tax in an attempt to recover an estimated Pounds 90m in unpaid tax.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Hammond will step down in two months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERIC HAMMOND, the controversial general secretary of the EETPU
electricians' union, announced that he is to retire in two months as he and
other leaders of the EETPU and AEU yesterday began a three-week tour of the
UK to win support for a merger.
Mr Hammond, 62, will step down as general secretary on March 13, a week
after the result of the merger ballot is due to be announced. His nine-year
leadership has been punctuated with clashes with other unions. The most
serious, over single-union deals and his union's refusal to withdraw from
two of them, led the TUC to expel the EETPU in 1988.
Assuming the merger ballot goes in favour, members of the 1m-strong merged
union will be balloted in a year on TUC affiliation. Mr Paul Gallagher, Mr
Hammond's successor, indicated that he had yet to be persuaded about TUC
affiliation. He said his union had not missed being outside the TUC and
members of the new union would have to be convinced it was worth belonging
to the organisation.
He said: 'A year from now we could be spending Pounds 1.7m to belong to the
TUC, so it is quite proper for us to ask what we would get in return.'
In the three-week tour, launched among British Airways staff at Heathrow
airport yesterday, Mr Hammond and Mr Gallagher will be joined by Mr Bill
Jordan, AEU president, and Mr Gavin Laird, the union's general secretary,
and other union leaders.
The AEU said yesterday it had identified 177,153 job loss announcements in
manufacturing last year, 22,306 of them between October 17 and December 31.
The areas worst affected were the north-west and north Wales, the west
Midlands, the north-east and the Yorkshire area.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Sale of port delayed for investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION of the port of Tees &amp; Hartlepool is to be delayed for about
two weeks while the government investigates allegations that the process has
been conducted unfairly, the Department of Transport said yesterday.
In a Commons debate on Tuesday night, Ms Joan Walley, a Labour transport
spokeswoman, said there were 'serious allegations of fraud, bribery and
corruption'.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, shipping minister, told MPs no decision would be
taken until the allegations had been studied. Ministers had indicated that
the sale to the Teesside Holdings consortium for Pounds 180m would be
approved by the end of this week.
A furore over the conduct of the sale has forced a postponement while
Department of Transport officials investigate allegations by the losing
bidders and MPs.
The sale of the port was entrusted to the non-executive members of the Tees
&amp; Hartlepool Port Authority. They chose the winning bid in preference to
three others: a higher bid of Pounds 210m from Maritime Transport Services,
a strongly tipped bid of Pounds 150m from a management-employee buy-out team
and a bid of Pounds 155m from Ocean Group, the freight management company.
Allegations about the contest include the following:
Teesside Holdings promised to include a port authority representative on its
board if it won the bidding, thus confronting the adjudicators with a
conflict of interest.
Teesside Holdings was given the opportunity to change its name, bring in
other investors and increase its bid twice during the contest, so giving it
an unfair edge.
Two of Teesside Holdings' directors had previously been directors of port
service companies that were put into liquidation in 1989, landing the
taxpayer with their obligation to meet redundancy payments of Pounds 6.6m
under the Dock Labour Scheme.
Mr John Hackney, leader of the buy-out team, said he was pleased the review
was taking place, 'certainly more pleased than I thought I was going to be
on this day two weeks ago.'
He still intended to seek a judicial review of the decision if it went
against the buy-out.

GENERAL Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, has formed a
joint venture in China for the production of light commercial vehicles.
The venture, which will be GM's first vehicle project in China, will have an
equity capital of Dollars 33m (Pounds 18.5m). Total investment by the joint
venture is expected to be Dollars 100m by the end of the decade.
The US vehicle maker is taking a 30 per cent stake in Jinbei GM Automotive
Company, a joint venture formed with Jinbei Automobile, a producer of vans
and light duty trucks.
The new company, which is to employ 5,000 people at Shenyang City, 700 km
north-east of Beijing, will start assembly of GM's North American S-series
pick-up trucks later this year. GM said yesterday that output would increase
gradually in the 1990s to reach some 50,000 a year by 1998.
At first, the trucks will be assembled from semi-knockdown kits shipped from
North America, but GM said that it would gradually increase local content by
using a rising share of locally supplied parts.
The engine plant is planned to have an eventual capacity to produce 200,000
units a year.
Initially 2.5 litre engines for the pick-up trucks to be assembled by Jinbei
GM Automotive will be supplied from North America, but these will gradually
be replaced by engines from the Bei Nei plant.
GM is to provide management personnel, training, and technology to the joint
venture company.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Beijing steps up pressure over US
sanctions - A look at the two countries' campaigns ahead of today's deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ACCUSED by Washington of being the biggest pirate of US copyright and
patents in the world, China has fought a tough and noisy campaign to prevent
the US from imposing punitive trade sanctions against Chinese exports worth
up to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 84bn).
As today's US deadline approached for the Chinese to reach an acceptable
agreement on the issue or face stiff retaliatiion, Beijing steadily
increased the tempo of its campaign.
This reached a peak last week with the threat of counter-retaliation in the
form of a 'hit-list' of Dollars 1.2bn-worth of US exports, from aircraft,
chemicals and steel, to cotton and corn, that could be subject to tariffs of
up to 100 per cent.
Meanwhile, Beijing left no stone unturned in its efforts to prove its good
faith.
A little more sincerity on the US side was what was needed, its negotiators
loftily claimed, while blithely affecting to be unaware of considerable
evidence of wide-ranging piracy in videos, computer software, books, movies
and music recordings.
The Communist Party newspaper People's Daily took up the cause of proving
that China meant well, trying to present a country unjustly misrepresented
by its critics, notably the US.
It gave prominence recently to a report of a crackdown on unauthorised
Chinese editions of the US novel Scarlett, the bestselling sequel to Gone
with the Wind.
The Shanghai Translation Publishing House bought the exclusive copyright,
the paper said, and planned to publish a Chinese edition in simplified
Chinese characters.
It reported that, when the State Administration of Press and Publication
Copyright Bureau learned that other Chinese publishing houses planned to
bring out their own editions, they were ordered to stop translating and not
to publish.
The People's Public Security News managed to track down an alleged US
infringement of copyright against a Chinese novel.
The newspaper accused the International Daily News based in Los Angeles of
serialising the novel without permission.
However, the real issue is less about pirated books - although there are
thousands locked up in university libraries and in private rooms in Chinese
bookshops - than about protection for highly valuable computer software and
industrial patents.
Chinese patent law protects only processes not products. Chinese companies
have been able to take up US products, such as pharmaceuticals and chemical
fertilisers, slightly change their manufacturing process and thereby avoid
infringement of patent.
Trademarks are another problem area.
Here, China points to what it sees as US guilt. A Xinhua news agency report
last year said China had declared illegal and confiscated products
infringing the M &amp; M chocolate patent of Mars Inc, and fined the infringers.
By contrast, complained Xinhua, the US delayed settling a case of
infringement of the trademark of China's Qingdao Brewery, even though the
case had dragged on for two years.
Nevertheless, the weight of the case appears to remain overwhelmingly with
the US. When Mr Joseph Massey, the US assistant trade representative,
emerged last month from the fifth and penultimate scheduled round of talks
in Beijing, he made no secret of US dissatisfaction.
He described China as 'the single largest pirater worldwide of US
copyrights' and 'the largest unauthorised user of US pharmaceuticals.'
He said: 'We are suffering substantial economic harm because of Chinese
piracy,' he said.
US manufacturers estimate they have lost Dollars 430m (Pounds 240m) from
copyright violations on the Chinese mainland.
All of this of course increases unwanted trade tensions. Moreover, China
does not want a trade war.
But neither does the US want to deal with a rogue elephant, trampling
international convention and violating copyright and patents on its hard-won
and expensively-researched intellectual property.
US and Chinese trade officials yesterday were still negotiating in an
attempt to head off a trade war over Beijing's failure to provide adequate
protection for intellectual property rights, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, has set today as the last
possible deadline for settlement. If no agreement is reached, US sanctions
are to be announced shortly. The Chinese government has threatened to
retaliate.
Among the points of dispute was a proposal by Beijing to establish a
two-tier system of protection for softwear copyrights. This would provide
stronger protection for foreign than domestic copyrights; US companies fear
joint ventures would fall under the domestic regime.
The US is also demanding a definite date - and it must be near-term - for
China to join the Berne Copyright Convention.
The dispute over intellectual property rights came to a head last spring,
when the US, under a provision of trade law called Special 301, cited China
for failure to protect softwear, movies, records, trademarks and drug
patents.

Round

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday rejected the Dunkel plan for the conclusion of the Uruguay
Round of international trade liberalising negotiations, which it described
as unfair to French interests and unacceptable.
President Francois Mitterrand told the government, meeting in cabinet, that
'France is not ready to bow to American demands, nor to submit to the
interests of any other country, and will not give way'.
The French government's objections are directed primarily at the
agricultural provisions of the Dunkel plan, which would call for sharp
restraints on European farming, including limits on exports.
'Our country rejects the Dunkel report in its present form', said Mr Roland
Dumas, the foreign minister, 'because of its partiality and its disregard
for the interests of French and European agriculture'.
Mr Dumas said that France would insist on sticking to the negotiating
mandate given by the 12 member states to the European Commission, and 'would
refuse any submission to non-European interests'.
Mr Louis Mermaz, the agriculture minister, described the Dunkel report as
unacceptable on many points and 'totally unacceptable' in the agricultural
area.
For Europe to accept the proposed reduction in exports, without any
off-setting concessions, would have 'dramatic' results, he added.
The US also came under attack in Brussels, in a statement issued yesterday
by Mr Frans Andriessen, the European Community's Trade and External
Relations Commissioner.
He said he was 'unpleasantly surprised' by the remarks of US President
George Bush this week that the EC was hiding behind an 'iron curtain' of
protectionism.
A Commission official yesterday described as discriminatory Japan's pledge
last week to import more US-made cars, and said the agreement would be
opposed.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Dispute over subsidy for Airbus
intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE transatlantic dispute over Airbus subsidies is set to intensify
following a confidential report by a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
panel condemning German exchange rate support for Deutsche Airbus, the
German partner in the four-nation European aircraft consortium.
The panel was reporting to the Gatt subsidies committee, with which the US
government filed a complaint against the European Commission last February.
It concerned Germany's dollar exchange support mechanism for Daimler-Benz,
the German private car group which has absorbed Deutsche Airbus as part of a
restructuring of the German aerospace industry.
Under the mechanism, Daimler can ask the Bonn government to make good the
exchange rate difference if the value of the dollar over a year averages
between DM1.60 and DM1.80. Germany has argued that the exchange support
scheme was necessary to enable the transfer of Deutsche Airbus from state
control into the private sector.
But the US government and the American aerospace manufacturers complained
that the German move was a distortion of trade and represented a subsidy
worth an average of Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.4m) per aircraft produced by
Airbus.
The US has also filed with Gatt a second, more general complaint against
Airbus subsidies. This has been vigorously rejected by the EC and the
European aircraft consortium. The EC and Airbus have retorted by accusing
the US of directly and indirectly supporting its commercial aircraft
industry through state agencies and military contracts.
The panel's confidential report was circulated to the parties involved in
the dispute this week. But it will require a consensus by the Gatt subsidies
committee before being adopted.
The EC is likely to oppose the panel's findings. German officials indicated
last night that the Gatt subsidies committee was not an adequate forum for
commercial aircraft issues which were governed by a separate civil aircraft
code.

BRITISH Petroleum said yesterday it would pull out of Qatar's huge liquefied
natural gas (LNG) export project. BP said its 7.5 per cent stake in Qatargas
would now revert to the Qatar General Petroleum Corporation, which holds a

Qatargas was set up seven years ago to export LNG from the country's North
field. The Dollars 5bn project to develop the world's largest gas field is
run by the QGPC (Qatar's state energy company) and three foreign partners.
Total, a French resources company, and Mitsui and Marubeni, Japanese trading
houses, have 7.5 per cent each of the project.
BP said its decision to pull out was made for internal reasons and that,
given the calls on its investment funds, it would get better returns
elsewhere.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Kat-Parts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Financial Times article published on March 14, 1991 was the subject of a
court statement yesterday. Mr Noel McMichael, solicitor for Kat-Parts Inc,
told Mr Justice Drake in the High Court in London that the article, headed
'Moles unearth spare parts scam' concerned the efforts of Caterpillar Inc,
by the use of private investigators, to eliminate a counterfeiting network.
He said the article, which was substantially based on information provided
to the FT by Caterpillar, accepted that Kat-Parts had been identified as
part of a counterfeiting network which was costing it several million US
dollars a year and enabling Mr William Dann, the head of Kat-Parts, to fund
an extravagant lifestyle. The FT now accepted that it should not have
portrayed this and other matters as proven fact.
The newspaper's solicitor, Mr Richard Shillito, agreed that the FT wished to
make clear that while Caterpillar had brought an action against Kat-Parts in
the US District Court for the southern district of Texas, Houston, in which
allegations of dealing in counterfeit parts are made against them, Kat-Parts
are vigorously defending the proceedings. The issues are yet to be
determined in the action.
In the meantime, he agreed, Kat-Parts is not restrained from dealing in
Caterpillar spare parts nor, as a result of the denial of an application by
Caterpillar in the US proceedings which was heard on May 9, 1991, is it
restrained from trading under the name Kat-Parts Inc.
Kat-Parts had assured the FT that spare parts which it agreed to supply to
Caterpillar's agents were all manufactured or supplied by companies which
were authorised Caterpillar sub-contractors. Kat-Parts had also assured the
FT that it does not employ a team of immigrant workers and that Mr Dann does
not have a luxury trailer on the Kat-Parts site in Houston, nor a house in
France and does not lead an extravagant lifestyle, the solicitor said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA has endorsed the Uruguay Round proposals to strengthen patent
protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals, in the face of strong protests
from the powerful generic drug industry.
The endorsement, if the Uruguay Round is successful, would effectively end
compulsory licensing, which has been a thorn in the side of the world
multinational drug industry for more than two decades.
A 1969 law required pharmaceutical makers to license products to generic
companies long before their patents expired.
Brand-name suppliers were given greater patent protection in 1987, but the
law still allows generic companies to copy a drug within seven to 10 years
of its launch.
Acceptance of the proposals would extend patent protection to 20 years.

FT  16 JAN 92 / US stock market brushes aside gloom of the latest figures:
Statistics are pessimistic but financial markets are betting that the
economy will rebound in the second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST economic figures suggest that the US economy is weakening rather
than strengthening. Yet share prices bound from one new high to another.
The explanation offered on Wall Street is that investors are betting that
the economy, after three years of stagnation, will begin a sustained
recovery later this year. Lower yields on bonds and bank deposits following
the Federal Reserve's aggressive easing of monetary policy before Christmas
have also prompted a shifting of cash into the stockmarket.
US forecasters' consensus is that the economy will indeed rebound in the
second half of this year. Most have pencilled in growth of about 3 per cent
at an annual rate - exactly the forecast they made this time last year for
the second half of 1991. The question is whether the optimism will again
prove misplaced.
It is certainly difficult to draw any comfort from recent economic
statistics. Worse-than-expected figures for retail sales released this week
indicated that 1991 was the worst year for department stores in at least two
decades. Sales fell sharply in December and were revised down substantially
for November. Car sales for the first 10 days of January were also down
sharply, signalling no early recovery of consumers' spirits.
'The deterioration in consumer spending in the fourth quarter is a major
hurdle for the economy," says Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura
Securities in New York. The stockmarket, he adds, is 'totally blinded to
current events and looking well into the future.'
Figures for employment and production are little more encouraging. In
December, the unemployment rate rose to 7.1 per cent, a five-year high.
Non-farm employment rose 31,000, which seemed a relief after the plunge of
265,000 in November.
But the rebound did not reflect private-sector strength because it was more
than accounted for by an erratic rise in state and local government
employment. Taken as a whole, the fourth quarter showed a marked
deterioration in employment prospects.
The Purchasing Managers' Index - a much-watched guage of manufacturing
industry's health - is falling at an accelerating rate. Last month, it fell
four percentage points to 46.1, which suggests a contraction of the
industrial economy. Industrial production and the index of leading economic
indicators have also turned down decisively.
The evidence so far suggests that production, although weak, was stronger
than demand in the fourth quarter: inventories rose in both October and
November as companies' sales fell short of expectations. Economists are
divided on whether gross domestic production was flat or slightly down in
the fourth quarter. But the need to bring production and demand into better
balance strongly suggests a drop in gross domestic product (GDP) in the
current quarter. The feared 'double dip' recession thus looks a reality.
Why has sentiment in the financial markets improved so noticeably in spite
of growing evidence that the recession - already the longest since 1945 - is
intensifying again?
The turning point was the announcement late in December by Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve chairman, of a full point cut in
the discount rate to 3.5 per cent, the lowest level in 27 years. This move -
the boldest in Mr Greenspan's career - convinced markets that the Fed was
determined to revive the economy.
Mr Greenspan testified before Congress on Friday that he hoped the sizeable
monetary stimulus now in the pipeline would prove sufficient. But he added
that he was ready to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure a
sustained economic recovery. Many analysts have interpreted this as a
commitment to further interest rate cuts if growth fails to pick up.
'I'm confident that rates will be cut further,' says Mr Neal Soss, chief
economist at First Boston Corporation, a New York broker. He argues that Mr
Greenspan needs to react not only to renewed weakness of the US economy, but
to gathering evidence of a recession in Europe and Japan that could curb US
export prospects. Few analysts, however, expect another cut in interest
rates before February, and some believe rates are already at, or very near,
the bottom.
The widespread optimism that the long-awaited recovery will materialise in
the second half largely reflects confidence in the efficacy of monetary
policy. The housing market - the sector by tradition most sensitive to
interest rates - has not yet shown convincing signs of recovery, but many
economists believe that it must eventually respond to lower mortgage rates.
In recent weeks, homeowners have rushed to refinance loans at the new, lower
rates. Lower interest rates are also increasing the attractions of
investment in consumer durables such as cars and domestic appliances.
Optimists stress that companies are seizing a golden opportunity to
restructure balance sheets weakened by the debt build-up of the 1980s. Lower
long-term interest rates and strong equity markets prompted record bond and
equity issues last year. In theory this should eventually support increased
capital investment and rehiring of workers.
The problem lies in judging the time needed for adjustment. Each successive
year of economic stagnation increases the likelihood of a recovery. But debt
burdens still remain uncomfortably high throughout the economy, while
consumer confidence languishes at a near-record trough. The Bush
administration, moreover, has done little to address long-term weaknesses
such as the abnormally low US savings rate.
Measures in the President's State of the Union address later this month,
while being promoted as a long-run growth package, may lead in practice to
even higher fiscal deficits, which is precisely the wrong prescription in
the eyes of many economists.
The forward-looking optimism of financial markets is thus more akin to an
act of faith than a considered economic judgment.

THE Philippines yesterday agreed terms with the International Monetary Fund
that should allow the resumption of a Dollars 900m (Pounds 503m) lending
programme suspended last July when Manila failed to meet economic targets,
writes Richard Gourlay in Manila.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, finance secretary, said the two sides had agreed on a
target for the central government's budget deficit which was the only
unresolved issue from last week's IMF mission. Resumption of the programme
is still dependent on the Philippines passing tougher revenue-raising
measures. Only then will the IMF give its stamp of 'good housekeeping' on
which a commercial bank debt rescheduling agreement and new international
aid commitments depend.
The measures have been passed by the House of Representatives but have yet
to be approved by the Senate.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Algeria reaches into the past to avoid fundamentalist regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MOHAMED Boudiaf's decision, at the age of 71, to return to his country
from which he voluntarily exiled himself after 1963, to preside over a
five-man collegiate presidency until the end of next year, is symbolic of an
attempt by senior Algerians to reconcile their country with its turbulent
history, writes Francis Ghiles in Algiers.
Mr Boudiaf, who was said last night by one of his sons to be due to arrive
today in Algiers from Morocco, is one of the three surviving 'historic
chiefs' of the Algerian revolution, the men who launched the fight to end
132 years of French rule in their country. That struggle claimed 1m dead as
French were pitted against Algerians and communities were riven by violent
strife.
Mr Boudiaf, who has been adamant in his refusal to live under what he has
always considered to be a military dictatorship, will ostensibly lead a
jemaa, a sort of council of elders which, in traditional Maghreb society,
seeks to settle feuds and maintain tribal unity and prosperity.
However, Gen Khaled Nezzar, defence minister and the Algerian strong man
since the annulment of the second round this week of the elections that
might well have put the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front in power, was
also a member of the short-lived High Security Council and presumably was
important in the dramatic decision to recall Mr Boudiaf.
His ability to get on with Gen Nezzar and all the Algerian military, which
he has always distrusted, will be a key factor - unless Mr Boudiaf is to be
treated as mere window-dressing to avoid a violent split between Islamic and
secular Algeria in the wake of the ascendancy of the FIS.
Dr Haddam Tedjini, a man who hails from a much-respected traditionalist
family, is also a member of the collegiate presidency. He has occupied,
among other posts, the ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia, the presidency of the
Grand Mosque in Paris and the chair of the Family Planning Council. Also in
the five-man ruling body is Mr Ali Kafi, who is in charge of the war
veterans' association, and Mr Ali Haroun, a respected lawyer and minister of
human rights.
Algeria today is at the crossroads. Family ties, regional loyalties and
religion are the keys to understanding it. The appearance of a modern state
with a progressive ideology notwithstanding, these factors outweigh all
others, at street level and in government, and remain the real checks and
balances in a society which has yet to forge its identity nearly 30 years
after independence from France.
The divisions are only in part between haves and have-nots. The fault lines
fracture every professional, language, regional and social group in the
country.
The young Algerians who were educated in the post-1962 parallel system,
where Arabic was the medium of instruction, have not been given access to
the top jobs in diplomacy or industry.
Also, the lack of freedom in a single-party system, whose official discourse
denounced the west and heaped praise on everything Arab, also played its
part in fostering the idea that a return to traditional Moslem values would
purge society of 'perverted' western values.
Reconciling this country with its history, helping it to forge a less
confused sense of its own identity, is the challenge that Mr Boudiaf and his
peers face. He will need the support of a strong and competent government to
enact the painful reforms needed to buttress the liberalisation of the
economy and get people back to work.

<TEXT>
THE European Parliament last night approved Ecu1.58bn (Pounds 1.13bn) worth
of aid to several North African and Middle East countries, but blocked a
further Ecu773m for Syria and Morocco because of human rights abuses there.
The package of grants and loans, covering the period up to 1996, is the key
element in the Community's strategy to increase stability to its south and
east, as well as to underpin Middle East peace efforts.
Surprisingly, aid to Algeria and Israel was approved. In the case of the
former, MEPs urged the Commission to monitor closely the situation following
a decision by Algeria's government and army to cancel a further round of
voting this week, after successes by Islamic fundamentalists.
Aid to Israel, worth a relatively small Ecu82m, scraped through with most
MEPs wanting to give even-handed backing to the Arab-Israeli peace process
and to match the funding they also approved yesterday for Jordan and
Lebanon.
Irrespective of the Middle East peace drive, however, MEPs' complaints about
human rights abuses in Syria doomed Brussels' plan to conclude a
much-delayed third financial protocol of Ecu152m, and a fourth protocol
worth Ecu158m, with that country.
More surprising, particularly in view of yesterday's treatment of Algeria,
was the voting down of Ecu463m for Morocco.

Figures for the first six months of the financial year show that the decline
in the manufacturing sector was 1.9 per cent, while production in mining and
quarrying fell 2.6 per cent.
Capital goods have been particularly badly affected and their production was
down by 17 per cent. Consumer durables were down by 11 per cent, while
production of consumer goods fell less sharply by less than 1 per cent.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Baker acts to avert stalemate in talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE East peace talks appeared to be stymied yesterday after Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators clashed over the issue of Israeli settlements in the
occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, called the heads of the peace
delegations in to see him yesterday morning, and the Israelis agreed to stay
in Washington for one more day of talks, remaining until noon Thursday
instead of leaving on Wednesday night as they had originally planned.
The State Department said yesterday's meetings were requested by the
delegations, and said Mr Baker had made only private comments, rather than
putting forward US suggestions on how to resolve the deadlock in the
simultaneous bilateral talks which Israel has been holding in Washington
this week with Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Palestinian delegations.
While the Arab delegations, in particular, have repeatedly tried to bring
the US into the discussions, the State Department has insisted that it can
act only as a catalyst to the peace process and cannot get involved in
issues of substance.
The peace talks had seemed to take a step forward when delegates agreed on a
formula which allowed Israel to hold separate meetings to discuss Jordanian
and Palestinian issues while preserving its insistence that it would deal
only with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
But after agreeing on what kind of table to sit around, the delegations
failed to make any further progress on what agenda to put on that table.
'It seems that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have come to a head-on
collision,' said Dr Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian
delegation.
'We told them that there is no way in which negotiations can proceed or
succeed while Israeli settlement activity is continuing.' In another
development, the Palestinians have refused to accept an invitation to
multilateral talks due to take place in Moscow on January 27-28.
They want to take part with their own delegation, including Palestinians
living outside the occupied territories, rather than as part of the
Jordanian delegation.
Meanwhile, settlers in the occupied territories yesterday attempted to
establish four new makeshift settlements and demonstrated for tougher
government action against the Palestinian uprising, in protest against a
series of attacks on settlers by Palestinian gunmen in which four Israelis
died.
The army quickly intervened, arresting more than 20 settlers.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Israeli inflation rate reached 18 per cent in 1991
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAELI inflation totalled 18 per cent in 1991, less than had been feared
and only slightly up on 17.6 per cent in 1990, writes Hugh Carnegy.
The biggest single factor was the surge in housing costs, which rose 28 per
cent overall as fears of an immigration-induced housing shortage drove up
prices and rents.
But Russian immigrants' reluctance to take on high levels of debt to
purchase property, and rising availability of new stock arising from a
construction boom, abruptly reversed the trend in the last quarter, when
house prices fell 4 per cent.

<TEXT>
ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government appears likely to lose
its parliamentary majority next Sunday after an extreme right-wing party
formally decided last night to pull out of the coalition and the leader of
another said he would recommend his faction do likewise.
The withdrawal of the two, in protest at Mr Shamir's willingness to offer
autonomy to the Palestinians of the occupied territories in the Middle East
peace talks, could precipitate an early general election, ahead of the due
date in November.
A meeting of the policy-making body of Tehiya, a three-MP party led by Mr
Yuval Ne'eman, the science minister, decided to resign from the 20-month old
government following the first steps towards substantive talks on
Palestinian self-rule taken by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in
Washington this week.
'Our party secretariat has decided I will present my resignation on Sunday,'
said Mr Neeman.
The two-MP party Moledet is almost certain to follow suit at a meeting
today.
Like Mr Shamir's Likud party, Tehiya and Moledet believe Israel should never
give up the occupied territories. But they bitterly oppose Likud's
acceptance that a measure of self-government should be given to the
Palestinians.
Only a collapse of the peace talks is likely to reverse their move to quit.
The departure would leave the Likud-led coalition with just 59 supporters in
the 120-member Knesset.
Opposition parties who support the peace process have expressed a
willingness to allow a minority Shamir government to continue, as long as
the peace negotiations make progress. But Mr Shamir has made it clear he
does not want to rely on opposition backing for his survival.
His aides say he would prefer elections, but he might seek a delay before
confronting voters in the hope of securing a deal with the US on the Dollars
10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in loan guarantees Israel has requested to help finance
Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. Most commentators predict
an election in May or June.
Bank of Israel officials said yesterday the IMF had agreed Israel met the
criteria for a Dollars 250m loan to compensate for economic losses estimated
at Dollars 1bn caused by the Gulf war.

Mr Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, yesterday urged parliament's
upper chamber to approve the government's first quarter budget provisions,
amid threats of a one-day protest strike by members of the former communist
trade unions, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Mr Olszewski warned that even after cuts in government spending aimed at
reducing the budget deficit target to Zl 17,600bn (Pounds 890m) the real
budget out-turn could be overwhelmed by the volume of overdue 1991 payments.
These could add another Zl 20,000bn to the total, he said.
In an attempt to bring the deficit under control the government has cut
energy subsidies and reduced unemployment pay, setting off unrest.

FRANCE'S inflation rate fell to a provisional 3.1 per cent last year, the

main benchmark used by official economic planners, writes William Dawkins in

The figure compares with 3.4 per cent in 1990 and this year's 2.8 per cent
target, and puts France well below the 4.5 per cent average for its nine
main trade partners. The German inflation rate rose by 4.2 per cent last

The figures, released by the Insee state statistics institute, are the

RUSSIA threw its weight yesterday behind a German plan for an international
convention to prevent the export of nuclear weapons technology to third
countries, backed by sanctions against any would-be future nuclear power.
Mr Alexander Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, gave the plan his
enthusiastic support after talks with Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, his German
opposite number.
He also issued a plea for an international programme to support continuing
nuclear research in the former Soviet Union in order to dissuade the
country's scientists from selling their potentially lethal know-how to the
highest bidder.
The plan was spelt out by Mr Genscher as a two-part convention to complement
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The first would commit existing
nuclear states to prevent the export of nuclear know-how; the second would
provide for sanctions against any country attempting to acquire nuclear
weapons technology, or produce nuclear weapons material.
He said the convention should be promoted by the existing nuclear powers,
including the US, Britain and France, as well as non-nuclear powers like
Germany worried about the consequences of Soviet weapons technology
spreading across the globe.
Mr Kozyrev said Russia would continue scientific research 'as far as it is
affordable,' underlining the shortage of funds. An international programme,
he said, could support peaceful nuclear research.

FT  16 JAN 92 / EC formalises the split-up of Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday sealed the formal end of the Yugoslav
federation by recognising Croatia and Slovenia as independent states.
But it put off extending recognition to the other breakaway republics of
Macedonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The landmark decision by the Community was tempered by disagreement among
the Twelve over tactics and fears that it could complicate negotiations at
the EC peace conference on Yugoslavia's future.
The findings of the conference's arbitration commission under Mr Robert
Badinter, the French constitutional expert, expressed the reservation that
Croatia had not agreed to the conference's plans to accord self-government
to majority Serbian areas inside Croatia.
However, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia undertook this month to 'accept
entirely' the peace conference provisions for autonomy and minority rights.
The differences within the EC were underlined when Germany yesterday assumed
full diplomatic relations with Croatia and Slovenia, ensuring that it stayed
in front of the rest of the EC to the very end.
The arbitration commission's reservations on the question of human and
minority rights in Croatia failed to cause even a flicker of hesitation in
Bonn, where the government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, expressed confidence
that the German pressure for diplomatic recognition had been an important
contribution towards the realisation of a genuine ceasefire there.
The Dutch government, however, was among those most concerned at premature
recognition of Croatia. It said it had agreed, while 'expecting the Croatian
government to see to it that all the shortcomings mentioned ..will be
remedied'.
Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch junior minister for EC affairs, speaking in
Bavaria, said the continual German threats to press ahead with recognition
regardless of its partners' views was 'a very unhappy beginning to the
common foreign and security policy, for which the path was cleared at the
Maastricht summit.'
France said it might not send an ambassador until Croatia met the required
conditions, while Britain said it was considering the question of sending
ambassadors to Croatia and Slovenia.
In Belgrade, the Serb-controlled federal government reacted with predictable
anger to the EC decision, accusing it of 'violating international law'.
While Serbian officials insisted the move would not affect Yugoslavia's
international status, Mr Dobrosav Veizovic, the deputy foreign minister,
said it would jeopardise the EC and United Nations peace process.
In Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, officials said they were
disappointed but not surprised that the EC declined to recognise its
independence.
'I understand that the EC's arbitration commission has recommended that we
hold a republic-wide referendum,' said Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, Bosnia's
deputy prime minister. 'We will carry out this.'
In Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, a government official said the EC's
objection was based on the principle of 'not alienating Greece, which
objected to the name Macedonia being used for our independent republic.'
The Badinter report's finding that Macedonia should also be recognised is
bound to bring pressure on Greece to relent.

COCA-COLA will today announce in Moscow the formation of Coca-Cola
Refreshments-Moscow (CCRM). It claims CCRM is the first private sector joint
stock company in Russia that will be majority controlled by a US
multinational corporation.
The new company will manufacture soft drink syrups as well as control a
retail distribution network, which will begin operations in 18 months with
400 kiosks in the greater Moscow area. The ultimate target is 2,000 retail
outlets.
Mr Neville Isdell, president of the Coca-Cola division that covers eastern
Europe, said the significance of the Moscow company 'is that for the first
time we will have a fully integrated system for consumer goods, all the way
through to the individual consumer.'
Coca-Cola will own more than 95 per cent of the shares in CCRM. The
remaining shares will be held by Professor SN Fyodorov, a Russian
businessman.
Coca-Cola's initial capital investment of Dollars 12m (Pounds 6.7m) is
small, but Mr Gavriil Popov, the mayor of Moscow, said the investment should
stimulate economic activity. He said it would 'attract additional
international investment and would signal to others that the City of Moscow
is ready to do business.'
Coca Cola said the new syrup plant, to be built on a five-acre site, would
create 200 jobs.
Pepsi-Cola, the second largest US soft drinks company, sells its product by
licence agreement with some 40 state bottling companies. Mr Christopher
Sinclair, president of Pepsi-Cola, said the company was negotiating new
joint ventures in the former Soviet Union, including a resin fibre producing
venture in Belarus that would manufacture plastic bottles.
The first Coca-Cola product available in the Soviet Union was Fanta Orange
in 1979. Soviet state bottling companies began making Coca-Cola in 1985.
Mr Isdell said Coca-Cola would provide the new retailing force with
equipment, training and management assistance.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Ministers under fire in Gulf war report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government faced acute embarrassment yesterday after the disclosure of
an internal armed services report strongly criticising interference by
ministers in the conduct of Britain's role in the Gulf campaign a year ago.
The report, leaked to the Press Association news agency on the anniversary
of the expiry of the UN deadline signalling the start of the offensive
against Iraq, comes amid a sustained three-day Tory offensive against Labour
as a party lacking genuine commitment to strong defence policies.
It says the government showed a 'preoccupation with money and politics',
'excessive ministerial influence' and 'a frustrating loss of cohesion'
during the campaign.
As Downing Street talked down the report's significance, Mr Martin O'Neill,
chief Labour defence spokesman, insisted it raised 'very serious questions'
about the government's handling of the military side of the Gulf crisis.
Responding, officials suggested the paper was merely part of an extensive
re-evaluation of the conduct of the war ordered by Mr Tom King, the defence
secretary and now the chief target of opposition attacks.
In a statement, Mr King acknowledged there had been disputes over 'details
within the decision-making process', but added that these had not interfered
with 'the overall team effort and the success that that achieved'.
Later he said: 'It is clear that some mistakes were made, there were
disagreements between different people and some failures of communication.'
But it was his responsibility during the crisis 'not to accede automatically
to every request' from the forces.
The report, understood to have been written by a naval officer, highlights
friction between the services and senior civilians about the forces
committed to Gulf operations. This included ministers' refusal to send the
aircraft carrier Ark Royal into the Red Sea despite US requests for it to
assist in enforcing the embargo against Iraq.
The report says Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, the UK-based joint
commander of the campaign, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir David
Craig, then chief of defence staff, pressed the government to send the Ark
Royal.
The navy's anxiety to take a higher profile in military operations was seen
by civil servants as partly reflecting worries about impending cuts.
The report says senior civil servants were 'hell-bent on committing as
little as possible' to the Gulf because of the cost-saving review.
Mr King flies to the Gulf on Saturday to help boost UK arms sales in the
region. He plans to visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and the UAE where big
British defence sales are expected this year.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Sweeping reforms at Lloyd's to limit losses: Proposals offer
little help for insurance market's worst-hit Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday unveiled one of the most far-reaching reform
programmes in its 300-year history which could sharply reduce the importance
of unlimited liability on which the insurance market is built.
The reforms aim to strengthen Lloyd's capital base, cut costs, improve
competitiveness and help it increase its share of the international market.
They come as Lloyd's faces some of its worst trading losses - estimated at
more than Pounds 2bn in the three years to 1990.
However, the proposals, drafted during the past year by a 14-strong task
force, contain little to relieve the position of those 'Names' who have
borne the brunt of the market's losses. The Names are the individuals whose
wealth provides the market's capital.
The Lloyd's council, the market's governing body, has accepted the bulk of
the recommendations and will act quickly to implement a number of them.
The first of the reforms, modifying unlimited liability rules, is expected
to be introduced next January. That would cap the losses for which Names,
who can be bankrupted under the present system, are liable.
Names will be personally liable for all losses during a four-year period up
to an amount equivalent to their overall premium limit, the amount of
premiums they are allowed to accept under Lloyd's rules.
A Name accepting Pounds 500,000 in premiums, for example, would be liable to
pay insurance losses up to this amount. Losses above the individual's limit
would be payable from a central fund financed by contributions from all
Names. However, if this fund were to be exhausted, liability would revert to
the individual. The task force believes that may make Lloyd's a more
attractive investment and help stem the decline in membership.
Over 4,000 Names have left Lloyd's in the last 12 months, reducing
membership to about 22,500 and cutting Pounds 1bn from the market's capital
base.
Other proposals include:
The introduction of a system allowing less well-off Names to spread their
investments more widely, diversifying their risks.
Measures to increase Lloyd's ability to draw corporate capital into the
market. The task force suggests that Lloyd's should press for legislative
changes to allow 'corporate names' to underwrite at Lloyd's. If Lloyd's is
unable to attract sufficient capital from Names, it should increase its
reliance on corporate capital.
A charter of rights for Names, giving them the ability to hold regular
meetings of the syndicates in which they are grouped, direct access to
syndicate information and the right to veto big transactions.
Names have welcomed the changes in the report, which explicitly recognises
the 'primacy' of their interests. According to Mr Mark Farrer, the chairman
of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents 9,000 Lloyd's Names,
'the proposals go a long way towards correcting the imbalance between Names
and syndicate management. They are a blueprint for genuine change and
progress'.
Mr Tom Benyon, of the rival Society of Names, said that for the first time
Lloyd's was putting 'the outsiders first, and not the insiders', but it had
done 'nothing to help' the badly hit Names.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Carsberg to take over at OFT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of telecommunications, is to succeed
Sir Gordon Borrie as director-general of fair trading. Sir Gordon, who will
be 60 in March, will step down at the end of June after 16 years in the job.
Sir Gordon, only the second person to hold the office since the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT) was set up under the 1973 Fair Trading Act, let it be
known last year that after completing three five-year terms he had no desire
to continue.
He was persuaded by the government to carry on for an extra year to give it
time to find a suitable replacement.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday described as 'pure
speculation' the suggestion that Sir Bryan's appointment was a precursor to
uniting the roles of the utilities' regulators and the OFT. Abolition of the
office of director-general of telecommunications would require primary
legislation, an official said.
Sir Bryan, 53, promised a 'pro-active' approach to his new job. He said the
OFT's functions were to 'improve the performance of the economy by making
things more competitive and more efficient' and to protect consumers. He did
not expect a radical change of policy. 'I have always been impressed by the
extent to which we use the same language,' he said. It was important that
the director-general was independent of political pressures, and he foresaw
no problems if Labour formed the next government.
The government hopes to appoint Sir Bryan's successor in time for the new
director-general of telecommunications to take over at the end of June.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Labour may scale back National Insurance plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR leadership may scale back its plan for sharp increases in
National Insurance contributions for those earning more than Pounds 20,000 a
year because of the potentially crippling impact on its electoral support in
southern England.
Senior party figures are suggesting that the proposed abolition of the
Pounds 20,280 earnings ceiling on such contributions could be phased in over
a number of years rather than coming into effect immediately after the
general election.
The change of heart, which follows a Conservative onslaught on Labour's tax
and spending plans, reflects growing concern in the shadow cabinet about the
unpopularity of the plan among voters in key southern marginals.
The party insisted last night it had emphasised consistently that its
planned tax and National Insurance changes would be introduced gradually.
But the general presumption among MPs of all parties at Westminster has been
that the NIC changes would be introduced in the first budget of a Labour
government to pay for its planned increases in spending on child benefit and
pensions.
Labour needs to win a swathe of seats around London and in the rest of
southern chance of defeating the Conservatives in the general election due
by July.
Its concern about the impact of the NIC change will be reinforced by the
publication later this month of a detailed study on its effect on voters in
different parts of the country.
Overall, about 3.4m or about 14 per cent of taxpayers would be hit by the
abolition of the ceiling, but because of the wide disparities in income, the
losers would be heavily concentrated in the south.
It is understood that a report under preparation by the independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies will show that in parts of the south-east more
than a third of those in employment would suffer.
If it were introduced immediately, it would cost employees Pounds 90 extra a
year on every Pounds 1,000 of income over the Pounds 20,280 threshold. For a
middle-manager on Pounds 30,000 per year that would mean an additional
annual bill of nearly Pounds 900.
There are two possible ways to phase in the change. Shadow cabinet members
have floated the option that initially employees earning more than Pounds
20,280 would pay contributions on anything above that point at a lower rate
than the 9 per cent level levied on the rest of their income.
Another possibility, suggested by the IFS, would be a gradual increase in
the ceiling over a number of years until it was eventually aligned with the
top-rate tax threshold, and then abolished.
Either would bring Tory charges of a U-turn in policy. The Conservatives,
buoyed by the latest opinion poll giving them a one-point lead and by a
cheerier mood in the City, plan a new attack on Labour's spending plans
ahead of a Commons debate on the economy next week.
They will raise further their estimate that Labour's spending commitments
add up to more than Pounds 35bn.
But if Mr Neil Kinnock confirms the plans for a phased change, he will
insist it is entirely consistent with long-stated pledges to avoid large
disruptions in family budgets.
Labour party figures last night were referring to a phrase in the party's
latest policy document, Opportunity Britain, which states: 'Fundamental tax
reforms of the kind we propose must be introduced gradually so that family
and business budgets are not disrupted.'
Labour can also argue that the two specific areas of spending which it has
pledged to increase immediately on taking office - child benefit and
pensions - can be financed comfortably without a 'one-off' abolition of the
NIC ceiling.
This total package is estimated to cost Pounds 3.5bn, but a substantial
proportion of that could be raised by the planned increase in the top rate
of tax and by other planned income tax changes, allowing room for a phased
increase in NIC.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Technology: Mobile information transmission
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When London &amp; Edinburgh Insurance's engineers visit garages to assess crash
damage, they send the information back to the computer centre so the repair
costs can be calculated. At the moment they use either a phone line, with a
modem, or the Cellnet cellular radio network.
Soon they could have several other options.
Audatex, the vehicle damage assessment company, is already talking to
Huchison Mobile Data, of Hertford, about using its data network for
transmitting the information. Huchison, which is planning to offer
commercial services to urban areas and motorways before the middle of the
year, is one of several companies to have developed such services.
Others include Cognito, which has developed a two-way paging service, and
Ram Mobile Data, Paknet, owned by the Vodafone Group and Cable &amp; Wireless,
is also planning to enter the market - it already has a service for sending
radio data from fixed terminals, such as credit card verification units.
Such services will prove less expensive than the cellular radio networks
because they are designed specifically for data traffic which take up less
radio spectrum than voice calls.
Data companies envisage the service engineer as a prime target for their
services. Other forms include sales and distribution, as well as financial
services for sending information on share price movements.
To use the network a separate moden can be attached to the laptop, pen
computer or electronic diary, although eventually the modems will be built
into the machines. For Paknet, which launched its service in 1990, products
with built-in modems are available.
The biggest customers have proven to be burglar alarm manufacturers. 'When
burglars come they cut the phone wires,' points out John Smith, Paknet's
commercial director. 'We've had quite a few cases where the burglars cut the
wires and the police have come along and caught them.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / Appointments: Barclays pursues Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank is promoting two of its key continental European executives in
a bid to underline the UK clearer's commitment to further development across
the channel.
Carlos Martinez de Campos (right), who has made his mark by introducing
innovations to Spanish retail banking, becomes director of European retail
banking, a new function which he will fulfil from Madrid where is currently
based. de Campos is 47 and has been with Barclays since 1973. More recently
he has shaken up the Spanish financial establishment, for instance, by
pioneering interest-bearing current accounts; he has also pushed ahead to
open 33 new branches of the bank in Portugal during the past 15 months.
Meanwhile, Jacques Rambosson (above right), who heads the French operation,
is promoted to director of European corporate banking, also a newly created
position. Rambosson spent 8 years in London in charge of Banque Nationale de
Paris' UK operation, before moving in 1988 to Paris with Barclays.
Barclays is one of the few European banks still to harbour ambitions of a
pan-European strategy - pitting it alongside Deutsche Bank of Germany and
Credit Lyonnais in France. De Campos and Rambosson will report to Richard
Carden in London who is managing director of commercial banking in the UK
and Europe.
Rambosson, who is 54, will among other things assume overall responsibility
for corporate banking in Germany, a key country for Barclays particularly
since it bought the exclusive blue-blooded Munich bank Merck Finck in
September 1990. Giles Davison, who is based in Munich since the acquisition,
remains Germany's area manager.
The new posts are two levels down from main board directorships. Will
Barclays, which last year appointed two non-executive directors from
overseas, be cementing its international credentials with a foreign
executive director in the not too distant future?
*****
RODIME, the Scottish-based disk drive company, has restructured its board to
reflect the fact that its manufacturing subsidiaries are in receivership; it
is concentrating on pursuing patent infringement actions against other
manufacturers.
Thomas Kamp, a senior figure in the US electronics industry, has resigned as
chairman and is replaced by Malcolm McIver, senior partner of Bird Semple
Fyfe Ireland, the Glasgow solic-itors. McIver was already a non-executive
director and acted as company secretary.
Jay Swent is resigning as finance director but will remain a non-executive
director and consultant. Rodime has decided it no longer needs a full-time
finance director.
William Batchelor, a Scot who was a founding shareholder of Rodime, leaves
the board, as does Robert Ashley, a US electronics consultant.
David Mathewson, a director of Noble Grossart, Rodime's Edinburgh-based
merchant bankers, becomes a non-executive director. Peter Bailey stays as
managing director.
*****
Keith Swinley has been appointed group company secretary of LILLEY.
*****
David Newcombe, formerly finance director, has been appointed chief
executive of PHILIP HARRIS Holdings; Stephen Wood, who has recently been
responsible for the group's scientific business, has decided to leave.
*****
Graham Melmoth, a non-executive director of the Cop-operative Bank, remains
company secretary of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and is not the
former secretary as earlier reported.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Business Law: Programmes to keep trade fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure in recent years of the centrally planned economies of central
and eastern Europe to fulfil the expectations of their peoples, and the
re-emergence of societies based on free competition, support Thomas
Jefferson's philosophy that free trade is the foundation of commerce.
The law in a number of countries attempts by regulation to preserve fair
competition and thus enforce this underlying principle of free trade. While
there may be some paradox in regulating for freedom, these laws have a
practical impact on most businesses operating within their jurisdictions.
The laws can be traced back in many cases to the English common law doctrine
that contracts 'in restraint of trade' are against the public interest.
American antitrust law developed this original concept when the so-called
'trust busters' in the early part of this century broke up huge business
conglomerates such as Rockefeller's Standard Oil because they were perceived
to be strangling commerce by their widespread interests.
English legislation after the Second World War regulated monopolies,
restrictive trade practices, resale price maintenance and anti-competitive
practices.
The European Community (EC) has competition law rules aimed at prohibiting
agreements or concerted practices which prevent, restrict or distort
competition and the abuse of dominant positions which could threaten the
creation of a single European market.
The EC legislation is enforced by the European Commission and cases can be
brought before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg or, more precisely, before
the Court of First Instance, which took over jurisdiction for all
competition cases from the senior court in September 1989.
The Commission can fine offenders up to 10 per cent of their worldwide
annual turnover for breaches of the competition rules in articles 85 and 86
of the Treaty of Rome. In December 1990 it fined ICI and Solvay more than
Pounds 33m for operating a cartel in soda ash, a key ingredient of glass,
and in July this year it fined Tetra Pak, the Swiss liquid packaging group,
Pounds 52m for abuse of a dominant position.
American companies have been exposed for a longer period of time to
potential investigations by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department
of Justice, with the possibility of treble damages being awarded in the
courts, and have consequently taken competition law compliance seriously for
many years.
As part of ensuring compliance within their organisations, and also
minimising the consequences if they do infringe any of the antitrust laws,
many US companies operate effective antitrust compliance programmes.
In Europe such programmes seem to be a rarity, even among large companies
trading internationally which, it would be reasonable to assume, would be at
some risk if they were in breach of the law.
The advantages afforded by an effective competition compliance programme
should have been clear to European companies for some time. As long ago as
1982, in a case involving National Panasonic, the European Commission made
its views on the subject abundantly clear:
'Regard must however also be taken of the fact that (the company) has taken
urgent steps to regulate the overall marketing policies of its subsidiaries
in the EEC . . . (The company) has also conducted an audit of its legal
practices in the Community and has issued Codes of Conduct to all its
subsidiaries in the EEC which have the authority of the parent company.
'This constructive attitude adopted by the management . . . has been taken
into account in assessing the amount of the fine. The undertakings concerned
have adopted a comprehensive practical detailed and carefully considered
antitrust compliance programme, with appropriate legal advice. Such action
must be considered a positive step which contributes to an awareness at all
levels of the group of the daily impact of competition policy.'
In the UK the House of Lords has also indirectly provided support for
compliance programmes in a recent restrictive trade practices case. It
involved Smiths Concrete, which successfully appealed to the Law Lords
against a fine imposed by the Restrictive Trade Practices Court for
participating in a price fixing cartel. The Law Lords ruled that the company
had taken all reasonable steps to dissuade its staff from entering into
unlawful agreements.
A compliance programme should take full account of the industry in which the
company operates and be run by in-house or external lawyers who have a good
working knowledge of the company's business methods, with assistance from
the company's training department.
This gives the lawyers the opportunity to participate in preventative legal
measures, and enables commercial managers better to understand the
contribution they can make.
It is essential, however, that the programme is understood and endorsed by
the company's senior management. Otherwise it may be considered time
consuming and even a nuisance, as it lacks any authority or commitment from
those who make the key decisions within the organisation.
Such a programme would need proper planning and involve some form of
compliance audit to determine the current understanding of competition law
within the company and the extent of any non-compliance.
This would be followed by an education programme aimed at creating awareness
and an understanding of the reason for the programme among relevant managers
and employees. Any offending business practices should be changed.
Even informal arrangements among competitors must be avoided.
Take as an example, a sales managers' conference attended by a number of
European companies that all trade in similar products throughout the
Community, but only one company that has invested in a competition
compliance programme.
At a post-conference social gathering, somebody suggests that their common
problems are associated with customers negotiating different prices for the
respective products. Another representative agrees and adds that it would be
simpler if they could all agree what discounts to offer. A third says they
should also agree which parts of the Community would be served by each
company.
The representative of the company which has a compliance programme points
out that what they are proposing amounts to an illegal price fixing and
market sharing cartel and states that he wants nothing to do with it.
Later, however, he mentions the conversation to a colleague at a company
which is having considerable difficulty in obtaining any market share owing
to price cutting activities by competitors, prompting a complaint to the
Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in the UK and the European Commission in
Brussels.
An industry investigation would inevitably follow. Some of the companies
would be subjected to dawn raids by Commission representatives, followed by
a protracted investigation by the two competition authorities, with the
likelihood of substantial fines and enforced changes to their business
practices.
The company with a compliance programme would also be investigated, but it
would be able to avoid any fine by using its compliance programme to
demonstrate that it had avoided participation in any anti-competitive
practices.
Are there any disadvantages in establishing a competition compliance
programme? Such an exercise may cause some resentment among business
managers, who could see it as undue interference in their work with no
positive benefits.
This can be overcome by senior management endorsement and sensitive
training, designed to emphasise the overall value of the programme to the
company.
If a company were found to be in breach of competition law, after
establishing a compliance programme, the competition authorities could be
adversely influenced by the company's failure to meet its own standards.
However, the proper implementation of such a programme would be more likely
to impress the OFT or the Commission than otherwise, particularly if it is
seen as a continuing process which is followed through and reviewed year by
year.
Business lawyers and their clients are now realising the benefits of
identifying potential problem areas and dealing with them before they become
big issues. Competition law compliance programmes are a timely and sensible
way of furthering such practices, while endorsing the economic and legal
systems which should enable companies to flourish in their chosen fields of
business.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong reaches
another record high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET'S record close overnight encouraged the Pacific Rim markets, in
the absence of Tokyo which was closed for a holiday yesterday.
HONG KONG finished at its second successive record high, though well off the
day's best due to profit-taking. The Hang Seng index climbed to 4,420.07
before ending a net 15.05 up at 4,382.66 after turnover of HKDollars 1.76bn,
against HKDollars 1.68bn.
In a buoyant property sector, Cheung Kong rose 20 cents to HKDollars 19.40
and Hongkong Land edged up 10 cents to HKDollars 9.30.
SEOUL fell back as worries over financial constraints, falling customer
deposits and a full-scale labour dispute at Hyundai Motor continued to put
pressure on the market. The composite index dipped 11.49 to 604.63 in
turnover of Won231.1bn, after Won217.2bn.
Hyundai Motor fell by its daily limit of Won1,000 to Won23,800 following
news late on Tuesday that employees of Hyundai Motor had voted to strike.
AUSTRALIA followed Wall Street as the All Ordinaries index moved ahead 23.8
or 1.4 per cent to 1,675.6 in turnover of ADollars 230m, up from ADollars
199m.
Currency considerations supported the natural resources sector, as BHP
jumped 32 cents to ADollars 13.90 and Western Mining gained 20 cents to
ADollars 4.95.
The banking sector was firm in spite of news that the International Banking
Credit Analysis agency had downgraded Westpac's long-term debt rating and
put ANZ's long-term debt on watch. Westpac and ANZ each rose 6 cents to
ADollars 4.36 and ADollars 4.81 respectively.
TAIWAN underwent a technical correction in the wake of its 7.6 per cent rise
since the start of the year. The weighted index lost 8.09 to 4,939.07 in
turnover of TDollars 48.71bn, after TDollars 45.27bn. Dealers said more
profit-taking was likely if the index went through 5,000.
NEW ZEALAND gained ground on better than expected domestic inflation news.
Annual inflation in 1991 fell to a 31-year low of 1.0 per cent. The NZSE-40
index closed 25.38 or 1.7 per cent higher at 1,503.70 in turnover of
NZDollars 29.8m, against NZDollars 31.0m.
Trading was boosted by some block sales, including 5m shares in Brierley
Investments which changed hands at NZDollars 1.06. The stock closed a cent
higher at NZDollars 1.06. Fletcher Challenge firmed 10 cents to NZDollars
3.40, Carter Harvey Holt 8 cents to NZDollars 2.28 and Lion 3 cents to
NZDollars 3.93.
MANILA responded to Wall Street's strength. The composite index advanced
23.84 to 1,260.50 as turnover rose to 132m pesos from 122m.
The telephone blue chip PLDT led the market upwards with a 30-peso gain at
970 pesos, in the wake of its overnight rise in New York. Food and beer
company San Miguel saw its class 'A' shares close a peso higher at 74.50
pesos.
Oil shares continued to fall on profit-taking after their surge on Monday on
news that recoverable reserves at the Linapacan A-2 oil field in
southwestern Philippines could hit 200m barrels.
SINGAPORE strengthened on news that the government-controlled DBS Bank had
lowered its interest rates and by assurances that limits on foreign
ownership of companies would not be lifted. The Straits Times Industrial
index ended 20.71 or 1.4 per cent higher at 1,509.30 in turnover of SDollars
235.47m, up from SDollars 110.3m.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index climbed 5.65 to 552.28 in volume of MDollars
92m (MDollars 57.9m). Leading the gainers was Genting, which firmed 50 cents
to MDollars 12.10. Resorts World advanced 40 cents to MDollars 10.50 and
Malaysian International Shipping foreign shares appreciated 35 cents to
MDollars 8.00.
BANGKOK finished firmer across the board following gains in foreign stock
markets. The SET index closed 10.89 stronger at 742.99 after turnover of
Bt5.76bn, the heaviest in two months. Siam Cement gained Bt12 to Bt656, Siam
City Cement Bt2 to Bt140 and Jalaprathan Cement Bt12 to Bt680. Bangkok Bank
was unchanged at Bt538.
JAKARTA closed lower, with the official index down 1.27 at 250.14. Trading
was slow and turnover contracted to 2.97m shares, from nearly 4m the day
before. Astra International came under strong selling pressure and fell 300
rupiah to 11,300 rupiah.
BOMBAY soared to a record closing high for the second time this week on
speculative buying fuelled by an amnesty on repatriating foreign funds. The
BSE index added 22.11 or 1.1 per cent at 2,020.18.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent rises across the
board on Dow's advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street's record high on Tuesday, and a varying weight of local
influences were advanced as reasons why bourses climbed yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT found strong domestic reasons for its gains which were
considerable, the DAX index accelerating to a 38.97, or 2.4 per cent rise to
1,667.50 after the FAZ put on 14.15, or 2.1 per cent to 672.67 at
midsession.
Mr Jens Wiecking, for Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that German equities
were a special situation, having underperformed the world for nearly two
years during which foreigners had been selling the market, on balance.
This year's recovery, he said, was built on the anticipation of the
Bundesbank easing its monetary policies and a subsequent bull market. It
started with the Anglo Saxons but continental investors followed yesterday,
boosting German market volume from DM6.4bn to DM12bn on one estimate.
Meanwhile, the focus on individual sectors shifted again. Banks, after a
period of relative strength, were quiet despite a further drop in the
Bundesbank's average bond yield from 8.18 to 8.15 per cent.
In conventional cyclicals the big blue chip carmakers, which had taken over
from the banking sector, were outshone by chemicals, where Hoechst put on
another DM13.30 to DM248.80; and among bombed out stocks the construction
group, Philipp Holzmann, closed DM63 higher at DM1,138.
PARIS rose to its highest level since last October as Wall Street's record
rise overnight prompted domestic institutions to go on a buying spree. The
CAC 40 closed 29.82 or 1.6 per cent higher at 1,873.62, off the day's high
of 1,884.6, in heavy turnover of FFr3.9bn after Tuesday's FFr2.5bn.
Gains were across the board. Peugeot jumped FFr26 to FFr700 after positive
comments from its chairman on the previous day. In the oil sector, Total
added FFr34 to FFr1,1088 on its optimism about its Colombian oil find, and
Elf gained FFr5.90 to FFr371.20.
Among smaller stocks, Canal Plus rose FFr22 to FFr1,050 in relatively good
volume of 117,575 shares.
ZURICH offered easing Swiss interest rates and the firm dollar in addition
to the Dow as justification for the Credit Suisse index advance of 1.5 per
cent or 6.9 to 470.7.
Nestle bearers, SFr210 higher at SFr9,140, topped the active list after
Tuesday's news that the company might be considering a ten-for-one stock
split. Banks were led higher by CS Holding which added SFr65 to SFr1,925; in
chemicals, Sandoz registered rose SFr60 to SFr2,640; and in insurers, lifted
by interest rate hopes, Winterthur bearers put on SFr160 to SFr3,840.
BRUSSELS was also lifted by Wall Street. The Bel20 index closed 34.35 or 3.1
per cent higher at 1,149.21 in unusually heavy turnover of BFr1.95bn.
Generale Bank was the most active stock, rising 2.6 per cent to FFr6,360
with 45,600 shares traded.
MILAN saw some domestic sellers at the start but then there was a scramble
to buy as other European bourses continued to rise. The Comit index rose
9.55 to 547.46 in turnover estimated at slightly better than Tuesday's
L125bn.
Stocks due to be transfered to screen-based trading today, the start of the
new trading account, were strong. Benetton rose L480 or 4.2 per cent to
L12,000, Sip added L48 to L1,538, Italgas put on L85 to L3,580, Italcementi
rose L395 to L21,600, and the transport company, Gottardo Ruffoni, climbed
L85 to L2,340.
Pirelli continued to rise ahead of its capital increase, putting on L43 or
3.9 per cent to L1,123. The stock reached L1,170 after hours.
MADRID's general index rose 5.19, or 2 per cent to 258.50, impressed by the
drop in consumer price inflation from 6.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in the
year to December, 1991.
AMSTERDAM closed higher in active trading. The CBS Tendency Index rose 2.3
or 1.9 per cent to 120.3 in turnover swollen by Friday's expiration on the
European Options Exchange.
STOCKHOLM made gains in heavy trading, encouraged by overseas strength and
falling domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 16.1
or 1.7 per cent to 974.7 in volume of SKr728m after SKr417m.
Astra continued to dominate trading, as turnover in its shares tripled to
SKr191m from SKr60m. Astra A rose SKr18 to SKr588.
OSLO jumped 2.1 per cent, the all-share index ending 9.33 higher at 452.46
in active turnover of about NKr460m. Industrial stocks led the rally. Norsk
Hydro, following a period of relative weakness, rose NKr6 to NKr145.
COPENHAGEN finished off its best as the CSE index closed 3.01 higher at
365.29. HELSINKI's Hex index put on another 15.92, or 1.8 per cent to 877.12
but free shares did better with a 2.5 per cent gain.
VIENNA surged in lively business to a six-week high on hopes that German
interest rates have peaked. The ATX index rose 24.58 or 2.6 per cent to
962.23, its highest close since December 4.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox tries to make up lost
ground - London's troubled commodity futures exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S RAW sugar market moves from screen trading back to floor trading
tomorrow as the troubled London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) embarks
on a year of readjustment after its property futures debacle.
Traders around the world will be watching closely what happens to the raw
sugar market, which only 12 months ago was switched to screen trading in a
move to boost rapidly fading volumes. The decision to move it back to the
floor was taken in September, a month before Mr Mark Blundell, then chief
executive, resigned after having initiated trades in the screen-traded
property futures market.
In December the Securities and Futures Association fined five brokers
between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 80,000 for creating a false impression of
investor interest in the market.
Fox has been a pioneer of screen trading, but its experience has not been
happy. The white sugar market, launched in 1987, was the first market to be
put on screens and has remained relatively successful. But since then
contracts in rubber, rice and property have been launched and closed. The
base metals index contract was trading reasonably well until the property
futures scandal, when volumes collapsed, while an arabica coffee contract
has attracted little attention.
One of the first actions of Mr Phillip Thorpe, the new chief executive, was
to order a review of the exchange by Arthur Andersen, the accountancy group,
and he expects the results shortly. 'It will be an audit of where we are and
a blueprint of where we want to be,' he said this week.
But he is clear that Fox will be concentrating on its core agricultural
contracts in the short to medium term. He also insists that he has no
preconceptions as to how they should be traded - floor or screen.
The exchange is very much the creation of a succession of mergers. It was
not until 1986 that the coffee, cocoa and sugar markets merged in order to
defray the costs of regulation under the Financial Services Act. In 1990 the
exchange merged with the Baltic Futures Exchange, taking over contracts in
grains, potatoes, meat and freight futures.
The degree of merging, however, has been limited by the individuality of the
markets. Mr Piers Fletcher, a director of both London Fox and GNI, the
futures broker, believes the hearts of the original three individual markets
have not been in co-operation. 'The merger was never fully consummated,' he
says.
For several years GNI, a member of all the Fox markets, has consistently
pushed the idea that all the markets should be traded on a single floor
using a pit system, like the London International Financial Futures Exchange
or the big US commodity markets. This would enable traders to cross from one
pit to another, following the active markets.
However,the sugar, coffee and cocoa market committees have retained their
autonomy at Fox, and Mr Fletcher concedes that the cocoa committee, which
runs Fox's most successful market, would point to recent events as a good
reason for hanging on to control.
Mr Thorpe agrees that one of the key issues Fox has to address is whether
members want a strong central authority or an umbrella over individual
markets. 'We have to decide what the exchange is for,' he said. 'Is it to
introduce new contracts? To service markets? Or is it just a regulatory
umbrella?'
He is also certain that Fox will have to organise itself in order to
maximise the benefits of the mergers. 'Only the most efficient markets will
survive, and Fox has got to be competitive.'
Mr Michael Overlander, chairman of the exchange's sugar market committee,
does not underestimate the difficulty of re-establishing London's raw sugar
market.
'We know we have an uphill task. We also recognise that this is a last ditch
attempt at success,' he said this week. There was no clear single reason why
the volume had disappeared from London, although the trading world had
changed drastically, and the number of players was far smaller than five
years ago.
Several companies and assorted locals (traders who operate on their own
account) will staff the raw sugar floor, which will trade on a pit system
between the coffee ring and the agricultural contracts. The companies
include Sucden (UK), Refco Overseas, Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Pierson ICS and
GNI.
Fox also points out that about 70 traders attended a registration meeting
last week, indicating a strong interest in the new market.
However, Czarnikow, one of London's biggest physical sugar traders, will not
be manning the new floor. Mr John Barnaby, managing director of Czarnikow
Sugar, said the group simply did not have the business to justify a presence
on the trading floor. He did not rule out using the London market, via local
traders, if his clients wanted to use it, but 'very few of our clients want
to use it. The major users of raw sugar - the big producers and buyers - now
use New York as the medium for raw sugar pricing,' he said.
Mr John Darling, a director of ED &amp; F. Man, said that as a major
international sugar house his company was committed to the market as far as
it could be, with three registered traders based at the nearby coffee ring
and freight futures pit. 'We are well disposed to act quickly,' he said
yesterday, but there were no indications that volumes were going to leap.
The company would man the sugar floor full time 'as soon as it became
economically viable'.
Mr Overlander is convinced there is still a desire to trade raw sugar in
London, pointing out that there are basic differences between the London and
New York contracts offering opportunities for arbitrage. Mr Fletcher
believes the market stands a good chance of survival if the big players use
it.
Mr Fletcher is also optimistic about Fox's future, pointing out that while
all three soft commodities have been in the doldrums together, there is good
reason to believe cocoa and coffee are heading for better times. 'We ought
to see the present circumstances as an opportunity to build up the
exchange,' he said.
Mr Thorpe believes the freeing up of agricultural policies will greatly
boost the potential of the exchange's grain contracts, and research will
continue into a European grain contract. But the exchange will be very
careful about launching contracts in future. Adding a new market may not be
complicated or expensive, but that is not a reason to put it on the screen,
he said.
Meanwhile Fox would be concentrating on the products it already has, which
people want to trade, he said. 'We are very conscious that we need to show
that we run well as an organisation. We want the exchange to be approaching
1992-93 with a very strong foundation.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Financing difficulties delay
Anglesey base metals project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENT OF Britain's first big base metals mine for decades, at Parys
Mountain, Anglesey, is being seriously delayed by financing difficulties.
Anglesey Mining, the company floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1988 to
develop the Parys Mountain property into the UK's biggest-ever metals mine,
is now seeking a joint venture partner to bring the project back on track.
The zinc-lead-copper mine was scheduled to come into operation early in
1993. Anglesey says that production can start 15 months after financing is
completed.
Plans also call for the mine to produce a steady stream of authenticated
Welsh gold for which there are customers who will buy at a premium to the
market price.
Anglesey so far has spent about Pounds 8.5m on the project and now needs
another Pounds 25m to take it through to production.
Two banks, the Swiss Bank Corporation and the Bank of Scotland, agreed in
October to provide project loans of up to Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.5m) and
Anglesey also received a Pounds 2m Welsh Office assistance grant because the
mine will create 147 jobs.
However, raising the equity part of the package has proved impossible so
far. Most of Anglesey's shareholders seem keen to subscribe for new shares
but its biggest shareholder, Imperial Metals, a Canadian mining company
which owns 43 per cent, is not able to.
Like nearly every other metals mining company in the world, Imperial is
suffering from present very low prices and it has other projects requiring
capital.
Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, a director of Kleinwort Benson Securities,
Anglesey's advisers, said two companies were studying joint venture
proposals but any arrangement obviously would take some time to work out.
Two of the likely candidates, Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, and
Minorco, the offshore investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of
South Africa, had been approached but indicated that they would prefer to
concentrate on projects in Ireland in which they had interests, he added.
A Parys Mountain feasibility study suggested that, by milling 250,000 tonnes
of ore a year, the mine would produce concentrates containing 13,000 tonnes
of zinc, 5,700 tonnes of lead and 2,500 tonnes of copper. The mine would
also produce about 5,000 troy ounces of gold of which 2,500 to 3,000 ounces
could be recovered by Anglesey and authenticated as 'Welsh' gold.
During pilot plant testing, more than 2,000 tonnes of ore was processed and
about 250 tonnes of metal concentrates were sold to the Pasminco smelter at
Avonmouth.
Parys Mountain has a long mining history dating back to Roman times. During
the late 18th century it was one of the world's largest copper mines,
supplying much of the metal required for Britain's Industrial Revolution.
About 3.5m tonnes of rock was moved by hand, pulled up from a growing pit by
ropes and eventually the mountain contained the biggest man-made hole in the
world - a record that was not overtaken until the 1890s. Mining eventually
ended in 1911 after 143 years of almost continuous activity during which an
estimated 130,000 tonnes of coper was produced.
The site is owned by the Marquess of Anglesey who will collect substantial
royalties if the mine eventually proves profitable.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussel blow for dairy hormone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday agreed a report on Bovine Somatotrophin
(BST) that brought to the forefront its concerns that the growth hormone
would run counter to its efforts to reduce farm output.
The interim report follows last month's endorsement by the council of
ministers of a further, two-year moratorium on licensing the hormone, which
boosts the output of dairy cows by between 12 and 25 per cent, according to
different studies.
The report and the council decision together amount to 'a clear signal that
chemically based production improvements are not likely to be a feature of
the future', a commission official said. This is a blow to Monsanto and Eli
Lilly, the two companies seeking authorisation for hormones they have
developed, which some analysts believe could create a Dollars 1bn market
worldwide.
The commission report accepts that BST has no discernible effect on humans
who consume milk and dairy products from cows treated with it. The hormone
meets 'quality' and 'efficacy' criteria as well, though there is an animal
welfare consideration because the need to inject it daily causes swelling
and mastitis.
But the report notes that 'a veterinary medicinal product may not be
authorised. . . if its use would contravene the rules and objectives laid
down by the community within the framework of the common agricultural
policy'.
Plans to overhaul the CAP envisage sharp price and output cuts, to deal with
overproduction, which in the dairy sector is running at 15 per cent, despite
the use of ever more restrictive quotas. Widespread use of growth hormones
would drive a coach and horses through this strategy.

FT  16 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices paid for wool in Australia this week show little overall change
compared with closing sales before the Christmas recess. Drought effects
have tended to lower prices for finer categories, while well-grown broader
types have become slightly dearer. There is trade confidence in a firm price
outlook for the rest of the season, with demand matching reduced supply.
This is despite no sign of demand from the old Soviet Union areas, nor
payment of wool debts due from there.  The market indicator was 576c/kg,
which compares with 578c/kg at the closing sale in December.

Aluminium bounced higher on the LME after a wave of buy stops were triggered
in the afternoon. Traders said that dealer buying and option covering took
three-month metal above Dollars 1,160 a tonne, touching off sizeable US
customer buy-stops. The rise accelerated sharply before sufficient profit
taking and hedge selling built up to prevent a close above the next
resistance point at Dollars 1,190. The move was seen as mainly technical,
and although it might still have a little way to run it would need the
support of consumers if it was to be sustained. And it was not likely they
would chase the market higher with so much surplus metal available, traders
said. Copper prices closed higher in the wake of aluminium. In contrast tin
bounced down to a new contract low of Dollars 5,485 a tonne for three-month
metal before buying re-emerged. Silver moved ahead on the London bullion
market after a day of active and volatile trade which moved the market onto
a positive chart footing. But one dealer said silver would have to breach
resistance at 425 cents a troy ounce to achieve a break through into a new
trading range. Silver dragged gold ahead, but producer selling was seen
capping rises at the upper end of the new range between Dollars 352 and
Dollars 358.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMINCO AND Teck, the Vancouver-based mining groups, have thrown their
weight behind the Louvicourt copper, zinc and gold deposit in central Quebec
by shouldering a large chunk of the development costs and acquiring a 25 per
cent equity stake in the project.
The two companies will acquire their stake from Aur Resources, a junior
mining group, in return for a cash payment of CDollars 15m (Pounds 7.3m)
plus a contribution of 55 per cent of the next CDollars 100m in development
costs. The contribution also covers Aur's share of the costs. Aur will
retain a 30 per cent interest in the project.
The deal thus values Louvicourt, considered one of the most promising base
metal projects in Canada, at a total of CDollars 180m. Construction costs
are estimated at CDollars 326m.
The Louvicourt mill is due to start up in 1994 at a rate of 640,000 tonnes a
year. Full production of 1.8m tonnes is scheduled for 1997. Metal output at
full capacity is expected to reach 215m lb of copper, 53m lb of zinc, 36,000
ounces of gold and 960,000 ounces of silver.
Mr Raymond Goldie, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, said
besides high grades and large tonnages, Louvicourt benefited from being
close to existing infrastructure, such as roads and power supplies. The
mine, near the town of Val d'Or, will also be close to a smelter operated by
Noranda, the Toronto-based resources group.
Because the deposit is adjacent to a mine that was closed in the mid-1970s,
Mr Goldie expects the environmental review process to proceed relatively
smoothly.
The remainder of the project will be financed by Louvem Mines, which has a
45 per cent equity interest. Louvem is 51 per cent owned by Noranda.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEAT FUTURES prices at the Chicago Board of Trade bounced yesterday after
early profit-taking following the previous two days of rises, which had
taken them to life-of contract highs .
By mid-morning, the spot contract had risen 1.25 cents to Dollars 4.1425,
while May wheat rose by 1.75 cents to Dollars 3.99, July by 3.25 cents to
Dollars 374.5 and September by 3.5 cents to Dollars 377.
The increases came after some contracts had fallen by several cents. Wheat
has been rising since the US Agriculture Department revealed at the start of
the week that farmers had planted fewer acres of winter wheat and that wheat
stocks were at their lowest point for almost two decades. World wheat stocks
are also low.
Adding to the price pressures are continued good demand and below par
growing conditions for the winter wheat crop, said grain analyst Mr Richard
Feltes of Refco.
Some analysts are suggesting that wheat could rise to as much as Dollars 5
per bushel, though tough price resistance is expected at Dollars 4.50.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Fears for future of long bond
trade - The CBOT's unease about possible Treasury moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea floated by Washington to curtail issuance of 30-year Treasury bonds
has drawn heavy fire from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's
largest futures exchange.
Futures and options based on the US long bond accounted for about two-thirds
of the exchange's 1991 trading volume. The CBOT believes a halt of 30-year
bonds by the US Treasury would 'cripple' it.
Exchange officials and some bond market experts say that with fewer Treasury
bonds, or without them altogether, investors could move into other
derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. Treasury bonds are
currently the world's most actively traded security, and they are considered
the benchmark against which all other dollar-denominated long-term
instruments are measured.
While some believe that the CBOT's trading, generated by investors
speculating on interest rates or using the futures market to hedge, will
switch - in the event of a halt in long bond issuance - into its futures and
options in the lower maturities of two-year, five-year and 10-year Treasury
notes. Mr Thomas Donovan, the exchange president, said: 'I don't think a lot
of it will shift.' He feels investors with long-term exposure will seek a
long-term hedge.
An announcement about the possible curbing of sales of the long bond is
expected before the quarterly refunding of US government debt on February 5.
The idea of cutting back on long bonds surfaced last month when Mr Nicholas
Brady, the Treasury secretary, told a congressional hearing that his
department was 'taking a look at the question of whether the Treasury should
stop issuing long-term bonds.'
Some academic and business economists, including Mr Martin Feldstein and Mr
Henry Kaufman, say that switching government funding to shorter maturities
could save the US government as much as Dollars 1bn or more a year in
interest payments and help stimulate the stagnant US economy.
By decreasing the supply of long bonds, supporters say, their price would
rise and their yield fall. Currently, the yield curve from short to long
maturities is very steep, with a top-to-bottom difference of more than 3
percentage points: with the yield on the long bond currently at about 7.5
per cent. If long bond yields declined, proponents argue, mortgage rates,
which are calculated by long-term yields, could also fall, freeing up more
consumer spending.
Those opposed, such as Mr Robert Giordano, chief of economic research at
Goldman Sachs, say that eliminating long bonds would be a mistake. He says
the effect on long-term yields is likely to be minimal and, consequently,
the savings for the US government would be trivial in the larger scheme of
high federal deficits and government debt worth Dollars 3,000bn.
Moreover, Mr Giordano and other opponents argue that the government would
subject itself to the vicissitudes of short-term interest rates and possibly
end up squeezing businesses out of the shorter-term market, where they
typically finance themselves.
Eliminating long bonds altogether looks a less likely option than curbing
their issuance. Some Dollars 50bn had been expected to be issued during the
next 12 months.
Mr William Griggs of Griggs &amp; Santow, a New York investment advisory firm,
said: 'The feeling in the street is that they will cut back by Dollars 2bn
to Dollars 3bn (on long bonds in February refunding).'
Given that most of the CBOT's futures and options trading is built on new or
current issues, even a curtailment worries the exchange. Hedging and
arbitrage activity is heaviest in the futures market at the time of, and
immediately following, issuance, though portfolio turnover provides some
trading volume after that time.
The exchange, which has significant political clout, has been lobbying
against the move. Not only did it fire off a letter of protest to Mr Brady,
but it complained to Mr Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful chairman of the House
ways and means committee.
Such concern is uncalled for, however, according to Mr Richard Sandor,
managing director of Kidder, Peabody. As the former chief economist for the
CBOT, he designed its Treasury bond futures contract. He said: 'A diminution
of supply will not necessarily dampen activity in the futures market.'
He noted that as trading activity is driven into the two-, five- and 10-year
Treasury notes - and more of them will have to be issued to make up for a
decrease in 30-year bonds - volume at the exchange could actually pick up.
The CBOT already has experienced significant growth in its trading of
futures and options based on lower maturity Treasury securities over the
last year. For example, trading in five-year Treasury note futures and
options contracts grew 34 per cent and 48 per cent respectively over 1990.
Nonetheless, exchange officials are concerned.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Further supply of dollar paper
saturates market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS a further supply of paper continued to emerge yesterday, despite
increasingly confused views on the direction of the Treasury market, the
dollar sector of the Eurobond market began to look saturated.
The US Treasury bond market appeared to find support at a yield level just
above 7 1/2 per cent on the long bond, suggesting that the market may have
undergone a correction which is now complete.
However, a rally in Treasuries at this stage, with spreads at such tight
levels, would be likely to force spreads to widen. 'Even if the Treasury
market steadies, spreads are likely to widen, because of the heavy supply of
paper,' one head of syndicate said.
Not only has the excess appetite for dollar securities at the start of the
year been filled, but many bond desks are now holding substantial amounts of
recently-issued paper which has not yet been placed. In addition, the
quality of new issues has begun to falter.
For most of the six further new issues totalling Dollars 1.3bn in the market
yesterday, demand was decidedly slack. Spreads in some of the more
tightly-priced issues showed signs of widening: the spread on Credit Local's
10-year deal shifted to 33 basis points from 28 basis points at launch,
while Denmark's five-year deal has widened from 20 to 25 basis points over
the curve.
Of yesterday's new issues, corporate and financial names generally met
weaker demand. Dealers said there was little incentive to buy a Dollars 200m
issue of four-year bonds for ABB International, the Swiss-Swedish
engineering group, priced to yield 50 basis points over the interpolated
yield curve.
Lead-manager Morgan Stanley International reported strong demand in
Switzerland, but most traders said the issue was too aggressively priced.
Kommunekredit, a Danish financial institution which tapped the market for
the first time yesterday, also proved hard to place. The deal was considered
aggressively-priced for a virtually unknown name.
A Dollars 300m issue of 15-year bonds for KFW International, the German
financial institution, is expected to fare rather better because of the
strong credit of the government-owned borrower.
Elsewhere, a matador issue for Bancomext, a Mexican bank guaranteed by the
Mexican government, met strong demand, and was quoted at its par issue
price. The deal is the first matador deal for a Mexican borrower other than
the government.
Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank continued its heavy schedule of
issuance with two more deals, in the wake of its two offerings on Tuesday.

HONG KONG'S broking community yesterday signaled its desire for a calmer
life when it unanimously elected Mr Charles Lee Yeh Kwong chairman of the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Mr Lee, 55, is an independent member of the stock exchange's council, and
takes the helm after a tempestuous year which witnessed confrontation with
the Securities and Futures Commission, the colony's financial watchdog.
After a long battle, the SFC forced the exchange to change from a club run
for the benefit of small Chinese brokers to one that represented a broader
range of broking interests and the public.
One council member said after the meeting that it was reassuring that Mr Lee
was elected unanimously. He had shown that he could garner support from both
the independent members of the council and, importantly, from the local
Chinese brokers.
After his election last night Mr Lee struck a conciliatory note. He said the
business of the exchange was to protect the interests of the investing
public, and he aimed to work closely with the SFC and others in the tasks
that lay ahead.
Mr Lee said the council looked forward to the development of Hong Kong
markets in 1992 with the planned introduction of financial products such as
traded options, short selling and other hedging instruments.
'Underlying and vital to these new developments would be the provision of a
modern infrastructure such as a centralised electronic clearing system,
including an automatic trade matching and execution system,' he said.
Mr Lee, is a lawyer and has been the convener of the exchange's listing
committee since October 1990 and a member of the exchange's council since
October 1987. He is a director of more than 20 listed companies. Mr Kwan
Cheong Yiu and Mr Alex Wu Shu Chih were elected first vice-chairman and
second vice-chairman respectively.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Commodities business faces
threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL wrangle between the London Clearing House and several banks is
threatening to disrupt the financing of commodities business in London.
As a result, talks have been held between the clearing house, banks and
exchanges over whether changes to the settlement arrangements are necessary
to encourage some banks to continue to provide finance to the markets.
The dispute arises out of the collapse a year ago of Woodhouse Drake &amp; Carey
(WDC), a medium-sized London commodities trader. Some banks which financed
WDC's trades are in dispute with the clearing house to recover assets over
which they claim to have security.
Separately, the clearing house is in dispute with customers of Woodhouse
Drake &amp; Carey (Commodities), WDC's futures broking subsidiary, who are also
trying to recover assets which were held up in the clearing system.
Mr David Hardy, LCH managing director, said the dispute arose out of a
'failure of some banks to understand how delivery of commodities takes place
in London'. Once commodities pass into the clearing system, any security
interest of a bank over them lapses, he said.
However, some banks which lent money to finance WDC trades, taking in return
security over the commodities concerned, are attempting to enforce their
security interest. While the dispute continues, the banks involved are
reported to be concerned about advancing more money to commodities
businesses.
Mr Hardy said talks had been held to explore ways of meeting the banks'
concerns over the way the settlement system operates. 'Maybe you could find
a way to recognise their interest,' he said.
Meanwhile, the clearing house is being challenged over its decision to use
assets belonging to Woodhouse clients to offset liabilities of the failed
group, rather than bank guarantees which had been given for the purpose.
Mr Harsh Kumar, whose company, Afexp Commodities, stands to lose about
Pounds 300,000 as a result, said that the clearing house's actions meant
that clients of London commodity brokers could no longer rely on recovering
their assets once in the clearing system.
The clearing house is proposing to meet Woodhouse debts by applying some of
the Pounds 1.2m of Woodhouse clients' money which it holds.
The decision to use client money comes in spite of the fact that the
clearing house holds Pounds 3m, representing guarantees pledged by banks to
cover Woodhouse's trades. Under the LCH proposal, this money would be
returned to the banks, even though the guarantees were specifically given to
meet any liabilities of Woodhouse to the clearing system in the event of
failure.

MR SIMON THORP, the head of gilt-edged securities trading at Salomon
Brothers International in London, left the company yesterday, writes Sarah
Webb.
The company said Mr Thorp has been replaced by Mr Andrew Duthie and Mr Robie
Yuniacke. They will act as joint heads of the gilts trading desk. No reason
was given for Mr Thorp's departure.
Salomon Brothers, a market-maker in gilt-edged securities, made a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 8.38m in 1990 on gilt operations with a capital base of
Pounds 59m at the end of that year.
Salomon Brothers has been hit by a wave of staff departures - both enforced
and voluntary - in recent weeks. Most of these, however, have been on the
equity side. However, on the fixed income side, Mr Simon Meadows, the firm's
head of bond syndication, resigned last week to join Credit Suisse First
Boston as co-head of debt syndication.

STANDARD and Poor's, the US rating agency, and several Spanish organisations
plan to establish an agency in Madrid to evaluate the full range of debt
issues in the domestic Spanish capital market, Reuter reports from London.
The group also includes the Madrid, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges,
Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO) and Compania Espanola de Seguros de
Credito a la Exportacion (Cesce).
S&amp;P hopes to launch the rating agency in the summer or early autumn. It said
it was unable to provide details about the capitalisation of the new agency
or the breakdown of shareholdings.
The new agency will assess the bonds and commercial paper programmes of
corporations, financial institutions, utilities and local government
authorities, as well as structured financings.
Mr Antonio Zoida Martinez, vice-president of the Madrid Stock Exchange,
said: 'The introduction of ratings in Spain is a necessity which has been
recognised for some time, both by issuers and investors, to clarify risk
levels for debt securities.'
The partners have signed a letter of intent, but the transaction is subject
to a definitive shareholder's agreement.

Continental Bank team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKELEY Govett, the US fund manager best known for investment trusts under
the John Govett name, has poached a team of institutional fund-raising
specialists from Continental Bank.
Berkeley Govett has Dollars 4bn equivalent under management and is quoted in
London with a market capitalisation of around Pounds 100m. Its latest
recruits comprise the private equity group formerly with Continental Bank in
London. The team includes Mr John Hess, Mr John Lowing and Mr Ian Simpson.
The team raises capital from European institutional investors for specialist
funds. This can be for outside fund managers, such as work on Fidelity's
quoted Latin American Capital Fund.
The team also develops independent projects, such as the syndicate of
investors gathered to back property development in Berlin.
It will now be developing funds under the Berkeley and Govett names and will
continue to raise capital for outside fund managers.
The departure from Continental means further shrinkage of the London
operation of the US bank. Like many other US financial institutions faced
with difficult market conditions at home, Continental has been aggressively
'downsizing' international operations.
Offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Paris, Frankfurt and Brussels have
closed. While London will remain Continental's primary European base, the
number employed has fallen from 400 to a target level of 'below 200'.

THE St George Building Society, Australia's largest non-bank savings and
loan institution, yesterday said it planned to apply for a banking licence
and a full listing on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).
St George, with assets of about ADollars 9bn, (USDollars 6.6bn) will become
Australia's sixth largest bank if the application for a licence is approved
by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the society's members.
A banking licence would give St George improved access to the inter-bank
payments system, and lower its cost of funds by bringing it under the direct
supervision of the RBA.
'We have been operating like a bank and competing against the major banks
for many years. We believe that our members and shareholders are now
entitled to the benefits that banks have,' said Mr Jim Sweeney, managing
director.
He said he had spoken to the RBA, and expected St George to begin banking
operations on July 1. 'I have every indication that I should be confident,'
he said.
St George said it would continue to concentrate on its residential loans
business, which has helped protect it from the bad debts incurred by many
Australian banks through corporate lending activities.
The society is based in Sydney, but recently expanded into Victoria through
the acquisition of the Victorian Savings and Loan Society, based in
Ballarat. Further expansion into Queensland is likely if the society is
awarded a banking licence.
St George's application for a full listing on the ASX follows the exchange's
decision to exempt building societies from regulations requiring
shareholders' voting power to be proportionate to the number of shares held.
The change of rules will allow building societies and other mutually owned
financial institutions to maintain provisions in their articles of
association providing for one vote for each member.
St George shares were trading at ADollars 7 on the unlisted market before
the announcement, capitalising the society at ADollars 690m. St George
reported interim net profits of ADollars 20.3m for the six months to the end
of November, up 3.6 per cent on the comparable period of the previous year.
St George was one of several building societies to show interest in applying
for a banking licence after the successful transformation of the New South
Wales Permanent into the Advance Bank of Australia in 1985.
Bank of Melbourne, Perth's Challenge Bank, and Metway Bank in Brisbane also
once traded as building societies.

AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday turned in a
14 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net earnings on the back of strong sales
of several drugs for women.
For the three months to end-December, the company earned Dollars 372.6m, or
Dollars 1.18 a share, against Dollars 328.2m, or Dollars 1.04, a year
earlier. Last year's earnings included a large one-time gain which lifted
net income by about Dollars 35m in the quarter.
Sales in the 1991 fourth-quarter rose 13 per cent to Dollars 1.82bn from
Dollars 1.61bn.
For the full year, net income grew 14 per cent to Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars
4.36 a share, from Dollars 1.23bn, or Dollars 3.92, in 1990. Sales advanced
11 per cent to Dollars 7.08bn from Dollars 6.78bn.
Non-recurring items in 1990 added about Dollars 105m to American Home
Products net income last year.
Although the results were in-line with analysts' expectations, its shares
eased Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 at midday yesterday.
The company surprised Wall Street in the third quarter with exceptionally
strong earnings, but it continues to lag behind the leading pharmaceutical
companies, such as Merck.
Its pre-tax income increased 12 per cent in the fourth quarter. For the full
year, earnings before taxes fell 4 per cent, reflecting several one-time
items.
Excluding extraordinary items, pre-tax income rose 18 per cent in 1991.
Sales are increasingly driven by its pharmaceuticals business, and in 1991
pharmaceuticals sales rose 16 per cent to Dollars 4.02bn.

prices

MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian mining group, yesterday blamed lower base metal
prices and coal production problems for a 76 per cent fall in net operating
profits to ADollars 16m (USDollars 12.3m) for the six months to December 15.
The group made a profit of ADollars 61.7m after an abnormal profit of
ADollars 45.7m from the sale of its interest in Teck Corporation as part of
a deal in which it doubled its shareholding in Cominco, the zinc, lead and
copper producer, to 22.5 per cent.
However, after net exchange losses of ADollars 2.1m and minority interests
of ADollars 12.1m, net profit attributable to shareholders was ADollars
47.5m, an increase of 28 per cent on the comparable period of the previous
year.
MIM said sales fell from ADollars 935m to ADollars 840m, mainly because of
lower metal prices - copper prices fell by 15 per cent, lead by 32 per cent
and zinc by 27 per cent.
Copper production at the Mount Isa mine in Queensland was adversely affected
by contamination difficulties and abnormal winds on smelter operations.
The Oaky Creek coking coal operation suffered a loss of ADollars 24m for the
six months, mainly because of delays in the changeover from the first panel
in the longwall unit. Production from the second panel began in late
December.
MIM said that base metal prices remained weak because of a lack of demand
caused by the recession.
It added that signs of recovery in the US appeared to have been premature.
The directors declared an unfranked interim dividend of 2 cents a share, a
reduction of 1 cent on last year's interim dividend.
Highlands Gold, a 65 per cent subsidiary of MIM, reported net profits of
K26.9m (Dollars 28.3m) for the six months, compared with K10.5m the previous
year.
Highlands said the result was largely due to its share of production from
the Porgera gold mine, in the highlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Highlands has a 30 per cent interest in the project, co-owned by Placer
Pacific (30 per cent), Renison Goldfields Consolidated (30 per cent) and the
PNG government (10 per cent.)
Highlands said that its share of Porgera sales for the six months amounted
to 197,800 ounces of gold and 63,400 ounces of silver, which provided
revenue of K40.7m before tax.
The company said Porgera had 'passed an important milestone' in the second
quarter, when a number of important construction projects were completed,
increasing the gold recovery rate.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 2 toea per share.

earnings

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Paper, the large US forest products group, announced a 33 per
cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, once special charges are stripped out
of the figures.
The company blamed this mainly on the sluggishness of the US economy and
said it expected difficult business conditions to continue early this year.
Fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars 66m, or 59 cents a share, including
a Dollars 4m after-tax special charge for an accounting change and a Dollars
37m one for severance costs. In the fourth quarter of 1990 earnings totalled
Dollars 23m, or 20 cents a share, after a Dollars 137m charge for a business
improvement plan.
Without the special charges, 1991 fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars
107m, compared with Dollars 160m the previous year.
Mr John Georges, chairman, added that sales and earnings in the fourth
quarter 'about equalled second and third-quarter levels as the domestic
economy remained stagnant'.
Full-year earnings totalled Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, after
Dollars 231m of special charges, compared with Dollars 569m, or Dollars 5.21
a share in 1990 after Dollars 137m of special charges.
Sales dipped 2 per cent to Dollars 12.7bn.
Mr Georges said the company's packaging and distribution business reported
stable quarter-to-quarter earnings.
Timber and wood products businesses had higher earnings while domestic
linerboard benefited from increased demand and prices.

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENGOLD, the gold arm of the Gencor group, saw attributable profits drop
sharply in the December quarter as a result of a weaker gold price and
higher capital expenditure.
Profits after tax and capital expenditure dropped by 56 per cent to R22.4m
(USDollars 8m) from R51m in the September quarter. The December figure is,
however, in line with profits earned in the March and June quarters.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said the figures disguised positive trends
which augured well for the rest of the year.
The main cause of the lower profits was an R18m increase in capital
expenditure to R52.3m compared to the previous quarter. Future capital
expenditure will be lower.
Profits were also hit by the lower average gold price received by the 11
mines in the group. At R32,578 per kg, it was 2.4 per cent lower than the
R33,385 price of the previous quarter. Total gold produced during the
quarter rose by 1.6 per cent to 18,114kg, at an average grade of 5.1
grams/tonne.
Total working costs rose by 3 per cent to R499.5m, but Mr Maude said this
reflected the build up for increased production, particularly at Winkelhaak
and Unisel.
Both mines have started increasing production and will continue to do so
throughout the year. They have recruited extra labour, following a long
period of retrenchments.
Of the five large mines in the group, St Helena and Buffelsfontein did well
to produce more gold and decrease unit costs; Kinross and Beatrix had steady
quarters while gold output increased at Winkelhaak.
Of the marginal mines, Grootvlei, a mine threatened with closure a year ago,
continues to improve its performance, while Mr Maude said West Rand Cons was
battling to stay alive.
Commenting on Gengold's recently introduced hedging operations, Mr Maude
said they were increasingly using the options rather than the futures
market.
He said they felt this was a much more responsible method of hedging because
it did not involve putting more physical product on to the market and hence
reduced the prospect of depressing the bullion spot price.

MOTOROLA, the leading US electronics and semiconductor manufacturer,
reported improved fourth-quarter results, buoyed by the performances of its
semiconductor, cellular telephone and paging businesses.
Fourth-quarter income rose to Dollars 126m, or 96 cents a share, from
Dollars 109m, or 82 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1990. Sales for the
quarter rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.93bn in the same
period last year.
Fourth-quarter results reflected 'sluggish economies in the US and Europe',
said Mr George Fisher, chairman and chief executive.
'This impact should continue to be felt in the first half of 1992 with the
potential for modest economic growth in the second half.'
Sales for the full year increased 4 per cent to Dollars 11.34bn, from
Dollars 10.88bn in 1990. However, earnings declined to Dollars 454m, or
Dollars 3.44 per share, from Dollars 499m, or Dollars 3.80, in the previous
year.
Motorola said sales of its communications products rose 2 per cent in 1991,
against the previous year, while semiconductor products sales rose 7 per
cent.
However, the company's computer sales fell 2 per cent and the information
products group recorded increased operating losses for the year. The company
also recorded losses due to investments in a proposed global communications
system called Iridium.
Military and government sales fell 8 per cent, in spite of a significant
contract for secure telecommunications equipment from Saudi Arabia. The
automotive and industrial electronics group reported an 8 per cent increase
in sales.

Anglovaal

<TEXT>
A TURNROUND in the performance of the marginal Loraine mine allowed the four
gold mines in the Anglovaal group to increase net profits by 14 per cent to
R41.6m (USDollars 14.9m) in the December quarter, writes Philip Gawith.
Last year, management announced that a return to profitability - following
an R18.9m loss in the year to September - meant Loraine should be able to
stay open for at least a further year.
The mine made a R2.8m profit in the December quarter, against a R2.6m loss
the previous quarter, after a rationalisation of the mine's operations.
However, the mine has to secure satisfactory hedging prices for at least
half its production. The gold price has declined to R31,000/kg, compared
with R32,700/kg when the announcement was made.
Hartebeestfontein, which produces more than 80 per cent of the group's
profits from gold, had a steady quarter, with profit after taxation of
R34.4m, virtually unchanged from the previous quarter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRAGNOTTI &amp; Partners Capital Investment (C&amp;P), the investment group formed
by Mr Sergio Cragnotti, which includes several leading international banks
among its shareholders, yesterday sealed its purchase of Fedital, the
loss-making Italian foods group.
The acquisition, which followed a three-round auction last month, marks a
double first.
Firstly, it represents C&amp;P's first European acquisition as part of its plans
to assemble a portfolio of businesses in the food industry. The food sector
is one of the three areas, alongside packaging and detergents, identified by
Mr Cragnotti as ripe for investment.
Since its formation last year, C&amp;P has spent heavily to buy companies in
both other areas. However, purchases in the foods sector have so far been
limited to CICA, a large, privately-owned Brazilian tinned foods group.
The sale of Fedital also marks the first large asset disposal by the special
commissioners and court supervising the affairs of Federconsorzi, the
bankrupt Italian farm services group.
Fedital, which has a sizeable market share for long-life milk in southern
Italy, specialises in dairy and cheese products.
In spite of its established Polenghi Lombardo trademark, other bidders for
the company are believed to have been dissuaded by the considerable
uncertainty surrounding the group's accounts.
Under the sale agreement to C&amp;P, the L55bn (Dollars 46.3m) offer price can
be cut by L10bn subject to the findings of an audit now under way.
Mr Cragnotti, who used to run the Enimont chemicals joint venture, said C&amp;P
would recapitalise the group and seek agreement with unions on substantial
job cuts.
C&amp;P remained interested in other purchases in the foods sector, notably in
the event of disposals by the state-owned IRI holding company.

ADAM OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, raised turnover last
year by 15 per cent to around DM27bn (Dollars 17bn) and increased its sales
in Germany by 26 per cent to 719,000 cars, Mr Louis Hughes, the chief
executive, said.
He also warned that excessive pay rises this year could endanger jobs in
Germany. 'I am very worried about wage developments in Germany,' he said.
The IG Metall trade union this week set a 9.5 per cent ceiling for regional
pay claims; last year's pay settlement in the engineering sector was 6.7 per
cent.
Mr Hughes declined to give any indication of Opel's profits for last year,
but said the result would again be one of the best in the German motor
industry. In 1990, net profits advanced by 18 per cent to DM1.3bn.
He said the jump in sales in 1991 occurred despite a 5 per cent fall in
production caused by the replacement of the Kadett by the new Astra family
model; the difference was made up by imports from other GM plants in Europe.
This year, Mr Hughes expected the German new car market to decline after
last year's surge in demand after unification.
'We expect a marked drop in the German market from 4.2m to around 3.5m
units,' he said. This would be a 17 per cent drop, but sales in 1992 would
still equal the second best year in western Germany.

stake

NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals conglomerate, plans to sell
for an undisclosed amount its remaining 50 per cent stake in its battery
division to S E Del Acumulador Tudor (Grupo Tudor) of Spain, one of Europe's
leading battery companies.
It was in March 1990 that Tudor bought the first half of the battery
division from Neste. In a statement, Tudor said its intention was to create
a pan-Nordic subsidiary company with an annual SKr1bn (Dollars 170m)
turnover, specialising in the production of batteries for vehicles and
industry as part of the group's European restructuring programme.
'The Neste battery division has made large losses and the group needs a
strong owner,' said Mr Ulf Hogland, vice-president of the Tudor group.
Efforts are being made to reduce the division's costs which Tudor says are
too high in a very competitive market.
Since 1987, the Spanish company has cut its labour force in the Nordic
region to 750 from 1,400 and rationalisation will continue.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: European sales offset GM, Ford
losses in N America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FORD and General Motors yesterday announced record sales in western Europe
last year, helping to offset their sharply deteriorating market performances
and heavy losses in North America.
Ford, second behind GM in North America, outperformed its rival in Europe,
claiming 1.58m sales, compared with GM's 1.565m.
Ford's sales increased by 4 per cent, or 28,000 units, on 1990, and by 2 per
cent on the previous record year of 1989.
GM sales set a record for the seventh year in succession, but were up only 1
per cent - or 15,000 units.
With total west European car sales still being finalised, the precise market
shares of both companies have yet to be identified. Both, however, are
expected to trail well behind the market-leading Volkswagen group.
Ford said its Fiesta model set its own sales and production records to
become the best-selling model in its class. Both sales and output rose by 2
per cent, two 615,000 and 620,000 respectively.
Despite a poor reception for the latest Escort/Orion range in the UK, sales
throughout the region as a whole jumped by 24 per cent last year, to
620,000.
Sales of Ford's larger cars, Sierra and Scorpio, declined; Sierra by 0.4 per
cent to 271,000 and Sierra by 0.2 per cent to 69,000.
In percentage terms at least, by far the biggest sales jump for Ford - from
1,200 to 7,200 - came in sales of US-produced cars, particularly its Probe
coupe. Ford expects a boost from the Probe from 1993, when it is expected to
be sold in right hand drive form as the Capri in the UK.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Porsche cuts payout as income
falls 70%

<TEXT>
PORSCHE, the German maker of luxury sports cars, has cut its dividend after
a steep slide in profits caused by recession-hit foreign markets and high
provisions for job cuts.
Group net income fell by 70 per cent to DM17m (Dollars 10.6m) from DM57m in
the year ended July 1991 and the dividend on the voting shares, owned by the
Porsche and Piech families, goes down to DM9 from DM12 a share. That on the
preference shares falls to DM10 from DM13.
Because of the provisions, Porsche finished with a much worse result than
expected. The company had warned that net profits would be around DM50m.
Mr Walter Gnauert, finance director, said the provisions totalled some
DM60m, including the cost of shedding 550 non-production workers. The
dollar's decline had reduced operating profits by DM66m, while model changes
had held back production. Earnings per share were down to DM23 from DM68.
Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive, said the weak state of some car markets meant
last year's sales and profit levels would not be achieved this year. 'This
is a difficult phase for Porsche,' he said.
Unit sales would drop further to around 25,000 in 1991-92 from 26,200. This
compares with 30,200 in 1989-90 and 50,000 in 1986-87, just before Porsche's
sales and profits collapsed as a result of the weak US market.
Last year, Porsche's performance in the US again deteriorated. Turnover
there was 26 per cent lower, compared with a 15 per cent decline in other
foreign markets. In Germany, however, sales jumped by 39 per cent. Group
turnover eased by 1 per cent to DM3.1bn, of which cars accounted for
DM2.4bn.
Mr Bohn said Porsche, which has been subject to intense takeover
speculation, could absorb the sales decline.
Mr Gnauert said Porsche had net liquid funds of DM620m. Cash flow was DM273m
against DM297m.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Olivetti reveals difficulties
with 5% decline in demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computers and office equipment group,
yesterday gave an insight into its trading difficulties by announcing a
decline in sales of around 5 per cent to L8,600bn (Dollars 7.17bn) for last
year.
No figures for profits were released. However, some analysts expect the
company to report a loss of at least L200bn for 1991, compared with net
earnings of L60.4bn in 1990.
At a press conference held to coincide with the group's move to a simplified
operating structure, Mr Elserino Piol, Olivetti's director for central
operations, was confident that measures now under way would restore
profitability this year.
The downturn has been particularly acute in Europe. According to industry
sources, European demand for computer hardware fell by 4.9 per cent in
1990-91 and would be static in 1991-92, while prices fell by 35 per cent to
40 per cent in 1990-91.
Mr Bruno Lamborghini, Olivetti's director of economic research, warned that
oversupply, coupled with soft demand and the continuing shift to smaller but
more powerful computers, meant further price cuts were inevitable this year.
However, the reductions were likely to be less severe than in 1990-91.
Olivetti intends to confront the crisis with a mixture of innovation, cost
savings in the form of across-the-board labour cuts and further transfers of
production from Europe to cheaper manufacturing regions such as Singapore.
In stormy meetings with unions last week, the company called for a further
2,500 job cuts in Italy this year. Unspecified redundancies are also
expected at the group's foreign operations, which employ around half its
47,000 workforce.
Olivetti hinted that cuts could hit its Triumph Adler subsidiary in Germany,
which has already closed one plant in Frankfurt.
The decision to move production outside Europe would focus on lower-cost
products, such as office equipment, in which Triumph Adler specialises.
Olivetti's presence in office equipment products would be 'rationalised,' it
warned.

FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Treuhand to rule on petrol bids

<TEXT>
THE TREUHAND agency's managing board is to choose today between rival bids
for eastern Germany's lucrative Minol petrol stations which are being sold
in combination with the loss-making Leuna refinery.
A British Petroleum-led consortium including Total, the French oil company,
Norway's Statoil, Agip of Italy and the Austrian OMV, is competing against a
consortium led by Thyssen Handelsunion which includes Elf-Aquitaine,
partly-owned by the French government, and Deutsche SB-Kauf.
Minol made a profit of DM250m (Dollars 158m) in 1990 while the obsolescent
Leuna refinery contributed 50 per cent of the DM2.1bn turnover of Leuna
chemical works which had losses of DM360m last year. The Treuhand is selling
them as a package in order to find a buyer for the hard-to-sell refinery
which is closely integrated with the Leuna chemical plant.
A Treuhand official said the Thyssen-led consortium appeared to have an
advantage as it was offering more than DM5bn in investments to build a new
Leuna refinery and pipeline and to modernise the petrol stations. One of the
agency's conditions was that the new owner must supply the chemical plant
with advantageously-priced products.
BP, which entered the east German market soon after the collapse of the
communist regime, had been confident that this had put it in a favourable
position, an official said. However, BP did not obtain the subsidies it had
counted on. Both London and Paris lobbied strongly in Bonn.
Minol's 1,300 petrol stations in eastern Germany have higher sales per pump
than equivalent stations in the west and the company is expected to profit
heavily from the sharp growth in car ownership.

flat

HENKEL, the German chemicals and consumer goods maker, increased sales last
year by about 8 per cent, but net profits are expected to be about the same
as 1990's DM429m, Mr Helmut Sihler, chairman, said yesterday.
Confirming the purchase, announced in Stockholm last week, of the Barnangen
household and personal products company from Sweden's Nobel Industrier, Mr
Sihler said the acquisition had cost DM900m (Dollars 569.6m). It had
increased turnover in cosmetics to 10 per cent of the group total.
Henkel had achieved 'critical mass' in several European markets. 'Cosmetics
is now a very profitable business,' Mr Sihler said, although a greater
presence in Britain would be welcome.
Barnangen is best known in Britain for Aapri skin care products, in France
for Le Chat, and in Germany for Vademecum toothpaste.
Household detergents and cleaning products, a Henkel speciality accounting
for 32 per cent of group sales, comprise 15 per cent of Barnangen's
turnover. Personal products, including the Fa and Poly brand names, account
for a further 76 per cent.
The deal includes between DM150m and DM200m of debt, Mr Sihler added. It
would be funded from group reserves and borrowings.
Henkel expects sales in the current year to increase from DM12.9bn in 1991
to around DM14bn.
