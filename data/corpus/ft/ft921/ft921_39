FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Drummond to call for Pounds 2.5m via rights
issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUMMOND Group, the worsted and wool textile company, is to raise about
Pounds 2.5m net of expenses via a rights issue.
Ordinary shareholders will be entitled to apply for the new shares on a
1-for-2 basis. Preference shareholders will receive 0.3853967 new ordinary
shares for each share held.
The issue of the new shares at 39p each is dependent on shareholder
approval. Dealings are expected to commence on February 10.
Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, together with his family interests and
Chargeurs Textiles, have irrevocably undertaken to take up their
entitlements totalling 3.17m new shares (46.37 per cent).
Over the past three years the group has invested more than Pounds 9.5m in
new machinery and acquisitions, and further capital expenditure is planned.
the proceeds of the rights issue will be used initially to reduce
borrowings, which stood at about Pounds 5.9m on January 5 1992.
The board forecasts that pre-tax profits for the year ending March 31 1992
will exceed Pounds 1.1m, while a final dividend of 0.75p, lifting the total
from 1p to 1.5p, is also forecast.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Foundations targeted in pursuit of Pounds
1.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pursuit of Pounds 1.3bn missing from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's public
companies has homed in on six secretive Liechtenstein foundations and two
Swiss companies, writes Bronwen Maddox.
The six foundations or 'stiftungs' - Corry, Allandra, Baccano, Akim, Kiara,
and Jungo - have been targeted by accountants Arthur Andersen and
liquidators of the collapsed Maxwell empire in their search for the missing
millions.
Most of the missing money appears to have flowed out from the public
companies Maxwell Communication Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers and
their pension funds to the web of 400 private Maxwell companies - and then
out again to Liechtenstein, Switzerland, the US and Panama.
Arthur Andersen, who are administrators of the private companies under UK
insolvency laws, now suspect that some of these foundations were used to
conceal the origin of funds.
The Swiss-based companies Yakosa Finanzierungs and Servex are thought likely
to have had a central role in the alleged scheme in which Mr Maxwell
illegally supported the share price of MCC, now the subject of an
investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: First Leisure rises to Pounds 30.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST LEISURE, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling and tourist attractions
group chaired by Lord Delfont, yesterday announced a 4 per cent improvement
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 30.4m after what it described as the most
difficult year since the company was set up in 1983.
Lord Delfont said he expected tough trading conditions to continue
throughout most of this year. He said the first half of the current year
would be particularly difficult and would coincide with the planned closure
of Blackpool Tower and several discotheques for redevelopment.
Mr John Conlan, chief executive, said the group was looking into the
possibility of acquiring some of the assets of Themes International, owner
of Windsor Safari Park, which went into administrative receivership earlier
this month.
Mr Conlan said the company was interested in Themes International's bowling
alleys and would also look at the safari park. He added, however, that
discussions were at an early stage.
First Leisure's profits for the year to October 31 1991 were boosted by a
strong performance from snooker and the ten-pin bowling business.
The strong performance of First Leisure's snooker activities is in part due
to the rise in unemployment and the increase in the number of people looking
for activities to fill their day.
The sports division, which includes bowling, snooker and the Chichester
Marina, saw profits rise 31 per cent to Pounds 12.8m on turnover of Pounds
26m (Pounds 21.8m).
Profits from discotheques were flat at Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 13.5m) on
turnover slightly up at Pounds 41.6m (Pounds 38.5m). Mr Conlan said this
sector was the first of the company's businesses to feel the effects of the
recession, as competitors discounted prices heavily to increase market
share.
The group is in the process of redesigning its discotheques to give them a
more futuristic, high-tech look. Mr Conlan said the last redesign of the
discotheques, in the mid-1980s, had attempted to give them a similar look to
the lounge of a luxury hotel.
Profits at the group's tourist facilities, which include all three Blackpool
piers and the Winter Gardens conference centre, fell to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds
14.1m) on a small advance in turnover to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 38.7m). Mr
Conlan said visitor numbers were down, and those tourists who did visit the
attractions were spending less.
Depressed conditions in London's West End, where the company has a stake in
the Prince of Wales and Prince Edward venues, saw profits from theatres fall
to Pounds 728,000 (Pounds 1.1m) on turnover of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.2m).
The company announced last November that Mr Cameron Mackintosh, the
theatrical producer, had agreed to increase his 20 per cent interest in the
Prince of Wales and the Prince Edward to 50 per cent.
Group turnover increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 108.7m (Pounds 102.3m).
Earnings per share rose from 15.62p to 15.67p and a final dividend of 3.95p
(3.5p) is proposed, making a total of 5.695p, a 13 per cent improvement on
last year's distribution of 5.05p.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hanson nearer continental buys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the acquisitive conglomerate, yesterday said it was more likely to
buy into continental Europe now that the rules governing hostile bids were
clearer.
At an analysts meeting in Paris, Mr Peter Harper, chairman of Hanson's UK
industrial division, said: 'We want to move into continental Europe. The
opportunity for such a move we have not yet discovered.'
He said Hanson had always been held back from buying a European company by
the thought it could be thwarted by hidden laws, but now the European
Commission has the power to rule on cross-border EC buys. 'We applaud that
power,' he said. The shares yesterday rose 8 1/2 p to close at 212 1/2 p.
Hanson last year unsuccessfully pursued a merger with Imperial Chemical
Industries, partly to give it new businesses outside its Anglo-American
base.
For the year ended September 1991, turnover by geographical location, was
Pounds 3.8bn in the UK, Pounds 3.5bn in the US and just Pounds 327m in the
rest of the world.
Analysts interpreted the announcement as evidence that Hanson had also
decided that a UK hostile bid was too difficult in the present political
climate. However, Mr Harper reiterated that Hanson was keeping its options
open over its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI.
Mr Harper added that Hanson would still prefer a friendly acquisition on the
Continent.
He said Hanson's borrowing power stood at Pounds 15.8bn after paying for
Beazer, the building and materials group.
Hanson had been looking for opportunities in continental Europe for the last
three to five years, Mr Harper said.

<TEXT>
CROWN Communications, the radio broadcasting company which owns London's LBC
station, plunged into the red last year as losses mounted at its French RFM
subsidiary. There is no dividend.
The total deficit for the 12 months to end-September came to Pounds 6.79m,
compared to taxable profits of Pounds 611,000 last time. Turnover rose from
Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 23.8m.
Mr Brian MacLaurin, corporate affairs director, said RFM incurred losses of
almost Pounds 3m.
Losses were also incurred at IRS, Crown's advertising arm.
Gearing, which stood at 200 per cent before the Pounds 4.5m rights issue in
October, was down to 100 per cent. This would be further reduced by the sale
of non-core assets.
During the year, Crown sold its stakes in Southern Radio for Pounds 3.8m and
Radio Forth for Pounds 1.3m. However, interest charges rose by Pounds 1m to
Pounds 2.8m, due to delays on those sales.
Losses per share deepened from 1.3p to 22.9p.

<TEXT>
Seton Healthcare Group has agreed to sell SePro Healthcare, its US
subsidiary.
The medical and sports equipment group said that to benefit fully from
developments in the US health market, it would need a sales force outside
the hospital market.
However, it had decided that SePro could not undertake this development
cost-effectively on its own, and it would be better to concentrate
management resources on the many opportunities in the UK.
Tecnol Medical Products will acquire SePro's Warm'N Form and Ice Bag product
ranges for about Dollars 2.75m, (Pounds 1.5m) of which Dollars 900,000 will
be paid to the former owners of Warm N' Form in lieu of outstanding payments
under a previous agreement.
Acme United Corporation will acquire the remaining healthcare assets for
Dollars 4.35m, payable over seven years.
Acme, which already distributes Seton's range of wound dressings, will
acquire the US rights for several of Seton's other UK manufactured product
ranges for an initial Dollars 2.5m, part of which will be satisfied by a
small stake in Acme.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dividend rise lifts Southern Business
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Southern Business Group, the photocopier supplier which came under
fire 18 months ago for its contractual practises, yesterday jumped 15 per
cent as the company announced a modest rise in annual profits from Pounds
14m to Pounds 14.4m.
Analysts said the share price, which closed 14p up at 106p, took heart from
the decision to lift the final dividend from 1.62p to 1.91p, making a total
of 2.94p.
Profits were struck on turnover ahead 9 per cent at Pounds 51m. The group
claimed forward contracting income - the total value of all its contracts -
of Pounds 300m at the end of the year to September 30. The average life of
Southern's contracts has been reduced from about nine years to six.
Mr Roger Limpenny, finance director, said the company had spent a
considerable amount of 'time, energy and money rectifying our past
misdemeanors'.
He was referring to accusations that Southern had offered onerous contracts,
sold by salesmen employing high pressure techniques. The sales force had
been retrained and Southern now boasted an endorsement from the Plain
English Campaign on its revised contracts.
Mr David McErlain, managing director, was equally anxious to quash any
lingering doubts about Southern's practices. 'The criticisms caused us to
take a long hard look at our company . . . That (in turn) enabled us to come
in with results which have more than shown we have held our own in a
difficult marketplace.'
Earnings per share rose from 9.67p to 10.07p.
COMMENT
Reporting an increase in profits and turnover at a time when your main
customers - small businesses - are falling at a rate of knots is not bad
going. Then, to raise the dividend 15 per cent - indicating that 1992 is
likely to be even better - will leave many competitors green with envy.
Southern is rightly proud of generating so much cash last year, but that is
partly a consequence of slower growth. When recovery comes, the company,
which grew at an annual compound rate of 20 per cent between 1984 and 1990,
is likely to have to return to shareholders for cash. For next year,
forecasts are pitched at Pounds 16.1m, giving a prospective p/e of 9.5. For
the moment, the shares appear to be undervalued.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ScottishPower joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER yesterday set up a joint venture company with Utilicorp
United, the US gas and electricity utility, to compete with British Gas in
supplying commercial and industrial customers in Scotland.
ScottishPower thus becomes the third British electricity company to form a
joint venture with Utilicorp in gas supplies. Midlands Electricity and
Eastern Electricity joined up with Utilicorp in the second half of last
year.
ScottishPower will be responsible for the marketing and administration of
the new venture while United Gas, the UK wholesaling subsidiary of
Utilicorp, will be responsible for supplying the gas, which will be
transmitted through existing British Gas pipelines.
The new venture, which is named Caledonian Gas but will trade as
ScottishPower, is owned 75 per cent by the Scottish company and 25 per cent
by Utilicorp. It will compete with British Gas on price and also on service,
according to Mr Martin Fleming of ScottishPower.
British Gas is open to competition for customers taking 25,000 therms or
more of gas a year. ScottishPower expects that in due course the threshold
will be lowered to 2,500 therms and that by 1996 the government will throw
the domestic gas market for large households consuming at least 600 therms a
year open to competition.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thames Water pays Pounds 59m for US and
German acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES WATER, the largest of the UK's privatised water companies, is
strengthening its environmental engineering activities with the acquisition
of a German engineering design and contracting business and a US
manufacturer of municipal water treatment products for a total consideration
of just under Pounds 59m.
Thames, which has been one of the most aggressive groups among the
privatised water companies in diversifying out of its core regulated water
business, is acquiring Mitteldeutsche Wasser-und Umwelttechnik AG Halle
(UTAG), and FBL Holdings (Leopold), based in Pittsburgh.
The acquisitions, among the largest foreign purchases to date by water
companies since privatisation, will bring Thames's non-water business
turnover up to Pounds 250m. The deals will give Thames possibly the highest
proportion of unregulated earnings among the privatised water companies.
Mr Mike Hoffman, chief executive, said that the acquisition of UTAG, was a
strategic move that would enable the group to strengthen its presence in
continental Europe.
Germany, in particular among European markets, provided a significant
opportunity as investments totalling up to DM10bn (Pounds 3.5bn) per year
were expected to be made over the next ten years to bring eastern Germany's
water supply and waste water standards up to EC levels. It would also
position Thames to move further into both eastern and western European
markets.
The group won a strongly-contested battle to take over UTAG from the
Treuhand agency. It put in the highest bid at Pounds 33m and
has pledged to retain 935 jobs which, together with investments, will bring
additional investment in the German company to about DM20m, according to Mr
David Luffrum, finance director. UTAG has annual sales of DM131m.
The acquisition of Leopold for Dollars 44m (Pounds 25.9m) will strengthen
Thames's presence in the US. Leopold's experience in the municipal sector
will complement Thames's operations through LA Water Treatment in the US
industrial water treatment market as well as provide an important route for
distributing group products in the US.
LA Water Treatment is expected to achieve turnover of about Pounds 10m while
Leopold's for the year to end-May is expected to be about Dollars 30m.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Exceptional costs drag Asda into heavy loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the struggling grocery chain, yesterday reported an interim pre-tax
loss of Pounds 68.8m as it suffered from falling operating profits, a
mounting interest bill and a string of exceptional charges.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 58.4m to Pounds 10.1m in the 28 weeks to
November 9 but the company was dragged into heavy loss by exceptional costs
of Pounds 78.9m relating to reorganisation charges and property write-downs.
The City had been braced following an earlier warning from the company. Mr
Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'In the
circumstances it was about the best outcome we could have hoped for.'
Asda's sales grew from Pounds 2.25bn to Pounds 2.3bn but operating profits
fell from Pounds 107m to Pounds 74m in difficult trading conditions.
Asda's grocery stores produced profits of Pounds 84m (Pounds 100.9m) on
sales slightly ahead at Pounds 2.2bn. But losses from the Allied Maples
furnishings business amounted to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 3.2m) and the Gazeley
property business saw profits fall to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 9.3m). The
interest charge rose to Pounds 63.7m (Pounds 44.4m).
The exceptional costs split as follows: the recent financial restructuring
cost Pounds 11.1m; head office rationalisation, including the loss of 350
jobs, Pounds 9.6m; write-off of capitalised distribution start-up costs,
Pounds 19.1m; and provisions against its development properties at Gazeley,
Pounds 39.1m.
Asda accepted it had paid too much for the 60 superstores it bought from
Gateway for Pounds 705m in 1989 - implying that a current asset revaluation
would include a further write-down in the year-end accounts. Losses per
share came to 5.71p against earnings of 2.9p the year before. An interim
dividend of 1.25p was recommended against 1.85p last year.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Realism impresses more than magic: There are no sweeping
solutions to Asda's problems, says Archie Norman, chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Archie Norman, who has been chief executive of Asda for less than a
month, yesterday achieved the rare feat of impressing the stock market by
saying almost nothing about the future of the troubled grocery group.
'We are not coming in in a swashbuckling way and saying that we have the
magic formula for Asda. What we have to do is look at the assets of the
business and see whether there is potential for doing something better with
them,' he said somewhat prosaically.
Yet his comments - and the company's better-than-feared results - added 19
per cent to Asda's market value as its shares closed 5 1/2 p higher at 34
1/2 p.
Mr Norman's refusal to suggest sweeping solutions to Asda's deep-seated
problems was appreciated by analysts, who said the approach smacked more of
realism than reticence. 'After all, he has probably not even got sensible
answers to his questions yet,' said Paul Smiddy, food retailing analyst at
Kleinwort Benson.
But analysts can see the outlines of Asda's immediate strategy. It can be
summed up in Mr Norman's statement: 'It is essential to make Asda's core
business work.'
Over the past few years, Asda's grocery chain has lost much of its appeal
while its rivals' offerings have forged ahead.
The new management's immediate priority is to restore credibility with
customers by improving Asda's pricing proposition, sharpening its product
offering and improving the physical appearance of its stores portfolio.
Already the company has taken several initiatives on the price front. It
froze the price of 30,000 items in the run-up to Christmas and has recently
introduced a range of 200 lower-priced products at its underperforming
stores. Next week, Asda will launch an extra value promotion featuring
hundred of products at 'substantial' reductions.
According to the company such initiatives are already bearing fruit; market
research studies show Asda to be offering more competitive prices than at
any time since 1987.
The company's products will also be scrutinised. Asda's George range of
clothing - produced by Mr George Davies of Next fame - has been doing 'quite
well' with clothing sales up 25 per cent. But home goods, which account for
the bulk of non-food sales, lack 'authority' and tie up capital in
slow-moving stock.
As well as the all-important task of winning back customer loyalty, Asda
must exploit its market position and assets far more effectively.
The company runs 200 superstores with more than 8m sq ft of selling space.
It has annual sales of Pounds 4bn with particularly strong market shares in
Scotland and North England. At great expense, it has built eight composite
distribution centres supplying over 80 per cent of its food sales and has
introduced information technology systems at all its stores.
Yet as the company readily admitted: 'This asset base is significantly
underperforming against its profit potential.'
Mr Norman yesterday expressed dismay at the 'lousy' way Asda used its sales
information. 'I cannot tell you whether our canned vegetables are profitable
or our toys. But the systems that we now have in place give us the
opportunity to do that,' he said. Such improvements are an obvious priority.
But cleansing the Asda stables of the results of mismanagement is the easy
task; finding a horse for the company to ride away on will be a much harder
one.
Asda accepts it has lost the 'me-too' battle it fought with the industry
leaders, Sainsbury's and Tesco. But it has yet to develop a viable formula
for ensuring future prosperity. 'It is going to be a very exciting task but
it clearly has a lot of risk attached to it,' said Mr Norman.
One immediate problem is the poor performance of Asda's 49 older stores  -
some of them 25 years old - where sales slipped 6 per cent during the half
year.
It remains an open question whether it is worth investing heavily in these
outlets and some of the more hopeless stores will no doubt be swiftly
closed. But the company may choose to use some of the space more creatively
 -perhaps adopting a different trading format as Gateway has done by
launching its Food Giant discount stores at its loss-making superstore
sites.
Intriguingly, Asda said new store formats and pricing strategies would be
tested with the 'expectation of roll-out from 1993 onwards'.
But the company has little time to tackle these concerns. It is suffering
from weak sales as a result of the recession while watching its competitors
increase the competitive heat with big store-opening programmes.
In spite of its recent Pounds 357m rights issue, Asda is saddled with debts
of Pounds 668m which it will find difficult to pay down simply from trading
profits.
This raises the prospect of it selling Allied Maples, its furnishings
business, or disposing of its 25 per cent stake in MFI, the furniture group.
But the company cannot count on selling assets in the current climate and
analysts suggest it may yet have to look for further financing perhaps
through a convertible bond issue.
Mr Norman yesterday seemed under few illusions about the gravity and urgency
of the problems confronting him. 'History does not matter to Asda any more.
Survival does,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Brent Walker has any fans left, they might profit by studying the steady
rise of First Leisure. Since its flotation in 1984 it has outperformed the
market by more than 200 per cent, while its market capitalisation has risen
tenfold to Pounds 460m. Granted, yesterday's earnings were only marginally
up on the year before, and that only because of a lower tax charge. But the
performance was still remarkable when set against the leisure sector's
decline.
The trick has been simple enough. From the start, First Leisure avoided high
gearing in favour of cautious expansion and tight cost controls. It refined
its markets - unglamorous niches like ten-pin bowling and discotheques - and
offered customers an attractive combination of comfort and value for money.
When consumers start spending again, it should justify its historic rating
of 19 times earnings. Until then, it can quietly chip away at competitors'
market share.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's 19 per cent rise in the Asda share price might seem a generous
response to an interim retained loss of Pounds 106m, or 16 per cent of the
group's market value. But the Pounds 10m pre-tax profit before exceptionals
was rather better than expected; and if the exceptionals were worse, that
doubtless testifies to the reforming zeal of the new management.
The snag is that the group's new strategy has not yet been formulated, let
alone published. It remains worrying that, with Gateway also searching for a
role, some 20 per cent of the UK grocery industry depends for its future on
finding gaps in the market. Asda prefers to point to its huge asset base and
the transformation that would ensue if it were put to productive use. But
with the grocery market faltering, it could still all go wrong. The prudent
strategy for investors is to wait for hard evidence, even at the risk of
missing the early part of any rise.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's initial 4 per cent jump in British Gas shares on its
capitulation to the Office of Fair Trading showed how little faith the
market had in the gasman's willingness to bow to the inevitable. The fact
that the gain then all but evaporated was a more realistic measure of the
difficulties Gas faces. Having claimed that its ability to meet shareholder
expectations on dividends would be hampered unless its regulator also
climbed down, Gas can do little more than put on a brave face while it is
broken into pieces.
The shares will increasingly suffer a two-way pull, with their yield
attraction diminishing as their break-up value is clarified. The message
will doubtless not be lost on investors in BT. As Sir Bryan Carsberg
prepares to leave Oftel, his counterpart at Ofgas has shown what a
determined regulator can achieve. A new incumbent at Oftel might choose to
take up the challenge: a new government might conceivably require it.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: US markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US markets have been strikingly unanimous in signalling expectations of
economic recovery this week. The dollar and equities have risen, if with
some hesitation on the part of the latter yesterday: the bond market has
been soft. This determination to call the turn is all the more curious given
the absence of hard evidence that recovery is under way. On the contrary,
Tuesday's retail sales figures pointed to continuing weakness.
Pessimists would argue there is no general message in the various market
trends. Thus, it may not be so much a case of dollar strength as of D-Mark
weakness, caused by worries about strike action in Germany. The bond market
faces a glut of Treasury issues over the next few weeks. Investors are
switching into equities from low-yielding money market funds.
It nevertheless seems increasingly likely that last month's discount rate
cut has in fact laid the ground for recovery. There is increased scope both
for corporations and consumers to improve their cash flow by refinancing
debt, and for higher banking margins which should stimulate credit growth.
The uncertainty for the markets is thus not whether an upturn is on the way,
but more over its strength and timing. It may not set in until the second
quarter or even later.
Until then, there is a risk of setbacks. Negative indicators may yet
discourage equity investors and prompt the exchange market to question how
quickly interest rates will harden again. In any case, at these levels the
equity market is already pushing its luck. It could not advance much further
without appearing to discount a boom. That would be self-defeating, as the
Federal Reserve would be forced once again to slam on the brakes.

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: A costly policy from Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,537.1 (+20.8)
Companies do not survive for long with a cost structure 43 per cent above
what is needed to offer shareholders an acceptable return. That is perhaps
the most fundamental reason why the Lloyd's insurance market will be forced
to act quickly on the many sensible recommendations put forward yesterday in
the report led by Mr David Rowland. Given his reputation for knocking
Sedgwick into shape, Mr Rowland is a credible taskmaster.
Even his apparently savage target expense ratios, though, could prove
optimistic. They assume, for example, that underwriting results and
investment income at Lloyd's will return to the average levels of the period
1979-1988, years which apart from the final one were highly profitable. It
could be that worldwide capacity reductions and hardening premium rates in
some areas like marine and aviation herald a sharp turnround in the
insurance industry's fortunes. It would be unwise to count on it.
The main surprise yesterday was the report's proposal that the divestment
rules in the 1982 act should be reversed. It is possible to argue that
tighter regulation today takes care of the conflict of interest problem, and
that ownership of underwriting agencies by the brokers will encourage
stability. Quoted agencies tend to be poorly understood by investors and
follow a different cycle. That apart, the unspoken message of the report is
that Lloyd's needs its brokers more than the other way round.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Sterling has many defences
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing that has yet happened since the UK joined the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) in October 1990 casts any more light on whether it joined at
the correct exchange rate or not. Those who argue that rate is too high are
in effect saying that a lower average real wage is required to secure
external and internal balance at a high level of employment, and that a
nominal devaluation is more likely to bring this about than maintaining the
pressure on pay settlements under the ERM.
The recent debate has not, however, been about this fundamental issue. The
clamour to escape from the constraints of the ERM comes mostly from people
looking for a way of reducing British interest rates irrespective of what
the Bundesbank does. Too many of them cherish the illusion that there is a
compromise policy called a realignment (Eurospeak for devaluation), which
would restore interest rate freedom to Britain while allowing it to remain
in the system and thus avoid too much loss of face on Mr John Major's part.
They forget that UK interest rates would have to remain competitive with
German ones at the new parity - with a more unfavourable differential than
the 1 percentage point or so now prevailing. The link with German interest
rates would remain even in a multilateral realignment in which the D-Mark
moved up against several leading currencies - in any case a pipe-dream,
which the French government, which would have to be the main player, has
ruled out.
What is astonishing is how modest the pressure on sterling has been despite
the unceasing clamour in The Times, Sunday Times, Evening Standard and
related organs, for a large interest rate cut at all costs, irrespective of
the ERM. So far there has been little difficulty in maintaining sterling
within the prescribed band.
If sterling did come under serious pressure, the first obvious line of
defence would be to take advantage of the full 6 per cent band, and allow
sterling to fall nearer its D-Mark floor. Such a move would increase the
losses risked by speculators against the pound.
Second, if that is not enough, there remains a huge potential for central
bank intervention even before the D-Mark margin is reached. The combined
British and German foreign exchange reserves are committed to the defence of
sterling to prevent a breach of the margins.
Base rates would be increased, however reluctantly, if the reserve drain
became too large. But this is only the third line of defence. However
politically distasteful, it would not be as catastrophic politically for the
government as a humiliating departure from the ERM which like other 'dashes
for freedom' would end in yet higher interest rates as Messrs Kinnock and
Smith coped with the ensuing sterling plunge.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's report offers no solution to 'outsiders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLAUD S CECIL GURNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Once again we get exactly what we should have been expecting from a
group headed by a Lloyd's 'insider' - a clever set of suggestions as to how
the 'insiders' can go on obtaining enough 'outsiders' to continue to rip
them off in the future.
We could have hoped for a few more imaginative ideas from a team supported
by McKinsey. The only radical ideas are in the suggestions which are
presented as possible areas that Lloyd's may like to look at in the long
term and are, therefore, never likely to be implemented.
I know of no other organisation in the world which asks Names to take such
risk and in which the people who are meant to look after their interests not
only enjoy so much immunity but also have their own often conflicting
interests.
David Rowland, who chaired the task-force which prepared the report, offers
no radical solution to this problem and he offers no solution to the basic
conflicts of interest in the market despite much nonsense talked about the
'primacy of Names' interests'. There are, of course, some good 'nuts and
bolts' suggestions - but then every report on Lloyd's in the last 50 years
has had some good ideas along with some bad ones - and if the Council of
Lloyds continues to represent the insiders then there is little hope in the
aftermath of this report, as there was in the aftermath of the last report,
that the recommendations which are actually implemented will reflect the
outsiders' interests.
I am one of those Names who had hoped that the balance of power would
finally and irrevocably have shifted in favour of the provider of capital
and that a scheme would have been devised to ensure that those who had
profited from past market dishonesty would have contributed something to a
fund to help present sufferers. I therefore put off my resignation pending
the Rowland report. I sent it off today.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: More on the not so sovereign pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most reassuring piece of news about the British economy is that the
Treasury forecasters have now flipped over and see little if any recovery in
the period ahead. That must be a sign of relief ahead. Not surprisingly
activist fiscal policy is once more a respectable subject of discussion.
I do not mean that the true prognosis is always the opposite of what the
official forecasters say. It is more that forecasts are bound to reflect the
present and recent past, with a few twists and manipulations. Recent
indicators have been unremittingly gloomy on the real side of the economy;
and it is often darkest before the dawn.
But there is genuinely cheerful news, and not merely hope, on the inflation
side, which is an unmixed blessing. For it is the fall in inflation that
provides the headroom for an eventual resumption of growth.
Let us take an annual growth rate of the national income of 5 to 7 per cent
as providing room for reasonable growth at moderate inflation. This is not a
rate that can be guaranteed immediately. In the short term the course of the
British economy is tied to the success of the Bundesbank in breaking the
momentum of the German wage push.
But eventually, nominal demand should be able to start growing again by 5 to
7 per cent, and the course of inflation will determine how much of that can
be real growth. This Friday's Retail Prices Index will, as so often, be
misleading, reflecting the echo effect of long-distant changes in the price
of oil.
The most encouraging data come from UK Producer Prices. These do not of
course cover the whole economy, but do provide its leading edge. Excluding
food, drink and tobacco, which were boosted by the excise duties increase in
the last Budget, other producer prices rose by 3.8 per cent in the 12 months
to last December, compared with the peak of 6.5 per cent as recently as last
February.
If you look at seasonally adjusted data, the core rate for producer price
inflation is down to 3.2 per cent, taking the last six months at an
annualised rate. This is the lowest since the series began, except for two
months in 1986 which were affected by a dive in the oil price.
If this withering of inflationary psychology carries through to the more
insulated service sectors of the economy, the way will be open for a
resumption of non-inflationary growth. The achievement is, however, a
fragile one, which could easily be shattered by political short-termism
without achieving any durable gains in output or employment in return.
The main chart is an attempt to put the issue in longer-term perspective. It
is an adaptation of the one I produced after the Maastricht Summit on
December 12 to show how the purchasing power of the supposedly sovereign
pound had fallen since the war.
I have made two main changes. The index is now on a log scale, so that a
given proportional fall in the value in the pound is always shown by the
same vertical drop. Second, I have superimposed for comparison the
experience of the US, Germany and Switzerland.
The results repay study. First they show that a sum of money which would buy
a pound's worth of goods in 1948 was worth just over 6.3p in 1991. The
steepest rate of fall was during the Heath dash for growth and the
subsequent Labour government.
The dollar has also fallen steeply in real purchasing power. But at 17.5
cents it is still worth nearly three times as much as the equivalent amount
of sterling. This fundamentally explains why Mr Alan Greenspan of the US
Federal Reserve has more flexibility in combating recession than the
Treasury or the Bank of England.
The German D-Mark, as one would expect, has fallen much less in real value.
But there have still been enough periods of creeping inflation to reduce it
to 31.5 pfennigs today. A closer look at the chart reveals a remarkable
phenomenon. Until the late 1960s, the dollar's purchasing power remained
almost as much as the D-Mark. It was only with the inflationary financing of
the Vietnam war and the floating of the dollar in 1971 that the value of the
US currency really started to shrink.
It is a myth to suppose that Switzerland's experience provides any comfort
for a policy of going it alone outside the ERM. After a shock appreciation
in the late 1970s which alienated local industrialists, the Swiss franc has
been informally shadowing the D-Mark.
An economist of Birkbeck College London, Mr George Alogoskoufis, has put the
message in a more formal way in a series of papers. When floating exchange
rates allow countries to control their own monetary destiny, inflation
differentials between countries, once established, tend to persist. Moreover
once inflation is pushed up by any shock, such as a wage explosion or an oil
price increase, it tends to stay high.
Under the Gold Standard or Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed exchange
rates, on the other hand, there was no such 'accommodation' and inflation
described a random path around a low or zero basic trend. In the UK, for
instance, up to the 1967 devaluation, neither the advent of elections nor
the identity of the party in power mattered for either expected or actual
inflation. The ERM could perform a similar function if Germany can overcome
its unification strains.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Psychological testing is not resented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alas, Mr Sturt's letter (January 13) in reply to Timothy Clark's study
('Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted'', January 7) is yet another snare
and delusion. Of course, headhunters have a role, but so too do objective
means of assessing a candidate's suitability or potential for a job.
Mr Sturt has fallen into the trap of misunderstanding the effects of random
selection, or in his terms, 'introduction'. Headhunters will, simply by
chance, identify candidates who are high performers in their new role. As a
result they are not subsequently transferred or fired. The key point here,
however, is that chance has come into play. For, at the same time,
headhunters can and do 'introduce' executives who do not perform well. I
wonder where his evidence comes from that this does not occur? Certainly my
experience as an occupational psychologist is that I have often been
retained by clients who wish to recover from a poor 'introduction'.
Mr Sturt rightly asserts that psychological assessment is 'just one link in
a chain', but then ruins his whole argument by adopting the elitist attitude
that such assessment is only relevant to junior and middle management.
Psychological assessment is not just about ability testing, although this is
important even at the highest levels. A rigorous analysis of overall
suitability is essential for all jobs, including board members. Why senior
managers should feel 'insulted' by demonstrating their skills and abilities
is a mystery to me.
Finally, many companies which use psychological assessment alongside
headhunters are more impressed by the hard evidence that has emerged from a
plethora of research studies over the past 50 years than they are by the
subjective data that Mr Sturt would have us take account of from telephone
conversations, references and anecdotes from former colleagues.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Call for new type of pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A H R DELENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Barry Riley's article on pensions (The Long View, January 11) there are
several points which are not covered.
To start with, pensioners are entitled to their pensions in the same way
that insurance policy holders are entitled to their benefits under their
policies. Anyone who has worked overseas and decided to maintain his DSS
pension knows that he paid a premium, part of the NI contribution,
specifically to cover his pension and nothing else.
Barry Riley talks about a 'free gift from one generation to the previous
one'. What about the free gift of a national infrastructure from one
generation to the next one? If people entering work had to pay for assets
and services built up by preceding generations, there would be no pension
funding problem.
Although the working population may decrease relative to the number of
pensioners, productivity increases due to advancing technology should fill
the gap. Nevertheless, it is high time there was a single national pension
plan for all; government controlled, but privately administered and funded,
but completely out of the hands of employers.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Need for revolution in attitudes towards teaching
and research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANGELA CRUM EWING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial 'Mass higher education' (January 13) you forecast
that when the divide between polytechnics and universities has ended it will
be replaced by a new divide, one between institutions engaged in teaching
and research and those funded only for teaching. Of course, those that
receive no government funding for research will still be able to seek such
funding from other sources, just as all institutions do at present; and this
new divide may in any case not be as clear-cut as you suggest, since there
are likely to be divisions of this kind within institutions themselves.
Nevertheless, if the revolution in higher education is to succeed there
needs to be a corresponding revolution in attitudes towards teaching and
research.
The Association of University Teachers has consistently pressed for greater
recognition of teaching quality in universities; yet the Universities
Funding Council continues the practice of its predecessor, the University
Grants Committee, and bases its allocation of funds to universities
primarily on its assessment of their excellence in research. It is not
surprising, therefore, that promotion in universities, too, depends heavily
on research performance with teaching in most cases coming a very poor
second. Replacing one divide by another, with a few 'ivy league'
universities and a rump which is regarded as second-rate, is no way to build
a genuine mass system. It is to be hoped the new funding councils, and the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, will accept the
interdependence of research and teaching. Angela Crum Ewing,

FT  16 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Next steps in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY, the European Community recognised Slovenia and Croatia, albeit
with understandable caveats from France and the UK. Two weeks into the most
effective ceasefire in the six-month conflict, Bonn's persistently argued
belief that recognition would be a carrot leading towards peace appears to
have been vindicated. No one, however, should be tempted by the illusion
that this war, which has killed thousands and made half a million people
homeless, is over.
The main question facing the EC, upon which the practical task of
peace-broking will continue to fall, whatever the nature of any UN
imprimatur, is the extent to which community member states are willing to
apply stick as well as carrot. Economic sanctions will no doubt have a part
to play for some time to come, but most specifically and immediately, the
peacemakers must ensure that neither Serbia nor Croatia feels able to extend
the war into the neighbouring republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Extension of the war is a course of action all too likely to appeal to Mr
Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, and Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Serbia, given their political need to silence growing internal
opposition to the failures of their policies.
Mr Tudjman, for example, has obtained recognition for Croatia without
regaining full control of the republic's territory. Mr Milosevic has failed
to prevent Croatia from seceding from what was once the Yugoslav federation.
For politicians whose stock in trade is to foment nationalist unrest to
increase their power bases, these are serious difficulties.
Carve up
That both politicians now present themselves as peace-makers should delude
no one. There are unmistakeable signs that the two rivals are indeed seeking
to gain more territory by agreeing with each other to carve up their
ethnically mixed neighbour, where for centuries, Moslems, Serbs and Croats
have lived together peacefully.
It will not be easy for the international community to guarantee the
stability and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina. A first step
would be for the EC to make it plain to everyone involved that the security
of this republic is a precondition of all further co-operation with Serbia
and Croatia. Secondly, the EC should propose and help finance the
demilitarisation of the republic, which is currently home to a large part of
the Serb-dominated federal army.
At the same time, planning needs to proceed in earnest for the possible
despatch of a significant UN peace-keeping force to Bosnia-Hercegovina,
something Mr Milosevic strongly opposes.
Most risky
Of all the options open to the international community, this is obviously
the most risky and could only proceed in the light of a full appraisal of
the military situation. It would be a disaster for such a force, likely to
be composed mainly of Europeans, to be obliged to retreat in the face of
gruesome casualties. If the ceasefire continues, such intervention may not
be necessary; if it breaks down it may be impossible. But following the
decision to send in unarmed UN observers, it is a contingency which, if well
timed, may be both viable and desirable.
In the meantime, Bosnians themselves will be active. Some still hope for
international recognition once a referendum is held throughout the republic
and that independence will give Bosnia the right, and perhaps even the
ability, to exercise some control over the army. More important is the fact
that independence would validate the republic's internal frontiers as
international borders. If it is possible to establish in the Yugoslav
context that no borders, whether internal or external, will be altered by
force of arms, much will have been done to improve the chances of lasting
stability.
For the EC, Yugoslavia will continue to represent an inescapable, long-term
challenge. That Germany's unilateral diplomacy has produced a short-term and
most welcome advance should not be allowed to obscure the need for patient
and coherent collective action in the future.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: The Distant Sound - Grand Theatre, Leeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Franz Schreker's Der ferne Klang, titled The Distant Sound in a new
translation by the conductor Paul Daniel, receives its first British
production from that boldest of British companies, Opera North. This is an
event of some importance, for the work itself is a milestone of German opera
during the first decades of the century.
A first opera (Frankfurt, 1912) by a previously little-known 34-year
Viennese Jew who was also his own librettist, it had a smash-hit success,
which Schreker then capped with those of Die Gezeichneten (1918) and Der
Schatzgraber (1920). Thereafter the tide of fashion changed, and the advent
of the Nazis completed the rout of Schreker's reputation with brutal
finality: in the early 1930s he was deprived of his high-profile Berlin
teaching post, and died of a stroke.
In recent years the re-examination of his music has proceeded apace. Der
ferne Klang has already turned up in several European cities and two
recordings; other Schreker rediscoveries have also been undertaken, which
chimes with the growing European interest in the major musical figures of
the Austro-German musical culture - not just Strauss and Schoenberg ' in
what may loosely be termed the Weimar years.
On the evidence of Tuesday's Leeds first night, I have to say that the case
for the Schreker revival seems not at all proved, let alone won. The most
prized feature of the opera was, and remains, its instrumental sound-world -
the shimmering, deliquescent, ravishingly blended woodwind-harp-and-celesta
sonorities welling up out of the orchestra pit whenever the opera's central
male figure, the composer Fritz, is depicted in obsessive search for the
'distant sound' that represents his artistic inspiration. Wherever this
recurs, particularly in the opera's opening and closing stages, the aura of
late-Romantic rapture proves enduringly potent: Schreker seems to fuse the
worlds of Debussy and Strauss.
Elsewhere, I fear, we are left with little more than a pre-Hollywood penny
dreadful. Fritz abandons his village sweetheart Grete, who sinks into
prostitution; in Act 2 she's the top attraction of the Casa di Maschere, a
Venetian brothel - Fritz encounters her there, for reasons never made clear,
and spurns her. In Act 3 she turns up, now a shabby street-walker, for the
premiere of his unsuccessful new opera, The Harp, and they are reconciled -
mortally ill, he dies still searching for the proper completion of his
opera, rather like Zivny in Janacek's roughly contemporaneous Osud.
Though these and other scenes are built up with recourse to original and
sophisticated effects - clearly the use of onstage band and piled-up
simultaneities was to work a strong influence on the writing of Wozzeck -
the gap between technical complexity and plot slenderness, not to say
banality, grows unbridgeably wide. The roles are symbolic mouthpieces, not
characters; in this respect I find it instructive that all Schreker's
creative individuality appears to have been spent on the orchestra, leaving
the voice parts to sing out in a kind of post-Wagnerian autopilot.
I said earlier, 'on first-night Leeds evidence'. It is a crucial proviso.
The Grand pit proves too small for Schreker's orchestra; additional
instruments have to be housed on the stage itself, in tiers around a raised
acting-area, with the disastrous consequences for Schreker's subtly blended
scoring, which most of the time separates out in thin strands - and which,
in full cry, drowns the voices. Mr Daniel, obviously a Schreker believer,
pilots the opera with sympathy and tenderness, but the Klang produced by the
orchestral configuration defeats his best efforts.
Then, alas, there is the matter of the production - a British debut in this
field by the much-loved mezzo Brigitte Fassbaender, using the sets and
costumes (utilitarian and hideous) of Ultz. A moment or two in the unfolding
of the central relationship suggest that she worked closely and well with
the singers, Kim Begley and Virginia Kerr; but Miss Fassbaender's control of
the opera's larger forces is of a stiffness and, indeed, ineptitude that
defy description. The Act 2 brothel-scene comes complete with female
revenants from the J. Arthur Rank Charm School and some incredibly genteel
drag queens; one would guess that the producer's purpose was send-up, except
that there's no hint of wit or deftness in her handling.
In spite of the orchestral barrage, there is some impressive singing. Mr
Begley and Miss Kerr both reveal 'youthful heroic' voices of exactly the
right sturdily appealing kind (I hope she will press no harder for volume);
other performers notably involved include Fiona Kimm, William Dazeley, Peter
Sidhom and John Hall. In sum, though, and to be cruelly and regretfully
frank, Opera North appear for once to have vastly overreached themselves.

Today's big topic is the first anniversary of the Gulf War. BBC2 shows the
first of three programmes entitled The Washington Version (9.30), made by
the people who produced the outstanding series 'The Second Russian
Revolution'. Six members of the US war cabinet, including Secretary of State
James Baker, Secretary of Defence Dick Cheney, and Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, tell the inside story of how they managed the
war.
Channel 4 provides a vivid contrast. After The Gulf (10.00) consists of five
short films, lasting almost two hours, offering different Arab points of
view on the war including a woman who was present at the bombing of Baghdad.
This Week (8.30 ITV) shows Part 2 of 'The Rise And Fall Of A Godfather', the
story of the reputed Mafia boss John Gotti who is due for trial next week on
charges of racketeering and multiple murder. The BBC2 series on long lasting
vehicles, Perpetual Motion (8.30), marks the passing of the Avro Shackleton:
'Rolls Royce engines and leather seats, what more could you want?' asks one
of the navigators. The Goldring Audit (9.00 C4) reports on the aircraft
carrier HMS Invincible.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: Noble unveils his first season at the Royal
Shakespeare Company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An upbeat Adrian Noble unveiled yesterday his first full programme as
artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Sir Peter Hall returning
to Stratford after twenty four years to direct All's Well That Ends Well at
the Swan; Terry Hands returning after 24 months to direct Antony Sher in
Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great, also at the Swan; and Kenneth Branagh
playing Hamlet, again, at the Barbican in Adrian Noble's first production of
the play, are among the highlights.
The five Shakespeare plays opening at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in
Stratford include Antony and Cleopatra for the first time since 1978, with
Richard Johnson and Clare Higgins in the title roles. Also on offer are The
Taming of the Shrew, As You Like It, The Winter's Tale, and Merry Wives of
Windsor.
The Swan, which had a very successful 1991, presents its first musical, The
Beggar's Opera, and a revival of A Jovial Crew, written in 1641 and last
revived in 1724. It marks the Stratford directorial debut of Max
Stafford-Clark.
The Other Place has a production of Richard III, with Simon Russell Beale as
the King, which will tour the country when a sponsor can be found, plus two
new works, The Odyssey, a reworking of the Greek myth by the Caribbean poet
Derek Walcott, and The School of Night, by Peter Whelan, which is set in the
London of Christopher Marlowe.
Apart from Hamlet the Barbican has transfers from last year's Stratford
season, with the exception of Julius Caesar and Twelfth Night which were not
reckoned to be worth the trip. There are also two premieres, Columbus by
Richard Nelson and a play, not yet titled, by Peter Shaffer, which will also
be directed by Sir Peter Hall.
Despite the Pounds 3m deficit which hangs over the RSC, Adrian Noble was in
bullish mood. Audiences were up in 1991, when the Company played to over one
million people, and the year will show a small profit. Noble is making minor
innovations both in opening a Shakespeare play - Hamlet - in London and then
transferring it to Stratford in 1993, and by building up successes from last
year's season at the Swan, such as The Two Gentlemen of Verona and The
Alchemist, for the big stage at the Barbican rather than condemning them to
the Pit.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: La Fille mal gardee - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ballets change. No matter with what care a company may seek to preserve its
choreographic patrimony, the erosions brought about by the transmission of
steps from one dancer to another, from one generation to another, bring
mutations in text and style. Technique changes; bodies change, and worst of
all, those nuances of feeling wherein lies the spirit of the choreography,
are lost or distorted. Frederick Ashton was really only interested in first
casts. What happened to his ballets after them was an inevitable process
which subtly altered, and perhaps diminished, his creation. Yet managerial
good sense has dictated that his ballets must be seen on fresh bodies every
year. The task for the new casts is not only to preserve the letter of the
text (which, by itself, killeth) but to honour the work's spirit (which
giveth life).
La Fille mal gardee is, more than any other Ashton creation, is plainly a
cast-iron, change of cast-proof, ruin-proof work of genius. Its structure is
a marvel of integration between ensemble and solos. Its narrative is taut,
as grounded in good sense as a Moliere comedy, and as rich in human feeling.
Its dances seem an effortless outpouring of pastoral delight - and the
testimony of members of its first cast suggests that its creation was of the
happiest. Looked at dispassionately its virtues are superabundant, and
unflawed: there is not a dull or unnecessary step in it, nor a moment when
the attention is sated by dance or drama.
Happy, then the young inheritors of its leading roles, as we saw on Monday
night when Fiona Brockway and Tetsuya Kumakawa took the stage for the first
time as Lise and Colas. Both are bright, gifted artists who find much to
engage their talents in Fille, and much to delight us. They both play for
quick, vivid physical effects. Understandably, they see their debuts in
terms of physical hurdles to be sunnily overcome, and there were many
rewards in Miss Brockway's buoyant, sparklingly accented point-work - like
the easiest coloratura - and in Mr Kumakawa's bounding virtuosity and in his
multitudinous pirouettes (I fancied that he turned nine in the last act
coda). Dramatically these performances were lively. Miss Brockway is Widow
Simone writ young, with temperament and to spare; there is no doubt about
the ardour that Kumakawa's Colas feels for Lise.
Yet I was most touched by both performers in the very closing scene of the
ballet, when Miss Brockway became gently adoring in Colas's arms, then moved
with a lovely spaciousness through her final solo, and when Kumakawa
suggested the intense happiness that Colas knows now that Lise is his. Such
joint sincerity and sweetness of feeling was the quality that marked these
characters in their creation by Nerina and David Blair, and it is the
life-giving spirit of the ballet.
From Iain Webb an Opera House debut as Alain marked by real depths of
emotion. He gives the simpleton a puppyish eagerness and incomprehension of
worldly ways which generates true pathos in the moment when he discovers
Lise and Colas in each other's arms. From David Bintley and David Drew their
customary fine readings of Simone and Thomas. From the company, splendid
dancing.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: Institute declares war on its growing
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEEP IN the recesses of Moorgate Place in London, home of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, there is a metaphorical sound of
clanking. Council members are clambering into suits of armour as they
prepare for battle.
After six years of timidity, the decision-makers are gearing up for a spring
offensive against the critics in their own ranks. They say they need a
substantial rise in subscriptions to preserve and expand their activities.
As news has trickled out from the council's annual 'conference' in
Birmingham last weekend, it emerged that there had been unanimous approval
for an increase. Proposals to go before members at their special meeting in
June suggest rises in all fees charged for 1993 except those for retired
members.
The principal changes are a Pounds 15 rise in the annual subscription to
Pounds 115 for UK and other EC members of more than five years' standing,
with further rises of 12.5 per cent above inflation for the following two
years; an increase in practising certificate fees from Pounds 36 to Pounds
50, with similar rises over the next two years; and a jump in the admission
and re-admission fees from Pounds 178 to Pounds 285 from the beginning of
next year, and to Pounds 400 from the start of 1994.
'The institute really cannot continue to have annual deficits,' Mr Ian
McNeil, the president, warned in a statement on Monday. 'Without
substantially increased funding, the only alternatives would be to cut
essential services to members and to reduce our activities.'
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive, said on Monday that the
institute is likely to reveal a deficit of Pounds 200,000 for the year to
December 31 1991 when audited figures are released in March, and projected a
deficit of Pounds 500,000 for 1992. That comes on top of a deficit for 1990
of Pounds 633,000.
It might seem ironic that the professional association for chartered
accountants was not able to balance its books in 1990, and does not
anticipate doing so for the following two financial years. But Mr Colquhoun
has a series of responses that are by now well-oiled.
'There is nothing unique in our financial problems,' he says. 'At their root
is the fact that our rates are very low in real terms. The Chartered
Accountancy qualification offers a cachet with considerable advantages, for
a price comparable to membership of a golf club.'
Other accountancy bodies in the UK and abroad are struggling with similar
deficits, he argues. So are the equivalent bodies in other professions,
which often charge more (Pounds 380 last year for the Law Society). Members
of the Scottish and Irish accountancy institutes pay more than their English
and Welsh counterparts.
While revenues have remained static, the recession has started hurting the
commercial activities of the institute, particularly the publications
division. Money from recruitment adverts has declined sharply, for instance,
and Mr Colquhoun predicts it will not pick up again until well into 1993.
At the same time, operating costs have continued to rise. ICAEW's
obligations to support stronger financial reporting standards (such as its
contribution to the Accounting Standards Board) and its international
commitments have stretched existing budgets.
'We can axe people or services but there is an impact on what is provided,'
he says. 'We cannot have a situation of continuing deficits. More
discretionary activities of direct benefit to our members may be squeezed
out. But we must continue to properly fund our public interest commitments.'
The council has held back from proposing a large increase in subscriptions
since 1985, when it was defeated by just 0.2 per cent in a vote of all
members. It estimates that the decision cost it Pounds 6.4m in foregone
revenue up till the end of last year.
Now they are ready for a new fight. 'I believe we have a much better
campaign this time,' says Mr Colquhoun. In 1985, he says there was hardly
any argument put forward by the council for a substantial rise. Last autumn,
by contrast, the case was put forcefully in an eight-page discussion paper
sent to members called 'Financing the Institute'.
The result has been one of the largest mailbags the ICAEW has ever received
on an issue. While those who write are not a representative sample,
officials draw comfort from the fact that about half the correspondents have
supported the council.
Nevertheless, there are serious concerns voiced by members about the need
for an increase, or wider doubts about the direction of the institute and
the services it provides that have been stoked by the suggestion of bigger
subscriptions.
One view is that the ICAEW neglects parts of its constituency, pandering to
the larger accountancy firms while offering relatively little to smaller
practitioners or those outside practice. Others suggest that with an
increasing range of powerful independent bodies regulating aspects of the
profession - such as the Accounting Standards Board and the Audit Practices
Board - its importance is waning.
A meeting at the institute last year drew a parallel with the medical
profession, which has two separate bodies: the General Medical Council,
which regulates the profession and disciplines its members, and the British
Medical Association, which represents doctors' own professional interests.
The ICAEW, some suggest, might have to move in that direction to survive.
There are more direct concerns about costs relating to the subscription
increase as well. The ICAEW currently employs about 460 staff, a significant
number by any standards and an increase on last year, although arguably low
as a proportion of all members.
External consultants have scrutinised different departments for efficiency
and have concluded, the ICAEW says, that each offers value for money and
some are significantly under-resourced. The corollary, of course, is that
they have failed to identify areas for savings.
How the fees are structured also raises questions. The larger firms and
businesses often pay the annual subscriptions of members they employ, while
others, including many sole practitioners, have to pay the fees from their
own pockets. The ICAEW sees no way of being able to distinguish different
fee levels for the two approaches.
'At least they have given us a lot of information on the reasons for the
increases this time,' says Mrs Jane Gillbe, a sole practitioner from Surrey.
'But I think they have spent too much on glossy brochures to explain it. I
can sympathise with them, but they should not have let themselves get into
such a mess. I don't believe I should have to pay the increase.'
She decided not to incur additional fees by registering as an auditor last
year. But she does use the institute's library, and finds the services
provided by its tax faculty useful. In a sense, she is trapped. While she
could potentially practice as a tax consultant without being registered as a
chartered accountant, she says she will not resign. 'I think my clients
respect the chartered accountancy qualification and the ethics that go with
it.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Chewing over the
cold turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1970's, the Swedish navy set scientists at Lund University a
difficult task: how to prevent loss of concentration and irritability among
cigarette-addicted submariners who, in the course of duty, were banned from
smoking.
Their response was to produce a different way to deliver the essential
addictive ingredient of a cigarette - nicotine.
Moral absolutists might argue that the delivery of nicotine by any means
should be outlawed. A more practical solution is to switch nicotine
consumption from a form recognised to be harmful - smoking - to another
believed to be harmless.
Lund university scientists came up with a nicotine-impregnated chewing gum.
Nicorette, as the product was christened, was launched in the UK in 1980 and
sold under licence by Lundbeck.
But in the UK, at least, Nicorette's distributors found themselves facing a
severe marketing setback; the product could only be sold on prescription
from a general practitioner.
Unlike conventional family doctor prescription drugs, Nicorette did not
carry the benefit of a lower, national health service charge.
Nicorette's aim is to bolster the will-power of the smoker who wishes to
give up, but finds it difficult to do so 'cold turkey'.
Chewing the gum releases into the bloodstream small amounts of nicotine
which satisfy the craving without being harmful.
So far no nasty side effects have been discovered.
Doctor Chris Steele, a GP who uses Nicorette as part of his anti-smoking
clinics, says that in clinical trials around the world Nicorette has doubled
the success rate of smokers who wish to give up the habit.
According to Jeff Birkett of Lundbeck, 'at any one time in the UK, 6 per
cent of the 14m smokers are trying to give up the habit'. And 75 per cent
will have tried to stop smoking at one time or another.
The marketing headache was finally removed in May 1991, following two years
of exhaustive investigation by the Department of Health and other official
scientific bodies. Lundbeck succeeded in having Nicorette's status changed
from a 'prescription-only medicine' (POM) to a 'pharmacy product', which
could be sold freely by pharmacies.
Lundbeck and Kabi Pharmacia, soon to be responsible for UK marketing, have
now initiated an advertising drive for Nicorette, capitalising on its
new-found freedom. Kabi plans to spend Pounds 3m on UK advertising this
year, according to David Hewitt, Kabi's senior product manager.
The first television commercial started running early in January. It takes a
humorous look at the fears of would-be non-smokers, done by the cartoonist
Gray Joliffe, through the Windsor-based ad agency Miltons. It will be
promoting the gum heavily in the run-up to the UK's annual anti-smoking day
in March.
Nicorette's commanding lead in the stop-smoking product market is soon to be
challenged by such devices as a nicotine-impregnated patch worn against the
skin. The irony is that an addiction-propping gum should finally be getting
the freedom to advertise heavily when the EC looks increasingly set to ban
advertising of its biggest rival - the fag, the cancer-stick, the weed - the
cigarette.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The ascent of
Everest - Soft drinks / Coca-Cola's plans for a new global sales assault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somewhere in the outer reaches of the Himalayas, a small and
specially-trained band of Nepalese sherpas has found a new vocation.
Coca-Cola, the biggest soft drinks company in the world, has hired the
sherpas to lug cases by backpack up to the lodges where mountain travellers
rest.
Meanwhile in Moscow, Coca-Cola is today teaming up with Gavriil Popov, the
city's free market-oriented mayor, to announce the formation of what is
claimed to be the first fully-private joint stock company in Russia since
the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The Moscow venture, a privately-owned business that will manufacture syrup
and establish up to 2,000 retail outlets in the city, is part of Coke's
assault on the eastern Europe market, a stronghold of arch-rival Pepsi-Cola.
In India, Coca-Cola is planning a joint venture that would bring it back to
the populous sub-continent for the first time since it left in 1977, after a
dispute with the government.
Each example demonstrates Coke's drive to strengthen its international sales
volume. It recognises that distribution plays as great a part in a
successful marketing strategy as the the traditional concepts of
advertising, promotion and other marketing techniques.
It is all part of a master plan described by Roberto Goizueta, Coca-Cola
chairman, in Olympian terms: 'By the year 2000, we will have Coca-Cola
available within an arm's reach of desire of the 6bn people who will be
housed on this planet.'
Donald Keough, Coke's president, says the corporate goal is to double total
non-US sales volume by the end of the 1990s, meaning the company will have
to do better than keep pace with the market.
Surprisingly, Jesse Meyers, editor of Beverage Digest, the industry's bible,
thinks that this is not a wild objective: 'At this point, I don't think even
Coca-Cola knows how big it could become.'
Coke is already the world market leader in soft drinks, with a commanding 46
per cent share that compares with Pepsi's 15 per cent. In the competitive
and more mature US market, Coke has 41 per cent, and Pepsi has 33 per cent.
Outside the US, Coke claims it sells four times as many cases as Pepsi,
while Pepsi insists the ratio is three-to-one.
For much of the 1980s, the marketing focus of Coke and Pepsi was on the
famous cola wars, on Coke's rapidly aborted change to its formula in 1985
and on the high growth US beverage market.
Cola wars continue in the US, with Pepsi now aiming for the younger market
segment, but profit margins are higher in the European Community and much of
the Pacific. Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch says that non-US markets offer
the best sales growth potential, which is not surprising since Coke's US
volume grew by just 2-3 per cent last year.
In 1985, about half of Coke's operating profits came from outside the US.
Last year, non-US soft drinks accounted for about 79 per cent of Coca-Cola's
operating income and two thirds of volume.
Coke spent Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.78bn) on selling and advertising expenses
worldwide in 1990. Of this total, only Dollars 932m was spent on traditional
advertising in the media.
Coca-Cola declines to break down its marketing expenditure outside the US;
Pepsi spent Dollars 500m last year outside the US. But all of Coke's top
executives in Atlanta - each of them sipping incessantly from ice-cold cans
of their product - agree that while their brand name may be among the best
known in the world, the real challenge is to create the bottling,
manufacturing and distribution infrastructures in each market.
In 1992 Coke will boost capital spending by 30 per cent, to around Dollars
1.3bn, much of which will pay for the development of bottling plants and
other infrastructure.
Nowhere is distribution more important than in eastern Europe, where thanks
to a Nixon-era deal, Pepsi-Cola outsells Coke. Neville Isdell, the man who
negotiated the new Moscow venture, says the best marketing of Coke in newly
emerging east bloc democracies 'is to get a bottle on the shelf'.
This is in keeping with Coke's fundamental marketing strategy, known in
Atlanta as 'the three As', or availability, affordability and acceptability.
The company's goal is to drive volume by selling concentrate or syrup to
local bottlers, be they independent or joint venture partners. Local
distribution deals are designed to make the product available. It is priced
to make it affordable as a proportion of disposable income. Acceptability
comes through sponsorships, political contacts, or other means, to
infiltrate Coca-Cola into the local culture.
Depending on the country, Coca-Cola will approach marketing differently. In
China, where Coke has 13 joint venture plants and is prepared to wait many
years before it gets any money out, marketing means buying delivery trucks
rather than spending on advertising.
In Japan, Coke last year spent Dollars 500m on 130,000 vending machines, as
half the drinks there are sold that way.
In much of Latin America, the key to marketing is for Coke to supply ice
coolers for the rural markets. In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, Coke
bought 10,000 push-carts and trained local people to sell soft drinks in the
street. In Brazil, the key was to make larger bottles in order to take
advantage of that market's changing consumer habit.
The biggest marketing coup in eastern Europe has been in what used to be
east Germany, where Coke was not available under the Communist regime. The
day the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, executives in Atlanta
ordered Berlin employees to hand out free cans of Coke to east Germans as
they walked into west Berlin.
By February 1990, without any distribution network in place, Coke began
trucking cases into eastern Germany from its French bottling plant in
Dunkirk. During the year, some 21m cases were sold to wholesalers and
retailers by an army of employees from the west.
At the end of 1990, Coke decided to spend Dollars 450m in east Germany
buying and refurbishing the land, buildings and equipment of state-owned
bottling plants. The result is that in 1991, Coke says it sold 89m cases in
the old east Germany and is aiming for sales of 139m cases in 1992.
The market represented by the European Community is one of Coca-Cola's most
profitable, accounting for around a third of Coke's non-US soft drinks
operating income, estimated at Dollars 2.1bn in 1991.
But not all EC markets have been easy. France, in particular, has thrown up
problems, ranging from past difficulties with Coca-Cola's local bottler to a
certain cultural resistance to the product.
This year Coke is undertaking a traditional marketing campaign that aims to
reach some 42m consumers by a series of sponsorships, contests and other
gimmicks tied to the winter Olympics in Albertville and summer games in
Barcelona, the opening of Euro-Disney park near Paris, the Seville Expo,
Wimbledon tennis, Tour de France and European Cup in Sweden.
Back in the US, one of Coke's most talked about marketing moves was the
agreement last year to hire Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood power broker who
chairs Creative Artists Agency, as a consultant. The big idea is that Ovitz
will forecast entertainment trends worldwide that will enable Coke to link
its products to hits.
The Coke marketing strategy, therefore, is supposed to range from Hollywood
to the Himalayas.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political impartiality of Mr Bruce Millan, the EC Commissioner for
regional policy, was questioned by Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and
industry minister, in the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He accused Mr Millan, a former Labour cabinet minister, of holding back
Pounds 109m in EC funds intended to benefit coalfield communities in
Britain.
The minister claimed that while Mr Millan was dissatisfied with the
accountancy procedures of Italy, the Netherlands and France in respect of EC
funds, he had chosen to withhold only grants due to Britain because of
arrangements designed to ensure that the level of public expenditure was
determined at Westminster and not in Brussels.
Mr Tam Dalyell (Lab Linlithgow) attacked Mr Leigh for a 'slur' on Mr Millan,
and recalled that a leaked draft letter disclosed that Mr Michael Heseltine,
environment secretary, had argued that the government's arrangements for
dealing with the EC funds were 'no longer tenable'.
OIL REVENUES: The Treasury has gained Pounds 72bn from North Sea oil
revenues since 1969-70, or Pounds 112bn at today's prices, Mr John Maples,
economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a Commons written reply
yesterday.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Putting a price on idealism -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Kinnock has spent much of the past four years promising Labour will
not change the world, at least not much. Now, as the election approaches, he
must pledge that it will.
It is not a contradiction he would admit. He argues that by jettisoning the
ideological baggage that made it unelectable during the early 1980s, Labour
has returned to, rather than turned its back on, its ideological roots. It
is possible to be both safe and exciting.
Yet, just as Conservatives now hark back to a mythical age of polite
schoolchildren diligently reciting their tables and of liveried trains
chugging elegantly across rolling hills, Labour is glancing wistfully at an
idealised past.
Mr Kinnock's dilemma is obvious. He must persuade the electorate that he
will not rob it of the fruits of Thatcherism. For all their anger over the
recession, voters will not accept a return to extravagant public spending
and punitive taxation.
But he must convince them also that a limited reallocation of the nation's
resources is something worth voting for: that idealism has not been thrown
out with extremism.
The response is to seek an image which combines its new-found economic
respectability with a perception that Labour is the party ordinary people
vote for because it stands for a fairer society.
Nationalisation, unilateralism, anti-Europeanism, and soaking the rich are
to be seen as a damaging but aberrant departure from this true socialist
tradition - much perhaps as Thatcherism is now regarded by some
Conservatives as an, albeit extraordinary, deviation from the traditions of
Disraeli's One Nation.
Senior Labour figures lose little sleep when accused of offering a warmed-up
version of the 1960s vision of the then Mr Harold Wilson. Mr Wilson, they
remind themselves, won three of four elections.
They are unashamed that Mr Kinnock - as at the party's weekend rally in York
when he spoke on a platform emblazoned with the Union Flag - has combined
his conversion to Europe with a new brand of economic nationalism. 'Made in
Britain', the latest slogan from the party's image makers to encapsulate its
economic and industrial strategy, could have been coined by Mr Wilson.
Perhaps it was.
Yet, as Mr John Major has discovered, it is not so easy to relive history.
The backbone of postwar Labour support came from the 'respectable' working
classes who saw security for their old age and opportunity for their
children in the welfare state. It is no accident that Mr Kinnock's firmest
spending pledges are to increase state pensions and child benefit.
But cloth caps and rows of rented terraces have been replaced by Ford
Escorts and mortgaged council houses. The recession has not erased that part
of the Thatcherite legacy which has left the electorate more than
half-persuaded that opportunity is now found in low taxes, home ownership
and a quick profit on BT shares.
It is that change that has been the driving force behind Mr Kinnock's
transformation of his party. It remains the most potent force shaping the
general election campaign.
For all its dismissive rejection of the Conservative onslaught on its tax
and spendings plans, Labour remains deeply worried that its reputation for
wasteful profligacy has not been entirely exorcised.
Its leaders will privately admit that if the decision could be taken again,
proposed increases in National Insurance Contributions for those earning
over Pounds 20,000 would be more cautiously framed. The message is already
seeping out that the rise might well be phased in gently rather than slapped
on in a first Budget.
Labour takes comfort in polls showing that most voters would prefer a better
health or education service to a tax cut. And, like Mr Wilson, Mr Kinnock
will argue that 'modern' management will yield the economic growth to square
the circle of higher spending and moderate taxes.
Labour knows that, however strong its pledges, it cannot avoid the charge
that taxes under Mr Kinnock would be higher than under Mr Major.
So from now until the election we will see an effort by Labour to claim the
moral high ground. To admit that idealism costs money; and then argue, as Mr
Hattersley did in York on Sunday, that if it is loyal to its past idealism
the voters will readily pay for 'the fairer society which the Labour party
was founded to create'. But how much will they pay?

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Scheme to help Names
gains mixed response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSIONALS IN the Lloyd's insurance market generally reacted positively
to the recommendations of the task force yesterday, but many doubted whether
the recommendations would help Names already in financial difficulties.
The welcome was cautious, however, as brokers, underwriters, advisers and
Names - the individuals whose wealth underpins the market - struggled to
digest the 240-page report.
Mr Max Lehrain, managing director of Grimston Scott, a tax and financial
adviser to Lloyd's Names, said late in the afternoon: 'I have to admit I'm
only on page 52 at the moment. But what is encouraging is to see the Council
responding in a positive way.'
Mr Chris Burton, joint managing director of AJ Archer, a quoted underwriting
group, said: 'It's a very comprehensive document. My immediate reaction is,
it's a breath of fresh air for the whole marketplace. The whole concept of
the report is getting back to the commerciality of Lloyd's. I welcome the
growth in the number of Names, and that the capacity is being maintained for
individual Names.'
He also welcomed the importance given to the Names and enhanced links to
brokers, whom he called 'the life blood of the market'. He did not feel the
new rights for Names would make managing agency business less attractive.
Mr Ken Carter, chief executive of insurance broker Lloyd Thompson, was
particularly pleased with the reaffirmation of the partnership between
brokers and underwriters.
He added: 'The report is not very radical. It is what one would have
expected. The original aim was to look at Lloyd's capital base. That has
moved slightly into the background.'
The proposal to allow Names to reinsure their 'open years' with CentreWrite,
in particular, had a lukewarm reception. Mr Mike Voller, Lloyd's specialist
with the accountant BDO Binder Hamlyn, which advises about 1,000 Names said:
'If they can afford that, they can probably afford the losses.'
He added: 'I can't see an awful lot of people taking that out because of the
level of premiums which is likely to be charged.'
Mr Mark Farrer, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents 9,500 Names - 40 per cent of the total - was more positive about
the proposal. 'I think the proposals for CentreWrite are going to be
extremely useful for Names, because nobody at present is really prepared to
assess the individual risk. I don't doubt that what is proposed is an
excellent idea.
'Proposals like this underline the importance of the providers of the
market's capital and go a long way towards correcting an imbalance between
Names and syndicate management.' He recognised that Names suffering losses
from the old years 'will not find a panacea in the proposals'.
Brokers were generally enthusiastic. Mr Alan Colls, chairman of the Lloyd's
insurance brokers committee, and chairman of Nicholson Chamberlain &amp; Colls,
a Lloyd's brokerage said: 'The instantaneous applause that David Rowland
received when he made his presentation said it all. I think the report has
the balance about right. It has to be about the art of the possible. I am
glad to see support for the broking community.'
Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Names, was positive,
but added: 'It's done nothing to help the injured Names, of which there are
6,000. Many of them are in great financial difficulties already, and it's
going to get worse this year. Names who are suffering this year ain't seen
nothing yet.'
He welcomed the report's recommendations for the future. 'It's a
first-class, imaginative report, and I'm sure it will lead to a profitable
future. For the first time in its 300-year history, it's putting the
outsiders first, and not the insiders.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - News and Reaction: Market stays calm as
coffee-shop ethos put at risk - Sampling the atmosphere during a historic
day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR all the high-tech 20th-century facade of the Lloyd's insurance market,
the heart and soul of the business remains as it was 300 years ago - a bunch
of guys meeting in a coffee shop.
The clubby ethos has remained impervious to the sweeping changes that have
turned London's other financial exchanges upside down. 'We're trying to
catch up on 300 years of business,' said Mr Reg Brown, underwriter at RE
Brown syndicate. 'Up until now, Lloyd's syndicates haven't regarded
themselves as businesses.'
Unlike the sometimes frenzied trading floors of the world's leading equities
and commodities exchanges, Lloyd's on a busy day consists of dark-suited
brokers patiently lining up at underwriters' 'boxes'. Even on the day of the
market's greatest single disaster - the destruction of the Piper Alpha oil
rig in the North Sea - unflappable brokers went about business in the usual
fashion.
Yesterday, as one of the biggest reform packages ever proposed was
announced, business proceeded as usual. Early in the day, syndicate heads
and senior officials were called to a briefing, leaving underlings to rely
on the rumour mill for information. 'We're waiting to read it in the papers
tomorrow,' said a clerk at one underwriting syndicate.
Seated or kneeling, brokers daily bargain with underwriters, hoping to
persuade them to accept a portion of risk in return for the smallest
possible fee.
Oil rigs, satellites, ships and international trade transactions are all
assets that can be destroyed at any time, causing devastating losses for
owners. Underwriters bear those losses if they occur and charge a fee for
their risk.
Recent losses have been so great that 20 per cent of Names are pulling out
of the market, so underwriters and brokers yesterday hoped the proposed
reforms would reverse the loss of capital. But long-time members remain
cynical.
'Do you know the best way to stop the haemorrhage of Names? Make a profit
for them,' said one underwriter, whose view was echoed around the market.
'Nobody was screaming for reform when everyone was making a profit.'
Overall, there was relief at the proposed cap to be placed on the personal
liability of Names, who now may risk all their personal wealth. 'For
unlimited liability, they should be getting a 25 per cent return on their
money every year,' said one underwriter. 'They've only been getting 10 per
cent and you can get that out of the stock market.'
People in the market used to think they were 'bomb-proof', Mr Brown said,
but the market was finally taking a more businesslike view of itself. 'I
have always said to my lads: 'We're nothing more than a sweet shop.' If we
don't open up in the morning, we don't sell sweets. If we don't sell sweets,
we don't make a profit.'
And the 'lads' at Lloyd's are getting the message.
For all its significance in the world's insurance business, however, the
revolution of the 1980s appears to have touched Lloyd's little in many key
ways. For example, the number of female underwriters can be counted on one
hand.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Genetic treatment of disease to be approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECT genetic treatment of inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and
haemophilia is to receive official approval today.
A Department of Health committee headed by Sir Cecil Clothier, former
chairman of the Police Complaints Authority, has decided that gene therapy
can go ahead in the UK, subject to certain ethical safeguards.
The procedure, pioneered in the US, involves correcting genetic defects by
adding new genes to the cells where they are needed. It is expected to be
more effective and longer-lasting than conventional drugs.
The treatment approved is 'somatic gene therapy'. It corrects the defect by
adding new genes to certain cells - for example in the bone marrow or lungs
 -but the genetic change is not passed on to the patient's offspring.
In contrast, 'germ line gene therapy', which would affect future
generations, is regarded as medically unpredictable and ethically
unacceptable. It will not be approved in the foreseeable future.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Study shows effects of inward investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KNOCK-ON effects of foreign direct investment to the UK are numerous,
widespread and not always transparent, according to a study commissioned by
the Department of Trade and Industry.
The study, carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte in collaboration with
Benchmark Research, was prompted by the growing significance of inward
investment to the economy. It says inward investment might account for as
much as 25 per cent of all new capital formation in 1991-92, against 15 per
cent in 1989.
There have been numerous studies into the direct impact of inward
investment, but the latest report aims to analyse less tangible effects on
local economies and communities within the English regions.
The study says the primary beneficiaries of inward investment are groups
that have established a direct relationship with the inward investor -
employees, local component suppliers, local service companies and local
customers.
The less tangible effects, such as involvement with local charities or links
with educational establishments, indicate the degree of integration into the
local economy.
While only a sixth of the companies examined were actively collaborating or
planning to collaborate in research and development with another company,
almost half were working on R&amp;D with one or more academic institution,
nearly all of which were local.
Japanese companies led the field in collaborating with academic
institutions, and the high incidence of collaboration by mechanical
engineering companies had brough significant local benefits through
technology transfer.
In general inward investment is considered to be 'a good thing', not only by
the investors but by most other companies and organisations within each
region.

FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Pace of wages convergence in EC will
slow, report says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARMONISATION of wages within the EC will slow rather than accelerate during
the next 20 years, according to a report by Professor Douglas McWilliams for
the research group London Economics, David Goodhart writes.
The report, which challenges the conventional wisdom on convergence, also
predicts that relative labour costs in Europe will be much more stable
during the next 20 years as inflation rates and currencies stabilise.
The standard deviation of EC wages, a statistical device to measure the
degree of dispersion, is estimated to have fallen from 46 per cent in 1974
to 31 per cent in 1991, but will still be as high as 24 per cent in 2010.
Spanish wages in 1970 were 29 per cent of those in Germany and are now 66
per cent, while wages in Italy rose from 42 per cent of the German level to
71 per cent. Professor McWilliams, a Confederation of British Industry
economic adviser, concludes: 'An investment decision based on the relative
wage costs in 1970 might have looked very different had 1990 relative wage
costs been taken into account.'
The report predicts that German wages, the highest in the EC, will fall by
10 per cent relative to those in other EC countries as a result of
unification. Wages in Greece and Portugal will catch up from 45 per cent and
36 per cent of the EC average to 62 per cent and 57 per cent to 2010.
The UK, which has labour costs 12 per cent lower than the EC average because
of its low non-wage labour costs, is likely to retain its advantageous
position on labour costs virtually unchanged.
UK wages are actually 8 per cent higher than the EC average, but non-wage
labour costs are well below the average.
Germany has the highest hourly labour costs (including both wages and
non-wage labour costs) at Dollars 24. Denmark is next with Dollars 20,
followed by Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands on Dollars 19, France and the
UK on Dollars 16, and Ireland and Spain on Dollars 13. The US and Japan have
hourly labour costs of about Dollars 14.50.

<TEXT>
CANADA has endorsed the Uruguay Round proposals to strengthen patent
protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals, in the face of strong protests
from the powerful generic drug industry.
The endorsement, if the Uruguay Round is successful, would effectively end
compulsory licensing, which has been a thorn in the side of the world
multinational drug industry for more than two decades. A 1969 law required
pharmaceutical makers to license products to generic companies long before
their patents expired.
Brand-name suppliers were given greater patent protection in 1987, but the
law still allows generic companies to copy a drug within 7-10 years of its
launch. Acceptance of the proposals would extend patent protection to 20
years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Haitian parliament is to decide whether it will accept the head of the
country's small communist party as an interim prime minister, in moves to
clear the way for a return to the country and to power of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He was overthrown and sent into exile by the army in
September.
Although Mr Rene Theodore, the communist leader and a critic of Father
Aristide, has said he will accept the post, many legislators, and the army
leaders, continue to have reservations about any moves leading to the return
of the president. Mr Theodore has been accepted as a compromise candidate by
Fr Aristide and the Organisation of American States.
Mr Theodore has said, however, that his acceptance of the post is
conditional on the lifting of a trade embargo imposed on Haiti after the
coup by OAS members and several European countries. His position thus
supports that of the military.
Mr Theodore has said he cannot set any dates for the return of the
president, suggesting that he would have to be guided, perhaps by the
country's military leaders.
The OAS has maintained that the president must be back in office before
trade is reopened. But diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, and
Washington, said yesterday that the OAS was likely to be flexible, and would
be willing to consider a phased removal of sanctions when there were clear
signs that Fr Aristide would be allowed to return.
The army, which will have the final say, is concerned about the impact of Fr
Aristide's return. He has said that junior officers involved in the coup
were following orders, but their commanders would be tried or exiled.
The military and Haiti's small elite also fear that the return of the
populist politician would embolden his many poor supporters to act against
those who staged and supported the coup.

ONE of Argentine President Carlos Menem's most trusted aides resigned
yesterday after press allegations that he is a shareholder of a company that
sold sub-standard powdered milk at inflated prices to a public nutrition
programme for children.
Mr Miguel Angel Vicco, one of Mr Menem's two private secretaries, is also a
close friend of the president. He had direct access to Mr Menem and handle
delicate government missions, as well as the president's private affairs.
An investigation led by Pagina/12, an opposition newspaper, claimed that Mr
Vicco and Mr Carlos Spadone, also a government official until forced from
office last month, were partners in a milk-processing plant that sold
powdered milk to the Ministry of Social Action.
Mr Menem had strongly defended Mr Vicco against the allegations, claiming
they were thinly-veiled attacks on the government. Mr Vicco is the second
government official to resign this year accused of corruption.
On Monday, Mr Miguel Nazur had resigned as head of PAMI, a government health
insurance scheme for old age pensioners.
Mr Menem has shrunk from aggressive prosecution of alleged offenders. He has
said: 'They have left the government. What more do you want? We should shoot
them?'

PRESIDENT Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil was left isolated yesterday
after an emergency government bill to increase social security contributions
had been rejected by all parties, including those which support the
government.
The bill was introduced to cover Dollars 10bn in extra pension payments that
the government will have to make as a result of a court having ruled that
pensioners shall be given a 147 per cent increase.
Unless the government can find a way to raise this money, the payments would
threaten to jeopardise its fiscal adjustment plans, which will be presented
to the board of the International Monetary Fund next Wednesday. The board is
due to discuss then a Dollars 2bn stand-by loan for Brazil.
The unanimous rejection of the bill, effected in talks before any vote could
take place in Congress, was communicated to Mr Collor in a note signed by
all 17 parties in Congress and written by Mr Ricardo Fiuza, leader of the
government bloc.
Meeting journalists yesterday, the president warned that the government
would not print money to meet the payments as this would threaten the battle
against inflation, which is running at 24 per cent a month.
He said: 'One more time, I must make clear that this government is not going
to reopen sources of inflation.'
The president added, however: 'I am open to any suggestions as to how we can
pay this pension increase.'

FT  16 JAN 92 / Vengeful Saddam keeps Arab opponents on edge: The growing
uncertainties afflicting the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surreal spectacle of a larger-than-life Saddam Hussein pinning 'mother
of battles' anniversary medals on the chests of his military commanders
would have brought little comfort to his jittery Arab opponents, preoccupied
with developments in Algeria and their own domestic problems.
While this week's television theatre in Baghdad, marked by the Iraqi
president's claims of 'victory' in the Gulf war, might be dismissed as sheer
bravado, the episode was nevertheless an uncomfortable reminder to his
rivals that in spite of everything Mr Saddam lives on.
An Arab proverb, repeated with some nervousness in Cairo these days, holds
that a snake is not dead until its head is severed from the body. This
melodramatic observation usually precedes criticism of the allies for not
doing more to unseat the Iraqi leader when the opportunity presented itself.
Now, a year after the US-led alliance began the assault which liberated
Kuwait, the fruits of that victory in Arab eyes seem less appealing. True,
Kuwait was saved and Mr Saddam was humbled, but divisions in the Arab world
have scarcely been deeper and the future less certain.
Not least, concern in the capitals of Washington's moderate Arab allies
stems from the dramatic erosion in Mr Bush's domestic standing, with
consequent fears that a weakened administration would be less steadfast in
defence of its friends abroad, and thus less capable of imposing Middle East
peace.
Adding to these worries are the activities of the neo-isolationists on the
Republican right-wing.
Iraq's official media, reduced to a whisper by last January's bombing
campaign, now spends its days gloating about Mr Bush's misfortunes. Iraqis
are bombarded with negative images of recession-hit America, implying
somehow that life in Iraq, in spite of everything, is preferable.
'As we celebrate, with our heads held high, the first anniversary of the
tyrannical 30-state aggression against us, Bush. . . was touring Asian
countries looking for a solution to the economic crisis the US is suffering
from,' commented al Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Ba'ath party.
While much Iraqi propaganda is ludicrous, recent visitors to Iraq have been
struck by the regime's success in rebuilding the country's battered
infrastructure, and restoring essential services. The authorities also
appear to be making a reasonable fist of providing food rations for the
needy, in spite of sanctions and the burden of rising prices; inflation of
30 per cent a month is reported.
Predictions that defeat in Kuwait would foment a revolt against Mr Saddam
among Iraq's office corps - the favoured scenario of the US and its Arab
allies - have not come to fruition, and as the months pass hopes of this
happening diminish. The Iraqi leadership appears to have regained some of
its poise and is now more visible, although reports persist of dissension in
the ranks, including within Mr Saddam's immediate coterie.
The regime has also been obliged to deal with an incipient underground
campaign, much like the one that was waged during the Iran-Iraq war by the
outlawed al Dawaa Shia fundamentalists. At least one car-bombing - the
trademark of the underground group - has been carried out in Baghdad in
recent weeks.
The military, shattered by its defeat in Kuwait and further run ragged by
the Kurdish and Shia revolts following the war, has been reorganised and
discipline tightened under new defence minister Ali Hassan al-Majid, a
cousin of Mr Saddam.
The Kurds in the north and the repressed Shia in the south would be drawing
little comfort from this: Kurdish leaders have been warning for weeks that
Mr Saddam will use the winter months to drive Kurdish fighters from towns
south of the UN-declared safety zone.
Recent reports suggest that Iraq has been seeking to replenish its depleted
arsenal and UN experts, engaged in uncovering details of the Iraqi nuclear
programme, suspect that work continues on efforts to acquire a nuclear
capability.
In the capitals of Arab states of the anti-Iraq alliance, officials have no
doubt that a craving for revenge is never far from an isolated and weakened
Mr Saddam. 'When the great confrontation took place,' the Iraqi president
declared pointedly this week, 'God decreed that victory once again must go
to the Iraqis because they follow the path of truth while their enemies
follow the path of falsehood.'

INDIAN industry is in a sharp recession according to half-yearly figures
released yesterday and indications are that it will continue.
Figures for the first six months of the financial year show that the decline
in the manufacturing sector 1.9 per cent, while production in mining and
quarrying fell 2.6 per cent.
Capital goods have been particularly badly affected and their production was
down by 17 per cent.
Consumer durables were down by 11 per cent, while production of consumer
goods fell less sharply by less than 1 per cent.
Quick estimates of industrial production released yesterday showed that out
of 155 industries, only 85 have recorded any growth while the remaining 70
have shown a marked decline in production.
The overall fall in industrial production means economic growth is likely to
fall short of the modest 3 per cent of gross domestic product forecast by
the government for 1991-92.
The bad news comes when the government is preparing to present its budget
next month and means that revenues from excise duties will fall short of
estimates. The finance minister had promised to cut the fiscal deficit to 5
per cent of GDP. This will now be difficult unless expenditure is severely
curtailed.
The recession is expected to lead to retrenchment of workers in many
industries and the labour unrest that is expected to follow will exacerbate
the government's difficulties.
Reports in Indian newspapers say that some senior cabinet ministers and
members of the ruling Congress party are asking Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the
prime minister, act by slowing down his economic reforms.
This is because they fear that the 14 per cent inflation rate will rise in
the coming months and they have warned the prime minister that this will
affect the position of his minority government.
The government will, however, find it difficult to go back on its economic
policies since disbursement of further instalments of the standby credit of
Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from the International Monetary Fund is
dependent on fulfilling performance criteria.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Korean war-time memories sour Miyazawa mission

MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, plans to call for a
'future-oriented partnership' with South Korea, during a visit to Seoul due
to begin today. However, several issues stand in his way.
For the past few weeks the Japanese government has been confronted with
claims that at least 100,000 Korean women were forced to work in Second
World War military brothels, the so-called 'comfort women'. Tokyo had
claimed this was a private enterprise and no documents existed proving a
clear relationship between the military and the brothels.
However, after several documents were produced last weekend supporting the
allegations, Mr Miyazawa said: 'It is undeniable that the Imperial Japanese
army was involved in the recruitment of these women and the management of
these facilities. I wish to express my apologies and remorse to all those
who underwent indescribable suffering.'
But the damage had been done, with Koreans feeling insulted by Japan's
reluctance to admit responsibility for its brutal occupation of the Korean
peninsula.
In Seoul, the Japanese leader will also be under pressure to reduce his
country's rapidly expanding bilateral trade surplus, although Mr Miyazawa
would like to concentrate on broader issues.
He is scheduled to address the South Korean parliament and plans to suggest
the two countries play an important role in solving regional and global
problems. The prime minister will have to reassure his hosts that Japan is
proceeding cautiously in its talks with North Korea, which is keen to
improve economic links with Tokyo.
The bilateral trade deficit - a source of increasing concern in Seoul - has
expanded greatly since the mid-1980s. In 1991, according to Korean Ministry
of Trade and Industry estimates, the trade deficit with Japan widened to
Dollars 8.8bn (Pounds 4.91bn), an increase from Dollars 6bn in 1990 and
about 90 per cent of Korea's total trade gap.
Korean economic officials will request tariff reductions of up to 50 per
cent on 16 of Korea's main export items, including textiles and footwear.
Korea will also ask for sharp increases in export quotas on chemical and
steel products and will demand improved access for Korean construction
companies.
However, officials in Seoul are not too optimistic about prospects for their
demands. 'Japan has told us so many times that it will help increase Korean
imports, but it never turns words into action,' said one official at the
Ministry of Trade and Industry in Seoul.
'They bow over to help the Americans, but they do little for us,' he added.
A serious obstacle to improved economic relations is the structural nature
of the deficit. In particular, Korean manufacturing companies continue to
depend on Japanese components, capital equipment and machinery.
At a time of industrial restructuring in Korea - undertaken in an attempt to
offset the impact of rising wage costs through automation and more efficient
production - the result has been a surge of imports of Japanese capital
goods.
Imports of these goods are expected to see further strong growth this year.
And with continued weakness in Korean exports to Japan, South Korea's trade
ministry is expecting a widening of the bilateral deficit to about Dollars
10bn.

<TEXT>
THE Philippines yesterday agreed terms with the International Monetary Fund
that should allow the resumption of a Dollars 900m (Pounds 503m) lending
programme suspended last July when Manila failed to meet economic targets,
writes Richard Gourlay in Manila.
Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, said the two sides had agreed on
a target for the central government's budget deficit which was the only
unresolved issue from last week's IMF mission.
Resumption of the programme is still dependent on the Philippines passing
tougher revenue-raising measures. Only then will the IMF give its stamp of
'good housekeeping' on which a commercial bank debt rescheduling agreement
and new international aid commitments depend.
These measures, including the tightening of VAT legislation, have been
passed by the House of Representatives but are yet to be approved by the
Senate. They may have a rocky passage there as many of the incumbents are
gearing up for elections in May.
The government also has to push through with the second phase of a power
price increase before the Dollars 400m remaining from the IMF facility can
be drawn. The IMF agreed to allow a deficit of Pesos 9bn (Pounds 200m) this
year compared to the Pesos 13bn Manila had sought and the Pesos 3.8bn the
fund had targeted.
The finance ministry hopes to have received the good housekeeping stamp by
the end of February.
The fund agreed the increase in order to meet additional spending demands
around Mt Pinatubo, the volcano that erupted last year devastating parts of
Luzon island, north of Manila.
President Corazon Aquino also yesterday vetoed Senate proposals that would
have limited the percentage of export earnings going to repay foreign debt.

<TEXT>
HYUNDAI Motors, South Korea's largest car manufacturer, announced yesterday
it will temporarily close its plants in an attempt to resolve a growing
industrial dispute.
The decision follows a vote by 30,000 company union members to stage a
go-slow in support of claims for higher bonus payments, better working
conditions and the dropping of charges against union leaders. It will
further heighten the stakes in a test of strength between management and the
union.
The dispute represents an important test case for Korean labour-management
relations as a whole.
Industrial relations have been improving after three years of widespread
dislocation and strikes following the introduction of democracy in 1987.
Last year the number of strikes fell to less than 240, against 1,610 in
1989.
A spokesman for Hyundai Motors said management had no choice but to shut the
plants. 'The go-slow is paralysing production,' he said, adding he expected
the union to end the dispute quickly.
According to the spokesman, the dispute is likely to cost the company 25,000
cars, worth Dollars 150m (Pounds 83.7m), in January and may cause disruption
to exports.
A senior North Korean diplomat said yesterday his country wanted national
unity through confederation with the south, with both retaining their
present social systems, Reuter reports from Geneva.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Incomplete Gulf victory remains irritant to Bush: The war's
aftermath, a year after the launch of allied bombing of Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST anniversary of Desert Storm ought to be a chance to celebrate a
brilliantly executed US battle plan which crushed the bulk of the Iraqi army
with minimum allied casualties. But 12 months after the bombs fell on
Baghdad, it is clear that the Gulf war was an incomplete victory.
President Saddam Hussein remains in power. The Iraqi people starve. The
Kurds are all but abandoned. The Iraqi opposition remains divided. President
George Bush, who appeared invincible nine months ago, has watched his
approval rating nosedive in the face of a recession-hit US economy,
restricting his room for manoeuvre overseas.
Mr Bush does not face serious political pressure at home to remove Mr Saddam
from power; but there is a nagging concern that the defiant Iraqi president
(and his nuclear ambitions) amount to a time-bomb in the run-up to the
November election. At some point, surely, Mr Bush must defuse the problem or
risk detonation.
The trick is how to reconcile the desirable end with politically acceptable
means. At present, the administration seems more inclined to pursue
multilateral pressure through the United Nations rather than unilateral
military action which could leave the president open to criticism that he
was engaging in foreign adventures to escape difficulties at home.
Both Presidents Nixon and Johnson played politics with the Vietnam war
during election years. Yet Mr Bush can put up a plausible case for
preferring the use of United Nations sanctions to keep the heat on Mr
Saddam, rather than renewed US military force.
First, UN economic sanctions, while far from 100 per cent effective, create
strains within the ruling regime. The frequent purges in Baghdad suggest
that at the very least Mr Saddam is being kept off balance. Second, UN
inspectors are slowly but surely identifying and destroying the bulk of Mr
Saddam's nuclear and unconventional weapons programme. 'It's a long-haul
strategy,' says one US official. The advantage is that the UN gives
political cover for the US to ratchet up the pressure. In the coming weeks,
UN inspectors may begin blowing up buildings dedicated solely or partially
to the Iraqi weapons programme.
If Iraq seeks to block the inspectors, the risk of escalation is high. The
Pentagon has drawn up an extensive list of military targets for air-strikes
which would almost certainly be accompanied by French and British warplanes.
A second, less transparent policy option is the use of covert action against
Mr Saddam. Reports in Washington suggest that Mr Bush has ordered the CIA to
assist opposition groups; but US suspicions about the Shias and Turkish
suspicions about the Kurds have made large-scale military aid such as the
1980s programmes to help the Angolan and Afghan rebels a non-starter. Last
November, after waiting in vain for Arab predictions of Mr Saddam's imminent
fall to come true, Mr Bush ordered a review of Iraq policy. The result was a
clear recommendation from the Pentagon that military action in support of an
opposition or Kurdish/Shia coup was undesirable unless it was supported by
Desert Storm-size forces in theatre.
The impression, therefore, is that the Bush administration is content to
muddle along Micawber-like, hoping that something will turn up. It is not
pretty, but the alternatives all appear to be fraught with risk.
The one serious practical objection is that the UN inspectors are
desperately short of money. Over the past six months, the UN teams have
conducted more than 25 inspections, uncovering a welter of information about
Iraq's nuclear programme and the willingness of western companies to help
Baghdad.
The UN inspectors' ultimate aim is to destroy all Iraq's nuclear, chemical,
and biological programmes. The cost could amount to Dollars 100m (Pounds
55.8m). The original plan was to finance inspections (and much-needed
humanitarian aid) from UN-sanctioned sales of Iraqi oil, but Mr Saddam has
so far refused to go to market.
And so the familiar game of cat-and-mouse is under way, with Mr Saddam
calculating once again that the West will lack the patience to remain
engaged. He may be right; but it is a gamble.

</DATELINE>

POLAND'S economic situation was much worse than he expected before taking
office Mr Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, told the Senate
yesterday. Appealing to parliament's upper chamber to pass the government's
first quarter budget provisions, the newly appointed head of government
added: 'Maybe I wouldn't have taken on this responsibility if I had known
what I know now.'
Speaking on the eve of a threatened one-day protest strike by members of the
former communist trade unions, Mr Olszewski warned that even after cuts in
government spending aimed at reducing the budget deficit target to Zl
17,600bn (Pounds 890m) the real budget out-turn could be overwhelmed by the
volume of overdue 1991 payments. These could add another Zl 20,000bn to the
total, he said.
In an attempt to bring the deficit under control the government has cut
energy subsidies and reduced unemployment pay, setting off a wave of labour
unrest.
Preliminary figures issued by the Central Statistical Office, however, show
the depth of a recession which has cut industrial production in the state
sector by nearly 40 per cent over the last 2 years and seen unemployment
rise from practically zero in 1989 to 2.1m, or 11.4 per cent of the work
force last month.
Year on year inflation, however, fell to 60.4 per cent in December from 249
per cent in December 1990 while real incomes grew by 3.1 per cent after a 25
per cent decline in 1990.

FT  16 JAN 92 / Ukraine takes dim view of colourful coupons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FROM peers to peasants, the verdict yesterday was that with its first
economic steps the government of newly independent Ukraine has fallen flat
on its face.
High-powered foreign advisers and locals grumbling in shop queues agree that
the January 10 introduction of coupons parallel with the faltering rouble is
exacerbating inflation without the palliative effect of genuine monetary
reform.
Notwithstanding their bright colours and a picture of Kiev's historic St.
Sophia cathedral, the coupons are such an obvious misstep that they seem
likely to provoke a radical re-shuffle of the largely ex-Communist cabinet
members who introduced them.
'It is an inconceivably stupid system,' says Hungarian-born financier Mr
George Soros, in Kiev to advise the Ukrainian government. 'The dying,
moribund Communist apparat is trying to introduce monetary reform, and it is
an absolute disaster.'
In an effort to protect the relatively well-stocked Ukrainian market from
the full impact of Russian price increases, each Ukrainian resident was
issued with between 200 and 400 coupons, depending on salary. Once the
system is in place, at least 25 per cent of wages are to be paid in coupons,
which are the only currency valid for the purchase of food and consumer
goods.
In Mr Soros's view the hastily conceived system 'is a machine for inflation'
because the government intends to dole out fresh coupons each month without
an effective system for getting them back.
Mr Soros is also critical of the one-to-one official exchange rate between
the rouble and the coupon and the lack of a distinction between the two
currencies in government accounts, even though coupons give priority to
scarce goods.
This loophole, he said, 'is an invitation to large-scale arbitrage and is
responsible for the steep fall in black market rates for coupons. Initially,
coupons sold for ten roubles, but now five days into the reform the street
value of coupons is down to 2 to 4 roubles.
Acknowledging the failure of the rouble/coupon system, President Leonid
Kravchuk announced this week that on March 1 coupons would become the only
currency valid in Ukraine. Mr Soros believes this measure would make the
best of a bad situation, but he thinks the government should introduce a new
currency as soon as possible, preferably in March or April.
The inept introduction of coupons has provoked public protests and
encouraged political attacks on the government.
Sir Geoffrey Howe, another one of Ukraine's advisers, believes that it is
not just individuals but also government structures which are to blame for
Ukraine's inability to implement defective reforms. He is particularly
critical of the rivalry between the parliament, the president, and the
cabinet ministers, which often paralyses the state.
Ukraine has set up a new bank to pay the republic's share of the foreign
debt of the former Soviet Union and handle foreign economic relations,
Moscow Radio said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The new bank will take over the activities of the Soviet foreign trade bank,
Vneshekonombank, in Ukraine.

THE twin burdens of unification and recession in export markets slowed west
Germany's economic growth rate to 3.2 per cent in real terms last year, the
government statistics office said yesterday.
Although higher than the 2.4 per cent average growth in the past 10 years,
it was the weakest result since 1987, when gross national product (GNP) rose
1.5 per cent, and contrasted sharply with the 4.5 per cent 'boom' rate in
1990.
The figures show that west Germans tightened their belts last year: private
consumption and state demand increased by only 2.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent
respectively, compared with 4.7 per cent and 2.1 per cent in 1990.
But nothing could prevent the widening of the gap between the old federal
republic and the five former DDR states, and a sharp rise in state borrowing
to a record DM87bn (Pounds 30.6bn).
The first figures since unification showing 12 months' results from both
sides of the country, revealed that east and west together generated GNP
worth DM2,807bn, of which the east - with 20 per cent of the united
country's population - contributed just DM193bn, or just 6.9 per cent of
GNP.
Every western worker produced goods and services worth DM88,800 last year,
compared with DM26,300 in the east. Average gross incomes in the five new
states, meanwhile, rose to 45 per cent of western levels.
GNP figures for the final quarter of last year, due yesterday, were not
published, although a statistics office official was reported to have said
they 'appeared' to show no improvement on the previous quarter.
Private consumption in the west in 1991 was almost halved, mainly by the
impact of a 7.5 per cent income tax levy and other duty rises imposed to
help fund projects in the east. Inflation averaged 3.5 per cent during the
year, although the GNP price deflator, an indicator of domestically
generated inflation, rose 4.4 per cent compared with 3.4 per cent in 1990.
State borrowing, pushed up by the DM11bn cost of Germany's contribution to
the Gulf war, is expected to fall to about DM45bn this year.
Despite the setbacks, and recent further deceleration in growth, officials
insisted that Germany had not slipped into recession.

THE governments of Serbia and Croatia have revived secret negotiations aimed
at dividing up the ethnically-mixed republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Bosnian
officials said yesterday. They warned that any such attempt would lead to
terrible bloodshed.
Mr Haric Silajcic, Bosnia-Hercegovina's foreign minister, said Mr Nikolai
Koljevic, a prominent member of Bosnia's Serbian Democratic Party, had held
informal talks with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in Zagreb on
Tuesday.
'The two extreme wings of Croats and Serbs in Bosnia, which are supported by
Mr Tudjman and Mr Slobodan Milosevic (Serbia's president) respectively, are
trying to carve up our republic,' explained Mr Silajcic.
Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, Bosnia's deputy prime minister, said Mr Tudjman
wanted to revive the districts of 1939 when Croatia included parts of
western Hercegovina. Croatian academics believe Mr Tudjman wants to bring
Croats together in one independent state, as Mr Milosevic wants to do with
the Serbs.
Any agreed break-up between Zagreb and Belgrade would give Serbia the
opportunity to link the self-proclaimed Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina,
in south-western Croatia, with Serbia by driving a wedge across
north-western Bosnia.
Both ministers said the negotiations, first started between the two
presidents in March 1991, had been revived to try to shore up the flagging
support of the Croat and Serb presidents. Nationalists on both sides have
become disillusioned because Serbia has failed to quash Croatia's
independence bid, while a third of Croatia's territory is still under the
control of Serb militants and the army.
Bosnia-Hercegovina's 4.3m population is divided between Moslems (44 per
cent), Serbs (33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent). The militant Serbs, led
by Mr Radovan Karadzic, a Milosevic ally, could rely on the army in the
event of a forcible break-up of the republic.
The army, which has put more soldiers into Bosnia-Hercegovina as it
partially withdraws from neighbouring Croatia, is under the control of
General Vladimir Vukovic, a Serb nationalist closely connected with General
Blagoje Adzic, the new defence minister, and Mr Milosevic.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the republic's president, flew yesterday to Paris with
Mr Silajcic for urgent talks with President Francois Mitterrand on Bosnia's
internal problems. Before leaving, he said: 'Some of our politicians are so
short-sighted that they cannot see that nobody can partition the republic
and not even a single village can be taken from it.'
However, Mr Stjepan Kljuic, the moderate head of Bosnia's Croatian
Democratic Union party, the sister party of Mr Tudjman's party in Croatia,
is losing ground to Mr Marte Boban, the Croat nationalist leader in western
Hercegovina.
On the other side, prominent Croat intellectuals from Sarajevo, the Bosnian
capital and opposition parties in Croatia and Serbia have protested against
any attempt to carve up the republic.

FEARS that the Soviet army may emerge as a powerful political force in the
former Soviet Union increased yesterday with news that 5,000 officers and
servicemen are to hold a special conference in Moscow tomorrow. The aim is
to 'discuss urgent problems of the state of the armed forces and ways of
preserving their unity'.
The collapse of the Soviet Union has left the 3.7m-strong armed forces
without a clear role, facing a large reduction in size and possible break-up
as individual republics attempt to establish their own armies.
There is already considerable discontent among soldiers, many of whom are
living in tents and facing unemployment after being withdrawn from Europe.
This has provoked widespread fears of a military coup, or at least of the
army's playing an increasingly dominant role in politics.
'Such a large gathering of generals and marshals in the country's principal
conference hall officially turns the army into a powerful independent
political force,' the Moskovskii Komsomolets newspaper commented yesterday.
Mr Dmitry Volkogonov, a military adviser to President Boris Yeltsin and a
former general, said: 'The army is a very large force and the stability or
otherwise of the country largely depends on it.'

BRITAIN last night seemed headed for another clash on social policy with its
European Community partners after the Brussels Commission proposed EC-wide
work restrictions for people under 18 years old.
The draft directive, which Brussels proposes should be adopted by a majority
among EC governments, would bar children under 15 from most regular work,
except for instance in entertainment or delivering newspapers. For those
under 18 years it would ban overtime and most night work.
But Europe's teenagers will still be able to undertake certain types of
light or irregular work, including work at harvest time and night work in
restaurants and bakeries.
EC officials said the main impact would be felt in southern European
countries and Britain, which in 1989 repealed certain work restrictions for
16-18-year-olds, including some provisions of International Labour
Organisation conventions that the UK had earlier signed.
UK officials said the main problem for Britain would be the working time
restrictions for youths of 16 years and older, who, since the 1989 UK
Employment Act, were treated as adults, while the Commission plan went wider
than current legislation in protecting minors from physically risky work.
Brussels yesterday proposed measures to try to stop art thieves and
smugglers exploiting the planned abolition of internal EC border checks by
the end of this year.
The proposal would create a common export licence for designated national
treasures leaving the Community, and a system allowing one EC state to
recover stolen art works from another.
The draft directive, already extensively discussed with the EC governments
that must formally approve it, would not get Greece back the marble friezes
taken by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon in the 19th century and now in the
British Museum.
The restitution procedure only applies to works of art illicitly exported
after December 31 1992.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Brisk business on Beijing's back streets: Russian and Polish
traders bartering with Chinese entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM inside the heavy coat of a burly Russian the nose of a small Pekinese
dog sniffs the cold air. The dog is worth Dollars 300 to the Russian who is
hunting for a buyer among the Chinese stall-holders. He may trade it for
silk jackets or heavy down-filled coats of many colours to sell in Moscow at
a handsome profit to his fellow Russians, hungry for consumer goods of any
kind.
To a Chinese trader making thousands of yuan a month, a dog like this
represents status, convincing evidence that he has made it. In the narrow
alley in Beijing's diplomatic quarter, the silk market is lined with stalls,
packed with Russian and Polish 'businessmen' and alive with tourists.
Business is brisk and much of it is barter.
From the Republic of Mongolia, adrift without Soviet aid and struggling to
make the painful transition to a market economy, a middle-aged couple has
arrived with a large Mongolian carpet, folded onto a suitcase trolley. They
are asking only 500 yuan (Dollars 125).
The stallholders, who each paid 3,000 yuan (Dollars 750) a few years back
for their three-square-metre wooden shelters, small protection against the
biting cold, shoo them away. They can't sell that here.
Along the alley two blonde Russians trade telescopes, cameras, costume
jewellery and watches. The Chinese stallholder who sells the goods on to the
tourists displays hundreds of Soviet watches, their faces a pictorial
history of recent events across the border. There is the perestroika watch,
the George Bush meets Mikhail Gorbachev watch, the Boris Yeltsin timepiece
and the Gorbachev, 'President of the USSR', watch. Already an antique, the
stallholder claims, slicing his hand across his throat. The price is 520
yuan (Dollars 130). There won't be any more. He does not go into detail
about the watch mechanisms.
Here everything is for sale. A young woman in a stylish black fur hat bought
in Hong Kong is repeatedly asked if she will sell it. Would I sell my
tape-recorder?
Russians and Poles are the market's main foreign customers. Many of them are
regulars, flying in from the Russian Republic with dogs, watches or US
dollars, and flying out again with up to 20 sacks of goods. In the early
days the Yugoslavs were top dealers but their numbers have tailed off with
the civil war. Some of them would fly in twice a month, the return fare of
Dollars 800 from Belgrade easily recouped from the sales of the Chinese
goods ferried back home.
The stallholders are cagey about their business. A young man with permanent
waved hair said business had slowed down since Christmas but he admitted to
making Y2,000 to Y3,000 a month. The likelihood is a great deal more.
In the murky interiors of the little wooden 'shops', screened by 'curtains'
of multi-coloured jackets, the real business for many people is money
changing - US dollars into renminbi, the non-convertible 'people's money'.
The rate was up to 5.95 rmb to the dollar recently, but at the turn of the
year was falling back to 5.9. The bargaining is hard.
On the northern Sino-Soviet border it is a similar story. At Heihe the
two-way flow of trade across the frozen Amur river suffered scarcely a
hiccup through the turmoil of the Soviet coup attempt. The Russians swap
watches, toys and garlic presses for Chinese tracksuits, sneakers, shampoo
and bubble gum.
As in Beijing's silk alley the consequences of communism's collapse in the
former USSR is of little moment to the Chinese residents of Heihe. 'They
leave us alone', the Beijing stallholder with the permanent wave said of the
always watchful authorities. He used to be a factory worker earning Y150 a
month.
At the next stall two women, the younger one heavily made up, are shy about
questions. 'Take me to America and I will tell you all the secrets of the
business,' says the younger one, grinning broadly.

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary-general, warning that jobless rates will
rise this year, gave rich industrial countries a black mark for their
attempts to tackle the root causes of unemployment, Reuter reports from
Paris.
'The record so far has not been all that satisfactory,' Mr Paye told labour
ministers of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development at the start of a two-day meeting.
'Despite solid economic growth over a prolonged period, our labour market
institutions, private sector practices and government policies have not
succeeded in mobilising and using the full potential of our human
resources,' he said.
With unemployment levels unlikely to recede to 1991 levels before 1993,
despite the expected economic rebound, Mr Paye said remedial measures were
needed, especially to help the most needy and vulnerable.
'But the fundamental challenge is to ensure these actions are consistent
with the objective of fundamental reform, and do not delay, impede or
imperil the adjustment that is needed to provide the basis for sustained
growth of employment.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Italian Treasury alarmed at plans for spending
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian Treasury yesterday sought to prevent the imminent dissolution of
parliament and spring elections becoming an excuse for the political parties
to increase government spending, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
Alarmed by a flood of laws being pushed through the legislature to satisfy
special interest groups against the prospect of an April general election,
the Treasury yesterday requested parliament to block all financial
provisions currently going through the chamber.
The request also underlined Treasury anxiety about over-runs in spending
targets in the 1991 budget and the bunching of expenditure at the beginning
of the new financial year.
A government spokesman said: 'It is natural at the end of the legislature
that a larger number of financial provisions tend to be tabled. Some
provisions are correct and will inevitably be passed but there are others
which clearly go against the need to hold down public spending.'
He added: 'If these steps are not taken the budget is undermined, making
subsequent adjustments necessary.'
Police confiscated 4m litres of wine in northern Italy yesterday and
arrested four men in an alleged new doctoring scandal, Reuter reports from
Milan.
Para-military police said the wine had probably been laced with toxic
substances in five cellars near the northern towns of Vicenza and Padova.
Italy, one of the world's largest wine exporters, was badly hit by a scandal
six years ago in which 23 people were killed by adulterated wine.

EUROPEAN Community central bank governors yesterday discussed setting up the
European Monetary Institute, the proposed forerunner of a European central

Its establishment as an advisory body on monetary union was agreed at the
Maastricht summit last month. The plan is to have it begin operation in
January, 1994.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said after EC
central bank governors' monthly meeting at the Bank for International
Settlements that the organisational structure of the EMI, staff numbers and
the question of whether employees would be seconded from national central
banks or would be on the EMI payroll needed to be resolved.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank chief, said that they also need to
define how the EMI would relate with the national central banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, was moving quickly yesterday to
resolve a delicate political crisis after his health minister, Mr Julian
Garcia Valverde, was forced to resign. Mr Gonzalez, to whom cabinet changes
are anathema, was understood to be preparing to name a successor.
Mr Garcia Valverde resigned because of a growing scandal surrounding land
speculation near Madrid by the state railway monopoly, Renfe, of which he
was president before being promoted to the government nearly a year ago. He
thus became the first minister in any of Mr Gonzalez's governments since the
Socialists first came to power in 1982 to resign as a direct result of
corruption charges, despite a string of political scandals.
El Pais, the country's biggest newspaper, yesterday welcomed the
resignation. 'In a country that seems to be getting used to a rigid division
between the reality of the lives of its citizens and their political
leaders, and in which the word resignation appears to have no place, Mr
Garcia Valverde's decision is highly significant,' it said.
By taking responsibility for a series of payments by Renfe to intermediaries
in order to buy land which it hoped to sell later to finance the
construction of a new railway line, Mr Garcia Valverde has overnight
converted himself into a minor folk hero. Last year alone the government was
caught up in at least four serious corruption scandals.
Mr Gonzalez, who is anxious to discard his government's shaky ethical image,
is understood to want to appoint a successor to Mr Garcia Valverde quickly
and is unlikely to use the resignation as an excuse for a large cabinet
reshuffle. But there are serious doubts about the health of his veteran
foreign minister, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, whom illness forced to
miss last month's Maastricht summit.
A rapid appointment to the health portfolio would help the prime minister
allay speculation that he might call a general election before he has to in
October 1993.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Exhibition Marks Holocaust Date: Germany confronts its
Jewish past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has mounted a remarkable exhibition on Jewish life before the
Holocaust, marking its anxiety to atone for the murder of 6m European Jews
planned nearly 50 years ago at a lakeside villa in Berlin.
'Jewish Worlds,' depicting 3,000 years of Jewish life opened at the weekend
in Berlin under the patronage of Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the German
president. Later this week, the villa at the Wannsee where representatives
of the German government gathered on January 20, 1942, to approve the
details of the 'final solution' will be dedicated as a memorial site.
The sombre anniversary of the beginning of the Holocaust provides the
background for the exhibition which brings together rare Jewish religious
and secular works from museums and libraries around the world as well as
artifacts of daily Jewish life. It takes up 20 rooms of the Martin Gropius
exhibition building.
Mr Andreas Nachama, one of the exhibition organisers, said this was the most
valuable collection ever of rare Jewish manuscripts. An edict by Catherine
the Great on the establishment of Jewish settlements is shown for the first
time outside St Petersburg.
The exhibition directly adjoins the 'Topography of Terror', the basement
cells of former Gestapo headquarters where prisoners were tortured. It is
also only a stone's throw from the former Berlin Wall which some Germans saw
as one of the prices they had to pay for the Nazi crimes committed in their
name.
Costing DM10m (Dollars 6.3m) from the city and federal governments, and with
added support from Lufthansa, the exhibition comes at a time when budgets in
Bonn and Berlin are strained to the limit by the economic costs of
unification. But the exhibition was conceived several months before the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and received top priority.
The dedication of the 'Holocaust villa' at Wannsee comes after decades of
indecision about what to do with the infamous site which was used as a home
for schoolchildren until recently.
The so-called Wannsee Conference was organised by Reinhard Heydrich, the
senior SS officer who headed the Security Police, on orders of Hermann
Goring, the Reichs Marshal. Top officials from all the main ministries took
part and approved a document by Adolf Eichmann, a deputy to Heydrich.
The 'final solution of the Jews' was to take place in the east where columns
of Jewish labourers from all over Europe were to build roads. 'Undoubtedly,
a large part will be eliminated by natural reduction,' the transcript said.
Those who remained would be the most 'robust' and were to be 'accordingly
treated' as they represented a natural selection and, if freed, could form
the nucleus of a 'new Jewish revival'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unnoticed and unmourned by his own people, Mikhail Gorbachev was the centre
of media attention yesterday when he arrived for his first day of work as an
ordinary citizen after six years as the Soviet president, writes Leyla
Boulton in Moscow.
His first appointment could not have been more appropriate. It was with Dr
Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, a fellow elder statesman
who helped change the face of international relations with an earlier round
of superpower detente.
Mr Gorbachev now plans to combine an unspecified dose of politics with
public speaking, writing and research.
Since he was pushed out of the Kremlin by Russian president Boris Yeltsin
last month, he has moved to a three-room apartment in south-west Moscow with
his wife Raisa. It is close to his new office as chairman of the so-called
Gorbachev Fund, an international centre for political, social and economic
research.
Mr Gorbachev may still provide a few surprises. Thirteen top government
officials and army commanders involved in the August coup were formally
charged yesterday with conspiring to seize power. Some Russian officials
have suggested that the 13 have potentially explosive material on the former
Soviet leader. Newspapers have speculated that Mr Gorbachev may be
prosecuted for receiving intelligence reports on his political opponents
while in power.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN stock index futures was characterised by volatility, with many
traders choosing to focus on the short-term outlook, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March Footsie contract opened strongly on the back of a squeeze and soon
raced to a premium of 40 to the underlying cash market.
However, a surprise announcement by the Bank of Spain of an increase in its
short-end interest rates curtailed the March contract's early advance and it
retreated to a premium of 22, its estimated fair value to cash.
However, buying soon returned and March recovered the ground lost after the
announcement, boosted by the strong opening on Wall Street and a squeeze
towards the market close.
March ended at 2,561, some 23 points above its estimated fair value premium
to cash. Turnover reached 6,370 lots.
In traded options, turnover recovered from Monday's poor level to reach
29,608 contracts. The FT-SE 100 index was busy and had 7,643 contracts
traded. Boots was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,940 lots, with a
Kleinwort Benson roll-over trade of 1,000 contracts reported to have been
responsible for the majority of the day's business.

FT  15 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: More stable performance by equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MORE confident perform-ance from the UK stock market yesterday saw share
prices move steadily forward after brushing off initial uncertainty caused
by the rise in some Spanish interest rates. Trading volume, however, was
unimpressive and stock shortage pushed prices ahead in an equity market
still taking its lead from the futures sector.
Two modest buying programmes were identified and shares advanced across the
broad range of the market. Store and retail issues came in for support as
some strategists shrugged off the latest statistics on consumer credit and
stressed the annualised gain in retail sales in November.
Although firm at the opening, equities were held back initially by the rise
in some ever, the stock market recovered its confidence as traders had
second thoughts on the implications of the change in Spanish rates.
Perhaps more significantly for the market in its present mood, the March
futures contract opened strongly and, with sterling also in better form, the
stock market advanced by nearly 25 FT-SE points, recapturing the 2,500
territory.
The first trading programme came, reportedly, from a leading agency broking
firm and helped the market forward. The second programme was smaller but
helped to steady a market cautiously awaiting the opening of the new session
in New York.
However, with Wall Street ahead by 20 points on the Dow in UK trading hours,
London resumed its upward track to close at the day's best. The final
reading of 2,516.3 left an advance on the session of 26.2 points.
Seaq-reported volume, which does not distinguish between genuine customer
business and intra-market dealing, increased to 519.7m shares from Monday's
429.3m. Stock Exchange statistics confirmed that retail business fell away
on Monday, totalling only Pounds 781m, compared with daily totals above
Pounds 1bn in recent trading sessions.
Traders believed that customer business had recovered yesterday but stressed
that marketmakers were forced to push prices ahead sharply when a few buyers
caught them short of stock. The erratic performance of the market since
Christmas, often in response to an even more erratic stock index futures
sector, has put pressure on trading books still recovering from the holiday
period.
The latest data on domestic producer prices, disclosing a gain of only 0.1
per cent on output prices last month, buttressed expectations that inflation
is being curbed.
Among securities houses taking a more positive view on UK equities, Strauss
Turnbull saw the Footsie in the 2,600 to 2,650 range by April, when the
political background may become more difficult from the market's point of
view, since the UK will by then be very close to a general election.
Further support for leading oil shares again provided a strong boost for the
UK market yesterday. Both BP and Shell were wanted, although some other
international blue chips held back while awaiting a clearer sign on the
outlook for the US dollar.
Glaxo, still regarded as the wonder stock of the international sector, gave
back a few pence yesterday, and the pharmaceutical sector as a whole turned
in a less dramatic performance than of late.

Wall Street
THE STOCK market rally returned with a bang yesterday, as share prices rose
sharply across the board to take indices to record closing highs, in spite
of disappointing news on December US retail sales, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 60.60 to 3,246.20, its best level in
history, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 6.10 to an all-time peak
of 420.44. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks eclipsed its
previous run of record highs by ending 8.12 stronger at 625.75. Turnover on
the New York SE was a heavy 266m shares.
Yesterday's gains reversed two days of losses, which were more the result of
profit-taking than of a significant change in investor attitudes. Low
interest rates, which have made equities look more attractive than other
forms of assets, and expectations of an economic recovery by mid-year, are
still the dominant forces in the market. The fact that the current reporting
season - covering the final quarter of 1991 - has so far included no nasty
surprises has also helped to keep sentiment buoyant.
Denials from Corning that the best-selling silicone breast implants made by
its subsidiary Dow Corning are unsafe, and that full testing has been
carried out on the product, initially failed to stem the decline in its
share price. At one stage the stock was another Dollars 4 lower, but the
feeling that the selling had been overdone spurred late buying and Corning
ended unchanged on the day at Dollars 68 3/8 .
Dow Corning announced yesterday that it was taking a Dollars 25m charge in
the fourth quarter, temporarily laying off some workers and closing two
breast implant production lines. Dow Chemical, the other partner in the Dow
Corning joint venture and which has escaped most of the recent selling, fell
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 1/8 .
American Express firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 1/8 on reports that the
company is considering selling half of its ownership of Lehman Brothers, the
Wall Street securities house. The sale, which could be partly to Lehman's
management and partly to the public, could raise as much as Dollars 1bn.
Citicorp was again the most actively traded stock of the day, rising Dollars
1 5/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in turnover of 11.27m shares. Investors have been
keen on the stock since Monday, when the bank predicted a return to
profitability this year.
Chase Manhattan, which reported fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, edged
Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 20 1/2 after confirming that it would like to
buy Crossland Savings, the troubled New York savings and loan institution,
from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Chase is believed to want
only Crossland's core deposits, and not its loans or branches outside the
New York area.
Oil issues remained well-bid in the wake of higher petroleum prices. Texaco
climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 1/8 , British Petroleum Dollars 2 to Dollars
64 1/2 and Exxon Dollars 1 to Dollars 60 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO finished broadly higher in heavy trading in line with the strong
gains on the New York Stock Exchange.
The composite index forged ahead 40.6 to close at 3,635.0, a 52-week high.
Rises led declines by 382 to 237 after volume of 35.2m shares.
Fleet Aerospace gained 39 cents to CDollars 1.45. A newspaper report said
Belgian firm Promavia International is in talks concerning an equity
investment in Fleet, including a possible takeover. However, Fleet said it
had received no such proposals.

RUSSIA'S new agriculture minister, Mr Viktor Khlystun, said yesterday that
his country needed to import 20m tonnes of grain this year but that its own
producers could begin to meet domestic needs in 1994. Russia imported 16m
tonnes of grain last year.
He forecast that domestic agricultural production would rise in 1993 and
meet demand in 1994 thanks to fast-track market reforms by the Russian
government to redistribute land this year to all peasants and city dwellers
who wish to go into private farming.
The state is abolishing the old system of compulsory deliveries to the state
at artificially low prices to improve incentives to sell under the present
system. Peasants in future will be required only to sell 35 per cent of
their grain to the state - at market prices.
Workers at profitable state and collective farms are being told about the
advantages of switching to co-operative, joint stock enterprises or
individual holding. But only chronic loss-makers would be forced to abandon
the state system imposed by Stalin in the 1930s at great cost to both
Russian agriculture and the peasantry.
The government said it would cut off subsidies to unprofitable farms - even
though some of the 2,500 farms with debts would be allowed to stay if they
were viable.
'We are not going to force these stages through but we will bring the
philosophy of agrarian reform (to everybody concerned),' said Mr Khlystun,
anxious to reassure public opinion that violent Bolshevik-style reform was a
thing of the past.
He admitted that one obstacle to sweeping market reforms was that parliament
had yet to abolish a moratorium on the sale of land in the Russian
constitution. For the time being, land can only be sold by peasants who have
received a share of state land, to other inhabitants of the same region. But
he said he had not found strong opposition to reform plans on a recent visit
to farming areas - 'only the doubts and objections to specific points'.
The main problem he suggested was a shortage of finance and equipment to
help new farmers get started. 'The mood in the countryside is much more
stable than in the cities. What worries villagers most is the extremely high
price of agricultural machinery and they are also concerned about the
shortages of consumer goods on sale in villages,' he said.
Mr Khlystun said there was a particularly urgent need for animal feed
imports to stem a fall in livestock and dairy production.
The minister, who rejected calls for the government's resignation as
'premature', said he also expected food prices in the shops to come down
after soaring with radical price reforms on January 2.
Although the long-term solution was market reform of agriculture and the
trade network, he said some producers were already being forced to lower
prices for lack of purchasers.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: The cost of saving the spotted
owl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US Fish and Wildlife Service is attempting to strike a balance between
environmentalists' demands and the interests of the US timber industry, by
reducing the acreage of Pacific Northwest coastal forests that must be
protected as the 'critical habitat' of the Northern Spotted Owl.
The rare bird, which was designated as a 'threatened species' last year, has
become the focus of a highly charged clash between environmentalists, who
claim that logging will destroy the owl's habitat of 'old growth' forests,
and the timber industry, which fears the loss of thousands of jobs and
predicts an escalation of lumber prices.
The dispute has also become a symbol of a much broader debate over the
economic impact of US state and federal regulations designed to protect the
environment by restricting industrial activity.
In its latest attempt to resolve the spotted owl dispute, the US Fish and
Wildlife Service, an agency of the US Interior Department, has designated
6.9m acres of federal forest lands as critical habitat for the owl. That is
4.7m acres less than the agency proposed last year.
The protected forests would encompass federal lands in the states of
Washington, Oregon and California in which logging would be curtailed or
severely restricted.
By reducing the size of the protected habitat, the federal agency claims
that it will save about 1,000 jobs and return 65m board feet to the base of
lumber that can be harvested in the region each year. 'We recognise the
profound impact of potential job losses and have sought to strike a balance
between the interests of people and wildlife,' said Mr John Turner, director
of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
The agency admitted that efforts to save the owl were likely to eliminate
about 33,000 jobs but said that many of these jobs might be lost anyway,
because of the recession, the slow construction market and a reduction in
log exports.
The Western Council of Industrial Workers, a labour union representing
timber industry workers, said, however, that the government agency was
'grossly under-estimating' the impact of protecting the owl's habitat. The
union claims that more than 100,000 jobs will be lost if the plan is
implemented.
Environmentalists condemned the reduction in protected acreage, however. The
decision would lead to a loss of half of the owl population and further
destruction of irreplaceable ancient forests, said an official of for the
Wilderness Society.
Meanwhile, a US cabinet level committee is conducting hearings in Oregon to
consider whether to allow logging to continue in that state, regardless of
the effect on the owl. The committee is known as the 'God Squad', because it
has the power to allow a species to become extinct if it determines the
economic impact of protection is too great.
Separately, in California, the state legislature is expected to approve
bills that would set a limit on the rate at which old-growth lumber can be
harvested and require replanting. The compromise proposals, backed by
California governor Pete Wilson, are also supported by several lumber
companies and environmental groups.

<TEXT>
A US judge has ordered the government to block imports of tuna from Italy,
Spain, France and Japan on grounds that they buy the fish from countries
where fishermen use a method that kills dolphins, Reuter reports from San
Francisco.
The Earth Island Institute said yesterday that Judge Thelton Henderson,
sitting in San Francisco, had granted the environmental group an injunction
ordering a halt to imports from the countries.
The San Francisco-based organisation has waged a court fight since 1988 to
stop fishermen from using nets that kill dolphins as they catch tuna. It
says 6m dolphins have been killed since fishermen began using the nets.
The practice was outlawed for US fishing fleets in the early 1970s.

GROWTH IN world oil demand is expected to be sluggish this year, according
to the International Energy Agency's latest monthly oil market report. The
western monitoring body expects an increase in demand of 500,000 barrels a
day to 66.8m b/d - 1 per cent above last year's level, which was depressed
by the effects of the Gulf war and the recession.
Most of the growth in oil consumption by members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development is expected to come from North America
following a pick-up in economic activity. Demand from the former Soviet
Union is expected to fall 7 per cent to 7.7m b/d.
The IEA noted that production of oil in the former Soviet Union dropped to
9.5m b/d in November - the latest month for which figures are available -
leading to an estimate of a decline in output of 1.1m b/d for last year.
Output by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries edged up in
December to 24.2m b/d, the IEA said.
Venezuela's production of crude oil last year averaged 2.488m b/d, the
highest recorded since the petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976,
officials said, Joe Mann reports from Caracas.
The figure, which includes crude oil and small proportions of condensates
and natural gas liquids, represents an increase of nearly 11 per cent on
1990. Exports of crude oil and refined products in 1991 averaged 2.08m b/d,
up more than 10 per cent.
Venezuela's proven reserves of crude oil totalled 62.8bn barrels at the end
of 1991, up 5 per cent from a year earlier.

interest rate fade

THE SELL-OFF in the US bond market continued unabated yesterday morning,
despite a set of weaker-than-expected retail sales data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at
105 3/8 , yielding 7.533 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, down
1/16 at 100 1/32 , and yielding 4.965 per cent.
News of a 0.4 per cent decline in December retail sales, and a totally
unexpected revision in November sales - down from an initial rise of 0.3 per
cent to a drop of 0.5 per cent - should have provided a boost to the market.
The fact that it did not, was the result of two factors: faded hopes of
another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve; and persistent
profit-taking as players continued to sell into the recent rally.
In the credit markets, the Fed performed two-day matched sales just before
midday in an attempt to push the Fed funds rate higher. After the matched
sales, the rate - which has been depressed in recent days because of an
excess of funds in the system - firmed slightly from 3 7/8 per cent to 3
15/16 per cent, but still just below the Fed's target of 4 per cent.
UK government bonds gained up to half a point yesterday, boosted by positive
inflation news and sterling's strengthening against the D-Mark.
The news that UK producer output price growth slowed in December was seen in
the market as a sign of falling underlying inflation. Output prices rose 0.1
per cent on the month and 5 per cent year-on-year, compared with November's
0.4 per cent monthly rise and 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase.
Short-dated gilts rose by about a quarter of a point as the pound
strengthened to 2.844 against the D-Mark. The 10 per cent gilt due 1994
increased from 100 1/4 to 100 13/32 , while among long-dated issues the
benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 114 19/32 to 115 by
late afternoon. The Liffe gilt futures contract rallied from its opening of
96.14 to 96.28. Other factors which helped to lift gilt prices included the
rise in German government bonds and rumours that an opinion poll due to be
released today would show the Labour party's lead over the Conservative
party had fallen to one point.
STRONG demand for 10-year German government bonds pushed bund prices up
yesterday as traders noted demand from central banks and fund managers.
The Liffe bund futures contract rose from its opening of 87.94 to close just
below the high of the day of 88.29.
JAPANESE government bond prices firmed yesterday afternoon on news that
central bankers at a Bank for International Settlements meeting agreed to
accept the yen's appreciation.
The news report appeared in the Japanese economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun
and helped to push the yield on the benchmark No 129 from 5.37 per cent to
close at 5.35 per cent in Tokyo.
The dollar finished at Y126.05, lower than Y127.00 in New York late on
Monday.

investor fears

<TEXT>
A LONG-STANDING controversy over the safety of silicone breast implants has
turned into a public furore across the US this week, frightening thousands
of patients and casting a financial shadow over the leading manufacturer of
the device, Dow Corning Corporation, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The row heated up last week when the US Food and Drug Administration ordered
a moratorium on the use of silicone breast implants until new information on
their safety could be assessed. And it grew to fever pitch this week when US
newspapers disclosed company documents which, they alleged, suggested Dow
Corning had rushed breast impacts to market without sufficient safety tests.
The implants are used in plastic surgery to enlarge a woman's breasts for
cosmetic reasons or to replace breasts lost to cancer. Critics claim that
silicone can leak from the implants and migrate to other parts of the body,
causing complications.
Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Corning, the glass products
manufacturer, and Dow Chemical, the large chemicals group, has strongly
denied the allegations. Yet mounting stock market concern has led to a 16
per cent drop in Corning's share price since Monday morning, prompting Mr
Jamie Houghton, the company's chairman, to issue a statement yesterday
claiming that investors were 'grossly over-reacting'.
However, investors fear that the latest controversy over Dow Corning's role
in the development of the implant business could open the floodgates to
hundreds of product liability lawsuits, embroiling the company and its
parents for years in costly litigation.
An estimated 2m women worldwide have received breast implants over the past
30 years, more than 1m of them in the US, and Dow Corning is by far the
largest American manufacturer. Other producers include McGhan Medical,
Mentor and Bioplasty.
Dow Corning has already had a foretaste of the potential problems: last
month, a jury in San Francisco awarded Dollars 7.34m in damages against the
company to a woman who alleged that ruptures in her breast implants were
linked to an auto-immune disease. Dow Corning is appealing against the
judgment, pointing out that two of the plaintiff's doctors said in court
that her disease preceded the implants.
However, the jury said that Dow Corning fraudulently failed to disclose the
risks of implants.
The plaintiff's case relied heavily on internal Dow Corning documents dating
back to the 1970s, when silicone implants were being developed, which
appeared to show a lively debate within the company over the safety of the
devices. The documents appear to have played a role in last week's FDA's
moratorium, which came as a surprise, since the agency had been expected to
follow an advisory panel recommendation last November to leave silicon
implants on the market.
The controversy intensified this week when US newspapers, notably the New
York Times and Wall Street Journal, published summaries of the internal
documents and claimed these suggested Dow Corning may have rushed the
product to market without adequate tests.
However, Mr Robert Rylee, chief of the company's health care business, hit
back, claiming that the reports were a mis-characterisation of the facts,
that internal company memos were not science, and 'the cumulative body of
credible scientific evidence shows that implants are safe and effective'.
The next crucial point is likely to come in February, when the FDA is
expected to follow up its 45-day moratorium with fresh recommendations.
Meanwhile, Dow Corning announced yesterday it had shut down its silicone
implant production lines in the US and was taking a Dollars 25m pre-tax
charge in the fourth quarter to cover the costs of the controversy. It also
pointed out that the breast implant business covered only 1 per cent of the
company's 1990 sales of Dollars 1.7bn, much of which involves chemicals with
a wide variety of uses.
At parent Corning, Mr Houghton said he expected that the row would have no
significant impact on the group's long-term performance.
Corning's share price fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 in early trading
yesterday but rallied to close unchanged at Dollars 68 3/8 . On Monday
Corning's share price had fallen Dollars 10 5/8 . Dow Chemical, which fell
only Dollars  7/8 , to Dollars 53 7/8 , on Monday, yesterday lost a further
Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 52 1/8 .
Analysts said that Dow's share price had been hit less because it was a much
larger company than Corning, with annual sales of Dollars 19bn compared with
Dollars 3bn, and because Corning, having enjoyed a strong rally in recent
months, was vulnerable to a correction.
Amid all the flying accusations, those suffering most are the women who have
undergone breast implants. The American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons says its members have been flooded by calls from
frightened patients, but they have been unable to fully address these fears
because they have not been given access to the FDA's new safety information.
For all concerned, some very uncomfortable weeks still lie ahead.

PRIMERICA, the US financial services group, yesterday announced record
fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 132.1m, due primarily to another strong
contribution from Smith Barney, its Wall Street broking subsidiary.
The buoyant final quarter took Primerica's full-year earnings to Dollars
478.8m, well up on the Dollars 372.9m booked in 1990.
Breaking all previous records in the firm's 118-year history, Smith Barney's
Dollars 49.8m profit in the fourth quarter and its Dollars 152.4m in the
full 12 months were achieved on the back of bullish domestic equity markets,
big increases in new stock issues and increased market participation by
individual investors.
Within the broking firm, the biggest improvements were recorded in
investment banking, retail and institutional commissions, principal trading,
and asset management fees. At the same time, profit margins were boosted by
reductions in fixed expenses.
The insurance unit, Primerica Financial Services, suffered a decline in
earnings, which dropped 15 per cent to Dollars 41.8m in the quarter,
although full-year profits actually increased slightly to Dollars 174.6m.
More worryingly, sales of new life insurance fell in the quarter and in the
year.
Earnings from the consumer services businesses increased slightly to Dollars
45.2m in the quarter. Annual earnings from the consumer lending and direct
marketing divisions, however, were Dollars 175m, well up on the Dollars
153.5m posted in 1990.
Primerica's figures were well received on Wall Street, with the group's
share price rising Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 40 3/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

A SETTLEMENT has been reached between the US Internal Revenue Service and
Executive Life of California (ELIC), the ailing Los Angeles-based insurer,
the Californian Insurance Department announced yesterday, writes Nikki Tait.
A Dollars 643m tax claim against ELIC had threatened to jeopardise attempts
to rehabilitate the life insurer, which was seized by state insurance
regulators in April after a policyholder run. Yesterday, however, the
insurance department said that the claim had been settled for Dollars 73m.
Late last year, the insurance department struck a deal with a French
consortium, led by Credit Lyonnais and its Altus Finance subsidiary, over
ELIC's future. Essentially, Altus would acquire ELIC's junk bond portfolio,
while a group of French investors would take over the restructured insurance
liabilities.
Since then, two major matters - the tax claim and a dispute over how holders
of ELIC's municipal guaranteed investment contracts should be treated in
this reorganisation - have required resolution.

THE SLUMP in the US hotel and leisure industries was underlined yesterday
when Hilton Hotels, one of the leading lodging and gaming groups, reported a
25 per cent reduction in 1991 profits to Dollars 84.3m after tax.
In the final quarter, Hilton made Dollars 29.6m after tax, compared with
Dollars 27.3m in the same period of 1990. However, the apparent improvement
was due to the absence of a Dollars 10m property provision. At the operating
level, profits fell by 18 per cent to Dollars 56.3m.
Hilton said that recession and the over-supply of hotel space had 'severely
impacted' operations for the year.
Occupancy levels were down from 68 per cent in 1990 to 64 per cent last
year, while average room rates remained unchanged.
During the 12-month period, gaming profits fell by 12 per cent to Dollars
115m, and hotel profits by a sharper 23 per cent, to Dollars 92.9m. Revenues
overall were Dollars 1.11bn (Dollars 1.12bn).
However, in the fourth quarter it was the gaming side which saw the sharpest
setback. Operating income from hotels improved, from Dollars 27.3m to
Dollars 31.7m, while the Nevada-based gaming operations turned in only
Dollars 26.4m, compared with a record Dollars 48.4m in the last quarter of
1990.

MOTOROLA, the leading US electronics and semi-conductor manufacturer,
reported improved fourth-quarter results, buoyed by the performances of its
semi-conductor, cellular telephone and paging businesses.
Fourth-quarter income rose to Dollars 126m, or 96 cents a share, from
Dollars 109m, or 82 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1990, when Motorola
suffered an earnings decline. Sales for the quarter rose 4 per cent to
Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.93bn in the same period last year.
Fourth-quarter results reflected 'sluggish economies in the US and Europe',
Mr George Fisher, chairman and chief executive, said.
'This impact should continue to be felt in the first half of 1992 with the
potential for modest economic growth in the second half.'
Sales for the full year increased 4 per cent to Dollars 11.34bn, from
Dollars 10.88bn in 1980. However, earnings declined to Dollars 454m, or
Dollars 3.44 per share, from Dollars 499m, or Dollars 3.80, in the previous
year.
Motorola said sales of its communications products rose two per cent in
1991, against the previous year. Semi-conductor products sales rose 7 per
cent. However, the company's computer sales fell 2 per cent and the
information products group recorded increased operating losses for the year.
The company also recorded losses due to investments in a proposed global
communications system called Iridium.
Military and government sales fell 8 per cent, despite a significant
contract for secure telecommunications equipment from Saudi Arabia. The
Automotive and Industrial Electronics group reported an 8 per cent increase
in sales.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Paper, the large US forest products group, yesterday announced
a 33 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, once special charges are
stripped out of the figures. It blamed this mainly on the sluggishness of
the US economy and said it expected difficult business conditions to
continue in early 1992.
Its fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars 66m, or 59 cents a share,
including a Dollars 4m after-tax special charge for an accounting change and
a Dollars 37m one for severance costs. In the fourth quarter of 1990
earnings totalled Dollars 23m, or 20 cents a share, after a Dollars 137m
charge for a business improvement plan.
Without the special charges, 1991 fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars
107m, compared with Dollars 160m the previous year. Mr John Georges,
chairman, added that fourth-quarter sales and earnings 'about equalled
second and third-quarter levels as the domestic economy remained stagnant'.
Full-year earnings totalled Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, after
Dollars 231m of special charges, compared with Dollars 569m, or Dollars 5.21
a share in 1990 after Dollars 137m of special charges. 1991 sales dipped 2
per cent to Dollars 12.7bn.
Mr Georges said the company's packaging and distribution business reported
stable quarter-to-quarter earnings, while the timber and wood products
businesses had higher earnings. Domestic linerboard benefitted from
increased demand and prices, but sales of uncoated printing and writing
papers, coated papers and imaging products had stalled.

GENERAL MOTORS, the troubled US vehicle manufacturer, is trying to sell its
Allison Transmission division, which produces medium and heavy-duty
automatic transmissions for trucks, buses, military and off-road vehicles,
writes Martin Dickson.
GM is thought to have lost as much as Dollars 3bn in 1991 and needs to
bolster its balance sheet. It announced last month it would be closing 21
plants and shedding 70,000 jobs in North America over the next four years.
Mr William Hoglund, executive vice-president in charge of its automotive
components group, said the Allison move was consistent with GM's plan to
focus on improving its core business.
Allison, which employs just under 6,000 people and has a turnover of about
Dollars 800m, represents less than 1 per cent of GM's business. Mr Hoglund
said most of the heavy-duty automatic transmissions operating in the US, and
nearly 10 per cent of those abroad, were made by the company.
One interested party might be Detroit Diesel, the heavy diesel engine
company which GM sold three years ago to a joint venture headed by Mr Roger
Penske, an entrepreneur and former racing driver. Another possibility is a
management buy-out.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ever Ready helps Bhopal pariah
regain its balance - Union Carbide India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GITA PIRAMAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VIJAY GOKHALE, head of Union Carbide India (UCIL), goes to extraordinary
lengths to distance his group's name from the Ever Ready batteries that it
produces.
This is his strategy to protect the income of the group, which become a
pariah overnight after the Bhopal gas disaster which killed more than 3,000
people and injured 200,000 in December 1984. In spite of seven years of
public UCIL-bashing, the batteries continue to sell as briskly as ever.
Significantly, in an industry where three leading players have closed down,
UCIL has managed to maintain sales growth and its market share of about 42
per cent.
The results of the latest six months have been particularly good. Sales rose
sharply by 23 per cent to Rs1.36bn (Dollars 53.3m), while gross profit moved
up by 8 per cent to Rs950,000.
'We would have done even better if our factory in Kashmir had been working.
We sell everything we produce,' says Mr Utpal Basu, finance director.
This factory, which accounts for 29 per cent of UCIL's battery production
capacity, has been closed for the past 20 months because of local law and
order problems.
UCIL has a total of 10 factories in India and a subsidiary in Nepal,
producing 504m batteries annually, as well as battery intermediates and
battery-related products such as torches.
Even more significantly, the sales growth was in spite of a directive -
never officially stated - banning UCIL advertisements on all
government-controlled media.
'We used to be big radio advertisers. After Bhopal, we found it difficult to
get our advertisements accepted. So we decided to keep low, trim our ad
budget, and pay more attention to rural markets,' says Mr Kishore
Hattangadi, corporate communications manager.
Today, barely 40 per cent of UCIL's sales are in urban areas.
Another outcome of the disaster is that every UCIL application for
modernisation, new projects or expansion has been turned down. Money became
tight for the company, with banks wary of lending to a concern which did not
know what liabilities would arise from the disaster. With these problems,
UCIL needed to take on additional talented managers, but because of its
image recruitment was extremely difficult.
Perhaps inevitably, this experience has left UCIL a trimmer and fitter
company. Internal communications are swifter, the management of working
capital tighter, and productivity higher.
Moreover, UCIL has shed more than 2,000 workers from its over-staffed
payroll since 1984. Today, it employs 6,460 people. Over 1,000 dropped out
when UCIL sold its petrochemical business in 1988 and a substantial number
accepted voluntary retirement schemes.
Mr Gokhale, who is chairman and chief executive, says proudly: 'We have not
had a major strike since 1984.' However, recent labour problems, aggravated
by a politically-charged atmosphere at UCIL's Calcutta plant, may mar this
record.
Except for this one problem, there is a strong sense of optimism at UCIL's
Bombay headquarters. 'We survived and . . . we are back in business,' says
Mr Gokhale.
'We would like to lease the closed facilities of former competitors.
Software is emerging as a sunrise business, and we would like to enter this
field. Building components is another area we are looking at,' he explains.
His enthusiasm may be premature. The October 1991 Indian Supreme Court
judgment rejecting appeals that UCIL increase the Dollars 470m settlement
reached in 1989 - but lifting criminal immunity  - may have closed the first
chapter. However, the Indian government has since reopened the case for
criminal liability and the Bhopal High Court wants Mr Warren Anderson,
president of Union Carbide of the US, to appear before it on February 1 this
year.
Government permissions may therefore continue to be elusive. Aware of this,
Mr Gokhale perseveres in brushing the dust off old project reports.
It is the same spirit which enabled him unflinchingly to head a company
responsible for the deaths of thousands, meet hostile journalists head-on
and support UCIL's demoralised employees.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Looking down the wrong end of the barrel -
The expensive habits of the former Great Western Resources chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE residents of Friockheim, a small Scottish village north of Dundee, have
a sure-fire way of knowing when Dan Pena is entertaining at his castle home:
they listen for the nocturnal gunshots.
For Mr Pena, chairman and chief executive until recently of Great Western
Resources, the troubled US-based oil and gas company quoted in London, likes
to take some of his visitors hunting - at night.
Positioned on the raised back seat of his four-wheel drive buggy, guests are
driven around his 156-acre estate at high speed, gunning for rabbits.
But these days, Mr Pena - who proudly displays big game trophies, including
a stuffed buffalo, in the castle rooms - may feel as though he is on the
other end of the barrel.
Great Western shareholders, unhappy with the collapse of the company's share
price from 238p in August 1990, to 8p last night, have forced his departure
from the company he founded 10 years ago.
Mr Pena makes no bones about it, he did not want to go. 'I was terminated
without cause,' he says unashamedly.
The story is a familiar one to Pena, who was unseated from his previous
company, JPK Industries, following a 'boardroom split' in 1982. As with
Great Western, the board members decided in Mr Pena's absence to vote him
out of the oil refining and marketing company.
A former Wall Street whizz-kid with Bear Sterns - and alleged to be the US
investment bank's youngest vice-president back in the 1970s - Mr Pena has
trodden a controversial path during his time in London.
He set up Great Western just months after his abrupt departure from JPK,
with Dollars 820 and based in his son's nursery in Los Angeles.
Two years later, in 1984, the company was floated in London with a board
including the former Governor of New York state, Mr Hugh Carey. Some years
later, the Greenwell oil analyst who had helped to float GWR joined as a
non-executive director. His name was Peter Lilley. Mr Lilley quit when he
became a member of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet.
Even in the early years, analysts relate that Mr Pena was a larger-than-life
figure who kept a pistol in the drawer of his office desk.
Stories about Mr Pena's lifestyle are the stuff of legend. He has even been
known to attend an exclusive health clinic in Switzerland which uses sheep
placenta injections as a method of physical rejuvenation. A fitness fanatic,
Mr Pena is proud of his imposing physique.
Many of the tales about Pena's taste for the high life were behind
increasing shareholder dissatisfaction with the way he ran Great Western.
'He thought nothing of ordering Pounds 250-Pounds 300 bottles of wine when
he was in London,' said one close associate who dined with him at Le
Gavroche. 'And the company was paying.'
Shareholders, including the normally reclusive Kuwait Investment Office,
formed a coalition to force his removal when it became apparent that Mr Pena
had received more than Dollars 2m in expenses and compensation, in addition
to his pay, during fiscal 1990. Of that, Dollars 1.4m was subsequently
converted into loans by the company without shareholder approval, as
required by the UK stock exchange. Mr Pena claims the company was unaware it
needed such approval.
With some bitterness he notes a comment from one shareholder that, had GWR
not fallen foul of its largest customer, the South Carolina Public Services
Authority, no-one would have cared how much he received in corporate money.
The group lost some Dollars 32m in revenue from coal shipments to SCPSA
which withheld payment because of a dispute over contract pricing.
The deal now being hammered out by GWR and Mr Pena's lawyer - he says
defiantly he has hired the highest-paid plaintiff lawyer in the US 'just as
a safeguard' - will involve the repayment of Dollars 1.4m of loans.
GWR is determined that the loans will be repaid from his pay-off and Mr Pena
is equally determined to get his golden handshake - no matter how. 'I'm a
litigious person,' he says with some relish. 'Litigation keeps people
honest.'
Until 1989, Mr Pena worked for GWR without an employment contract, living
off a relatively insignificant salary, the dividends paid on his stake, and
independent means. It was not until entrepreneur Mr Lawrence Hockey-Sweeney
offered to buy Mr Pena's 43 per cent voting stock that the board decided to
issue contracts. 'Shareholders thought it was a good idea at the time,' says
Mr Pena.
GWR's dividend policy has come under attack recently by the very
shareholders who benefited for so many years. 'One begins to wonder whether
one was being fed a line,' said one significant shareholder who prefers to
remain anonymous. 'The argument was that there was more emphasis on dividend
policy in the UK.'
Mr Pena acknowledges that some shareholders preferred to see the dividend go
into exploration - which is more usual in oil and gas companies. But he adds
that the dividend policy had been designed to draw in a broader shareholder
base.
Meanwhile, Mr Pena was able to fund the Dollars 1m purchase and Dollars 4m
refurbishment of a run down Scottish castle in 1984. The castle is now owned
by an off-shore trust the indirect beneficiaries of which are, in Mr Pena's
words, the Pena progeny in perpetuity.
Mr Pena - of Hispanic origin and the son of a California policeman who he
claims has been linked to the CIA - now makes his home there for some four
months a year.
He has even taken to wearing the Guthrie plaid on occasion.
Guthrie Castle, a rambling Victorian castle, boasts a leisure centre, a
squash court, and is furnished to a high - and expensive  - standard.
Mr Pena is particularly proud of the portraits of himself and his wife - to
whom he has renewed his marriage vows three times - which he commissioned
from Mr Howard Morgan.
Both hang in the castle, one a regal portrait of the lady of the house, the
other a dark moody rendering of Mr Pena and his dog Driller, with the castle
in the background. Both portraits have been exhibited in the National
Portrait Gallery.
When asked if he now intended to retire to the seclusion of his Scottish
estate, Mr Pena replied that 'anything is possible'. Even political office.
Having once considered running for the governorship of California, Mr Pena's
ambitions are obviously boundless.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Barbour Index rides the recession with 5%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession in the construction industry has failed to dent profits growth
at Barbour Index, the specialist information supplier.
On turnover ahead from Pounds 6.94m to Pounds 7.17m, the pre-tax line for
the half year to end-October rose some 5 per cent to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds
2.66m). The shares rose 12p to 191p.
'The recession is still with us, it just means we have to work a lot harder
and be a good deal smarter' said Mr Jack Dunn, appointed chief executive in
a revamped management structure.
This has seen the group split from two to four operating divisions: the
renowned and weighty compendium - 'you could build buildings with it' Mr
Dunn said - used as a reference manual by the construction industry; the
telephone enquiry service, the microfile, used by quantity surveyors and
architects; and the health and safety division, which was doing 'bloody
well' according to Mr Dunn.
The interim dividend goes up from 2.2p to 2.4p, payable from earnings of
11.1p (10.5p) per share.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Prudential's new business holds firm in
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THE recession, Prudential Corporation's new business held firm last
year.
New annual premium business, more vulnerable when consumer confidence is low
because it requires long-term saving commitments, dropped slightly from
Pounds 663m to Pounds 662m.
But single premium business increased by 25 per cent to more than Pounds
3bn.
Single premium products showed strong growth in the UK, rising 52 per cent
to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds 926m). Most of this came from the Prudence Bond, a
single-premium bond investing in the Prudential's main with-profits fund,
which was launched through independent intermediaries in May and took in
Pounds 350m. The Prudential is also distributing the bonds through its own
sales force.
Mr Peter Nowell, chief actuary, said he had no plans to follow the lead of
other offices and withdraw the bonds from the market.
The other main sources of new business were additional voluntary
contributions to pensions, popular when people are worried about their jobs,
and 'transfer bonds' which receive transfers from pension plans when the
holders are made redundant or change jobs.
Mr Mick Newmarch, group chief executive, said: 'The strong growth in single
premiums is all the more pleasing given the current recession and the major
restructuring of our direct sales operation.'
Outside the UK, sales of annual premium products fell 8 per cent to Pounds
172m, while single premium business rose by 9 per cent.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Talks try to avert clash over right to
silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRENUOUS EFFORTS were underway yesterday to avert a head-on clash between
Parliament and the judiciary over the Maxwell brothers refusal on Monday to
give evidence to the Commons social security committee.
Discreet behind-the-scenes talks between Mr Frank Field, the committee
chairman, and party managers were understood to be seeking a formula that
would satisfy the rights of committees and those of citizens to remain
silent.
However, in a private meeting of the all-party committee today, Mr Field is
expected to seek the backing of his 10 colleagues to publish a report on
their defiance that could lead to a Commons debate and the Maxwells being
formally censured.
While acknowledging their common law rights not to have to give evidence
that might jeopardise their legal interests, the committee could ask the
House to call them to the Bar of the Commons.
As committee chairman and a champion of Parliament's rights, Mr Field, the
Labour MP for Birkenhead, is determined that the brothers are seen publicly
to be subject to the legislature's authority.
Nonetheless, some senior parliamentarians were cautioning last night that
every effort must first be made to find a negotiated compromise that would
satisfy both sides.
Several MPs of both main parties said yesterday that the genuine legal
difficulties of the case had to be acknowledged.
Constitutional lawyers remarked that the unprecedented circumstances of a
select committee inquiry running concurrently with legal actions had
seriously complicated the case.
The Court of Appeal is adjudicating on abid by Mr Kevin Maxwell to remain
silent on the pension funds affair after the High Court ruled in December
that he must answer questions put by the provisional liquidator of
Bishopsgate Investment Management.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat temporarily loses chief through
illness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT is losing the services of Mr Geoffrey Wilson, its founder and
executive chairman, for a number of months following successful heart
by-pass surgery on Monday.
The property company's share price has been under pressure in the past
fortnight due to rumours that the company was likely to break its banking
covenants and that it would not be able to refinance its Embankment Place
office block in the bond market. During that time the price has nearly
halved.
Mr Wilson will take some months to recover from the operation, which was not
preceded by any illness.
Analysts expect that Mr Richard Guignard, finance director, will take charge
in Mr Wilson's absence. The issue will be decided by a board meeting at the
end of the week.
It is also likely that the company will consider a permanent split between
the roles of chairman and chief executive.
The company has denied that it has breached it covenants. It said that its
Embankment Place bond issue, which is being handled by Dumas West, is
progressing smoothly and is likely to be signed at the end of the month.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: AGB market research sale reported to OFT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of food and packaged goods companies has complained to the Office of
Fair Trading about the possible sale of AGB Research - the private Maxwell
market research group - to its rival AC Nielsen of the US.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, the Arthur Andersen administrator, is in the process of
finalising the AGB sale.
The deadline for bids for various parts of the AGB business was Friday, and
he hopes to announce the purchasers later this week.
The most important of the AGB businesses include the continuing market
research panels on grocery and food sales.
The company also produces figures for research into television ratings.
The bidders include Nielsen, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet market research
subsidiary.
Companies including Kraft Foods, Nestle, and Unilever, have complained to
Sir Gordon Borrie, the director general of Fair Trading, arguing that a
Nielsen takeover would amount to the creation of a monopoly in large
consumer panel research in the UK.
AGB operates Superpanel, a family panel 8,500 strong which records all food
and packaged goods purchases on a weekly basis. The families in the panel
have barcode scanners in their homes and produce a very accurate record of
purchases.
Nielsen operates a rival 7,000 strong panel called Home Scan.
Mr Paul Freeman of Kraft General Foods, chairman of the Superpanel Users
Group, has written to Sir Gordon pointing out that a takeover of AGB by
Nielsen would give the company an effective monopoly of continuous panel
research in the UK.
Mr Freeman has asked the OFT to determine whether this would be in the
public interest.
The OFT has said that when it has official confirmation of a Nielsen bid for
AGB it will look into the issue as an apparent concentration of market
power.
The Superpanel Users Group also surveyed its members and every company asked
 -virtually all of Britain's leading food and packaged goods companies -
said it was not happy with a Nielsen takeover.
Copies of all Mr Freeman's letters to the OFT have been sent to Mr McKillop
and other potential purchasers such as GFK of Germany.
Because AGB has joint ventures on continuous research in other European
countries such as France, Spain and Germany Mr Freeman argues that there are
also European Community competition implications in any possible Nielsen
takeover.
The administrator, whose job is to realise the maximum from the assets of
AGB, now faces a difficult dilemma: if Nielsen has made the highest bid,
does he accept even though such a decision could lead to an OFT
investigation?
Nielsen declined to say yesterday whether or not it had bid for AGB, but
argued that the two companies accounted for no more than 20 per cent of the
market research business in the UK.
AGB is also responsible for providing the raw material for the BARB
television viewing figures - a contract Nielsen would also like to win.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Mirror journalists may suspend pension
payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOURNALISTS at Mirror Group Newspapers are considering suspending payments
to the company pension fund because of uncertainty about its future. One
Daily Mirror reporter, Mr Peter Kane, is prepared to issue a writ, as a test
case, against the company to prevent money being deducted for the pension
fund from his February salary.
The moves follow a circular from the pension trustees warning that although
normal pension payments were continuing, if none of the missing funds were
recovered the scheme was unlikely to be able to guarantee full benefits to
existing pensioners.
Following the collapse of the Maxwell empire there have been fears that more
than Pounds 400m is missing from the Mirror pension fund.
The National Union of Journalists is planning to join with other unions at
MGN to seek an urgent meeting with Mr Ernest Burrington, chairman of the
newspaper group, to discuss the future of the fund. Journalists fear that
the assets are so low that pensions are being paid directly out of the
contributions of existing staff. The NUJ is considering setting up a
separate fund for its members' pension contributions.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pearson interested in Maxwell businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, is still interested
in acquiring parts of the collapsed Maxwell empire despite its decision not
to go ahead with a bid for Mirror Group Newspapers.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, would like to buy the college
publishing division of Macmillan in the US, which has turnover of about
Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m), and is also interested in some of the Maxwell
business magazines in the Maxwell Business Communication division.
The college publishing business would fit well with Addison-Wesley, the main
Pearson educational publisher in the US. Macmillan, the main asset of
Maxwell Communication Corporation, successfully applied for Chapter 11
protection under US bankruptcy law which shields the company's assets from
creditors during reorganisation.
It is still unclear which Macmillan businesses will come onto the market,
but Pearson is unlikely to be a candidate to buy all of Macmillan.
The Pearson announcement that its flirtation with the possibility of making
a bid for MGN is over seems to be final rather than a tactical manoeuvre.
The company is interpreting its formal announcement to the Stock Exchange,
confirmed on Monday, as effectively barring any involvement for six months
as if a bid attempt had actually been made.
Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director, insisted that there was no split
on the Pearson board on the issue: 'That is the absolute truth,' he said.
On MGN, it seems it was Mr Barlow, a former Mirror executive in the 1960s,
who led his colleagues up the hill and then led them down again.
Pearson's interest flickered when a journalist called Lord Blakenham,
chairman and chief executive, to ask if the company was interested. Lord
Blakenham was about to say no when Mr Barlow advised delay.
'There's Pounds 70m a year cash flow in there,' was Mr Barlow's first
thought. Within a few days Lord Blakenham and other Pearson directors became
enthusiastic although Mr James Joll, finance director, was negative about
the idea from the outset.
Pearson, emphasising that it was only interested at the right price, asked
Lazard Brothers, its financial advisers in which it has a 50 per cent stake,
to investigate. Although it was impossible to get detailed figures, Mr
Barlow said that Lazards called the week before Christmas to set out the
numbers: that about Pounds 400m was missing from the Mirror pension fund,
some Pounds 100m from the company and there was normal debt of about Pounds
340m following the May flotation of MGN.
'When I heard those figures it seemed to me that it was very unlikely that
the deal was going to be possible,' Mr Barlow said.
In fact similar numbers had been around for quite a number of weeks. At
about the same time as the FT revealed the Pearson interest the paper had
also been reporting that Pounds 350m had gone from the MGN pension fund and
that it was feared that Pounds 95m had been siphoned off from the newspaper
group.
The weight of numbers, the uncertainty, the delay and the amount of
management time that would have to be diverted convinced Mr Barlow that
Pearson should not go ahead. He added that the reaction of the City was not
a factor.
Mr Eric de Bellaigue, publishing analyst at Panmure Gordon, had been very
negative. He said that the FT and the Daily Mirror had nothing in common
apart from a tinge of pink.
'It also sits uncomfortably with the emphasis on expansion in growth markets
 -popular newspapers in the UK are in the business of fighting over a slowly
diminishing cake,' he added.
Mr Barlow pointed out other analysts were more positive.
Last Monday Mr Barlow advised his executive management committee that he
thought the idea should be dropped. This view was endorsed at a routine
board meeting last Friday. The discussion lasted just 20 minutes.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Fisons chief quits on health grounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN KERRIDGE resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive of
Fisons, the UK drugs and scientific equipment company that has been the
subject of mounting criticism from its institutional shareholders in recent
months.
The company said his departure was due to ill-health after doctors diagnosed
a heart condition.
Mr Patrick Egan, a non-executive director of the company since 1985, takes
over as executive chairman. Fisons intends to appoint a new chief executive
and make Mr Egan non-executive chairman. It is looking for suitable
candidates both within and outside the company.
Mr Egan said that Mr Kerridge 'always knew' of the possibility of heart
trouble, 'and the events of the past few months cannot have helped'.
Those events include a 31 per cent fall in the company's share price from a
record high of 515p to 354p at Monday's close. Yesterday, the shares rose
11p to 365p.
The decline in the share price came despite Mr Kerridge saying at the
company's interim results in September that he was more optimistic over
business prospects than for several years. He forecast that two of Fisons'
products, Opticrom, an eye drug, and Imferon, a blood-iron treatment, which
had been suspended from the US market by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), should be back on sale quickly.
This did not happen and the shares fell steadily through the autumn.
Investor confidence was shaken on December 11 by the news that not only
would the ban remain in force but it had cost Fisons Pounds 65m in lost
profits.
City stockbroker James Capel is forecasting a profit of Pounds 185m for
1991, compared with Pounds 230m in 1990. It blames the fall on Opticrom's
and Imferon's problems.
Fisons then became embroiled in a public row with a Washington publication
called The Pink Sheet, which follows the FDA closely. The company accused
the publication of distortions in reporting FDA criticisms of its
manufacturing practice. The Pink Sheet responded that it had directly quoted
FDA officials.
Mr Egan denied there was bad feeling between the company and the FDA. The
matter will be tested at the next visit of FDA officials to Fisons due
before the end of March. He acknowledged that institutional investors had
been pressing for the roles of chairman and chief executive to be separated
at Fisons. He said that, apart from this request, shareholders had no
influence on the departure of Mr Kerridge.
Fund managers yesterday expressed surprise that Mr Kerridge was leaving the
company: 'It's been fairly obvious that something would happen but we are
surprised that he has gone altogether. We thought his role would split,'
said one.
Fisons was criticised in 1989 for over-confidence in expecting the FDA to
approve its version of Pentamidine, a pneumonia drug. The FDA chose a rival.
Mr Egan acknowledged that the company had 'not paid sufficient attention to
relationships with the City. We were naive, and perhaps there was wishful
thinking, over the FDA'.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Groupe Bull near to decision on US partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE BULL, the ailing French computer manufacturer, is close to a decision
on which US computer company it will choose as technology and equity
partner, according to sources close to the negotiations.
The sources say the French government is deeply divided over the outcome. A
decision is expected next week.
Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, and Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
the industry minister, favour Hewlett-Packard, the US minicomputer and
instrumentation supplier.
The French Ministry of Finance, however, is believed to support
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer.
IBM is reported to be extremely anxious to deny other US manufacturers the
opportunity of a partnership with Bull.
Hewlett-Packard is claiming that it can offer Bull better technological
collaboration in three key areas - high performance computer chips,
client-server computing and advanced networking.
Bull is an attractive partner since it has access to the French government
market, it has technology of value to its competitors and it would represent
an opportunity to share costs of developing the next generation of
high-powered workstat-ions.
Rumours that an investment in the French-Italian chip maker SGS Thomson
would be part of the price of the deal have no foundation but the French
have asked both IBM and H-P if they would be willing to license its high
performance chip technology to SGS Thomson.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Bush moves away from short-term fix option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush will focus on long-term growth measures in his State
of the Union address to Congress later this month, an event viewed as a
critical launch-pad for his 1992 re-election campaign.
A White House statement suggested that Mr Bush was leaning away from
proposals for a giveaway income tax cut for the middle class, and favoured
measures such as an investment tax credit and capital gains tax cuts to
stimulate the economy.
Other options being considered are tax credits for first-time home buyers as
well as tax relief to help people buy health insurance.
These proposals would be paid for partly by cuts in defence spending.
As well as opening his re-election campaign, the address, to be delivered on
January 28, is also a chance for Mr Bush to rebound from his record low
approval rating among voters.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press spokesman, said Mr Bush was close to
wrapping up the key decisions on an economic growth package. This would be
accompanied by general proposals for health care reform.
'The president intends to have a long-term growth and investment package, it
will be designed . . . as a stimulus for the economy and to ensure long-term
growth,' he said.
Mr Bush's proposals would be along the lines of 'long-term growth and
investment, what creates jobs, what protects people's homes, what protects
the interest rates they have'.
Last week, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, again cautioned
against the dangers of a fiscal 'quick fix' which would increase the federal
budget deficit, already expected to exceed Dollars 350bn (Pounds 195bn) this
year.
Mr Greenspan also said in Congressional testimony that the American public
was mainly concerned about poor long-term prospects.
Another factor influencing Mr Bush is that several prominent Democrats,
including Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner in the
Democratic presidential race, have called for a modest tax cut for the
middle class as a short-term fix for the economy.
Mr Fitzwater attacked the Democrat proposals. These ideas 'deserve a lot of
criticism', he said.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Big German union limits pay claim
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering and metal workers'
union, yesterday backed away from the double-digit pay rise demands which
have been a significant factor behind the Bundesbank's high interest rate
policy.
'We deliberately want to refrain from putting in double-figure claims,' said
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the engineers' leader, who announced a 9.5 per cent
ceiling for regional pay claims this spring by the 4m-strong union.
The recommendation demonstrates IG Metall's awareness that public opinion is
swinging in favour of wage restraint, but the claim is still more than twice
the inflation rate and is almost certain to be rejected by employers, who
have been swamped recently by gloomy forecasts.
The union's engineering branches are due to submit claims in March, when
forecasters expect Germany's economic downturn to be accelerating. Gross
national product figures, due tomorrow, are expected to show nil or
negligible growth in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter.
The union recognised Germany's economic difficulties, Mr Steinkuhler said,
and its 'recommendation' took account of what was socially desirable and
economically possible and necessary.
In spite of its apparently conciliatory tone, however, IG Metall decided to
go ahead with a strike ballot among its 135,000 steel industry members whose
10.5 per cent claim has been rejected by employers.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, deputy head of IG Metall, said steel employers had shown
an unyielding attitude.
As a result the steel talks had assumed 'a significance way beyond that of
the sector', but Mr Zwickel added that the union was still prepared to
negotiate.
The talks are deadlocked with an offer of just over 5 per cent tabled by
employers and proposals for more than 6 per cent from the union side.
The strike ballot is due to be held on January 26 when a 75 per cent
majority would be needed to call the workforce out.
Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of the country's largest steelmaker, Thyssen
Stahl, claimed that a settlement was possible, but he insisted that a deal
had to be less than 6 per cent.
He underlined his message by revealing a 42 per cent drop in profits, and
announced 2,000 steel job losses at the company this year.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Paying proper price for risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would make the following observations on the letter from Mr Kevin
Pratt, editor of 'Insurance Age' (January 7) commenting on an earlier
article by Richard Lapper.
Mr Pratt's attack on the Direct writers spells out exactly why the public
have voted with their feet. He is correct that Direct Line selects the risks
it writes very carefully: I entirely disagree that the insurance industry as
a whole should perpetuate its own inefficiencies by continuing to insist
that the good drivers should subsidise the bad ones. Bad risks will always
get cover but, just as the good drivers do with us, they will have to pay
the proper price for the risk they represent.
Surely, we all want to encourage people to drive as carefully and safely as
possible. Direct Line does not make it easy for young drivers to drive cars
they are too immature or inexperienced to handle. Our policyholders know
that they pay the rate for their own risk.
The comparison made between my remuneration and insurance commissions paid
to brokers out of premiums received is mischievous and misconceived. We have
made reasonably priced motor and home insurance available to people who,
previously, had no alternative but to pay the extra cost of commissions and
other expenses of the intervening broker on top of what their insurance
should really have cost.
Already, in only our seventh year of trading, we are in the top 10 UK
private motor insurers. Our mission remains to continue to offer the best
quality service at a very reasonable price.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Different light on post-steel era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof R HUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anthony Moreton and Stewart Dalby refer to Consett's post-steel
experiences as offering hope to Lanarkshire following the closure of
Ravenscraig ('Shattered towns that prove there can be a life after steel',
January 9). You report that some 5,000 jobs more than were employed in steel
have been created in Consett and the remainder of Derwentside District.
The facts, as revealed by the Department of Employment's Censuses of
Employment, are these. In 1978 more than 12,700 people were employed in
manufacturing in Derwentside District. Between 1978 and 1981, manufacturing
employment in Derwentside fell by slightly more than 8,000, largely as a
result of the run-down and closure of BSC's Consett steelworks. The net gain
between 1981 and 1989 was 1,270 manufacturing jobs. Thus between 1978 and
1989 there was a net decline of over 6,700 - over 50 per cent - in
manufacturing employment in Derwentside District. Such figures cast a very
different light on the prospects for Lanarkshire in its impending post-steel
era.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Foreign Affairs: The arms bazaar fragments - Nuclear weapons
know-how is leaking to developing countries - and the west is worried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that the break-up of the Soviet Union could be considered a threat
to international security would have been laughed out of court not so many
months ago. The collapse of the Soviet communist regime and the consequent
abandonment of its menacing military posture could only enhance the
prospects for world peace, it was generally believed.
It has not taken very long for these illusions to be shattered. Though the
US and its western allies are no longer faced by a monolithic enemy, they
have to deal with a much more insidious danger: the possible dispersal of
former Soviet nuclear weapons into much less secure and predictable hands.
Ostensibly, the worst-case scenario - that of the fragmentation of the
former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal into several independent nuclear
forces - appears to have been avoided, at least for the moment. At their
meeting in Minsk last month, the members of the new Commonwealth of
Independent States agreed that the ex-Soviet strategic nuclear forces would
remain under a single command, thus meeting one of the west's main concerns.
The man in charge will be the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, though
the other states with nuclear weapons on their territory - Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Belarus - will have to be consulted before they are employed.
The decision by at least two of these republics to become non-nuclear states
and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) must be considered a
bonus.
The settlement of the quarrel between Russia and Ukraine over the control of
the Black Sea fleet is a further step in the right direction, since all the
ships capable of carrying nuclear weapons will remain under central command.
Yet it is impossible to know at this stage whether these agreements will
survive the severe strains that have arisen between Russia and its sister
republics. Even on the most optimistic assumptions, the control and safety
of nuclear weapons in the republics will remain a serious problem during a
long transitional period.
Though all the new republics, except Russia, have agreed to remove or
destroy their nuclear weapons by the end of 1994, some experts believe that
such a process could take as long as five to 10 years in practice. During
this time, states which have neither the necessary expertise, facilities or
experience, let alone the financial resources, will be responsible for the
transport, storage, dismantlement and destruction of thousands of dangerous
nuclear weapons.
It is clear that they will not be able to carry out the provisions of the
1991 strategic arms reduction treaty (Start), which they have undertaken to
respect, nor do so in safe and secure conditions, without massive aid from
the west. Equally worrying, if not more so, is the likely impact of the
break-up of the Soviet Union on the worldwide proliferation of nuclear
weapons. Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, has just issued a stark
warning that as many as eight or nine developing countries could possess
nuclear weapons by the end of the century.
There is already a lively market in Third World states for cut-price Soviet
weaponry of all kinds. A Mig-29 aircraft is said to be going for the snip of
Dollars 25m. What price an intercontinental ballistic missile? But what Mr
Cheney and other western statesmen are really worried about is not so much
the transfer of actual weapons as the leakage of nuclear know-how to
developing countries seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.
The new independent republics are as fertile a head-hunting ground for
countries such as Libya, Iran and Pakistan as Germany was for the US after
the Second World War. Tens of thousands of scientists have already lost, or
are about to lose, their jobs as the result of the break-up of the Soviet
Union and can probably be bought for much less than the German rocket expert
Wernher von Braun in 1945.
Restricting the membership of the 'nuclear club' has always been an uphill
battle. The number of adherents to the 1968 NPT, who have undertaken not to
acquire nuclear weapons or assist others in doing so, has been steadily
rising since it came into force some 22 years ago and has now reached the
impressive number of 144. But the figures are misleading. While it is true
that no country has joined the official 'nuclear club' of the US, the former
Soviet Union, Britain, France and China since 1964, undeclared members have
been increasing slowly but steadily.
The spread of nuclear weapons has transformed the regional security picture.
In the Middle East, Iraq came Israel's presumed but unacknowledged
possession of nuclear weapons, before it was comprehensively stopped in its
tracks by the US-led military operation in the Gulf. In South Asia, both
India and Pakistan have long been considered at least as threshold nuclear
powers which, even if they did not already possess nuclear weapons, could
quickly develop them. The same is true for North Korea, South Africa,
Argentina and Brazil.
According to one school of thought, the possession of nuclear weapons by
rival regional states could lead to a stand-off between them and bring
stability to traditionally unstable areas, such as the Middle East. The more
widely-accepted view, however, is that greater proliferation of weapons will
inevitably lead to a heightening of political and military tensions in the
regions concerned. The openly expressed fear in some US quarters that
Pakistan could produce an 'Islamic bomb', which could become the basis of a
regional strategic bloc embracing Pakistan, Iran and the new Islamic
republics of Central Asia, may not be all that far-fetched.
These developments have been offset by some recent improvements in the
proliferation picture. South Africa, after the solution of several southern
African regional conflicts, signed the NPT and ratified its IAEA safeguards
agreement last year. Brazil and Argentina have also signed a bilateral
safeguards agreement which will be linked to the IAEA safeguards system. And
within the last few days, North Korea has concluded an agreement with South
Korea declaring the peninsula free of nuclear weapons and accepting
international inspections.
Nevertheless, the post-Gulf war discovery of the nuclear weapons development
programme of an NPT member state, Iraq, has underlined the shortcomings of
the treaty. The most urgent need is to strengthen the IAEA's safeguards
regime to make sure that in future all nuclear facilities are declared by
member states. That will require both a system of random or challenge
inspections and the closer involvement of the UN Security Council in the
non-proliferation regime, as it is already in the efforts to uncover Iraq's
undeclared nuclear activities.
At the same time, care must be taken that the strengthened safeguards system
does not give the appearance of an instrument used by the industrialised
world to restrict Third World development. If the NPT is to be extended in
1995 for at least another 25 years, the nuclear powers must make sure that
they have fulfilled their part of the original bargain, linking
non-proliferation efforts to real progress in nuclear arms control.
Many developing countries will argue that the Start treaty does not go far
enough. Their demand that further reductions of strategic weapons must be
complemented by a comprehensive test ban treaty to halt the development of
new nuclear weapons looks much more reasonable now than it did before the
disintegration of the Soviet Union.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: Music at the Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must presumably be a coincidence that the Docklands Sinfonietta has
looked to opera for its conductors to start the year. The week before last
it turned to the Royal Opera's Edward Downes and at the Barbican on Monday
to Sian Edwards, the newly-appointed Music Director in waiting at English
National Opera - this orchestra has its eye on the future, too.
To judge from this pair of concerts the Docklands Sinfonietta has a gritty
determination to get to the top. At the first the technical strength of the
strings had been well tested and on Monday we were introduced to no less
impressive wind and brass sections. They make a hard-working young
orchestra, forging their style through the sheer vitality and tenacity of
their playing, as perhaps befits a group born into the difficult world of
London Docklands in the 1990s.
There was not actually any operatic music on the programme. For a chamber
group of its size the Docklands Sinfonietta is ambitious to choose romantic
scores by Ravel and Dvorak, especially in the Barbican Hall, where the small
band of strings was compelled to spend much of the evening on overdrive. I
felt that Ravel's Ma Mere l'Oye, its new-found simplicity of textures
recalling the original piano pieces, came across better than the Dvorak, a
bracing and rather hard-edged account of the Sixth Symphony.
Nevertheless, the actual playing in both had some exciting moments. And in
between came one wholly exciting performance, of Britten's Violin Concerto
with Tasmin Little as the soloist. This was a meeting of minds, for neither
Miss Little nor Sian Edwards is a musician who likes to deal in
uncertainties, and the concerto came across with bold conviction.
Completed in 1939, the work caught Britten at the apex of his dazzling early
powers. Its writing, both for the violin and the orchestra, is unashamedly
brilliant and yet it is not often that one senses the performers allowing
themselves to revel in its virtuosity. Perhaps Tasmin Little makes less of
the bitter-sweet lyricism than one would like; but as soon as speed and
definition are called for, she drove the music on with real purpose and some
fairly scintillating playing.
The last pages of the score were not the questioning look back with a tear
in the eye that they usually feel, but a defiant facing of impending wartime
suffering head on, the violin part straining in its intensity, the orchestra
brutally cold. In its own way it was the most convincing live performance of
the concerto that I have heard.
Just a month ago, Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos led the London Symphony in a
triumphant account of Strauss's Symphonia Domestica. At the Barbican on
Sunday Beethoven's 'Choral' Symphony was at least triumphal; also
intelligent, and utterly controlled, but more interesting than deeply
stirring, for all the noise it made. The London Symphony Chorus in full cry
were admirable. Fruhbeck de Burgos preferred quadruple woodwinds for this
symphony (no extra horns, though), and used them unstintingly: one
interesting effect was that for much of the time they seemed to carry most
of the main argument, with the strings almost in supporting roles.
There were no 'visionary' effects, and very little aural theatre - unless
one counted the low strings' beautiful sotto voce in the first appearance of
the 'Freude' tune. The chorus, too, sustained a fine, unwavering pianissimo
for the difficult 'Sternenzelt' music.
The overriding impression nonetheless, mostly loud, was of a knotty, densely
argued piece of severe cut (like the 'Hammerklavier' Sonata of the same
time), vigorously expounded by someone who knows the score very well indeed.
One admired; one wasn't moved, not even by the Adagio, excellently modelled
and motivated though it was.
For the solo team, the baritone Erich Knodt led off in stentorian style,
passionate rather than sage. Though Lubica Rybarska's bright-edged, slightly
shrill soprano was not well matched with Alfreda Hodgson's big, penetrating
tones, the whole quartet - with Ben Heppner's elegant tenor - carried its
weight and more.
Before his Strauss last month, the conductor had planted a rivetting
performance of neglected Sibelius, Night-ride and Sunrise. This time he
chose the Schicksalslied of Brahms (after Holderlin): usually hard to
programme, since it is shortish but requires substantial choral weight, but
best-vintage Brahms, with its luminous Elysian idyll at the start and later
its from-the-heart representation of the troubled modern conscience.
The faithful art with which Burgos captured the tone and the piercing
anxiety, no less than the distinguished work of the chorus, went a long way
toward claiming a permanent place in the repertoire for the Schicksalslied.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Saving the day for solar
energy - The latest developments in sun power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is one of the UK's most important research centres into solar energy
located indoors? It's not a joke, especially not to Professor Brian
Brinkworth, who is in charge of the laboratory at Cardiff University's
mechanical engineering department.
'It's because you can simulate different conditions far more accurately,' he
explains.
Most people expect an answer blaming the British climate, saying you cannot
generate solar power if the sun does not shine.
However, such beliefs - allied with a damning report in 1980 by the
Department of Energy which decided that solar energy was too uneconomic to
merit government help - have put the solar power industry in the UK under a
cloud for more than a decade.
Now confidence is rising. A new report on the economic strengths of the
technology is due out in the next few months from the government's advisory
body, the Energy Technology Support Unit (Etsu) at Harwell. 'I think the
government is prepared to look at solar energy in a much better light,' says
Roy Swayne, director general of the 30-strong Solar Trade Association (STA),
an industry body of makers and fitters of solar equipment.
Business is booming among STA members: the first six months of last year
produced twice as much work as 1990, continuing a rising trend during the
past three years.
'After two hot summers and two mild winters, people are beginning to get
interested again,' Swayne says.
The STA bloomed before, in 1980 when it had more than 100 members. Business,
measured in the number of square metres of solar panelling installed,
attained a peak that year at roughly 21,000 square metres.
Then came the government report, as well as the realisation among the public
that some of those providing systems were cowboys. Business shrank - down to
about 5,000 square metres in 1985. Installations in the UK are expected to
exceed 10,000 square metres again this year.
The key to this revival is the public's perception of the industry. In the
1970s and early 1980s those promoting solar energy offered it as a solution
to high energy costs. Now the justifications are environmental: it is
non-polluting and kind to rainforests.
Solar energy systems can absorb any ambient solar radiation. 'There are
hardly any days when you don't get any sunshine at all,' says Brinkworth.
'There is just a big seasonal variation. And nowhere on earth gets more than
three times the solar radiation that we do here.'
The systems fall into three categories:
In 'active' systems an outside panel absorbs radiation, and heats up a
storage medium - typically water. That is circulated by a pump. Used in hot
water systems or central heating, active solar systems can save between 50
and 65 per cent of a home's annual energy costs. Roughly 45,000 are
installed in the UK. A system with four square metres of solar panelling
costs about Pounds 1,000.
Passive systems are facets of building design, such as smaller windows and
the use of double-glazed conservatories to create a private 'greenhouse
effect'. Government estimates say that by 2025 widespread use of passive
systems could shave Pounds 100m off the nation's fuel bill and reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by 2m tonnes.
Photovoltaic systems were originally developed for space-going satellites
but are now familiarly earthbound on everything from watches to calculators.
They typically contain silicon-based semiconductors, which generate
electricity directly from light. They have no moving parts but high
manufacturing and material costs make them roughly 10 times more expensive
than coal or nuclear power.
There are no manufacturers of photovoltaics in the UK, though BP Solar (a BP
subsidiary) makes them in Spain and Australia. Most manufacturers are
Japanese or American, with a few in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.
Industrially, the technology is regularly used to power remote sensors far
from the electricity grid. Users include Thames Water, British Telecom and
even the national grid itself.
For all three forms, government support in research is vital, which is why
the decisions of 1980 still rankle. 'They got it all wrong, says Swayne.
'They averaged everything, rather than looking at what the best results
were.'
In 1980 the Department of Energy classified alternative energies as suitable
for medium- or long-term research funding. Passive solar heating was
identified as a short-term solution, and therefore was not eligible for
funding.
Active solar systems meanwhile lost on economic grounds. 'They said it
didn't compete with existing fuels,' says Swayne. 'That included nuclear.
But they hadn't looked at the real long-term costs of nuclear power - of
decommissioning.'
Photovoltaics were dismissed as energy sources in the mid-1970s, and again
in 1982: 'The Department decided it was not practical,' says Brinkworth.
'But the rest of the world didn't. The impression given by the report's
conclusions at the time seriously set back the industry's own efforts and
research. Work in other countries has progressed, but the UK has only just
kept going.'
Other countries have been more enthusiastic about solar power as a
supplement to conventional energy sources. Japan has an operational 1MW
photovoltaic power station. Germany gives tax allowances on solar systems,
which has made it the biggest market in Europe. In the Netherlands,
government grants of up to 60 per cent of the installation costs are
available for photovoltaic systems. But in the UK, says Etsu, no incentives
are provided.
However, last November Colin Moynihan, the energy minister, announced a
Pounds 150,000 feasibility project to investigate the potential for using
large, amorphous silicon panels as cladding for buildings. The project will
be carried out by BP Solar and will supplement its electricity supply.
Although such panels are about 5 per cent less efficient than smaller
systems, they have the advantage of size: they can be hundreds of metres
square.
Photovoltaics may have the brightest future of all the solar technologies.
In a recent issue of Nature magazine, Brian O'Regan and Michael Gratzel
announced a system which captures 46 per cent of available light and
converts more than 80 per cent of that into electricity - giving overall
efficiency of 37 per cent. The scientists say that is more efficient than
photosynthesis in plants.
It compares with present photovoltaic systems which are between 12 and 14
per cent efficient. The new system uses very thin films of titanium dioxide
on glass, which can convert the longer light wavelengths in the infra-red.
However, until that development reaches the market, solar power companies
have to make do with what they have.
Solar power enthusiasts also know they have not really crossed the divide
from 'alternative' to practical until industry starts buying their products.
'There's a big market there, or should be, for energy savings through heat
exchangers,' says Roy Blower, managing director of Filsol, a solar heating
installer.
The reason offered is that unlike domestic buyers, industry wants a very
rapid payback. 'If it's longer than two years they put a big question mark
against it,' Blower adds.
The solar industry is also fighting to widen its typical buyer beyond the
typical profile - middle-aged or retired, middle-class, with some money to
spare, perhaps after children have left home.
Young buyers are rare. As Swayne puts it: 'For young people, if the choice
is between buying a new car or a solar energy system, they buy the new car
every time.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Management: A safety net for pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revelations of the missing millions at the Maxwell companies' pension funds
have set off a clamour for tougher laws for trustees and fund managers.
The National Association of Pension Funds thinks the answer is to broaden
the boards of trustees and to put strict limits on pension funds investing
and dealing in the company's own shares. Others have suggested that trustees
should have to pass a 'fit and proper' test.
But Robin Ellison, partner at Ellison Westhorp, pensions solicitors and a
member of the Occupational Pensions Board, argues that existing pensions law
protects members against the alleged transgressions by the Maxwell funds.
That view is shared by many within the pensions industry who point out that
if Robert Maxwell did transfer pension fund assets to his personal accounts,
the actions would be illegal by any definition. Instead, Ellison argues that
what is needed is not laws, but insurance.
Already, most pension fund trustees who are also company directors are
covered by so-called 'directors and officers' policies. Fund managers
usually have an 'errors and omissions' policy to cover them for oversights
or negligence in their administration of funds.
But the amounts insured by these policies are small relative to the funds
under management. 'The highest limit we've heard of for trustees is Pounds
5m,' said Michael Ambrose, associate director of insurance brokers Alexander
Stenhouse. For fund managers, insurance policies never exceed Pounds 25m, an
amount that would do little to help the members of the Maxwell company
pension funds.
Obtaining insurance cover against fraud is problematic in any industry. 'We
cannot indemnify individuals against the consequences of their own dishonest
acts,' said Reg Brown, underwriter at RE Brown, a Lloyd's insurance
syndicate and a specialist in indemnity insurance in the financial industry.
'It would be like giving someone a licence to print money.
Blanket bonds, typical in the banking industry, insure corporate managers
and directors against the dishonest actions of their own employees. But a
group of pension fund trustees, for instance, could not insure itself
against fraud. Brown said that pension fund beneficiaries can - and do  -
obtain insurance of that type. However, the ceiling on reimbursable losses
is roughly Pounds 20m - too little to comfort the Maxwell fund pensioners.
Ellison is urging a policy that does not yet exist. He suggests that pension
fund managers should be required to obtain insurance equal to the amount
under management. Insurance companies would then price their policies after
assessing the internal controls of the fund manager or trustee rather than
their competence in earning a high return on investment.
Well managed firms would pay low premiums, while those that were sloppy
would pay more. Given the low historical incidence of misconduct among
pension fund managers or trustees - the Maxwell funds are the first scandal
within memory - premiums should be affordable even though insurers would be
asked to cover billions of pounds of liabilities.
To pension fund managers, a market approach to regulation has some appeal.
'It's a very interesting concept,' said Clive Gilchrist, of Aberdeen Trust
and chairman of the NAPF's investment committee. 'If everybody had to obtain
it, given the history of low risk, I'm sure it would be available.'
The catch, Gilchrist says, is that the insurers would have to set premiums
reflecting the risk of each individual fund manager. 'Otherwise you get a
savings and loan situation,' he said. In the US savings and loan industry,
risky institutions paid the same insurance premiums as healthy ones, leaving
no incentive to invest assets safely.
But the insurance industry is chary of taking on the task of evaluating
either the probity or the efficiency of the fund management industry.
'Insurers tend to be very bad regulators,' Brown said.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten predicts move to extend
share ownership - Tory election strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRAILER for a Conservative election manifesto offering new incentives for
share and home ownership, a further shake-up of the education system and
more responsive public services was offered last night by Mr Chris Patten.
Delivering the annual Disraeli lecture at the St Stephens' Club in London,
the party chairman said that the first priority of a re-elected Conservative
government would be to establish Britain as a 'low inflation country'.
In a lengthy discourse designed to set out the choice facing the electorate
in the election due by July, Mr Patten underlined that the Conservatives
would put taxation at the heart of its campaign.
He foreshadowed also an imminent Conservative onslaught on Labour's plans to
repeal some of the government's trades union legislation, arguing that the
opposition was at the mercy of union 'muscle'.
Reinforcing speculation of a tax-cutting Budget in March, Mr Patten said the
Tory commitment to lower taxes and Labour plans to increase them would be
'the fault line which will run through the political debate both in the
election campaign and well beyond it'.
Disclaiming any intention to pre-empt the manifesto he is now drafting, Mr
Patten gave clear hints of the themes and priorities agreed in meetings
between Mr Major and cabinet colleagues last week.
The commitment to lower taxation underpinned the principle that freedom and
choice were 'best served if families are allowed to spend their own money as
much as possible'. Personal choice, freedom, ownership and responsibility
will be the key manifesto themes.
Mr Patten sought to emphasise that this was compatible with further
improvements in the quality of public services, hinting that the party will
seek to relaunch its Citizen's Charter as a vehicle to 'revolutionise'
attitudes in those services.
The clearest manifesto hints were to be found when Mr Patten turned his
attention to areas such as housing.
He indicated that the government was determined to press ahead with its
plans to promote the sale of local authority properties - particularly in
large estates - in spite of the present slump in the housing market.
He indicated also that new incentives would be offered to encourage savings
and share ownership and that the Conservative party would accelerate sharply
its plans to break the influence over schools of local education
authorities.

EMPLOYMENT: More companies were urged to encourage employee participation in
management on a voluntary basis by Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary,
yesterday.
He reaffirmed the government's determination to resist the imposition of a
'statutory straitjacket' by the European Community and welcomed the part
being played by the CBI in 'encouraging others to follow the lead set by the
best in industry'.
*****
SCOTLAND: Most Scots would prefer all-out independence to the present way
their country is governed, an opinion poll indicated last night.
Given a straight choice between independence and the status quo, 48 per cent
would opt for independence and 40 per cent for no change, said the System
Three poll published in today's Glasgow Herald.
The poll, held before the announcement of the closure of the Ravenscraig
steelworks, was conducted among 962 adults in 40 constituencies.
*****
CONSUMER AFFAIRS: Proposals for legislation requiring electric plugs to be
fitted to domestic appliances before they are supplied to the consumer is
being considered by the government, Mr Edward Leigh, trade and industry
minister said last night.
*****
MPs' QUESTIONS: The cost limit at which ministers may refuse to answer MPs'
written questions was raised yesterday from Pounds 250 to Pounds 400,
Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Maples announced in a Commons
written reply.
The figure is eight times the average marginal cost of answering each of the
hundreds of such inquiries tabled every year, and was last increased in
1988.
*****
LOTTERY: The prime minister yesterday side-stepped a call to support a
private member's bill demanding a national lottery.
Although he was reticent when challenged at Commons question time by the
measure's sponsor, Mr Ivan Lawrence (C Burton), Mr Major's colleagues
believe he is sympathetic to the idea. The bill is due for debate on Friday.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Document mystery unravels -
Intercity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MYSTERY of the 'bogus' British Rail document threatening cuts to
InterCity links after privatisation was partly cleared up yesterday as it
emerged that the document was neither bogus nor, officially, British Rail,
but something in between.
The document's contents, which figured prominently in the media last week,
suggested that a privatised InterCity would inevitably seek to improve
profits by trimming links with dozens of towns and cities in outlying areas.
That posed a potential embarrassment for Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport
secretary, whose favoured option for the break-up of BR is the sale of the
InterCity as a single entity.
Quizzed in the Commons on Monday about the document's implications, Mr
Rifkind ducked the question by denouncing its authenticity. It had become
clear that the document was not a BR document, but a bogus one, he said.
Yesterday BR's version of events was that the document had been seen by Sir
Bob but it bore no identifying marks and its origins were unknown.
The implication is that the document, although not produced officially by
BR, was written by a senior BR employee with the intention of leaking it and
creating exactly the effect it produced.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott explains plans for funding
 -Labour rail policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT, shadow transport secretary, set out yesterday how his
party would increase British Rail funding with private investment,
self-financing schemes, funds switched from road building - and possibly
from extra taxpayers' money.
A letter to Sir Bob Reid, chairman of the BR board, said Labour would expect
BR to have more board members 'committed to running a public service' and
warned that the positions of all board members would be reviewed if Labour
came to power.
At a press conference Mr Prescott indicated that if he became transport
secretary he would push for extra resources from the Treasury.
'We recognise that more money may have to come from the taxpayer,' he said,
although later he made clear that any increase would depend on economic
growth.
Much of the cost of his proposals would come from other sources. For
instance, Pounds 150m of replacement rolling stock for Network SouthEast
could be leased from a private-sector lender. Old trains would be converted
for leaf clearing and de-icing in severe weather.
The government's roads programme would be reviewed, almost certainly meaning
the cancellation of some bypass and motorway programmes.
Labour would end the 4.75 per cent target set by the government for the
return on assets of InterCity services, Mr Prescott said. The target Network
SouthEast has been set of operating without subsidy after April 1992 would
also be dropped.
Mr Prescott said that the government's Public Service Obligation grants to
British Rail have been cut by a total of more than Pounds 3bn in real terms
since 1983. Labour would stop preparation for privatisation and ensure that
InterCity routes threated by the government's plans would be preserved.
In his letter to Sir Bob, he said the lower public subsidy and the
investment needed for projects such as the Channel tunnel rail link meant
'an entirely new financial framework' would be needed, allowing BR access to
private-sector finance. BR said it would respond as appropriate when it
received Mr Prescott's letter.

pensions body - Social Security committee
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES should be given equal representation on pension fund boards of
trustees in order to prevent the repetition of a 'Maxwell-like scandal', the
National Association of Pension funds said yesterday.
In testimony to the Commons social security committee, Mr Brian McMahon,
NAPF chairman, said employers and employees should have equal representation
with independent trustees appointed in appropriate situations.
'Care should be taken to avoid domination by any one party,' the NAPF said.
The NAPF is the leading industry group on pensions in the UK and its members
run pension schemes with more than Pounds 250bn in assets.
The committee, which on Monday sought to question Mr Kevin and Mr Ian
Maxwell about the Maxwell company pension funds, is considering proposing
reforms to UK pensions law.
The NAPF also urged that assets of pension funds should be held by a
custodian trustee independent of the employing company. It added that where
investment management is carried out internally, as it was for much of the
Mirror Group Pension fund, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation
(Imro) set tougher rules. Mr McMahon said the disappearance of Maxwell
pension funds assets reflects weaknesses in the regulation of fund managers
rather than of pension funds.
'The supervision of an investment manager entrusted with the Mirror Group
pension funds was inadequate,' Mr McMahon said. 'We should like to see the
Financial Services Act amended to five protection to members of pension
schemes.'
The NAPF also urged that the 5 per cent limit on self-investment be applied
to all types of investments, and said that a two to five-year period would
be sufficient to wind down portfolios that currently exceed that limit.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM fails to defuse BR privatisation
row - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR failed yesterday to resolve the potentially damaging cabinet
clash over privatisation of British Rail which threatens to delay yet again
the publication of government plans for the sale.
After a lengthy meeting in Downing Street chaired by the prime minister,
officials said ministers were 'a long way off' deciding between the three
options that Whitehall departments are promoting.
The row, if not resolved quickly, might embarrass Mr Major deeply in the
approach to the general election, when British Rail privatisation is set to
be a central part of the Conservative manifesto.
Publication of a white paper setting out details of how BR is will be sold
has already been delayed twice. The Citizen's Charter promised a white paper
by the end of last year. Ministers then promised publication for this week.
Downing Street said only that a white paper would be published before the
general election - in spite of Department of Transport promises of
publication in February at the latest.
The Department of Transport has now changed its stance again, saying the top
priority of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, was to get the right
solution, not a rushed one. 'We can't rule in or out any timings at this
stage,' officials said.
Mr Rifkind is understood to be putting up a determined fight to defend his
department's proposals, but he appears to be losing ground to a rival scheme
proposed by the prime minister's policy unit.
The Department of Transport wants to sell off BR's profitable InterCity and
freight services but keep regional rail networks in the public sector,
although they could eventually transfer to private operators.
However, under the scheme prefered by Mr Major, BR would be split into
regional companies similar to the set up before the Second World War - the
so-called 'golden age' scenario.
Meanwhile, Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, has proposed a
scheme for privatisation which he believes would promoted maximum
competition. British Rail's track would be sold to a private operator with
private-sector companies competing to provide services.
Downing Street was sceptical of a compromise, pointing out that the schemes
were not easily compatible.
Mr Major told MPs yesterday that the government's aim was to ensure
passengers got better services.
The Department of Trade and Industry argues that the government should learn
from the experience of past privatisations and not simply create private
sector monopolies.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INITIATIVES to strengthen the peace-keeping mission of the United Nations
are to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister, while Britain holds
the chairmanship of the Security Council.
He told the Commons yesterday that President Bush of the US, President
Mitterrand of France and President Yeltsin of Russia would be among the
heads of state and heads of government attending the Security Council
meeting in New York later this month.
Mr Major also underlined the support for Britain's aim of improving the
procedures for securing compliance with the nuclear arms non-proliferation
treaty.
Condemning Labour suggestions that the timing of the meeting had been
influenced by electoral considerations, Mr Peter Thurnham (C Bolton
North-east) insisted that the current 'international instability' justified
the prime minister's action.
He said an earlier comment by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign
secretary, that Mr Major was 'grubbing around for a photo opportunity' was
insulting.
Mr Robin Squire (C Hornchurch) said the prospect of a dictatorship or
irresponsible country acquiring any of the 27,000 nuclear weapons previously
controlled by the Soviet Union was 'terrifying'.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: King launches offensive against
Labour - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOM KING insisted yesterday that a fourth Trident submarine was essential
to a credible British nuclear deterrent as the government continued its
attempts to focus pre-election political exchanges on issues of its
choosing.
In a Commons debate designed to highlight Labour's perceived weakness on
nuclear defence matters, the defence secretary also asserted that a
sub-strategic nuclear capability was similarly indispensable.
In spite of repeated Opposition prompting, he stopped short of announcing
that a firm order for the fourth Trident had been placed, however, stating
only that tenders were being evaluated and it was the government's intention
to proceed.
Authorisation to go ahead with certain long lead-time items had already been
granted, he said. In a recent written answer, the government disclosed that
approximately Pounds 142m had been spent on the fourth submarine to date.
The government motion advocating that Britain retain a credible nuclear
deterrent was carried by 320 votes to 49.
Mr King claimed that Labour was 'split from top to bottom' on defence. Why
did it publish policy papers on 'every subject under the sun' except nuclear
defence, he asked.
Citing the views of a former editor of Marxism Today magazine that Labour
had 'virtually abstained' from the post-cold war debate, Mr King claimed
that 16 of the 22 shadow cabinet members had 'an anti-nuclear background'.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, responded by calling for
Britain to take a lead in arranging a meeting of the eight nuclear powers to
begin the next phase of the Start process.
The elimination of 'all eight stockpiles' was 'the obvious and sensible
goal' of such talks, although it was too early to say when that goal might
be attainable.
Mr Kaufman attacked the government for brandishing its nuclear weapons 'like
some kind of macho symbol'.
He argued that post-war Labour administrations had been 'as diligent in
providing for this country's defence as any other government.
'Whenever the Tories know they are facing electoral defeat, they dive head
first into the political sewer,' he said.
Divisions within Opposition ranks were underlined, however, both by the
presence of two Labour-drafted amendments on the order paper and by a
statement from Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield) that he would not support the
official Labour amendment.
Summing up for Labour, Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow defence secretary, accused
the government of being more interested in 'trying to foment an artificial
debate about security matters' than addressing current domestic economic
problems.
For the government, Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, highlighted a
promise made by Mr Kaufman to provide the Trident shipyard in Barrow with
work equivalent to any defence cuts, branding it 'yet another undisclosed
pledge' that was being brought to the electorate's attention.
This elicited an intervention from Mr Kaufman who said that the promise
dated from May 1989.
Earlier, Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs
select committee, said there could 'never be a worse time than now' to
contemplate defence cuts.
He added that the government would now have to consider beginning a spending
programme on effective anti-missile systems.

FT  15 JAN 92 / British Steel to raise many prices in April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL plans to increase prices in April for some of its main
products, in its most determined attempt yet to halt the fall in steel
prices that has affected its profits over the past two years.
The company said yesterday that it would be raising prices by between 3 per
cent and 4 per cent for its main strip-mill products, which are mainly
produced at its south Wales plants at Llanwern and Port Talbot.
The move to raise basic prices for those products follows its decision to
withdraw price discounts of about 5 per cent from the turn of the year.
The increases are an attempt by British Steel to put a floor under steel
prices in advance of expected sharp increases in costs, particularly raw
materials, in the rest of the year.
The company expects that by the end of the year its costs will be 15 per
cent higher than they were in 1989, while selling prices have fallen
sharply.
The price of hot-rolled coil, the most basic strip-mill product, has fallen
by 28 per cent to about Pounds 170 a tonne since 1989, while the price of a
tonne of hot-dip galvanised steel has fallen by 32.5 per cent to Pounds 260
a tonne.
The severe cost-price squeeze was one of the factors behind the company's
announcement last week that it will close the last two blast furnaces at its
Ravenscraig plant in Scotland by September. British Steel yesterday won the
European Commission's approval to acquire two small German steel
stockholders, August Degels Eisengrosshaendel and Spaltbank, which will give
British Steel about 10 per cent of the German coated-steel stockholding
market.

FT  15 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Seelig cites share move by Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE apparently unannounced purchases by SG Warburg, the main adviser to the
government in the BT flotation, of Pounds 115m of BT shares was raised when
the Guinness trial resumed at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.
Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director at the merchant bank
Morgan Grenfell, produced an article from The Times in which the Warburg
dealing was described as 'effectively a legalised share support scheme'.
Mr Seelig put the article to Mr Graham Walsh, former Morgan Grenfell head of
corporate finance. Mr Walsh said he had read about the matter and his
reaction had been 'bewilderment that it should be possible to do that'.
He said he found it hard to see 'how it squares with the sort of
circumstances we are discussing here'.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance director at the Henry
Ansbacher merchant bank, deny fraud and false-accounting charges arising
from an allegedly unlawful share support operation mounted by Guinness
during its 1986 takeover battle for Distillers.
Part of the case concerns the non-disclosure of purchases made to support
Guinness's share price.
Mr Seelig said it appeared that Warburg had spent Pounds 115m on supporting
the BT share price in the market.
'Here is the government using an adviser to stabilise the share price in the
market and not feeling obligated to make any announcement of such dealings,
even though they constitute 15 per cent of the trading in that stock for the
entire month,' Mr Seelig said.
Suggesting that Mr Walsh, a former director-general of the Takeover Panel,
had unparalleled experience of City regulation, he asked if, assuming the
article was correct, Mr Walsh believed Warburg or the government should have
been giving details of the dealings on a daily basis.
Mr Walsh said that as he did not know the full facts he could not comment.
He assumed that the government or its advisers would have had legal advice
that there was nothing wrong or in breach of the law.
Mr Seelig asked if any authority had accused Warburg of creating a false
market.
No, said Mr Walsh.
Had anyone suggested that the failure to announce such dealings was a breach
of the Financial Services Act? Mr Seelig asked.
Mr Walsh said that all he had seen was comment that the dealings had not
been disclosed.
The trial continues today.

MRS FRANCES HEATON, the first woman to be appointed director-general of the
Takeover Panel, said yesterday she intended to give more weight to the views
of industrial and commercial companies.
Mrs Heaton, a corporate finance director of investment bankers Lazard
Brothers, will take over as director-general on March 11.
She said one of her main objectives was to ensure that all interested groups
were involved in the formulation of views on takeover policy. That would
involve 'not just the practitioners, who are the intermediaries, but also
their clients'. She added: 'There has been quite a heavy weighting on the
City side of the panel in the past.'
The panel had already moved to represent industry's views better by
providing for the appointment of three senior industry figures to advise it,
she said.
Mrs Heaton, 47, who joined Lazards in 1980 after a 10-year career at the
Treasury, has advised on privatisations while with the bank. She has also
advised property groups including London and Edinburgh Trust and the group
seeking to develop London's County Hall. Her experience of contested
takeovers includes Hanson's bid for London Brick and TSB's for Hogg
Robinson.

BRITAIN'S first baby hotel opened in London yesterday promising its guests
'a complete haven' away from the lifestyles of their busy parents.
Pippa Pop-ins, based in a customised four-storey Georgian house, caters for
children aged from two to 12 years old whose parents want a break from their
offspring for up to three days.
Cuisine tends more towards home cooking than cordon bleu and all but the
shyest guests will share bedrooms.
At Pounds 25 per weekday night per child and Pounds 30 a night during the
weekend, the overnight nursery is at the cheaper end of the London
accommodation market but the steeper end of the babysitting market.
Managing director Ms Pippa Deakin and her father, Tim, put up Pounds 20,000
themselves and have a Pounds 120,000 bank loan.
The Fulham Road premises are rented by the company and refurbishment cost
substantially more than Pounds 50,000.
Legal safety and security requirements have pushed up costs.
The directors do not expect to see a return on their money for five years,
assuming the nursery works at full capacity (21 children at the day nursery
and 12 overnight).
Ms Deakin, 26, has spent the last 10 years working with children. She took
business advice from Mr Nick Wilcockson, a Salomon Brothers stockbroker, who
is the company's financial director.
Limited publicity in June brought the nursery over 300 inquiries from
parents. Most tend to be professionals and some are single parents.
Diplomats and tourists have also expressed interest.
If the business is successful, the directors say they may consider
franchising their product. They say they have already had inquiries from
Switzerland, Italy and the US.

FT  15 JAN 92 / NHS chief praises success of reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Health Service has delivered significant benefits for patients
since the government introduced its reforms, Mr Duncan Nichol, the NHS chief
executive, said yesterday.
In a report to NHS staff covering the first six months of the reforms, he
said that an extra 250,000 patients would be treated in 1991-92, an increase
of 3.7 per cent on the previous year.
There had also been 'significant inroads' in reducing the time patients wait
for treatment. The number waiting more than a year fell by 19 per cent
between March and November 1991. Numbers waiting more than two years had
fallen by 35 per cent.
In addition, record levels of child immunisation had been achieved: about
nine out of 10 children had been immunised against diphtheria, tetanus,
polio, whooping cough and measles.
Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, claimed that the report
'confounded the sceptics who said that the reforms would never work'.
He said that the NHS was 'on track' for implementing the pledge in the
Citizen's Charter that by April 1992 no patient would have to wait more than
two years for treatment.
Mr Waldegrave released details of a survey carried out in eight of the new
self-governing trust hospitals showing that almost half the 900 patients who
had visited their hospital before and after it became a trust thought that
the service had improved.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour health spokesman, said that the increase in patients
treated was much the same as that recorded in previous years.

FT  15 JAN 92 / BAA receives Pounds 4.75m bid for Prestwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 4.75m bid has been made for Prestwick airport in Ayrshire. If it is
accepted it will be the first time that BAA, the UK airports operator, will
have agreed to the sale of one of its international airports.
The bid has been made by AAP, a company controlled by Mr Peter Kay, a
Scottish-based businessman. AAP said it began talking to BAA a year ago and
was making the bid now because 'the passage of time is to the detriment of
Prestwick airport'.
It said BAA had offered to lease the airport to AAP in July 1991 and an
outright sale was discussed in August.
AAP's bid surprised a rival consortium, the Ayrshire Community Airports
Project (Acap), which is chaired by Mr George Younger, chairman of Royal
Bank of Scotland and Conservative MP for Ayr.
Mr Bill Miller, an Ayrshire businessman involved in Acap, said that the
company was talking to BAA and British Aerospace, which has a manufacturing
plant and flying school at the airport. 'Things are at a very sensitive
stage,' he said.
BAA made clear last spring that it would consider bids for Prestwick. In
March 1990, the government removed Prestwick's monopoly on transatlantic
flights from Scotland, and airlines immediately transferred operations to
Glasgow.
Prestwick's turnover in the year to March 1991, fell to Pounds 4.8m from
Pounds 9.3m the previous year. No regular passenger flights are using the
airport this winter, although charter flights operated there last summer.
BAe's commercial aircraft division makes Jetstream aircraft at Prestwick.
The company said last month that it was also engaged in talks with BAA about
buying the airport. It said the existence of the runway at Prestwick was
vital to BAe. BAA gave assurances in 1990 that, if there was a change of
owner at Prestwick, it would ensure that any purchaser kept the runway open.
BAA said that it had failed to reach agreement with AAP last August because
AAP could not meet guarantees.
A record 10.8m passengers used Manchester airport last year in spite of the
recession and the effects of the Gulf war.
International traffic fell 2 per cent to 3m passengers and the recession
caused a fall of 10 per cent in domestic passengers to 2m. Chartered
business offset those falls with a 6 per cent rise to 5.8m.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD IS to increase its car and van prices by an average of 3.7 per cent
from the week after next, John Griffiths writes.
The move by Ford, the market leader, is expected to prompt what has become a
traditional new-year round of increases by manufacturers and importers.
Ford said the increases reflected improved vehicle specifications as well as
higher costs. The company appears not to have been daunted by the expected
publication of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on car pricing.
The MMC has been investigating whether cars are overpriced in the UK
compared with Continental markets and whether the system of exclusively
franchised dealers works against consumers' interests.
In recent years the vehicle industry has been criticised for increasing list
prices by more than the rate of inflation.

FT  15 JAN 92 / BT will press for faster increases in rental charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT WILL press for faster increases in line rental charges and a slower rate
of cuts to average charges during the review of prices due to begin at the
end of this month.
Executives of the telecommunications group argued yesterday that the review
by Oftel, the industry regulator, should not demand an immediate one-off cut
in prices. They rejected suggestions that BT's level of profitability was
excessive.
The two executives - Mr Andy Green, director of public communications
products, and Mr John Basgallop, head of UK regulation - also disclosed
plans to introduce a series of optional pricing packages that would appeal
to different types of residential customer. The scheme would allow users to
pay lower call charges in exchange for higher rental charges.
The executives said the review was taking place at a time of 'tremendous
uncertainty', particularly because new competitors were emerging, after a
change in government policy last year.
They said the forthcoming general election and the fact that the term of
office of Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, comes to an end in
June, added to the uncertainty. Even so, they argued that Labour and
Conservative approaches to telecommunications were unlikely to be 'miles
apart'.
BT would like the restriction on rises in residential line rental charges to
be relaxed. At present it is not allowed to increase them by more than 2 per
cent a year above inflation. Mr Green described an alternative proposal,
floated by Oftel, that the average residential bill should not increase by
more than the rate of inflation, as a 'perfectly acceptable way ahead'.
Mr Green also argued that its main price control formula - which requires
that a basket of prices be cut by an annual 6.25 per cent, after allowing
for inflation - should be relaxed. That was because the formula included a
one-off element to bring international prices down, he said.
The executives argued that a price formula should be set that would lead to
BT earning reasonable profits, if it made reasonable progress to improve
efficiency, so giving it an incentive to 'over-achieve'. The sale of part of
the government's residual shareholding in British Telecom will raise Pounds
5.43bn, including Pounds 1.84bn in this financial year, the Treasury said
yesterday. A total of 1.6bn shares have been sold, including the
international tender offer.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Priority for pampered pets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH consumers spend, on average, 15 times as much as Greeks on pet food
 -but less on buying food for themselves and their families than citizens of
any European Community country except Portugal.
The British also take more holidays than any other European nation and read
more daily newspapers than any of their Continental neighbours.
Those snapshots emerge from a survey of spending patterns by Woolwich
Building Society, which claims that in spite of the recession Britons are
better off than consumers in many other parts of the EC.
Judging by the Pounds 343 a year they each spend on alcohol, second only to
the Danes, the British might appear to be a nation of dipsomaniacs. The
figure mainly reflects high prices, however. UK consumption of wine and
spirits is low by European standards and beer consumption only average.
Children seem not to be over-indulged in Britain. Annual spending on toys
and games, at Pounds 18 a head, is below the Pounds 33 in France and less
even than the Pounds 22 the average Briton spends on pet food.
Mrs Thatcher's vision of Britain as a nation of homeowners takes something
of a knock. Although 65 per cent of Britons are owner-occupiers, the
proportion is higher in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Customs officers arrest 23 in raids on alleged 'squat' shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise officers have arrested 23 people alleged to have been
running a ring of illegal shops in towns around the UK in a crackdown on
evasion of value added tax thought to be worth Pounds 2m.
Mr Brian McCaffrey and Mr Collin Miller, directors of a company called
Prizebuys, were charged last night with fraudulent evasion of VAT. Eight
other people were released on police bail and 13 were released after giving
statements.
The arrests follow raids under the code name Operation Volume by 100
officers on 20 addresses in 14 towns and cities in England and Scotland over
the past two days.
A man believed to have run the network from a warehouse in Battersea, south
London, is among those arrested. The shops sold mainly clothing.
'Squat' shops have only recently come to the attention of customs
investigators as a way of evading all forms of regulation. Operators break
into vacant premises, set up stalls and refuse to move.
Retailers that have premises occupied by squatters can often face lengthy
battles to remove them because of the rate at which cases are dealt with by
the civil courts.
They can also face substantial additional costs in legal fees, lost business
and repair work.
Gap, the US clothing group, last year had difficulty removing squatters from
a site it bought in High Street, Kensington. The squatters occupied the shop
within an hour of the previous tenants' vacating it and refused to leave.
Established retailers have long complained about 'squat' shops, arguing that
they often sell sub-standard goods and offer no redress for dissatisfied
shoppers.
Mr James May, director of the Retail Consortium which represents many UK
retailers, welcomed the crackdown. 'It is a widespread problem and one that
has grown substantially over the last few years,' he said.
The 'squat' shop raids this week follow several months of planning and
detailed observations of the shops by about six Customs investigators based
in London after tip-offs from legitimate retailers.
The two men charged are expected to appear at South-Western Magistrates
Court, Balham, London, today.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS are often guilty of 'humbug and hypocrisy' over single-union deals,
according to Mr Alex Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of
Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, David Goodhart writes.
He said some of the most aggressive critics of single-union deals were those
which had lost out in 'beauty contests' for single-union deals. 'If you
don't agree with the system, you should not participate', he said.
Mr Ferry said at a conference of the Involvement and Participation
Association, that unions must accept single-union deals or no recognition at
all.
At the same conference, Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said
that there would be no repeal of existing trade union legislation under a
Labour government.
'Like companies, unions will be subject to proper legal regulation,' he
said. 'Like companies, they will be entitled to fairness within the law, not
favours outside it. But there can be no group of people outside of the
cabinet that truly believe that the future of Britain in the 1990s will
seriously be decided by re-running the debates of the 1970s.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / New CSO head likely to set sights on selling data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MARKETING drive aimed at making economic data more useful to the
commercial world may emerge after Mr Bill McLennan takes over as director of
the Central Statistical Office in March.
In recent years the CSO has been criticised for providing inaccurate data
which have had to be extensively revised, particularly in areas such as
trade figures and overall economic growth.
Mr McLennan said the press had given the office a 'rough deal' which had not
been fully deserved. 'Part of my job is to try to find out how that bad
impression has come about, and to try to do something about it.'
Mr McLennan, whose appointment was confirmed yesterday, is deputy head of
the Australian Bureau of Statistics, where he has forged links with
customers in industry. He hinted that he might introduce similar links at
the CSO, which answers to Treasury ministers and is the UK's main agency for
economic statistics.
While the Australian agency raises 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its
ADollars 150m (Pounds 62m) annual budget through sales to industry, the CSO
gains less than 2 per cent of its Pounds 32m budget in that way, with the
rest coming from the taxpayer.
Mr McLennan said: 'Once you start charging (for data), users expect you to
perform, and that in turn gives very strong feedback about what the users
need. I am very comfortable with marketing and putting a price on things.'
The agency says it has made important strides in increasing the quality of
its information in the past year, thanks to improved surveys and staff
increases.
At present, the main thrust of the CSO's work is to provide data about the
economy for the use of the Treasury, and relatively little effort has been
made to put statistics into an ideal form for industry.
As part of his new post, Mr McLennan, aged 49, also becomes head of the UK
Government Statistical Service - which includes professional responsibility
for all statistical services in other government departments outside the
CSO. He will be paid Pounds 79,000 a year and will be given an allowance to
help to find a home in London and to travel regularly to Australia, where he
has two children at university.
Mr McLennan is succeeding Sir Jack Hibbert as CSO chief. The office has
about 1,100 staff, located in London, Watford, and Newport, Gwent. The
workforce is to increase to about 1,280 in the next 14 months.
Mr McLennan has been deputy head at the ABS since 1986 and has a high
reputation in the international statistics community.
Ms Barbara Bailar, director of the Washington-based American Statistical
Association, was asked whether Mr McLennan would be able to transfer his
skills to Britain. 'Going to the CSO from the outside will be a big
challenge,' she replied. 'But if anyone can do it, it's Bill.'
Professor Denise Lievesley, head of the Economic and Social Research
Council's data archive unit at Essex University, said Mr McLennan was a
wonderful manager who was good at recruiting and retaining high-quality
staff.
A person involved in the selection process said: 'He came across as a good,
broad-brush administrator who knows what he wants and is good at putting
ideas into practice.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Midlands capital spending expected to be maintained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVEL of capital expenditure among companies in the west Midlands is
likely to stabilise in the next six months after falling since 1990,
according to a survey of business opinion in the region published today.
There is no indication of a surge in investment spending in the region,
which is seen as a barometer of UK manufacturing. Rather, the survey's
analysts conclude that companies are no longer cutting expenditure plans
'but are maintaining them at current levels'.
The survey was conducted by Wolverhampton Business School, Warwick Business
School and Price Waterhouse, the consultants, at the end of last year. It
covered more than 1,200 companies in the counties of West Midlands, Hereford
and Worcester, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire.
The predictions about investment come against the background of general
business stagnation. They show 22 per cent of companies questioned expecting
to raise spending, 46 per cent expecting to maintain spending at the same
level and 32 per cent expecting to spend less.
Price Waterhouse and the business schools said responses to the survey
suggested: 'The second half of 1991 has proven to be very little worse than
the first half of the year.' That tallied with other business surveys in the
region. 'We can say that the economy has hit the bottom.'
There were few expectations that conditions were likely to improve markedly.
'Overall, the survey leads us to conclude that the first six months of 1992
will show at best faltering recovery compared with the last six months of
1991.'
Government forecasts of 2.25 per cent growth in gross domestic product were
too high, short of 'an unexpected boom' in the second half.
The expressed intentions on capital expenditure were used by the survey
analysts as a sign of a change for the better in the economy, although they
had to be treated cautiously. Previous surveys have shown that companies
have consistently tended to underestimate the severity of the recession.
Falling investment spending since 1990 has led to fears that the regional
engineering industry is likely to lose its competitive edge in international
markets and that the recession, far from being just another cyclical twist
in the economy, may lead to further erosion of the manufacturing base.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Workers win claim on personal
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE engineering workers who were denied pay rises of between Pounds 20 and
Pounds 30 a week after refusing to sign personal contracts with Associated
British Ports have won a discrimination claim against their employer.
RMT, the transport union which represents the three dockers, is to press for
the gap in earnings to be closed. It is to consider whether its members at
other ABP ports should mount similar challenges.
Although the decision of the Southampton tribunal does not set a precedent,
it is likely to influence employers considering taking action similar to
ABP's. The company said it was appealing.
Last year a London tribunal made a similar ruling against Associated
Newspapers in a case brought by a member of the National Union of
Journalists at the Daily Mail who refused to sign a personal contract.
The Southampton tribunal found that ABP had taken action short of dismissal
contrary to section 23 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act
1978. It has yet to publish reasons for its decision.
The case was brought after ABP offered its 170 dockers a pay rise in return
for agreeing to individual contracts and more flexible working.
Employees signing individual contracts relinquished all rights to union
negotiation and representation. The three said they were prepared to work
more flexibly but were not prepared to relinquish collective bargaining
arrangements.
Individuals agreeing to personal contracts received pay increases of 20 per
cent. The three who rejected contracts were offered an 8.9 per cent rise
through collective bargaining.
As a result, the salary of the most senior of the three rose to Pounds
12,115, instead of the Pounds 13,650 he would have received on a personal
contract. His overtime rate was also lower.

FT  15 JAN 92 / BSA chief denies mortage lenders and housing associations
'at loggerheads'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mark Boleat, Building Societies Association director-general, denied
yesterday that mortgage lenders and housing associations were 'at
loggerheads' over schemes to ease the repossessions crisis. He told an
Institute of Economic Affairs conference: 'What is happening is negotiation.
It will take some weeks. But there is no question of the initiative
faltering.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Hopes for housing rescue rent asunder: Why the government
emergency plan has made little progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY homeowners with mortgage arrears saw the government's mortgage-rescue
scheme as a welcome Christmas present.
Yet, almost a month after the scheme was announced, there has been little
progress in implementing it. Most lenders seem to have done little to ease
up on repossessions. Lenders and housing associations have yet to agree
terms for the mortgage-to-rent schemes at the centre of the plan.
High-level negotiations on how to structure mortgage-to-rent schemes are
under way between the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), the National
Federation of Housing Associations (NFHA) and the Housing Corporation, which
regulates associations receiving public money.
But Mr Stuart Bernau, general manager at Nationwide Building Society, told a
meeting of housing association executives on Monday that the number of
detailed negotiations between individual lenders and associations was 'very
small indeed'.
Mr Stephen Duckworth, head of housing finance at the NFHA, told the meeting
that there were many difficulties to be resolved if mortgage-to-rent schemes
were to be agreed. They include:
The interest rates that lenders will charge associations on loans to buy
repossessed homes. The basis of valuations of such homes. Mortgage arrears.
The associations want lenders to write off some or all of existing arrears
to make it easier for their new tenants to meet rental payments.
Costs incurred on legal advice, surveys and valuations, administration and
chasing bad debts should be paid by lenders, the associations say.
The lenders see associations piling up demands that are tantamount to a
'scroungers' charter'. Mr Bernau told Monday's meeting there would be no
incentive for owners to keep up mortgage payments if default meant lower
monthly outgoings in rent, their debts written off and their property
upgraded.
The associations' demands are opening bids in negotiations that have much
further to go before what one executive described as a 'chasm' between the
two sides is bridged. Some of the larger building societies, such as
Nationwide and Woolwich, say that negotiations over terms are well advanced
with individual associations.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, hopes to reach
agreement on a mortgage-to-rent scheme by the end of the month. 'It is
important to get a pilot scheme going to avoid a massive loss of credibility
for the whole exercise.'
Until workable mortgage-to-rent schemes are agreed, lenders will be
unwilling to change their repossession policies. As a result, help for
homeowners in arrears may be some time in coming.

FT  15 JAN 92 / British Gas to decide on inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of British Gas meets today to decide whether to submit to a
far-reaching investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The meeting comes after Ofgas, the industry regulator, expressed reluctance
to accept one condition the company asked for when it agreed to halve its
share of the industrial gas market by 1995.
British Gas has agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to cut its industrial
market share from 90 per cent to 40 per cent and hive off its transport
division into a separate company. In return, the company expects Ofgas to
review a tough new formula for domestic prices which was agreed last year
and is due to come into force in April.
British Gas wants the MMC to act as final arbitrator for that review if the
company fails to agree changes with the regulator. While Ofgas says it would
be illegal to use the MMC for such a function, British Gas says it would
not.
The difference of opinion hinges on an interpretation of the Gas Act, under
which British Gas was privatised in 1986. Ofgas yesterday stood firm on its
refusal to give British Gas further assurances over the tariff review. 'It's
a matter of principle as well as a legal matter,' it said.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Nedo chief warns on devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR UK official warned yesterday that a devaluation of sterling would
put Britain back in the European Community's 'third division' in terms of
inflation and would lead to a further rise in interest rates.
Mr Walter Eltis, director-general of the National Economic Development
Office, said that reducing sterling's value or trying to force down interest
rates would do nothing to alter the underlying challenge facing the UK
economy, which was to ensure that industry adopted Japanese-style best
practices in management.
He told a conference on the economy organised by the Institute of Economic
Affairs, the free-market think tank, that Britain needed another nine-year
period of expansion, like the one experienced in the 1980s, which would
allow further industrial restructuring.
The motor industry had been successfully restructured since the mid-1980s
with Japanese capital and working methods, and a new period of sustained
expansion could allow other sectors to follow that example.
It was more important to create the right conditions for such a sustained
expansion than to worry about the timing of the recovery, Mr Eltis said.
Other speakers at the conference were more concerned about the weakness of
the economy. Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist of Robert Fleming
Securities, became the first City economist to fore-cast zero growth this
year.
He urged the immediate floating of sterling and a cut of 2 percentage points
in interest rates to restore activity and stop job losses. Mr Warburton said
that uncertainty over the result of the general election was postponing
economic decisions. Moreover, the economy was in unknown territory because
of the unpredictability of the response of consumers and busines to the
accumulation of debt.
Mr Giles Keating, chief economist of Credit Suisse First Boston in London,
gave a warning that recovery might be hindered by weakness of the banking
sector, and urged a substantial cut in bank base rates this year.
Mr Keating said political uncertainty was adding to the linked difficulties
of the pound and high interest rates.
He added that Britain needed an election as soon as possible to overcome the
troubles of the economy and the banking sector.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Mediation urged to avoid 'overcrowded'
courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was urged yesterday to back the private resolution of
disputes as an alternative to the 'inefficient and overcrowded' public
courts system.
The Adam Smith Institute, a rightwing think tank, said private alternative
dispute resolution (ADR), through mediation or mini-trials conducted by
trained mediators or retired judges and lawyers, should be recommended by
the government.
The institute said the evidence against ADR from the US, where it had been
used for many years, was largely anecdotal and sensationalised.
Critics attempted to cast ADR in the worst possible light - referring to it
as 'Cadillac justice' apparently favouring those who could afford to pay for
it - or implied that it would create a two-tier system.
The institute said the arguments against ADR were easily outweighed by the
benefits of speedy, efficient and cost-effective solutions with the added
benefit of preserving the business relationship between parties to
commercial disputes.
It urged the government to avoid allegations of creating a system available
only to the rich by extending legal aid to cover individuals who wanted to
opt for ADR.
The institute said public courts should take steps to introduce ADR
procedures. 'An increase in the number of options available to disputants
who do seek to remain within the public courts could only add to the
credibility of the traditional system of dispute resolution.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / The woman to do business with: Bush's nominee for commerce
secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has good reason to be grateful to Mrs Barbara
Franklin. An activist Republican, she co-chaired a recent dinner in
Washington which raised Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 670m) for his 1992 re-election
campaign.
Mrs Franklin's work impressed Mr Robert Mosbacher, the commerce secretary -
no mean fund-raiser himself  - who is departing to head the president's
campaign. Her gender impressed White House operatives who were looking for
'political bounce' out of the appointment of Mr Mosbacher's successor.
Thus Mrs Franklin, at 51, finds herself commerce secretary nominee, poised
to take the helm of an unwieldy government bureaucracy of 13 agencies with
responsibilities ranging from weather prediction, aerospace, oceans, the
census, economic statistics, to tourism and trade.
It is a department seen as having lost influence in policy-making under Mr
Mosbacher. But it is also viewed by some, including Ambassador Linn
Williams, former deputy trade representative, as having a vital role in
helping US industry regain its competitiveness.
If confirmed, as expected, Mrs Franklin will be the third woman in the Bush
cabinet, along with Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mrs
Lynn Martin, the labour secretary.
The prominence of women in the Bush administration is a point of pride among
feminists who chose difficult careers in male-dominated arenas such as
business and politics. (It is also a counterweight among Republican
moderates who dislike the president's 'born-again' opposition to abortion.)
Mrs Franklin has broad experience in business and government, but there are
sceptics who belittle her qualifications. 'What has she ever done?' says one
long-time trade lobbyist. 'Why didn't they choose some chief executive who
knows how to role up his sleeves and save a company?'
The nominee launched her government career two decades ago. To a young
reporter covering the White House for the first time, she seemed 'glamorous,
peppy, vibrant'. But, says Ms Sonja Hillgren, now Washington editor of Farm
Journal, 'she was Miss Establishment.
'While everyone else was doing outrageous things, she was working for the
Nixon White House to recruit women for government jobs.'
She is still considered 'establishment' and still known for her stamina  -
and her commitment to high-impact aerobics. Her curriculum vitae runs for
pages. Married to another activist Republican - Mr Wallace Barnes, a wealthy
Connecticut businessman - Mrs Franklin (who retains her first married name)
could have served in almost any job in a Bush cabinet.
In the Nixon White House Mrs Franklin recruited dozens of women for top
government jobs. She also crossed paths there with Mrs Hills, who had joined
the Justice Department. 'I always liked her,' says Mrs Hills. 'She is an
articulate, well-organised, dedicated person.'
These qualities appeal to Mrs Hills, whose legalistic style tries to impose
orderliness on trade negotiations with action plans and deadlines. The
question of how the two will get along heading agencies renowned for their
turf fights occupies the minds of many.
'I don't believe we couldn't sit down and talk about issues,' says Mrs
Hills, who sees the two agencies as interactive. 'We are opening doors for
business; Commerce helps business drive through open doors.'
The Commerce Department used to push doors open under the late secretary
Malcolm Baldrige, launching negotiations for sectoral openings in Japan. Mr
Mosbacher all but abandoned that role in favour of trade promotion; provided
Mrs Franklin agrees to continue on that path, she and Mrs Hills are likely
to get on.
But she will be urged by her bureaucracy to represent business interests and
regain the policy-making role it has lost. She will have to decide whether
to pursue the debilitating turf battles, which even the veteran Mrs Hills
does not like.
She would have enough to do without them. Mr Williams, who has been close to
Mrs Hills, argues that Mrs Franklin would do better to focus the
department's 'intellectual energy' on developing its role as 'an organiser,
a think-tank, and a catalyst'.
The professional women who have known Mrs Franklin over the years have no
doubt she can handle the job. Ms Felice Schwartz, president of Catalyst, an
organisation which promotes women in business, says women who began their
careers 20 years ago and succeeded are astute and tough because they have
had to overcome so many more obstacles than have men.
Mrs Franklin, in a recent speech to a girls' club, described the slights and
prejudices she encountered. At Harvard Business School, where she graduated
in one of the first classes containing woman, she found her opinions
dismissed 'as if no one had heard a word I'd said'. On her first job she was
underpaid and criticised both for being 'too aggressive' and not assertive
enough.
It took her years to understand that her first husband 'would be proud of my
career as long as it didn't interfere with something he wanted me to do or
somewhere he wanted me to be'.
That Mrs Hills and Mrs Franklin will now hold the top business jobs in the
Bush administration is 'mind-blowingly exciting for women', says Ms
Schwartz. The 'gutsy, very responsible' Mrs Franklin will bring to the
administration the 'fresh perspective' of a feminist who did things 'the
right way' and made it to the top.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Canadian inflation 'at 2%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S inflation rate is expected to fall to 2.2 per cent this year from
5.6 per cent in 1991, the Conference Board of Canada said in its quarterly
forecast yesterday, writes Bernard Simon.
The board, a business information group, said it was scaling down its
earlier forecast of a 3.8 per cent inflation rate because of the
unexpectedly severe recession, especially in the retail sector.
A steep drop in inflation, to one of the lowest rates among industrial
countries, has prompted a surge of investment in Canadian securities over
the past six months.
The board expects a further marked decline in interest rates. The prime
rate, now at 8 per cent, is forecast to drop close to 7 per cent this
spring.
Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 3.2 per cent in 1992 and the
same next year, after shrinking by 1 per cent in 1991.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Brazil pension cash warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL will allow the social security system to run out of cash rather than
print money to finance higher pensions, Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank
president, warned yesterday.
Mr Gros said in London that if Congress did not vote money to finance a
court-ordered 147 per cent increase in pensions, or if the court order was
not reversed, 'the social security system is going to run out of money'.
Legislation was due before Congress yesterday to increase social security
contributions to raise the estimated Dollars 10bn cost of the pension
increase. The administration of President Fernando Collor had proposed an
increase of more than 50 per cent, but the Supreme Court ordered that
pensioners were entitled to receive a significantly bigger rise.
Mr Gros said the government remained hopeful that the court order would be
reversed at a further hearing, probably next month.
He sought to allay concerns that the rise in state pensions would jeopardise
a Dollars 2bn standby loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund,
which depends heavily on keeping the fiscal deficit in check. The IMF board
is scheduled on January 22 to discuss the loan, upon which hangs agreement
on important debt restructurings with the Paris Club of creditor governments
and with commercial banks.
The central bank president, accompanied by senior members of his team,
painted a picture of an administration now committed to fiscal and monetary
rectitude, but one which recognised that economic stability and low
inflation would not be achieved quickly.
The officials accompanying Mr Gros said they hoped that over a three-year
period Brazil's foreign debt could be reduced by Dollars 15bn through
debt-to-equity swaps in privatisations.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Argentina beats IMF targets
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has bettered stringent economic targets set by the International
Monetary Fund for the final quarter of last year, opening the way for fresh
loans from the IMF and other lenders this spring.
Officials reported yesterday the government had a Dollars 1.74bn (Pounds
970m) budget surplus in the final quarter of 1991, against a Fund target of
Dollars 1.43bn.
Earlier, independent economists had cast doubts on the government's ability
to meet the surplus without including windfalls from larger than expected
privatisation receipts or by delaying payments. In the previous quarter the
budget surplus was only Dollars 989m.
The budget operating surplus, which excludes privatisation receipts, rose by
206 per cent over the third quarter to Dollars 1.1bn. Privatisation revenues
of Dollars 635m were hardly changed.
However, the surplus was only attained by a one-off inflow from a tax
amnesty and by deferring Dollars 360m-Dollars 380m in public sector
Christmas bonuses to January.
The improved budget figures will strengthen the position of Argentine
officials now in the US negotiating with the IMF and commercial banks.
Argentina wants to convert the Dollars 1.04bn standby loan it obtained from
the IMF last July to a Dollars 3bn, three-year extended fund facility loan.
This would unlock other loans from the Inter-American Development Bank, the
World Bank and - officials hope  - from the Japanese government.
The loans would help finance a reduction in Argentina's Dollars 35bn foreign
bank debt under the aegis of the Brady debt reduction scheme. Argentine
officials are holding preliminary talks with bank executives in New York on
refinancing more than Dollars 8bn in interest arrears before discussing
reduction of the bank debt.
The budget figures are coming under intense scrutiny because they are a key
to economic stability.

FT  15 JAN 92 / US retailers suffer worst year in decades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy sagged at the end of last year, giving US retailers one of
their worst years in at least two decades, sales figures showed yesterday.
Retail sales fell 0.4 per cent last month, before allowing for inflation, a
bigger decline than financial markets had expected. Figures for November
were revised down sharply to show a fall of 0.5 per cent rather than a rise
of 0.3 per cent.
Further evidence of economic weakness was provided yesterday by a sharp drop
in US car sales to an annual rate of 5.3m in the first 10 days of January
compared with 7.1m at the end of December and 5.7m in the same period last
year.
Excluding cars, retail sales have fallen for five months running. Share
prices, however, rose on Wall Street as investors looked beyond current
economic troubles to an expected economic upturn in the second half of this
year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 60.6 points at a record
high of 3,246.2.
Yesterday's figures indicate retail sales fell at an annual rate of about 3
per cent in real terms in the fourth quarter, raising the prospect that
gross domestic product fell modestly after two quarters of weak growth
during the summer.
For 1991 as a whole, retail sales rose only 0.7 per cent in cash terms, well
below the underlying rate of inflation of about 3 per cent. Officials said
the retail figures were the worst for at least two decades.
Mr Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, the New York broker,
said the figures showed the consumer was 'dead in the water' in December.
The economy was likely to decline both in the fourth quarter of last year
and in the current quarter.
'The heat is still on the president to propose some kind of economic rescue
package in the State of the Union address later this month,' he said.
Mr Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, another New York broker,
said the economy's weakness indicated the Federal Reserve would have to ease
monetary policy again.
The poor retail sales figures follow a series of weak economic indicators.
On Friday, the Labour Department reported a rise in unemployment to 7.1 per
cent, the highest level in 5 years.
Previous releases showed a sharp fall in the Purchasing Managers' Index  - a
sign of renewed contraction in manufacturing, weak car sales, a drop in
consumer confidence and a sharp decline in the index of leading indicators.
Sentiment in financial markets, however, has been buoyed by the Fed's
unexpected 1 point cut in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent shortly before
Christmas.

A JUDGE appointed to investigate South Africa's political violence said
yesterday he would probe newspaper allegations that the defence force was

Judge Richard Goldstone, chairman of a commission of inquiry set up under
terms of a national peace accord last September, said in a statement that he
had been asked to investigate by Mr Roelf Meyer, the defence minister, and
the black opposition African National Congress.
The Weekly Mail reported 11 days ago that the defence force was funding
front organisations which instigated violence in townships.
It has accused the government of helping the Inkatha Freedom Party, locked
in a long-running feud with the ANC. About 4,800 blacks have been killed in
the last two years in township violence.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Right-wingers pose threat to Israeli coalition

EXTREME right-wing members of Israel's government yesterday stepped up
threats to quit Mr Yitzhak Shamir's coalition - a move likely to presage an
early general election - in protest against negotiations on Palestinian
self-government in the occupied territories.
Two parties, Tehiya and Moledet, have long said they would leave the
government, depriving Mr Shamir of his parliamentary majority, if the Middle
East peace process reached the stage of negotiations on Palestinian
autonomy, which they strongly oppose.
News from Washington that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had exchanged
proposals covering autonomy prompted the leaders of the two factions to say
they would quit the coalition by next week if it was confirmed that Israel
had tabled an autonomy blueprint. Negotiators said that they had only
exchanged proposals for an agenda for the talks.
After a first bilateral meeting between Israel and Jordan, a Jordanian
spokesman said his country had proposed an agenda including Israeli
settlements in the occupied territories, water, borders and the refugee
problem.
Delegates reported little progress in separate bilateral talks Israel held
with Syria and Lebanon. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were due to meet
again last night.
Jordanian and Palestinian representatives called on the Israeli delegation
to stay in Washington in a bid to make further headway, but Mr Yossi Ben
Aharon, a senior Israeli negotiator, said his delegation was still scheduled
to leave Washington tonight. He remained optimistic, however: 'What may seem
like sterile deadlock is part and parcel of the process,' he said.
US officials are also putting on a brave face, saying that these often
hostile bilateral meetings are a necessary step in the evolution of
Arab-Israeli relations.
Meanwhile, Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, from whom Tehiya and
Moledet draw heavy support, reacted angrily to reports of progress. Mr Benny
Katsover, a senior leader of the settlers, threatened violence if autonomy
was conceded. 'We won't recognise any government authority given to the
Arabs. We won't accept it and the real meaning of non-acceptance would be
confrontation, head to head.'
Mr Shamir's office confirmed that only the agenda for detailed negotiations
had been discussed in Washington. But Mr Yossi Achimeir, a senior aide to
the prime minister, said it was clear that interim Palestinian
self-government - a central aim of the US-Russian sponsored peace talks -
would soon be on the table. He predicted the departure of Tehiya and Moledet
from the coalition was 'very close'.
Mr Achimeir said he expected a general election in three or four months as a
result - six months ahead of the due date in November. He said the peace
talks would continue in the meantime.
Speculation that elections will be called early has been building steadily
in the past two weeks. Yesterday Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a top Labour leader and
former premier, said Mr Shamir's commitment to the Jewish settlers meant it
was impossible for him to advance the peace process. An early election was
necessary.
Mr Shamir is not averse. His Likud party is ahead in the polls. He can argue
that his tough stance in the peace talks had forced the Arabs to negotiate
on Israel's terms. Domestically, rising unemployment, a growing political
issue, is likely to be worse in November than in the spring.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Algerian military sets up ruling body: Defence minister
likely to play central role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BROAD-BASED committee has been handed power in Algeria by the
military-dominated council which took control at the weekend after the
resignation of President Chadli Bendjedid.
The new five-man committee of state has been given a mandate to rule until
December 1993. It is headed by Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, a former opponent of
President Chadli, but includes Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister, one of
three generals on the previous council.
The new body, effectively a collegiate presidency, sidesteps the legal
ruling that an acting in in president must call a new presidential election
within 45 days
Mr Chadli is widely believed to have been forced out by the military which
was alarmed at his desire to go ahead with the the second round of general
elections, scheduled for tomorrow, in which the Moslem fundamentalist
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win parliamentary power. The FIS
has pledged to make the north African country an Islamic state.
Gen Nezzar's presence on the new council indicates that the army intends to
continue a prominent role in running the country. Other members are Mr Ali
Haroun, the human rights minister, Dr Tidjani Haddam, rector of the Paris
mosque and considered a moderate, and Mr Ali Kafi, president of the
Veterans' National Organisation.
There was no mention of Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, who headed
the previous ruling council.
Mr Boudiaf, 72, head of the council, has not lived in Algeria since 1963,
one year after independence, and currently resides in Morocco.
In 1964 he was condemned to death in absentia by President Ahmed Ben Bella
for setting up the Party of the Socialist Revolution. Ben Bella was ousted
in 1965 but Mr Boudiaf continued to live in exile, opposing the new
president, Houari Boumedienne.
The present crisis erupted after the FIS won an unexpected landslide in a
first round of voting on December 26 and needed just 28 of the remaining
seats at stake to take a majority in the new five-year parliament.
Gen Nezzar, 54, is seen as the military strongman after having effectively
run Algeria twice during states of siege imposed by Mr Chadli in 1988 and
last June after the street battles between FIS militants and security
forces.
Gen Nezzar, a veteran of the independence war with France, was named
Algeria's first defence minister in 25 years in July 1990.
Mr Kafi, 64, also a veteran of the independence war, spent 22 years as a
diplomat. Dr Haddam is a medical doctor. He set up a body to promote family
planning in Algeria, before going to Paris.
The US yesterday shifted position on Algeria, saying it would not take
sides. Earlier the State Department had defended the military-dominated
council which took power as provided for by the constitution.
The formation of the council was seen as a unifying gesture.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Bank says Soviet debt delays temporary
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VNESHECONOMBANK, the bank responsible for servicing the former Soviet
Union's debts, yesterday told western bankers to expect 'temporary
interruptions' in the prompt payment of interest and repayment of principal
in the months ahead. It added that it had every intention of bringing all
payments up to date as soon as the necessary funds were available.
The news, communicated at a meeting convened in Frankfurt at the request of
the Vnesheconombank and the Russia central bank, was not as bad as some
bankers had expected following remarks last week by Mr Georgy Matiukhin,
head of the Russian central bank. He said then that Russia would be seeking
a full deferral of interest payments at yesterday's meeting.
This would have meant a serious breach of the agreement reached on December
17, when creditor banks agreed to an arrangement whereby Vnesheconombank
would defer repayments of principle on certain types of debt for three
months whilst continuing to pay interest.
According to last night's statement from Deutsche Bank, co-ordinating the
talks on behalf western creditors, Vnesheconombank yesterday emphasised that
it was not abrogating last month's deal by making a unilateral suspension of
interest.
Vnesheconombank explained that new procedures to garner hard currency funds
to service foreign debt had not yet come into full effect and that the
former Soviet Union had liquidity problems.
According to the Deutsche statement, the committee was informed that 'until
the new measures were fully operational there may be temporary interruptions
in the timely payment of interest' and certain other categories of debt not
included in last month's agreement.
The agreement covers only debt to private banks taken up before January 1
last year and due for repayment between December 5 last year and March 30,
excluding public issues and bond placements as well as short-term debts and
facilities.
The statement said that Vnesheconombank's role as debt manager for the
former Soviet Union would not be affected by the transfer of the bank's
commercial activities to various Russian banks under a degree passed by the
Russian parliament this week.
Under the terms of that decree, the bank is likely to be split into three
parts - one acting as an agency for foreign debt servicing, the second as an
independent commercial bank, and the third being merged with Vneshtorgbank,
the Russian foreign economic bank.
Mr Matiukhin, the Russian central bank chairman, said yesterday there was no
agreement between the republics on sharing the estimated Dollars 84bn Soviet
debt between them, and that calculations about individual shares were 'very
difficult, almost impossible: after all, these debts were accumulated in the
course of 74 years (the Soviet period)'.
He confirmed earlier indications that the bank and the Russian government
intend to introduce a special rate - to be set at Rbs8-Rbs10 to the dollar -
at which foreigners planning to buy shares in Russian enterprises would be
required to change money.
This would be far below the present market rate. Mr Matiukhin said that
unless this was done, 'they (foreign investors) could buy everything at
fantastically low prices'.

FT  15 JAN 92 / German unions caught speeding in the slow lane: German
unions find their pay claims are now out of step with a slowing economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN trade union negotiators have left themselves out on a limb with their
demands for double-digit percentage wage rises at a time of slowing economic
growth in the west, huge financial demands in east Germany, and rising
prices.
One consequence of their demands was the Bundesbank's decision last month to
raise interest rates more steeply than expected. This drew much criticism
but the central bank made it clear that it would not tolerate present
inflation of about 4 per cent or wage settlements as high as the 7 per cent
of last year.
Yet the unions will not find it easy to climb back from their exposed
position. This was shown by the decision yesterday by the powerful IG Metall
union to hold a strike ballot in the steel industry, though it said that
further talks were still possible. The banking and insurance union has also
threatened limited industrial action in banks this week in defence of its
claim. Both are asking for 10.5 per cent rises.
IG Metall's recommendation that regional claims do not exceed 9.5 per cent
for the much more important engineering industry pay round this spring
demonstrates its awareness that opinion is swinging against it. Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, head of the union, admitted that profitability in the sector
had 'certainly worsened'. But the recommended claim ceiling is still more
than twice the inflation rate.
'The unions have not chosen their tactics very well this time,' says Mr Gert
Schmidt, an economist with IKB Deutsche Industriebank. 'The public, the
politicians, the Bundesbank, and many employees are against them.'
When the unions made their double-digit demands, the west German economy
still seemed to be going strong. But gross national product figures for the
fourth quarter 1991, due out today, are expected to show no growth between
the third and fourth quarters and expansion of just more than 3 per cent on
a year-on-year basis.
'The unions' problem is how to retreat without losing face,' says Mr Adolf
Rosenstock, senior economist with Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt.
With demand from east Germany waning and export markets still not picking
up, industrial companies now seem more willing to brave strikes rather than
agree to pay awards at about the 7 per cent level of last year.
Because of higher pay deals, increased social security costs, and lower
productivity improvements at a time of slowing economic growth, German
industry's unit wage costs rose by about 5.5 per cent last year, the
strongest rise since the early 1980s. This year productivity will increase
by just more than 1 per cent. Thus, argues Westdeutsche Landesbank, industry
would be put under extreme competitive pressures if wage settlements again
approach 7 per cent.
After the Bundesbank's own warnings, political pressure has built up against
the unions. Not only have government politicians from Chancellor Helmut Kohl
downwards called for wage moderation, so have politicians in states governed
by both the Christian Democrats, the dominant party in the ruling federal
coalition, and Social Democrats, the federal opposition party.
At a time when public funds are needed to maintain the economic revival in
east Germany, the central and state administrations are adamant they cannot
afford to pay public sector workers and civil servants anything like the
double-digit increases they are asking for.
At the same time, many export-oriented companies are suffering from weak
markets. 'Industry fears a loss of competitiveness, especially to the
Japanese,' says Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank.
'Union leaders sit on companies' supervisory boards and know the figures and
their business situation,' Mr Hufner adds. 'They are aware how far they can
go and when the limit is reached. This makes me hopeful that despite all the
noise, there will be sensible settlements.'
Most economists reckon agreements of about 6 per cent would be acceptable.
Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, believe this would allow
inflation to ease to 3 per cent by the year-end after a peak of 4.7 per cent
in March.
The central bank's ambitious goal is an eventual return to inflation of 2
per cent compared with the latest figure of 4.2 per cent in December. Core
inflation is about 3.5 per cent, when the impact of last year's consumer tax
rises are excluded. The Bundesbank is worried that a planned rise in
value-added tax in 1993, currently stalled in parliamentary committee, would
add to medium-term inflationary pressures.
Not wanting to appear too provocative, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of
the Bundesbank, avoided strictures against the unions when announcing the
rate increases which took the Lombard rate to 9.75 per cent and the discount
rate to 8 per cent. He made most play of the rising money supply, spurred by
a sharp rise in bank lending, much of it to finance corporate investments in
east Germany.
But it was the unions which the Bundesbank wanted to take heed of its words
and deeds. Mr Hufner hopes the message got through. 'I believe the unions
are thinking about what the Bundesbank did.'
Only when the Bundesbank is confident that they have thought hard enough,
and signed moderate pay accords, can it be expected to consider reducing
rates again.

FT  15 JAN 92 / EC to recognise Yugoslav republics: Hurd says 10,000 United
Nations troops could be sent in the next four weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST United Nations peace observers arrived in Yugoslavia yesterday as
the European Community prepared to recognise the breakaway republics of
Croatia and Slovenia from today.
In Lisbon, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal, current
holder of the EC presidency, confirmed that all 12 Community members were
expected to meet today's deadline for recognising the two republics.
However, EC differences were underlined when Greece started a diplomatic
campaign to prevent Community recognition of a third Yugoslav republic,
Macedonia, until it drops an implied territorial claim in northern Greece.
Both Mr Deus Pinheiro and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who was
speaking in London, cautioned against exaggerating hopes of a breakthrough
for peace.
In Yugoslavia, hardline statements from both sides echoed this message. In
Zagreb, Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, vowed to recover all
territory lost to Serbia during the last six months of the war.
He said a full-scale UN peace-keeping force, which could be dispatched to
the area next month, should help ensure that Croatia won back its territory.
The UN peace plan sponsored by Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of
state, calls for the withdrawal of the Serb-dominated federal army from
Croatia and the disarming of paramilitary forces.
Mr Hurd told the House of Commons foreign affairs committee that 10,000 UN
troops could be sent to the region in three to four weeks' time. The
50-member unarmed United Nations advance team which arrived yesterday will
be based in Belgrade and Zagreb and will liaise between Croatia and the
federal army and help observe the latest ceasefire.
In spite of official approval from Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, Serb leaders from Croatia have rejected the UN plan.
Mr Milan Babic, the leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of
Krajina in southern Croatia, said: 'The UN troops will be deployed to stop
bloodshed' but added that they would not disarm Serbs in Krajina.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL European Community countries will today recognise the independence
of Croatia after a six-month war in which thousands have been killed,
600,000 people have been made homeless, and entire villages and towns have
been destroyed throughout the republic.
But many Croats feel that despite international recognition, the war which
led to the occupation, backed by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, of
a third of Croatia's territory by the federal army has not yet ended. They
also believe that efforts to rebuild the republic's fragile democratic
institutions must go hand-in-hand with regaining all its territory.
'As long as Croatia has no control over its entire territory, it will be
difficult to build democracy,' says Mr Zarko Pukovski, a sociologist at
Zagreb University. 'As long as Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia,
talks about expanding the borders into part of Bosnia-Hercegovina if that
republic breaks up, Croatia could remain unstable.'
With the help of United Nations troops, who are expected to be sent to
Croatia if recommended by the 50 UN liaison officers who arrived yesterday,
government officials in Zagreb believe stability is now possible. But many
Croats argue that the war has created such an atmosphere of revenge that the
chance of peaceful co-existence between Serbs and Croats is slim.
Desperate to create stability to attract foreign investment and rebuild the
economy, the Croat authorities must try to dilute hatred so as to prevent
local acts of reprisals against the Serbs, to build democracy, and to regain
full control of lost territory.
Mr Mario Nobilo, an adviser to Mr Tudjman, insisted yesterday that not one
inch of territory would be ceded to Serbia as the price of stability. He
believes that the presence of UN troops, and the latest ceasefire, will have
an enormous psychological affect on Croats. 'If the killing and the fighting
stops, this will make it easier to build a democratic future,' he said.
But even the UN cannot guarantee a totally peaceful future. Nationalist
paramilitaries, for example, have sprung up on both sides during the war and
Mr Pukovski fears that, on a local level, 'people will start disappearing,
and the institutions of public accountability and rule of law will not be
strong enough to stop this'.
Fear of reprisals runs through the Serb and Croat communities. Croats were
once in the majority in some of the mixed villages, but were forced out of
parts of eastern Slavonia, eastern Croatia. They will not return as long as
Mr Goran Hadzik, head of the local militant Serbs, who is backed by Mr
Milosevic and the army, remains in power.
Nor will Croats return to Krajina, south-western Croatia, as long as Mr
Milan Babic, head of the Serbian self-proclaimed republic, controls the
region with the help of the army. Many Serbs from western Slavonia, which
Croatia has regained from the federal army, will stay away for fear of
reprisals.
'Of course it will take time for Croats to return there,' said Mr Nobilo.
'But with UN help, and that of the international community, we can establish
confidence-building measures and restore our republic's territorial
integrity.'
Whether this is true remains to be seen. Mr Robert Badinter, a member of the
arbitration commission set up by the EC-sponsored peace conference, warned
recently that Serbian and Croatian leaders had stoked a frightening hatred
between their peoples, resurrecting age-old feuds. 'It will leave such
profound hatred among the peoples and minorities. . . (there) will be a
permanent source of terrorism long after peace has been restored.'

Prosecutors yesterday formally charged 13 people, including the former
Soviet prime minister, KGB chief and defence minister, with conspiracy to
seize power during the failed coup in August that led to the downfall of the
Soviet Union, AP-DJ reports from Moscow. Some could face the death penalty.
No trial date has been set.
The charges cap a four-month investigation and the gathering of 125 volumes

the actions of the KGB, the armed forces, and Communist party and other

Soviet KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, prime minister Valentin Pavlov, defence
minister Dmitri Yazov, Supreme Soviet chairman Anatoly Lukyanov and

FT  15 JAN 92 / Yeltsin stands firm as new demand made for Russian
government to go
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR RUSLAN KHASBULATOV, the increasingly powerful chairman of the Russian
parliament, was yesterday unrepentant about his demands for the resignation
of the Russian government despite a withering riposte from Mr Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian president.
Mr Yeltsin, speaking before flying to the city of Bryansk to face more
consumers angered by price rises, declared: 'You cannot throw away
governments like old socks. . . It is easier to pass laws than to implement
them.'
Responding to Mr Khasbulatov's call on Monday for him to distance himself
from the government, Mr Yeltsin said curtly: 'Any leader can have an
emotional outburst.'
But Mr Khasbulatov, who is the main spokesman for parliament's anxiety over
the huge price rises, was categoric: 'My remarks yesterday were not merely
improvised. I was careful in what I said. I hear everyone calling for a
change in the present economic reform process: many deputies, including
democrats, and non-democrats, specialists, heads of plants and enterprises
both state-owned and not state-owned. We are fed up with experiments: we
have had enough of them.'
Mr Khasbulatov, speaking in his high-ceiling chamber in the Russian 'White
House', told the FT he was prepared to use parliamentary authority to hobble
Mr Yeltsin, who was voted sweeping powers last year to push through his
emergency programme. Though insisting he was a close supporter and adviser
of the president, Mr Khasbulatov said he was determined that parliament
should be equal to the presidency, even if that meant the removal of the
present government headed by Mr Yeltsin.
His main target - though not by name  - is Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime
minister in charge of economic reform. Mr Gaidar, and his team of foreign
advisers - who include Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard and Professor
Richard Layard of London School of Economics - are now under unremitting
fire from within the Russian power structure. Their attackers include Mr
Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian Central Bank, who in a separate
interview yesterday said they were 'all saying different things at different
times.'
Of his own recent trip to the provincial city of Ryazan, Mr Khasbulatov
said: 'It was terrible, but I was not surprised. The realities confirmed my
gloomiest expectations. People are really worried: they are still silent
yet, but it is the silence before the storm.
'The government has left completely on the side all the problems of
privatisation. Ninety per cent of our economy is state owned. Price rises
will change nothing if the process of privatising and selling-off of state
property is not set in motion.'
He again called for Mr Yeltsin to resign as head of the cabinet of
ministers. 'We must protect the institution of the presidency. I said it at
the beginning, and I say it again now: it was a great mistake for Yeltsin to
head the government. We (the parliament) made a big mistake by accepting
that we should contradict the constitution, and when we granted (last
October) the right to the president to nominate the government. Now we are
going to change that law so that the government and its structure must be
discussed and approved by parliament.'
Mr Khasbulatov added that he was 'not in the least worried that a change of
government would have an adverse reaction on world opinion. Italy has had 40
governments in 40 years, and nothing bad has happened there.
'There are in fact only two stabilising factors in the country - the
President and the parliament. And we should very carefully guard the
institute of the presidency so that he does not get involved in these
government matters.

Police confiscated 4m litres of wine in northern Italy yesterday and
arrested four men in an alleged doctoring scandal, Reuter reports from
Milan.
Paramilitary police said the wine was being analysed but had probably been
laced with toxic substances in cellars near the northern towns of Vicenza
and Padova.
Italy, one of the world's largest wine exporters, was hit by a scandal six
years ago in which 23 people were killed by adulterated wine.

Spain's prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, moved quickly last night to

to Mr Julian Garcia Valverde, who was forced to resign, writes Peter Bruce
in Madrid.
Mr Gonzalez appointed Mr Jose Antonio Grinan, an ally from his own province
of Andalucia who previously held the health portfolio there.
Mr Garcia Valverde was forced to resign because of a growing scandal
surrounding land speculation near Madrid by the state railway monopoly,
Renfe, of which he was president before being promoted to the government
nearly a year ago.
The Bank of Spain yesterday raised its official intervention rate to 12.65
per cent from 12.50 per cent in the first formal increase in interest rates
since a series of rate cuts began early last year.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Port sale may be re-examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was last night preparing for an embarrassing reappraisal of
its plans to privatise the port of Tees &amp; Hartlepool, Britain's second
biggest cargo port.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, shipping minister, told MPs that no 'final decision'
on the Pounds 180m offer for the port from Teesside Holdings, a newly-formed
consortium, would be taken until representations concerning the bid had been
looked into 'very carefully'.
Fresh criticism for the government came last night from both sides of the
House of Commons. This followed a storm of protest from rival bidders and
port employees.
Last month Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, said he was 'minded'
to give his formal consent to the deal as soon as the Commons had approved a
technical order paving the way for the sale.
In a Commons debate last night, Ms Joan Walley, a Labour environment
spokeswoman, said there was 'general despair' at the government's 'wholesale
mis-handling' of the trust ports' privatisation. She added that there were
'serious allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the Tees
and Hartleepool bidding'.
Mr Roger Moate (C Faversham) said the government should look at the
situation thoroughly 'perhaps even with a view to going through the bidding
process once again'.
Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend east) complained that the technical order was
defectively drafted.
The motion was eventually passed with a government majority of 108 after
several calls for an adjournment to enable more MPs to speak had been
rejected. It will implement a clawback to ensure that when trust ports are
privatised, their new owners cannot immediately sell their assets without
paying a penalty.
The sale of Tees &amp; Hartlepool - the first of about 15 large trust ports
destined for privatisation - was conducted by the non-executive members of
the Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority. They rejected the Maritime Transport
Services, operator of the Thamesport container terminal, which bid Pounds
210m, and the management-employee buy-out team, which bid Pounds 150m.

FT  15 JAN 92 / MCC chiefs signed cash transfers: Price Waterhouse suspects
Pounds 339m from company was used to prop up shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNATURES of three executives of Maxwell Communication Corporation, as well
as those of Mr Robert Maxwell and his sons, were on documents authorising
the transfer of Pounds 339m from MCC which investigators suspect was used
for an illegal share support operation.
Startling new evidence contained in a confidential report by accountants
Price Waterhouse shows that between April and July last year transfers to Mr
Maxwell's private companies stripped MCC of all liquid assets, giving its
head office bank account a Pounds 105m overdraft, on top of its other debts
of Pounds 1.6bn.
Although there was nothing illegal in the transfer of these funds, Mr David
Lee of Price Waterhouse said yesterday: 'It is a coincidence too great to be
overlooked that MCC's money flowed out in mid-1991 at the same time as its
shares rocketed - some of these large payments were probably used to support
its own shares.'
Between March and June 1991 the MCC share price surged from 150p to 240p.
The report, codenamed Project Lucy, calculates that Mr Maxwell would have
needed to spend about Pounds 300m to take his private shareholding in MCC
from 51 per cent in mid-1990 to 79 per cent at his death on November 5.
All the MCC shares owned by Mr Maxwell were eventually pledged to bank
creditors of his private companies as security. These shares are now
regarded as worthless by the banks, which face losses of many millions of
pounds.
The alleged share support scheme, which used secret foundations to buy MCC
shares, is the subject of one of five investigations by the Serious Fraud
Office. It is an offence under UK company law for a company to purchase its
own shares without shareholders' approval.
Mr Albert Fuller, head of MCC's treasury or funding operations, is a central
figure in the transfer of funds, according to the Price Waterhouse report,
delivered to the banks on December 18. His signature appears on Pounds 33m
of payments between April 29 and July 22.
There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Fuller and other MCC directors -
apart from Mr Robert Maxwell - knew the reason for the transfers. Mr Robert
Maxwell's signature is on Pounds 241m worth of them.
The report also shows the powers that Mr Robert Maxwell won from the company
in 1981 which gave him the right to make payments without other directors'
assent. Authorisation of payments otherwise needed two signatures.
On November 26 1981, after Mr Maxwell rescued the company, then called
British Printing Corporation, from financial disaster, a resolution was
passed 'that the chairman . . . is hereby appointed a committee of the board
and that there be . . . delegated to the chairman as such commit-tee all the
powers of the board'. The powers were never rescinded.
According to the Price Waterhouse investigation, Mr Maxwell's youngest son,
Kevin, MCC's chief executive, signed Pounds 52m of transfers and his brother
Ian Pounds 8m. Mr Jean Pierre Anselmini, the former deputy chairman, signed
only Pounds 2m and Mr Basil Brookes, finance director, only Pounds 1m, even
though their positions suggested they had a central role in the company's
finance.
MCC directors have said they protested to Mr Robert Maxwell about the
transfers and after they took independent legal advice in August money began
flowing back to MCC.
Price Waterhouse said yesterday that transfers were later authorised -
Pounds 2.5m on September 13 by the signatures of Mr Brookes and Mr Fuller,
and Pounds 14.7m on September 20 by the signatures of Mr Brookes and Mr
Kevin Maxwell. They added that their report was based on documents at MCC,
where they have been appointed administrators under UK insolvency law. They
are now checking that the signatures authorising the transfers are
authentic.
Mr Kevin Maxwell was in court yesterday for the second day of his appeal
against the high court's decision that he must answer questions from
Bishopsgate Investment Management about missing pension funds.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Iraq could have built 4 A-bombs a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ has acknowledged to United Nations inspectors for the first time that
it had a large-scale uranium enrichment programme.
It could have made enough uranium to build four atomic bombs a year of the
size and type dropped by the US on the Japanese city of Nagasaki in 1945.
The inspectors have no evidence that Iraq actually completed a nuclear bomb,
though it is possible that one was made and remains hidden.
Mr Robert Gallucci, who led the latest UN inspection visit to Iraq, said in
Bahrain yesterday that the Iraqis admitted running enrichment centrifuges on
a production scale, rather than just a research scale.
A colleague at UN headquarters in New York, Mr David Dorn, said Iraq might
have run as many as 10,000 gas centrifuges to convert natural uranium into
material rich in U235, the isotope required for an atomic bomb.
It emerged yesterday that German engineers had played a key role in
supplying materials for the centrifuges. About five German companies are
facing criminal proceedings for illegal exports of nuclear-related equipment
to Iraq, according to officials in Bonn.
All the companies were involved in exporting parts and equipment which could
be used to make gas centrifuges to enrich uranium, but some of these could
have a dual use and therefore may prove not to be illegally exported, the
German Foreign Ministry said.
Full details of the equipment supplied were handed by the German authorities
to the UN special disarmament commission for Iraq last week. Mr Gallucci
held talks with the German investigators in Bonn on January 9.
'The aim of this action is to show that we are in earnest in the exposure of
illegal exports to Iraq,' a Foreign Ministry official said. 'We are
determined to help the UN commission do its work properly by confronting
Iraq with the evidence.'
Centrifuges, which spin uranium hexafluoride gas very rapidly to separate
the scarce U235 from the heavier U238, are regarded as state-of-the-art
enrichment technology in the west, both for military purposes and for civil
nuclear reactors. The uranium has to pass through 'cascades' of hundreds or
even thousands of centrifuges before it is rich enough in U235 to fuel a
reactor or bomb.
In Washington, US officials predicted that the latest disclosures would lead
to stepped-up UN inspections of undeclared sites. An option is for UN
inspectors to destroy facilities dedicated entirely or partly to Iraq's
nuclear and unconventional weapons programme.
In a report to Congress released yesterday, President George Bush said that
although UN inspection teams had destroyed 62 missiles, 33 warheads and
quantities of additional missile equipment, the US believed that Iraq still
possessed 'large numbers of undeclared ballistic missiles.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Major fuels forecasts of tax-cutting Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday fuelled intense speculation at Westminster that the
government is preparing a tax-cutting Budget as the platform for its general
election campaign.
His comments in the House of Commons came amid indications that new tax
allowances for working mothers and further incentives to encourage saving
might accompany a reduction in income tax if Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, can find sufficient room for manoeuvre.
They coincided also with indications from a new opinion poll that the
Conservatives' onslaught early last week on Labour's tax plans has boosted
their support among voters.
The ICM poll for today's Guardian shows the Conservatives with a one-point
lead over Labour after a three-point rise to 42 per cent in its support
since December. Labour's support fell one point, while the Liberal Democrats
dropped from 14 per cent to 12 per cent. The poll was taken at the end of
last week.
The prime minister's statement that 'when it is prudent to make tax
reductions we will make them', was reinforced by a detailed exposition by Mr
Chris Patten, the party chairman, of the case for lower taxation.
Delivering the annual Disraeli Lecture in London, Mr Patten identified
taxation as the central difference between the two main parties. He added:
'Conservatives reduce taxes, whenever that is consistent with our
unshakeable commitment to sound money.'
Senior ministers stressed that the final judgment on the room for reductions
would not be made until much nearer the Budget.
Some of Mr Major's colleagues remain wary that charges of pre-election
bribery might undermine the Conservatives' claim to responsible economic
management. Mr Lamont will be anxious also not to risk upsetting confidence
on financial markets.
The ministers acknowledge, however, that Mr Major appears determined to
seize the opportunity of reducing income tax - either through raising
thresholds or by cutting the basic rate - if he can.
He reinforced that view in his first Commons clash of the new year with Mr
Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader. He rejected Mr Kinnock's claim that he had
ruled out as 'fool's gold' any pre-election tax cuts in an interview last
autumn.
Responding that he had been 'misquoted', Mr Major said the government would
cut taxes when it was prudent to do so because 'we believe that people are
better able to look after their own interest than any government, however
benevolent'.
Conservative party officials said plans were now in place to call the
election on either April 9 or May 7, following a Budget on March 3 or March
10.
They said that the broad themes of the election manifesto had been
established, with the focus on widening personal ownership and extending
personal choice. The Budget measures would be designed to underpin that
message.

FT  15 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Active session in Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of Fisons shares was marked up sharply at the opening as the
company announced that Mr John Kerridge had resigned as chairman and chief
executive of the group because of ill health. Mr Kerridge had been seen by
many as one of the main barriers to workable communication with the stock
market.
The change also prompted speculation that, with no-one at the helm and the
company undervalued on fundamental assets, Fisons may be vulnerable to a
bid. Traders revalued the shares by more than 20p, which encouraged sellers
who forced the price back to the low 360s. The stock saw good two-way
business at that level, ending the day as the most heavily traded issue with
a turnover of 14.4m shares and up 11 at 365p.
Mr Robin Gilbert of agency broker James Capel said: 'On one hand there was
bid speculation. Others took the view that Kerridge's departure is a prelude
to something even worse than we have been exposed to so far.' The shares
fell 47p in mid-December when the company announced that it had lost Pounds
65m since the US Food and Drug Administration decided to ban the import of
two of its products, Opticrom and Imferon. Analysts are looking towards the
company's research and development meeting next Wednesday, its first for
some years.
GRE finds buyers
The best performance of any Footsie stock yesterday came from Guardian Royal
Exchange, which moved up 5.3 per cent or 9 to 132p in response to talk of an
influential broker buy recommendation and very vague hints that a
stakebuilder may soon make an appearance. The shares shrugged aside the
lingering effects of at least two bearish broker circulars which had pointed
out GRE's need for a capital injection.
Dealers said the impetus behind the share price rise came from an impending
buy note from the insurance team at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroking
arm of Royal Bank of Scotland.
Charterhouse said it had prepared a 'strong buy' recommendation on GRE but
declined to give details. Dealers said the Charterhouse note focused on
asset values, notably GRE's Albingia insurance business in Germany, and a
Charterhouse assertion that other brokers' estimates of a 50 per cent cut in
GRE's dividend may have been overdone.
Glaxo fell almost 20p in early trading as investors decided to take profits.
Observers said the fall had been prompted by selling in Merck, the worlds
biggest pharmaceuticals company, to which Glaxo was recently compared in a
US business journal. However, US buyers returned in the afternoon and the
shares closed only 5 off at 925p with just over 4m traded.
Buying ahead of Friday's annual meeting helped Wellcome to gain 12 to 1053p.
BZW was thought to have been behind some strong gains in the oil sector.
Shell was 12 higher at 491p, Enterprise 8 firmer at 436p and BP also 8
ahead, at 294p.
A sell note issued by the banks team at Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL) kept
Standard Chartered, a strong performer since the end of November, in
negative territory throughout the day. The stock closed a shade off at 428p.
CLL told clients: 'Expect a profits plateau in 1992/93. The inevitable rise
in loan loss provisions post 1992/93 will lead to a significant reduction in
profit before tax and capital ratios.'
Cable and Wireless surged ahead 18 to an all-time closing high of 618p as
speculators grew more convinced that a major deal involving the group is in
the offing. C and W shares have risen rapidly during recent days amid
suggestions that AT&amp;T, of the US, was about to acquire a stake of up to 25
per cent in Mercury, C and W's telecoms division. C and W's previous closing
high was 611p, reached on September 8, 1989.
Dealers said yesterday's burst of buying followed strong suggestions that
AT&amp;T was preparing a blockbuster bid for the whole of C and W. The latter's
market capitalisation is approaching Pounds 7bn. 'AT&amp;T is the obvious
candidate to buy C and W and it has the means to do so,' commented one
leading telecoms analyst. AT&amp;T has stated it wants at least half of its
income to come from outside the US by the turn of the century.
Turnover in C and W was an above-average 4m shares, following the 3.8m
traded on Tuesday when the share price rose 11p.
Institutional buyers pushed Bass up 21 to 1070p. Panmure Gordon has the
company on its buy list and argues that the stock remains cheap against the
rest of the sector.
The power generators met selling ahead of the second calls on the stocks.
The second payment, of 75p a share, falls due on February 4. National Power
held at 129p but PowerGen eased 3 1/2 to 135 1/2 p.
A series of profits downgrades, commonly from Pounds 140m to Pounds 125m,
failed to damage Blue Circle Industries, which rose 6 to 229p. Wolseley, the
building supplies group, put on 6 to 384p after a buy note issued by Nikko
Securities.
Hazlewood Foods slid 20 to 142p, just above the 1991/92 low of 138p, after a
further big profits downgrade by SG Warburg Securities.
Mr Mark Lynch at Warburg, who only last Friday reduced his current-year
profits estimate from Pounds 58m to Pounds 55m, chopped it again yesterday
to Pounds 51m.
Chemicals manufacturer MTM continued to see heavy activity on the back of
company presentations to institutions hosted by Robert Fleming Securities.
The company was signalling 1991 profits of around Pounds 23m and was
optimistic about 1992 growth. The shares firmed a penny to 253p with 1.3m
traded.
Caravans to property group Burndene Investments shot up 56 to 175p as the
company announced final profits of Pounds 4.3m against Pounds 3.8m, far
better than the market had expected in view of the cautious statement at the
interim stage.
Vague bid speculation left APV 5 higher at 119p on turnover of 1.6m.
British Steel edged ahead 1 1/2 to 68 1/2 p after its broker, UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, turned buyer of the shares. TI advanced 15 to 580p after the stock was
included among County NatWest's top 30 best buys.
Smiths Industries gained 10 to 279p after UBS showed a keen interest in the
shares. A squeeze was noted in Siebe, which climbed 20 to 558p.
There are signs of a resurgence of interest in retailing shares after the
bout of substantial underperformance against the market that occurred from
mid-December onwards. Worries about Christmas trading and general
uncertainty regarding the progress of the economic recession in the UK
triggered the steep fall in stores shares in the middle of last month.
Analysts are now slightly more optimistic amid talk of better than expected
January sales. Provisional retail sales figures for December are expected on
January 20 and may give the market a shot in the arm.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Appointments: Ward to former client
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clive Ward, one of a number of recent senior defections from Shandwick, has
re-emerged on the board of business services company Capita Group, a
one-time client of his.
Ward, who is 46, readily concedes that his move two years ago to Shandwick
and into the then newly created position of corporate development director
was ill-timed. It soon became clear that there was not much of a job to do -
the world's largest public relations company was entering a distinctly rocky
period. He resigned last November.
Meanwhile, Capita was known to him from his days at accountants Ernst and
Young when he advised on the group's USM flotation in 1989. He had refreshed
the acquaintance when Shandwick purchased a small pr company in Northern
Ireland from Capita last year.
As managing director of the corporate finance arm of Capita, one of his
briefs will be to raise the company's profile in the private sector. Capita,
which was once part of Cipfa, the public sector's professional accountancy
institute, is the largest provider of management services to the public
sector. But Ward is hoping that, despite the recession, there is plenty of
scope for the provision of specialist advice to small and medium-sized
businesses in the private sector.

Alan Pink, a chemical engineer, is to take over from Alan Hayes as chief
executive of ICI Agrochemicals and Seeds, one of ICI's seven main divisions
with annual sales of Pounds 1.4bn a year and profits of over Pounds 100m.
Pink, aged 53, joined ICI in Billingham in 1962 and spent the early part of
his career on the heavy chemical side of the business. After a stint in the
US with ICI Americas, he was appointed general manager-planning at ICI's
Millbank headquarters in July 1985. Since 1989 he has headed ICI Advanced
Materials. He takes over his new post in April following the retirement of
Hayes who, at 61, has been with ICI for 46 years.

POLYGRAM, the London-based music company, has appointed Allen Davis to run
its operations in continental Europe. The company also announces that Norman
Cheng will become president of PolyGram Far East.
The two appointments form part of a worldwide restructuring of the company's
management, initiated by Alain Levy, chief executive of PolyGram, who also
continues to act as chairman and chief executive of PolyGram USA.
Until his retirement in 1990, Davis, 61, worked for CBS Records, now part of
Sony of Japan. He held senior positions in the US, UK, France and the
Netherlands.
Cheng, 45, will be based in Hong Kong and will be responsible for PolyGram's
operations in Japan and South East Asia.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Appointments: BUPA begins to fill its gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUPA, Britain's largest private healthcare organisation which is aiming to
improve its own fitness, has named Arthur Large as a main board member and
managing director of the health insurance division.
Three top executives left BUPA last November, the product of changes
initiated by chief executive Peter Jenkins who joined earlier in the year
determined to inject a more commercial spirit into the operation. In 1990
medical insurance had produced losses of Pounds 63m, and competition forced
BUPA's overall market share down to around half from an erstwhile 70 per
cent.
BUPA is still looking for a finance director but is not expected to appoint
another director of community business, the other position vacated last
year, following a general reorganisation in the health insurance division.
Large, 52, comes from the RAC where he was chief executive of Motoring
Services and was credited with greatly improving the RAC's approach to
customer service.

FT  15 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Positive factors and
bargain hunting lift Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
INSTITUTIONAL and foreign bargain hunting and positive fundamentals enabled
the Nikkei average to post a small gain yesterday in arbitrage-dominated
trading after five consecutive losses, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 78.27 up at 21,775.13 after a day's high of 22,019.94 and
a low of 21,662.99. The market fell 3.1 per cent the previous day. Volume
came to 180m shares after Monday's 176m. The overall tendency was easier,
however, declines leading rises by 530 to 384 with 185 issues unchanged, and
170 shares hitting lows for the year.
The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 4.56 to 1,624.40 after
finishing at the lowest level since the beginning of 1991 on Monday. In
London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index picked up 5.79 to 1,232.72. Japanese
markets are closed today for a public holiday.
The market managed to fend off early declines in spite of a narrowing of the
spread between cash and futures prices as the plunge in recent sessions
enticed buyers. Prices also received support from lower interest rates,
strength in the over-the-counter and bond markets and the yen's afternoon
rally.
Traders nevertheless warned that the investment trust selling which has
prompted recent sell-offs has not diminished, and that the market could face
further losses prior to March-end book closings.
Petroleum shares firmed on overnight strength abroad, with Nippon Oil
putting on Y15 to Y870. Financials also staged a rebound after recent sharp
losses, Fuji Bank rising Y100 to Y2,290 and Yamaichi Securities Y32 to Y708.
Auto makers and electricals recovered lost ground as well. Toyota was up Y40
to Y1,430 and Pioneer Y90 to Y3,330.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 52.31 to 23,198.67 on volume of 66.2m
shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday, as Hong Kong reached
another all-time high.
HONG KONG climbed to a new record in active trading as fund managers,
reshuffling their portfolios, stocked up on laggards. There were also
rumours that Sino-US talks on the protection of US intellectual property
rights had reached a compromise. The Hang Seng index rose 41.70 to 4,367.61
as turnover swelled to HKDollars 1.68bn from HKDollars 1.33bn.
AUSTRALIA ended lower, affected by a further decline in BHP, which lost 20
cents to ADollars 13.58. After the close, BHP announced structural changes
to its steel division. The All Ordinaries index finished near the day's
worst at 1,651.7, down 8.9, in turnover of ADollars 199m, against ADollars
218m.
Banking shares fell on speculation that further declines in domestic
interest rates were unlikely. Commonwealth Bank of Australia slipped 11
cents to ADollars 7.64 and Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking lost 10 cents to
ADollars 4.74.
Pacific Magazines &amp; Printing, spun off recently from News Corp, dropped 21
cents to ADollars 3.15 on a report that the underwriter had been left with a
large number of the shares.
NEW ZEALAND closed weaker as selling by foreign investors pushed turnover up
to heavy levels. The NZSE-40 index receded 15.36 to 1,478.32 in turnover of
NZDollars 31m, up from Monday's low NZDollars 10.7m.
Yesterday's volume was boosted by some block sales, including 4.5m shares in
Bank of New Zealand which changed hands at 60 cents a share. The stock ended
3 cents down at 60 cents on the day's heaviest market volume, including the
block sale, of 4.9m shares.
Turnover in Fletcher Challenge was also swollen by a block sale - 3.8m
shares that were traded at NZDollars 3.29 apiece. The stock was steady at
NZDollars 3.30 on total volume of 4.2m shares.
MANILA was buoyed by the overnight rise of PLDT in New York. The composite
index advanced 12.32 to 1,236.66 as turnover increased to 122m pesos from
94m pesos.
PLDT appreciated 25 pesos to 940 pesos following its overnight rise on Wall
Street by Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 36.25.
SINGAPORE was dominated by trade linked to the expiry of warrants. The
Straits Times Industrial index moved forward 5.33 to 1,488.59 in turnover of
SDollars 110.3m.
SIA Foreign declined 50 cents to SDollars 19.30 on continued concern that
the limit on foreign ownership would be raised.
TAIWAN was led higher by financial shares as the weighted index moved ahead
42.73 to 4,947.16. Turnover remained heavy, totalling TDollars 45.28bn,
after TDollars 54.28bn.
SEOUL rallied after three days of weakness. The composite index firmed 6.22
to 616.12 as turnover rose to Won217.2bn from Won185.3bn.
KUALA LUMPUR finished weaker following a thin day's trading on uncertainty
about the economy. The composite index dipped 2.06 to 546.63, while turnover
decreased to MDollars 57.9m from MDollars 66m.

FT  15 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil leads emerging markets in
December - Approval of President Collor's tax reforms added to the surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After lagging behind Argentina and Colombia for much of the year, Brazil's
stock market came into its own in December, to take first place among the
market indices published by the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
part of the World Bank.
Brazilian share prices rose 44.9 per cent in dollar terms, a strong
performance stemming from growing confidence - particularly among foreign
investors - that the country had started to get to grips with its economic
problems. For 1991 as a whole Brazil was up 151 per cent in dollar terms, a
performance which put it in fourth place in the IFC's comparisons, behind
Argentina (up 392.5 per cent), Colombia and Pakistan.
Contributing to December's surge of confidence were congressional approval
of President Collor's tax reforms and the signing of a letter of intent to
the IMF as part of negotiations for a standby facility. Mr Michel Camdessus,
managing director of the IMF, who visited Brazil in December to receive the
letter of intent personally from President Collor, said the standby will
probably be approved by the IMF executive board when it comes up for
approval on January 22.
'Brazil is still relatively cheap,' says a US broker following the market
from London; the market is selling at around 6 to 7 times 1992 projected
earnings. By comparison, Mexico ended the year at 14 times earnings. There
is still scope for further strengthening of the Brazilian market, the broker
adds, but current prices reflect the relatively high degree of country risk.
Investor interest, particularly from abroad, has continued into early 1992,
says Mr Tony Ewell of BZW's Latin American section. December's best
performers were the big blue chips, he adds. In particular, utilities such
as Electrobras and Petrobras benefited from the government's promise to the
IMF to permit tariff increases which not only match inflation but provide a
real return on capital.
Colombia put in another strong performance in December, climbing 37.2 per
cent in dollar terms. The market was opened to foreign investors in
December, and only two foreign funds have so far applied for approval,
though other applications are on their way. December's third-best performing
market was Pakistan, up 30.4 per cent in dollar terms.
There were no really bad falls in the month. The worst performing emerging
markets were Korea, which declined 6.8 per cent in dollar terms, and India,
down 1.1 per cent in dollar terms. Both these also fell in local currency.
Chile, which was just negative in dollar terms (down 0.1 per cent), actually
rose slightly in local currency terms, but that gain was offset by
devaluation.
For the year as a whole, Turkey halved in dollar terms, a drop largely due
to devaluation. Indonesia was down by two-fifths, despite a strengthening
currency. Greece fell 22.1 per cent in dollar terms.

FT  15 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit fall hits Thyssen as
German chemicals climb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST bourses were firmer yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's DAX index maintained its uptrend with the help of two or three
blue chips, closing 5.86 higher at 1,628.53, but the more broadly-based FAZ
easing 0.16 to 6589.53 at midsession.
Volume eased from DM6.9bn to DM6.5bn. In chemicals, BASF and Hoechst rose
DM3.40 to DM235 and DM8.50 to DM235.50 on rumours of two buy
recommendations. Bayer, more highly priced and with less of a dividend yield
to offer, rose only 80 pfg to DM287.80.
In carmakers, last year's underperformers recovered a little, with Porsche
rising by DM5 to DM560. Volkswagen added DM6.50 to DM307 as County NatWest
noted a VW indication that profits rose by 6 per cent in the final quarter
after a 17 per cent drop in the first nine months of 1991.
Ms Heidemarie Hoppner of B Metzler in Frankfurt noted a return to quality
among second-liners where specialist chemical manufacturers like Henkel and
Schering rose by DM8 to DM562.50, and by DM8.50 to DM820 respectively.
However, in steels, Thyssen fell DM2.50 to DM208 on the 42 per cent drop in
Thyssen Stahl's 1990-91 profits, and the forecast of 'clearly worse
earnings' in the current year.
PARIS finished close to the day's highs on the back of Wall Street. The CAC
40 index rose 19.52 to 1,843.81 in turnover estimated at around Monday's
FFr2.0bn.
News that Libya planned to cut its oil production to support sagging world
oil prices lifted the oil sector. The oil refiner Total added FFr45 to
FFr1,054 while Elf, weak recently, recovered FFr7.30 to FFr365.30.
The building materials company, Lafarge, recouped FFr6.70 at FFr324.80 after
Monday's 6.7 per cent drop. Elsewhere, Pernod Ricard, the drinks company
which announced an 11 per cent rise in its interim dividend last week, added
FFr38 to FFr1,431 in relatively heavy volume of 109,125 shares.
MILAN overcame a weak start as options-related selling dried up. The Comit
index rose 6.94 to 537.91 in turnover estimated at around L100bn after
Monday's L85bn.
Part of the day's gains were attributed to short-covering ahead of the close
of the January account today. But dealers detected domestic buying in
anticipation of the dissolution of parliament and the general election
campaign, during which the stock market traditionally performs well.
Bargain-hunting and optimism that all the bad news was out in the open
lifted the ordinary shares of Pirelli by L35 or 3.3 per cent to 1,080.
In telecoms, Sip was unchanged at L1,490 in spite of some foreign
profit-taking as the stock approached L1,500.
ZURICH rose as Nestle was reported to be considering a ten-for-one share
split. The Credit Suisse index rose 1.3 to 463.8. Nestle bearers put on
SFr120 to SFr9,000 and CS Holding, next on the active list, rose SFr50 to
SFr1,875 as the market awaited the decision by the US rating agency,
Moody's, on the credit rating of Credit Suisse, CS Holding's main
subsidiary.
OSLO extended its recovery with the all-share index up 6.24 to 443.13 in
active turnover of NKr430m on the stronger dollar and better oil prices.
HELSINKI did likewise in in the year's largest volume, the Hex index rising
7.90 to 861.20 in turnover of FM58.1m, of which free shares made up FM24.6m.
STOCKHOLM saw continued interest in Astra as its A unrestricted shares added
SKr4 to SKr570 while its B unrestricted shares fell SKr8 to SKr552. The
Affarsvarlden General index rose 0.6 to 958.6 in turnover of SKr417m after
SKr384m.
AMSTERDAM concentrated on dollar-earners and stocks which had lagged behind
in the second half of last year. The CBS Tendency Index closed 1.1 higher at
118.0.
Heineken went as high as Fl 164.90 before ending unchanged at Fl 164.10 on
takeover rumours, which were dismissed by analysts as unlikely.
BRUSSELS rose in line with the rest of Europe. The Bel-20 Index added 7.08
to 1,114.86

FT  15 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rallies in late trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar staged a late rally on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, as
flows out of the D-Mark raised expectations of a further strengthening of
the US currency, writes Simon London.
The dollar lost some ground overnight in Far Eastern trading although
dealers reported good two-way business, suggesting that sentiment remained
evenly split between buyers and sellers.
Sellers had the edge in Japan, however. From a close of DM1.5780 and Y127.05
in New York, the US currency declined to DM1.5688 and Y126.05 by the close
in Tokyo.
The Japanese currency was initially undermined by the emergence of another
financial scandal involving the political establishment. Against this, the
yen was supported by comments from Mr Yasushi Meino, Bank of Japan govenor,
which were taken to rule out another early cut in the discount rate.
In European trading the cautious tone continued, with the dollar trading in
a narrow range either side of DM1.57 for most of the morning session.
US retail sales figures for December, showing a decline of 0.4 per cent, at
the more gloomy end of expectations, did nothing to assist the US currency.
However, a late surge took the US currency to DM1.5905 by the close, against
DM1.5725 on Monday, with the rally continuing towards DM1.60 in New York.
Dealers pointed to the decision by the German metal workers union to ballot
members on strike action in pursuit of a 10 per cent pay claim. As dealers
switched out of the D-Mark, the US currency was the main beneficiary.
The dollar closed against the yen at Y126.80, the same as Monday's level,
underlining that the majority of switching came from holders of D-Marks.
Earlier, the Bank of Spain surprised most observers by moving to increase
10-day interest rates at its regular money market tender. The bank increased
rates from 12.5 per cent to 12.65 per cent, enough to lift the peseta
marginally within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The peseta improved to Pta63.65, from Pta63.73, against the D-Mark, with
similar modest gains against most other European currencies.
The Spanish currency is already the strongest with in the ERM and its
marginal appreciation lifted the effective floor for sterling, the weakest
currency in the system. The floor rose from DM2.8320 to DM2.8350 during the
morning session.
Sterling responded by rising to DM2.8380, maintaining the slim margin above
the floor which has been held since the middle of last week.
However, the weakness of the D-Mark during late afternoon took some of the
pressure off sterling and by the close the UK currency had improved to
DM2.85, from DM2.8350 on Monday. This was the peak for the day and in New
York trading sterling had fallen back to DM2.8430, still comfortably above
its ERM floor.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON

<TEXT>
UK money rates closed unchanged yesterday, with sentiment generally buoyed
by the gains of sterling against the D-Mark within the European exchange
rate mechanism, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 900m liquidity shortage in early
morning, later revised to Pounds 1.05bn. In early assistance, the Bank
purchased Pounds 100m paper for resale to the market at 10 7/16 per cent in
equal amounts on January 27 and 28.
Later in the morning this pattern was repeated but on a larger scale, the
Bank buying Pounds 700m paper at the same rate, of resale in equal amounts
on the same dates.
Afternoon assistance comprised the purchase of a modest Pounds 32m band 1
bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance totalled Pounds 100m bringing
the liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 932m, around Pounds 120m less
than the forecast shortage.
Rates were steady to softer for most of the day. Having closed on Monday at
10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent, overnight unsecured money traded down to 10 1/2 -
1/4 per cent in late morning before firming to close back at Monday's
levels.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange closed at 89.62, from 89.49 on Monday, implying
base lending rates of 10.38 per cent by the spring.
Sterling gained ground against the D-Mark in late trading on the foreign
exchange markets, having been firm for most of the day, to close at DM2.85.
During the morning, the Bank of Spain increased money market interest rates
from 12.5 per cent to 12.65 per cent, enough to lift the peseta against
other European currencies and lift sterling's floor to around DM2.8355.
In Frankfurt, call money rates were squeezed higher for the second day
running as financial institutions scrambled for funds ahead of a dealine for
taxation payments later this month. Call money traded up to 9.55/60 per
cent, from 9.45/55 on Monday and 9.40/9.50 for most of last week.
Today, rates could be pushed higher still with DM33.8bn being drained from
the market by the expiry of two Bundesbank repurchase pacts. The authorities
are expected to replace the lost liquidity with a fresh repurchase
agreement, although the Bundesbank may be content to see rates closer to
9.75 per cent, the Lomard emergency funding rate for financial institutions.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil expected to retake lead
in coffee sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL EXPORTED 19.46m bags (60 kg each) of green coffee in 1991, worth
Dollars 1.45bn, figures which the local coffee sector believes will propel
Brazil back into its traditional position as the world's biggest coffee
exporter, in terms of both volume and earnings.
The results, announced by the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters,
represented a 33 per cent increase in volume over 1990, and a 26 per cent
increase in earnings. In 1990, Colombia overtook its southern neighbour in
terms of receipts from coffee exports, pulling in Dollars 1.5bn on 13.9m
bags, compared with Brazilian earnings of Dollars 1.2bn on 14.6m bags. As
Colombia's 1990 sales depleted much of its coffee stocks, the country is
expected to register slightly lower results for 1990.
According to coffee traders, Brazil's poor performance in 1990 was caused by
international consumers' willingness to pay higher prices for better quality
arabica. Colombia's quality is generally considered to be superior to that
of Brazil.
Last year, Brazil accounted for an estimated 30 per cent of the world coffee
market in terms of volume. Several factors accounted for the surge in
Brazilian coffee exports last year. 'We had a relatively good harvest,' said
Mr Orlando Correa, president of the Coffee Trade Centre in Rio de Janeiro.
The Brazilian government no longer makes an official estimate of the
country's production, but according to Mr Correa the 1991 harvest was about
27m bags. Another reason, Mr Correa said, was that Brazil's coffee farmers
were caught in a credit squeeze 'and were therefore forced to sell off their
stocks to finance their harvest.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zairean cobalt output forecast
to drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COBALT PRODUCTION in Zaire, the world's largest producer, is likely to drop
substantially this year, forcing the cash-hungry government to increase
prices again, suggests the Wogen Resources minor metals organisation in a
note to clients.
Zaire and Zambia between them supply about 70 per cent of the world's
cobalt, an essential metal for some of the superalloys used by the aerospace
industry and for some motor industry products.
The two countries recently lifted their producer prices from Dollars 11 to
Dollars 25 a lb, responding to a rise in European free market prices which
doubled to Dollars 30 last year.
Mr Nick French, a Wogen director, points out that the Dollars 25 a lb price
is valid for only a few months. 'Indications are that fresh shipments of
cobalt cathodes from Zaire reaching the market before April will be almost
zero,' he adds.
'Given the high priority for cash in the bankrupt economies of both Zambia
and Zaire, with the new President in the former committed to reviving the
economy and that of the latter depending on an economic turnround for
survival, both will require maximum revenue from cobalt. Thus all pressure
will be for a further hike in prices.'
He says last year's cobalt price rise resulted from shortfalls in African
production for some years. Gecamines, Zaire's state-owned producer, aimed to
produce 13,000 tonnes last year but admits it achieved 10,000 tonnes at
best. For 1992 various sources have suggested Zaire's output would fall to
6,000 to 7,000 tonnes while one thought that '3,000 to 4,000 tonnes might be
more realistic'.
Mr French suggests Gecamines is suffering from a 'cash problem, not a
political problem', in that it needs more than Dollars 100m to update its
operations.
He warns: 'Volatility and high prices will be the main characteristic of the
cobalt market in 1992'.

VENEZUELA'S production of crude oil in 1991 averaged 2.488m barrels a day,
the highest level on record since the country's petroleum industry was
nationalised in 1976, official sources said in Caracas.
The 1991 production figure, which includes crude oil and small proportions
of condensates and natural gas liquids, represents an increase of nearly 11
per cent over 1990 production of 2.249m b/d. Exports of crude oil and
refined products in 1991 averaged 2.08m b/d, up more than 10 per cent from
the previous year's average of 1.88m b/d.
Venezuela's proven reserves of crude oil totalled 62.8bn barrels at the end
of 1991, up 5 per cent from a year earlier. This means that Venezuela
continues to hold the largest proved reserves of crude oil in the Western
Hemisphere, even without including the country's very large deposits of
extra heavy oil located in the Orinoco Belt.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Many zinc mines 'are operating
at a loss'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN 35 and 45 per cent of zinc mine capacity is not covering its
operating costs at present low prices and many zinc smelters are not
profitable, according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group.
So it seems logical that more high-cost mines should close this year and
that more smelter shut-downs must be expected, it suggests in a special
report on the zinc market.
Zinc production in western Europe, which fell from a peak of 1.14m tonnes in
1985 to about 950,000 tonnes in 1990, is expected to drop again.
Metallgesellschaft is to close its Meggen mine in March and this will
effectively bring an end to zinc mining in Germany, the report points out.
However, mine and smelter cuts will not be implemented quickly enough to
return the market to balance before well into next year and 1992 should see
another supply surplus, say the authors, Ms Karen Norton and Mr Angus
MacMillan.
They suggest the estimated supply surplus of 175,000 tonnes last year will
ease to 105,000 tonnes in 1992 and change to a 70,000 tonnes deficit in
1993.
Consequently, average London Metal Exchange zinc cash prices are likely to
average 48 cents a lb in the second quarter of 1992 before picking up to
average 58 cents in the final quarter. For this year as a whole, zinc is
seen averaging 52 cents against 50.7 cents a lb in 1991, rising to an
average of 60 cents in 1993.
Output of refined lead outside the old eastern bloc countries is forecast to
slip from an estimated 5.275m tonnes last year to 5.125m tonnes in 1992
before recovering to 5.2m tonnes next year. Consumption is estimated at 5.2m
tonnes for 1991 and forecast to ease to 5.1m tonnes this year and rise to
5.35m tonnes in 1993.
Looking further ahead, the report says zinc demand should enjoy a period of
reasonable growth in the 1990s and envisages an underlying rate of 1.5 to 2
per cent a year during the present decade.

Wheat futures were higher at midsession in Chicago supported by a mix of
speculative buying in the wake of bullish USDA crop reports on Friday and
Monday. The bullish reports include USDA ending stocks estimate,
greater-than-expected USDA wheat export inspections, and less-than-expected
winter wheat plantings. On the LME copper, lead and zinc prices rallied in
the afternoon on market talk that Peru is to close some of the facilities at
its La Oroya lead/zinc/copper plant due to high energy costs. Traders said
zinc was more vulnerable than some other metals to talk of supply
disruptions as it had recently absorbed news that two European smelter
closures in the first half of 1992 will take 200,000 tonnes of capacity off
the market. The news lifted three-month copper away from a test of the
recent 3 1/2 -year low of Dollars 2,110 a tonne. But dealers believe that
with charts and fundamentals bearish, this level could be tested again soon.
Gold pulled back from a dip into the Dollars 350-a-troy-ounce area on the
bullion market. Dealers said the market was in a position to make more
progress on the upside and possibly later this week challenge last
Thursday's highs between Dollars 358 and Dollars 360.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: A marriage made in the market
place - The merger of Liffe and LTOM which will go ahead in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) has managed to
find enough market-makers in individual stock options to allow its merger
with the London Traded Options Market (LTOM) to go ahead.
'We have received sufficient commitment from a nucleus of market-makers to
make it possible for the merged market to continue to trade the full range
of individual equity options and index options currently traded on LTOM,'
said Mr David Burton, Liffe's chairman.
Although there is still some concern that the market-making capacity of the
new exchange may initially be rather thin, dealers hope the boost in
activity provided by the merger will prompt an increase in the level of
market-making activity.
Six firms - JG Bolitho, City of London Options, Hills Independent Traders,
James Capel, Kleinwort Benson and Swiss Bank Corporation - have said they
will act as assigned market-makers and nominated market-makers in a range of
contracts.
An assigned market-maker is committed to making a continuous two-way price
in a particular contract, while a nominated market-maker is expected to make
prices on request.
The merger, originally due to take place at the end of January, was
postponed until March 20, because insufficient firms had come forward to act
as market-makers; there were also technical problems.
Liffe yesterday made a provisional allocation of 'D' shares which entitle
holders to trade stock and stock index options on the new exchange. The
final allocation will be made once the merger has become legal.
There is still some concern that the vested interests which hindered
progress on the merger from the start may continue to divide the market. In
particular, four of the most active firms in the underlying market -
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, County NatWest, Smith New Court and Warburg - will
not be acting as market-makers. These firms had pushed for a move from
open-outcry trading to a screen-based system, a proposal which met strong
opposition from other quarters.
Although they will not be involved as market-makers, these firms will act as
principal traders and could contribute substantial liquidity since they hold
around a dozen seats each. Each seat is equivalent to one trader on the
floor.
Kleinwort Benson, which had also advocated screen-based trading, surprised
some market participants when it volunteered last week to become a
market-maker. Mr Bruce Froud, head of equity derivatives at Kleinwort, said
the decision to make markets was 'economically a sensible decision in the
medium-term'.
Due to the nature of the market, volume in individual stock options is
expected to remain volatile. 'If there is takeover speculation affecting a
particular stock, market-making will shift to where the action is,' one
trader said.
The mood among traders yesterday was generally optimistic, after weeks of
speculation that the merger might not go ahead. Provided confidence in the
effectiveness of the market improves, the relatively small number of
market-makers could provide enough liquidity to get the market started,
according to most traders.
'I think you could see average daily volume in the FT-SE option (which
currently trades around 8,000 contracts a day) rise in excess of 30,000
contracts,' said Mr Richard Harris, head of derivative trading at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe, pointed to the 'high degree of
expertise' among the market-makers. However, he admitted that if volume in
the market failed to pick up following the merger there was still a chance
there would have to be a shift to another system. He said a screen-based
system was still an option.
Also under consideration is a 'negotiated price' market, like the system
used on the American Stock Exchange, where one nominated market-maker who
runs the book for a particular contract.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: US issuers expected to extend
business domination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US COMPANIES have dominated the new international equity business so far
this year and are expected to continue tapping the capital markets during
the first quarter of 1992.
According to one estimate, between 100 and 125 US deals, including initial
public offerings and domestic issues, are expected by the end of February.
The largest deal announced so far is the Dollars 1.25bn equity issue for
Chemical Banking, the bank resulting from the merger of Manufacturers
Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank. The funds are intended to strengthen the
bank's capital position.
Goldman Sachs is the lead-manager, with Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and
Morgan Stanley acting as co-leads. Chemical Banking has registered to issue
up to 50m shares, of which 5m will be offered internationally.
International Paper, the US forest products group which has expanded
aggressively in Europe in recent years, plans to reduce its gearing by
raising about Dollars 560m.
The company is issuing 8m new shares, 1.5m of which will be offered to
international investors.
Credit Suisse First Boston is the lead manager, with Goldman Sachs as
co-lead.
USX-Marathon Group, the US group which includes the operations of Marathon
Oil, is hoping to raise Dollars 440m for a capital expenditure programme.
Lehman Brothers is the lead manager for the issue which consists of 20m
shares, including a 4m international tranche.
USX-Marathon and USX-US Steel resulted from a stock split by USX, the
Pittsburgh-based steel and natural resources group, last year.
Hospital Corporation of America, a hospital management group, has announced
an initial public offering of 34m shares to raise Dollars 700m. Of these,
6.8m shares will be offered internationally.
The company was taken private in a management-led buy-out in 1989 but is now
seeking a New York listing.
The proceeds will be used to pay outstanding debt and the management will
keep a 66 per cent stake in the company. Goldman Sachs is the lead manager
for the issue.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Bonds: EIB deals in dollar, yen sectors arouse
controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW Eurobond issues continued to emerge at a brisk pace yesterday, despite a
further sell-off in the US Treasury market, with activity concentrated in
dollars and yen.
The European Investment Bank launched deals in both sectors, both with
reduced fees, arousing some controversy among market participants.
The EIB launched a Dollars 400m offering of 10-year bonds via IBJ
International, structured as a block trade; that is, the full underwriting
risk was taken by IBJ, with only a small selling group.
The pricing of the issue, at a spread of just 6 basis points above the
10-year US Treasury, took account of the substantial tightening in spreads
particularly in supranational names which benefit from tax-exempt status in
Italy.
The EIB's last dollar offering, a 10-year deal launched before Christmas,
has been bid just a couple of basis points above the US Treasury yield.
However, dealers point out that there has been a technical short in that
bond, partly because of use in the repo market.
In the Euroyen market, the European Investment Bank's Y60bn issue of 5 per
cent bonds, due 1995, was considered fairly priced, and dealers welcomed a
new three-year benchmark.
However, the structure of the transaction proved controversial. The deal,
arranged by Nikko, consisted of a small co-lead group of underwriters and a
selling group. The fees were undisclosed, but according to market sources
were cut to 10 basis points, a substantial reduction.
Nikko pointed out that despite the reduced fees, all the participants made
money on the deal, and added that other houses had proposed similar
structures.
However, despite the successful placement of the transaction, some houses
felt that the reduction of fees was a dangerous precedent. The EIB used a
similar structure in the dollar market last year, in an offering arranged by
ABN Amro.
Also in the yen market was a Y50bn offering of 10-year bonds for the Asian
Development Bank which was rather aggressively priced. The two offerings
were the first in the sector this year to be targetted at European
investors.
In the dollar sector, spreads on recent aggressively-priced deals looked set
to widen, but were rescued by further declines in the US Treasury market.
Austria's 12-year deal launched on Monday and priced yesterday met steady
demand and was increased from Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m.
A Dollars 300m 15-year offering for KFW International Finance, via Deutsche
Bank, was launched yesterday for pricing today. The indicated spread is 43
to 45 basis points above the 10-year Treasury.
In the D-Mark sector, the strong performance of a 10-year zero-coupon deal
for LKB Finance prompted an increase from DM500m to DM750m.
A SFr150m issue of subordinated debt for Commerzbank, swapped into floating
rate D-Marks, suffered as a result of over-aggressive pricing, dealers said.
SEGA Enterprises, Japan's largest maker of commercially-used game equipment,
announced a Dollars 200m convertible bond issue yesterday, writes Sara Webb.
The issue attracted some interest as Japanese companies have refrained from
issuing international convertible bonds in recent months and have tended to
launch debt with warrants.
The coupon on the issue will be fixed at between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent
on January 23. Nomura International, lead manager for the convertible,
opened subscriptions for the issue yesterday.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Petrobras considers
international share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETROBRAS, the Brazilian-state controlled oil concern, is considering an
international issue of new shares to raise capital, its financial director
said in London yesterday.
Mr Carlos Thadeu de Freitas Gomes, whose company is launching a new Eurobond
this week to raise Dollars 150m, said the issue of equity would come once
the company had exhausted its potential to issue international debt.
That would not happen before the middle of the year. However, an issue of
new equity - of as yet undetermined magnitude  - was possible later in the
year, probably through American depositary receipts so that the shares would
be easily tradeable in the US. He said he believed the federal government in
Brasilia would favour such an issue.
Latin American companies, particularly from Mexico, have over the past 12
months raised significant sums through the issue of shares in the
international market on the back of sharply rising stock markets. The
Brazilian market has continued a strong performance in the first two weeks
of this year.
Over 81 per cent of voting capital and 51 per cent of total share capital of
Petrobras, Brazil's largest company in terms of revenues and assets, is
currently held by the federal government.
Its shares have accounted for over 6 per cent of the trading volume in the
Brazilian market over the last three years.
Mr de Freitas Gomes told a conference, organised by the investment group
Stephen Rose and Partners, that Petrobras's investment programme envisaged
the spending of Dollars 2.91bn this year, up from Dollars 2.41bn in 1991.
This would rise to Dollars 4.4bn in next year, Dollars 5.7bn in 1994 and
Dollars 6.1bn in 1995.
Company projections showed production reaching just under 1.5 barrels per
day by the year 2000, accounting for 83 per cent of Brazilian demand,
against average output of 650,771 bpd in 1991, 57 per cent of demand.

fund talks

<TEXT>
THE Philippines is negotiating with multilateral lending agencies and
foreign governments to create a Dollars 100m investment fund for private
companies carrying out projects under the country's build-operate-transfer
(Bot) scheme, Reuter reports from Manila.
Under the Bot scheme, private investors undertake capital-intensive
infrastructure projects, turning them over to the government later.
The planned revolving credit facility would fund 20 per cent to 30 per cent
of the total cost of a project, said Mr Rogelio Singson, director of the
committee overseeing the Philippine Assistance Programme.
'It will send a clear message the government is behind the Bot programme,'
he said. The fund, to be run by state-owned Development Bank of the
Philippines, is meant to be in place by the second half of 1992, he said.
Manila has approached the World Bank, International Finance Corp, the Asian
Development Bank and the US and Japanese governments for funding, he said.
Guidelines for the programme were expected by June.
The Philippines is encouraging the Bot programme due to a lack of government
resources.
'One of the ways of minimising the load is for the government to allow
private investments in infrastructure projects,' Mr Jesus Estanislao,
finance secretary, told a forum on Bot and privatisation.

THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to launch yen-settled D-Mark/yen futures

currency futures and options not settled in dollars.
Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said: 'We are responding to the fact that,
more and more, the dollar is not the centre-piece of international
transactions.'
The exchange said it will wait to see how the D-Mark/yen contract succeeds
before it launches two other similar cross-rate currency contracts -
pound/D-Mark and D-Mark/Swiss franc  - for which is has approval from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry regulator.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the CME's traditional rival, announced it will
suspend listing new futures and options contracts in mortgage-backed
securities. Four such contracts traded poorly last year.
The CBOT said it would move mortgage-backed futures and options to its
upcoming local-area network electronic trading system, called Project A.
Project A, still under development, is to be used for low volume or
non-conventional products during regular trading hours.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chase Manhattan submits bid for
troubled NY thrift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHASE Manhattan, the US money centre bank, has submitted a bid to acquire
insolvent Crossland Savings, a troubled New York thrift, said Mr Michael
Esposito Chase, chief financial officer, Reuter reports.
'We have submitted a bid,' he said. 'It would be a pick-up of core deposits
if we are successful.'
Last summer, regulators said they were trying to sell Crossland, and a deal
is expected to be announced soon.
Republic New York has said it would be interested but has not said if it has
bid for Crossland, which was hurt by real estate loans.
Turning to the bank's performance, he said that, over the next quarter or
two, Chase would 'probably run a fairly high provision' for loan losses, but
he hoped there would be some tapering-off after that.
Mr Esposito said he hoped the provisions for loan losses would not be in
excess of the fourth quarter's Dollars 315m.
He stressed that problem commercial real estate continued to be a drag on
Chase's earnings.
In the fourth quarter, he said, Chase saw the first decline in commercial
real estate problems in six quarters.
'We have seen quite a bit of moderation here. It looks like we are working
through this difficult situation . . . we're starting to think we are seeing
the light at the end of the tunnel.'
Mr Esposito said that Chase had strong trading revenues in the fourth
quarter and sees those continuing into the first quarter.
In foreign exchange trading and trade in such instruments as derivatives,
Chase had a 'very good' quarter, 'and that is continuing into the first
quarter'.
Mr Esposito said Chase's consumer banking operations earned Dollars 450m in
1991, and 'we are looking for an improvement in all our consumer businesses
in 1992'.
He added that among the consumer areas that ought to have better results in
1992 were credit cards and mortgage servicing. Private banking is also
expected to do better.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CERUS, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, has
sold Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse), its majority-owned Geneva-based fund
management arm, to Banque Worms de Financement et d'Investissement (BWFI),
the Swiss subsidiary of Banque Worms of France.
Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse) sprang to fame last August following claims
that it had been the subject of a highly complex attempted fraud involving
L100bn (Dollars 83.75m) of Italian shares.
Despite continuing investigations by Swiss and Italian authorities, the case
of the allegedly 'missing' shares has not yet been resolved. Court action by
Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse) is also still pending.
The sale of the bank's fund management activities will not affect those
actions, as a small rump of the bank, covering corporate finance business,
will remain.
Nor will the sale affect the L100bn guarantee promised by Banque Dumenil
Leble, the bank's French parent company.
The acquisition will roughly triple the size of the funds managed by BWFI,
which is thought to have had between SFr300 and SFr400m (Dollars 283.6m)
under management before the deal. No price for the transaction has been
disclosed.
However, an official in Milan said BWFI had made a payment in respect of
both the funds under management and goodwill.
Fiat Auto, the car-making division of the Fiat group, will show a profit in
1991, according to managing director Mr Paolo Cantarella.
He said the poor performance of the British, French and Spanish car markets
in 1991 was offset by gains in the German market, which had expanded after
reunification.
However, the outlook for 1992 depended on the recovery in markets that
showed a weak performance last year.

bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE OF Canada's largest shopping mall landlords have threatened to force
Grafton-Fraser, a leading clothing retail group, into bankruptcy following a
court order protecting Grafton from its creditors.
The action reflects the growing strains between retailers and landlords
throughout North America caused by the protracted slump in consumer
spending. According to one Toronto real estate expert, shopping centres are
facing growing demands from hard-pressed tenants to renegotiate or delay
rent payments.
Grafton, which is suffering heavy losses, was granted a court order last
month protecting it from its creditors while it restructures its business.
The company is closing 107 of its 241 stores.
An action by the landlords seeking to overturn the court order and put
Grafton into bankruptcy is scheduled to be heard on January 23.
Grafton is continuing to pay rent on its stores. But a senior executive of
one of the landlord companies expressed concern yesterday at the growing
tendency among retailers to use a restructuring as an opportunity to 'cherry
pick' among shopping mall locations.
The landlords fear that retailers will, in this way, seriously undermine the
viability of some marginally profitable shopping centres.
He noted that some landlords borrowed heavily and provided generous
inducements to persuade retailers to move into new malls during the mid and
late-1980s. The landlords making the application against Grafton include
Cambridge Shopping Centres, Cadillac Fairview, Marathon Realty and Trilea
Centres.
Mr John Hick, Grafton's president said the company would strongly resist the
landlords' move. He said that if the landlords succeeded with their motion,
any possibility of a restructuring to save jobs and stores would be lost.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Colgate polishes its performance
 -Mr Reuben Mark, the company's chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a very busy few months for Mr Reuben Mark, chairman of
Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products business best known for its
Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive soap.
In quick succession, the company has announced plans to close or reconfigure
25 of its 91 factories around the globe; has made the first public offering
of stock in its history; has unveiled plans to enter the vast Chinese market
and bolster its position in eastern Europe; and has made a small but
significant acquisition in the the oral health care field.
There are rumours on Wall Street that it may be considering another, larger
takeover.
All this is a far cry from the mid-1980s when Colgate itself was seen as a
potential candidate for a bid, having some excellent brand names but a
reputation for stodgy bureaucracy and lacklustre results. The 186-year-old
company had lost its way in the 1970s when it diversified into unrelated
fields, such as sporting goods and food.
However, a bid never materialised and, in the seven years since he took over
as chief executive, Mr Mark has transformed Colgate into a much leaner, more
focused and profitable company.
Although the performance has impressed Wall Street, analysts suggest just as
hard a test may yet be to come, as the company faces intensified competition
around the world from the Anglo-Dutch Unilever and America's Procter &amp;
Gamble, which are much larger than Colgate and have reputations for greater
aggression.
Aged 53, Mr Mark has been with Colgate throughout his 28-year career since
gaining a Harvard MBA. Yet he seems remarkably untouched by the stuffiness
which can afflict senior executives in global organisations.
He has a disarmingly informal style and irreverent sense of humour, and
wears what is left of his hair distinctly longer than the conventional
businessman. His interests include a non-executive directorship at Pearson,
the British company which owns the Financial Times.
The revolution at Colgate in the second half of the 1980s involved getting
out of unprofitable businesses and focusing on just five areas.
Four of them have a natural fit: oral care, where it is the world toothpaste
leader, with a market share of over 40 per cent; body care, mainly through
the Palmolive brand name; household surface care, led by the Ajax brand; and
fabric care. The fifth, prescription food for pets, just happens to have
very high margins and be growing strongly.
The company's gross profit margins leapt from 39.2 per cent in 1984 to 45.2
per cent in 1990, while return on sales rose from 3.2 per cent to 5.6 per
cent, helped by the closure of inefficient factories, a greater emphasis on
high margin products, and simplification of Colgate's structure.
Just over a year ago, Mr Mark outlined an ambitious set of goals for
1991-1995, including 13 to 19 per cent annual increases in earnings per
share, on top of a 17 per cent annual rise over the past six.
That is to be achieved through strong volume growth, focusing on
higher-margin products, further cost-cutting (such as the current plant
rationalisation) and making the company's culture more entrepreneurial - a
complex task, given its far-flung global nature.
Many Wall Street analysts argue that Colgate has been more successful over
the past few years at rationalising the business than growing it. They say
that to achieve these targets, it needs more new product introductions and a
more powerful marketing punch, particularly in the US.
Mr Mark dismisses this as so much 'bull'. US analysts, he argues, tend to
focus too much on the US - where Colgate is usually overshadowed by P&amp;G - a
market which only makes up a third of the group's sales. They do not look
closely enough at the strengths of its global marketing network.
He points out that Colgate's share of the world toothpaste market has grown
from 29 to 43 per cent over the past decade. The only field in which it has
lost market share - the cut-throat detergents business  - has been the
result of a deliberate and successful plan to boost profits.
In the US, moreover, the company is launching a range of new products, 'so I
think you will find by the end of 1992 that that criticism is stilled'.
'The analysts,' he adds, 'keep asking 'where are the home runs?' But it's
not a question of home runs. It's the classic thing of doing a thousand
things 1 per cent better.'
'We're not going to discover the AIDS cure, we're not going to discover the
baldness cure. It's just that all these thousands of people around the world
are truly getting better - doing their jobs a little better, marketing a
little better, financing a little better - and that cumulative effect keeps
throwing off more profit.'
Some of its fastest growth is likely to come in the oral health care field.
Colgate wants to use its global dominance in toothpaste to ride a trend
among developed nations to more sophisticated, quasi-medical dental
products, offering higher margins.
For example, it has strengthened its presence in the 'professional' market -
products sold to dentists  - through a string of acquisitions, and last
October it bought the international business of Plax, the anti-plaque
mouthwash business, which claims to be the market leader outside the US.
It will also continue the painstaking task of building brand loyalty in the
developing world, where it spends some Dollars 20m a year on dental
education. The world oral care market, says Mr Mark, is far from mature,
with demand growing by between 4 and 6 per cent a year in the developing
world, and about double that in the West.
Last November's stock offering, which raised some Dollars 400m, brings the
company's debt-to-capital ratio down from around 51 per cent to 35 per cent.
This, Mr Mark says, is 'a little on the low side, but we want to have a
little reserve capacity to do what we think is right'.
Wall Street expects that to include more takeovers. Mr Mark will not be
drawn, but stresses any future acquisitions will only be in core businesses
and will either help give global dominance in a key business or give
critical mass to a local company.
He says: 'You will not see a bet-the-bank acquisition at Colgate. . . things
are going well, so there's no need to bet the bank'.

at A&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDER &amp; Alexander, the world's second largest insurance broker, said it
expected to make losses in the fourth quarter and 1991 overall after taking
a Dollars 75m charge to cover restructuring and asset write-downs.
The company said it planned to sell certain 'non-core operations' during the
first three months of 1992, including a non-broking business in the
Netherlands and a Florida operation that administers workers' compensation
self-insurer funds.
It said the sales should generate about Dollars 57m, reducing to about
Dollars 40m after tax.
A&amp;A, which has seen net profits slide from Dollars 34.9m to Dollars 24.8m in
the first three quarters of 1991, said more than half the special charge
relates to restructuring costs. This principally affects the US operations,
where the company has the largest concentration of offices at present.
The company said it planned to divide offices into three main categories:
those handling global accounts, which would be concentrated in 16 cities;
regional centres which would look after small commercial business; and
'middle market' offices, concentrating on national and regional business,
and focusing on certain specialised areas such as health care and energy.
It declined to say how many jobs would be affected, but suggested that this
should not exceed the rate of job losses seen over the past three years -
about 400 a year. The company said that it was maintaining its regular
quarterly dividend at 25 cents a share.
A&amp;A has had a particularly painful year, with flat commissions, a slow turn
in the property/casualty cycle, and declining investment income.
Cost-containment has, therefore, become a high priority.

reorganisation
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMES DEPARTMENT Stores, the US discount stores group which went into
bankruptcy almost two years ago, has filed an 'all equity' reorganisation
plan, writes Nikki Tait.
The scheme envisages that Ames's creditors would exchange their claims for
Dollars 352.5m in cash, plus stock in the reorganised company.
Unlike many bankrupt companies, Ames does not plan to issue new debt
securities as part of the reorganisation attempt. Senior creditors will
finish with about 47.1 per cent of the equity, general unsecured creditors
with about 45.7 per cent and bondholders with 7.2 per cent.
Making various assumptions about the value of the company's new shares, the
scheme is reckoned to give senior creditors about 64 cents on the dollar and
unsecured creditors about 39 cents on the dollar.
Total estimated claims against Ames, when the company filed for bankruptcy
in April 1990, were put at Dollars 1.6bn. Ames has pruned its operations
sharply, closing over 300 outlets.
The plan received a conditional endorsement from unsecured creditors. But
the company added that it was contingent on the successful negotiation of a
new Dollars 200m seasonal working capital facility, to replace Chemical
Bank's revolving credit line.

FORD Motor of the US paid out Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn in consumer and

In 1991, Ford paid out 16 per cent of its revenues in marketing costs,
including rebates, as well as advertising and promotional costs, said Mr
Gilmour, an executive vice-president at Ford.
Before the heavy incentives in recent years, Ford's marketing costs usually
ran at about 5 per cent to 6 per cent of revenues, he said.
The situation is even worse in Britain, where Ford paid out 20 per cent of
its revenues in marketing costs last year.

MCDONALD'S, the world's largest fast-food company, announced that Mr Jack
Greenberg, its chief financial officer, has been promoted to vice-chairman.
He will continue as chief financial officer and as a director.
He joined the company in 1982. The chairman, Mr Michael Quinlan, said Mr
Greenberg had, during the past 18 months, put 'even more ketchup in his
veins' - the highest compliment that can be given in McDonald's corporate
culture.
Mr Greenberg has worked in all facets of the restaurant business.
He is expected to shoulder responsibilities in legal issues, government
relations, insurance, licensing, personnel, purchasing, real estate and
construction, in addition to duties on tax and treasury matters and investor
relations and corporate communications.
The company, which now has 12,000 restaurants in 59 countries, has been
struggling against increased competition in the US domestic market. Sales in
its foreign restaurants have been posting double-digit increases, helping to
boost overall results.
For the first nine months last year, net income rose 7 per cent to Dollars
659.2m, compared with the same period in 1990.

Edelstahl, the special steels division of the parent Thyssen group.
'In the light of technical and economic developments over the last year
there is every reason for bringing them together,' Mr Schulz said. A
decision would be made in the summer at the earliest.
Blaming low prices for the second profits fall in succession, he claimed the
company's revenues from steel fell DM60 (Dollars 38) a tonne last year. 'If
you consider that we have volume of 10m tonnes, you can see the problems we
have had to face,' he said.
Although some improvements could be seen, prices were still 15 per cent
below 1989 levels.
Sales fell in all the company's main markets. Even in Germany turnover edged
down from DM6.6bn to DM6.5bn, reflecting weakening demand in the last
quarter.
Group sales in the year to the end of September dropped 8 per cent to
DM10.44bn, and net profits, adjusted for acquisitions, tumbled to DM317m
from DM549m in 1988-1989, the group reported a net return of DM969m on world
sales of DM11.8bn.
Mr Schulz said that in the present circumstances wage increases should be
less than 6 per cent. The company, which employs a third of all Germany's
steelworkers, would not be 'killed' by a strike, he added. He was responding
to threats, later confirmed, that the IG Metall union was to call a strike
ballot following the breakdown of pay talks over a 10.5 per cent claim.

STENA LINE, the Swedish shipping group, expects to make a profit on all
operations this year after a pre-tax loss of SKr300m (Dollars 52m) in 1991.
In an optimistic statement yesterday about Stena's future Mr Lars Erik
Ottosson, chief executive, said that rationalisation measures taken last
year, as well as increased loans and credit facilities, had ensured the
group 'now has a sound and competitive cost structure in all operations'.
But he declined to indicate just how large Stena's profit would be this
year, pointing out this would not be clear until after the end of the peak
summer season which accounts for more than half of annual volume.
Mr Ottosson added that the SKr500m cost savings programme in its ailing
Sealink cross-Channel operations had now been carried out satisfactorily,
along with a wage freeze until 1993 and closure of the Folkstone-Boulogne
route. The investment plans have also been implemented in Sealink, said Mr
Ottosson. The aim now was to utilise the additional capacity, he said. For
this reason, Stena Line viewed the future in a positive light.

strategy

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN bank lenders to Federconsorzi, the Italian farm services group whose
collapse triggered a major financial squall in the capital markets last
year, have defined their strategy before a crucial court meeting later this
month.
Federconsorzi's creditors are due to meet in Rome on January 29 to ascertain
whether there is sufficient support to approve the Concordato Preventivo - a
judicial composition among creditors  - initiated in principle last July.
Foreign banks are owed around L300bn (Dollars 251m) by Federconsorzi, to
which the Italian government appointed special commissioners last May.
Although not state-owned, the company was widely perceived abroad as being
guaranteed by the state. The refusal by the Italian authorities and
public-sector banks to compensate foreign lenders led to severe friction and
a partial boycott of Italian borrowers on the Euromarkets.
Some steps to liquidate Federconsorzi's assets are already under way. A
conditional offer worth L55bn was accepted for Fedital, the group's milk and
dairy products subsidiary, in late December.
Under the strategy now agreed by Federconsorzi's foreign bank lenders, those
banks which lent to the company under English law will give their proxies at
the January 29 meeting to Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Istituto Bancario
San Paolo di Torino.
However, the foreign banks concerned have not yet revealed how they intend
to vote, triggering speculation that the meeting could still prove stormy.
The meeting will establish whether holders of at least two-thirds of
Federconsorzi's borrowings approve of the judicial composition procedure.
Under the composition rules, Federconsorzi's government-appointed management
gained temporary protection from creditors last July.
The meeting this month will determine whether a sufficient number of
creditors are prepared to ratify that strategy.

FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Triple aim within Matra's
European target - The French group is pinning its recovery hopes on a shift
in strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FREDERIC d'Allest, the chief executive of Matra, wants to accelerate what
he calls the 'Europeanisation' of the French diversified missiles and
electronics group while focusing it on three principal core businesses.
'We are no longer looking for diversification. Indeed, we intend to sell
some of the business moves made in the past which no longer fit with our
strategy,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times.
Matra was originally exclusively a defence group specialising in missiles to
equip essentially French Dassault military aircraft. It embarked on a
sweeping diversification programme in the 1970s which turned it into a
defence to watches, electronics and cars conglomerate.
Mr d'Allest now wants the group to concentrate on the three sectors in which
it has gained a leading market position: defence and space;
telecommunications; transport systems and the Espace family vans it has
pioneered in Europe with Renault.
He confirmed Matra intended to withdraw from the electronics car components
business by selling its 35 per cent stake in Ufima, the loss-making joint
venture 65 per cent controlled by the Italian Fiat group.
The French company is also looking for a new partner to join its
telecommunications activities, whose heavy development costs led it to show
a loss in the first half of last year. Mr d'Allest said Matra was
particularly anxious to negotiate alliances to strengthen activities in the
development of equipment for a pan-European digital mobile telephone
network.
Matra wants to expand its telecommunications activities in Europe. But
Europe has also become the prime target, together with the Far East, of the
company's traditional defence business. Defence still accounts for a quarter
of annual sales of nearly FFr25bn (Dollars 4.6bn). However, Matra has had to
contend with a reduction in French government defence spending and a
shrinking market for Dassault military aircraft.
'Our strategy is to look for alliances which will strengthen our market
access. Our traditional markets have been France and the Middle East. Now we
want to be more active in Europe and in the Pacific Rim,' Mr d'Allest
explained.
The Matra chief executive believed the missiles business would grow in
Europe because the market for new fighters would become tighter, putting
greater pressure on refitting existing aircraft with more sophisticated
weapons.
Mr d'Allest is opposed to suggestions that Matra's missiles activities be
merged with those of Aerospatiale, the state-owned aerospace group, as part
of a rationalisation of the French aerospace sector. 'This would not provide
us with access to new markets and I don't see it improving productivity
significantly,' he said.
Instead, Matra hopes to expand its market base by co-operating with defence
companies in other European countries. It has already formed close links
with GEC, and is competing with the UK company for the Ministry of Defence's
contract for short-range, air-to-air missiles.
The satellite space business is another area of growth for Matra. Mr
d'Allest, the former head of the European Ariane space consortium, confirmed
talks to link British Aerospace's space activities with those of the
recently-constituted Matra-Marconi Space joint venture between the French
company and GEC. Matra is also negotiating with Robert Bosch of Germany to
join the new space company.
One of Matra's biggest recent success stories has been the development of
the Espace family van with Renault. Matra is currently producing 300 vans a
day and in a depressed car market has seen Espace sales increase by 20 per
cent last year. Matra's current agreement with Renault runs until the middle
1990s. But the company has already agreed with the French state-owned
car-maker to design and produce a new generation of car later in the decade.
Mr d'Allest said Matra also wanted to address other car market segments. 'We
are looking for one or two other niches,' he added. Matra's car operations
are currently the most profitable component of the group and account for
about 20 per cent of total turnover.
In the mass transit sector, Matra has a strong position with its Val
automated urban rail system which the company developed from
aerospace-derived engineering. However, the Val has not been profitable up
to now although it has sold in France, the US and Taiwan. Mr d'Allest said
the Val business broke even last year but Matra is now looking for a more
sustained level of profitability from this sector. At the same time, the
company is seeking to develop alliances with civil engineering groups to
make the Val more profitable.
After a difficult 12 months, Matra expects to see profits recover this year.
Operating profits fell from FFr719m to FFr 317m in the first half of 1991.

BANCO POPULAR, the smallest of Spain's national commercial banks, yesterday
reported net profits of Pta49.7bn (Dollars 494m) for last year, a 15 per
cent rise on 1990 and what will probably prove to be one of the best bank
performances of 1991.
Popular, which is regularly rated as the world's most profitable bank and
has just been chosen by Euromoney magazine as the world's best managed,
improved its return on average assets last year to 2.01 per cent from 1.87
per cent in 1990.
The bank reported a 17 per cent increase in fee income, reflecting a general
move among big Spanish banks away from their traditional retail strongholds.
Despite a near doubling of bad debt provisions, to Pta18.2bn, the bank
improved cash flow by 7.7 per cent to Pta112.2bn.
Spain's Banco Central Hispanoamericano has reached a deal with Catalan bank
La Caixa to sell its majority stake in property group Inmobiliaria Colonial,
according to the Spanish stock market commission. BCH controls 63.8 per cent
of Colonial.

<TEXT>
PORTUGUESE shareholders in Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), Portugal's third
largest commercial bank, will take a stake in Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto) and buy 3m BTA shares through the market in a move designed to
strengthen the Portuguese nucleus of investors within BTA.
This follows an agreement with Banesto which directly holds just under 10
per cent of BTA. Banesto also has a 49 per cent stake in Valores Ibericos
(VI), a Portuguese holding company, which has a 28.6 per cent stake in BTA.
The other 51 per cent of VI is held by Portuguese shareholders led by Mr
Jose Roquette, BTA president.
Mr Roquette said that the Portuguese shareholders had grouped their forces
in MSF, a holding company, which would receive their 51 per cent stake in VI
in a share transfer. When the share transfer and the purchase of additional
BTA shares were completed, VI, MSF, Banesto and other Portuguese
shareholders would hold about 49 per cent of BTA.
The Portuguese government stills holds 16.15 per cent in the bank. The
reminder of the shares is divided among over 40,000 shareholders.
The new share structure was agreed with Banesto to put an end to months of
uncertainty and disputes about the Spanish bank's intentions towards BTA.
BTA has about 210 branches and is expected to show a profit of Es22bn
(Dollars 157m) for 1991, about double its profits in the previous year.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sharp recovery buoys Howden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern that was brought low by
a contract to supply tunnelling machines to Denmark, showed a sharp recovery
to Pounds 5.81m in pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31.
This compared with Pounds 214,000 last time, which was overshadowed by
tribulations over the Pounds 41m contract to supply four machines to bore
twin rail tunnels under the Great Belt waterway.
Howden said yesterday the dispute with MT Group, its customer, was being
fought out in courts in Denmark and Scotland. It still had not been paid the
Pounds 10m outstanding on the contract. MT's claim for damages exceeded the
Pounds 12m contractual limit 'by a large margin'.
No provisions had been made for either amount. The board had taken this
decision based on legal advice, the insurance position and its substantial
counter claim.
In July Howden announced a 1-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 30.6m to
reduce borrowings of nearly Pounds 76m, compared with shareholders' funds of
Pounds 60.3m at the end of April.
Howden said yesterday that net debt at the half-way stage was about Pounds
45m, gearing of less than 50 per cent. It was being reduced further in the
second half.
Turnover fell from Pounds 148m to Pounds 138.3m. Work on the Great Belt
machines had pushed up the figure in the previous period and their
completion more than accounted for the turnover decline.
Operating profit jumped from Pounds 4m to Pounds 9.1m and interest costs
were reduced to Pounds 3.31m (Pounds 3.78m). As the rights issue cash was
only in for two months, a greater benefit would be felt in the second half.
Howden said the air and gas division, which accounts for 50 per cent of the
business, gave an encouraging performance.
In construction and mining - just over 25 per cent of sales  - Wirth
exceeded expectations.
Defence and aerospace markets had been slowed down by the 'peace dividend',
but the division continued to produce good profits. Processing and packaging
had experienced some softness in demand from food companies.
The interim dividend, which was maintained at 1.59p last time in spite of
0.7p losses per share, is cut to 0.7p. This resumes payments after a passed
final. Interim earnings per share were 2.2p, adjusted for the rights issue.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for Pounds 0.75m loss at
Bucknall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKNALL GROUP, the quantity surveyor and project manager, felt the full
force of recession in the construction industry during its first half and,
as it had warned, tipped into loss.
However, the group was now trading profitably, Mr David Bucknall, chairman,
said yesterday.
Pre-tax losses for the half year to October 31 amounted to Pounds 752,000,
against profits of Pounds 542,000 last time, on turnover down to Pounds
8.59m (Pounds 10.4m). This translated into losses of 5.6p per share against
earnings of 4.4p. No interim dividend is declared (1.3p).
Although Mr Bucknall expected little improvement in UK trading conditions
this calendar year - 'the downward slope of demand is flattening out a bit,
it's approaching the bottom' - the group has sought to stem losses by
trimming costs and becoming more active in overseas markets .By the end of
the current financial year nearly 25 per cent of turnover will come from
outside the UK, double the 1990-91 proportion.
But gearing remains higher than expected at 68 per cent, against 129 per
cent in April 1991. It is likely to stay at about the present level in the
face of sustained pressure on UK margins.

The Greater Nottingham Co-operative Society, one of the largest co-operative

Wholesale Society about a possible merger, writes John Thornhill.
Its incorporation into the CWS would confirm the trend of recent years which
has shown a marked consolidation of the co-operative movement.
The GNCS, which employs about 7,000 people, last year turned over Pounds
381.4m and made operating profits of Pounds 9.4m. It runs 113 grocery stores
and 70 non-food stores and also offers funeral, garage and travel services.

<TEXT>
THE 4,000 pharmacists who hold shares in UniChem, the pharmaceuticals
wholesaler that supplies them, put about Pounds 12.5m - an average of more
than Pounds 3,000 each - into the group's Pounds 35.1m rights issue.
Overall, the 1-for-4 issue was 86.3 per cent taken up, with the pharmacists
participating to a greater degree than expected. UniChem said their combined
interest would come down from 60 per cent, but remain at more than 50 per
cent.
The outstanding shares have been subscribed for at a premium to the 148p
issue price. The share price gained 10p to close at 182p yesterday.
UniChem said it had about Pounds 25m cash in the bank after the issue and
after the Pounds 27m acquisition, for shares and cash, of E Moss, which has
92 retail outlets mainly in the south-east of England.
The group's intention to expand its retail activities had already been
flagged by its bid for Macarthy, which was referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission - a decision is expected within the next few weeks.
UniChem also has plans to expand its wholesaling business in continental
Europe.
The rights issue was accompanied by a pre-tax profits forecast of Pounds 21m
for 1991, compared with Pounds 16.4m.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fall in UK sales behind 46% decline at
Eurotherm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HEFTY fall in UK sales was behind lower-than-expected results at Eurotherm
International, the control equipment and systems group, which reported a 46
per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 7.15m in the
year to October 31.
The decline also reflected net exceptional costs of Pounds 1.86m arising
from redundancy payments.
Eurotherm is, however, raising its final dividend to 4.7p (4.55p) for an
increased total of 7.2p (7.05p). This is covered about 1.5 times by earnings
per share of 10.6p (19.6p).
The results reflected a satisfactory performance, considering the double
digit decline in industrial investment in both the UK and the US, said Mr
Claes Hultman, the new chief executive who joined the group in September.
The decision to increase the dividend was based on confidence in the future
of the group, following the restructuring carried out last year and measures
to cut costs and raise profitability, he said.
In the period concerned, however, the group had found it very difficult to
find cus-tomers willing to spend any money in what had been 'a pretty lousy
year economically,' said Mr Jack Leonard, chairman.
The UK had been particularly affected by the slowdown in industrial
activity. While overseas sales fell marginally to Pounds 117.2m (Pounds
117.2m) turnover in the UK declined by 14 per cent to Pounds 40.6m (Pounds
47.2m), taking overall turnover down to Pounds 157.7m (Pounds 164.4m).
Cost cutting measures have led to savings of Pounds 3m a year, but
redundancies would be an ongoing process while businesses that did not fit
into the new structure would be disposed of.
In addition, tight financial controls were being augmented by steps to raise
profitability, particularly in the UK, by increasing margins and moving out
of low profitability areas.
COMMENT
Investors must be wondering when Eurotherm will be able to put the shine
back on its rather dull performance of late. Strong trading in the first two
months of this financial year was followed by a disappointing December which
has made Eurotherm understandably cautious about prospects for this year.
Having taken a good chunk of costs out of operations and with the new
business structure in place, the focus will be on whether the strategy is
going to work. While management is making encouraging noises about new
markets for its products and the group's ability to raise profitability, it
will probably take at least a noticeable upturn in the UK to prove that the
new structure is going to impact on sales. The chances are that Eurotherm
has a lot to look forward to when industrial activity does pick up. But with
the UK proving slow to come out of recession the pay-off looks unlikely to
come for some time yet. Until there is stronger evidence of these benefits
coming through, the shares have little to recommend them, making a
prospective multiple of 16 on forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m high
enough.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett concentrates on corporate
broking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A move expected in the City for weeks, Hoare Govett, the securities firm,
yesterday cut 60 jobs from its staff of 440, slicing research and market
making in order to concentrate on corporate broking.
The firm, which has been looking for new backers since October when Security
Pacific, its owner, merged with BankAmerica, is in discussions with
potential backers of 'many nationalities, including British', said Mr Peter
Meinertzhagen, chairman.
He described the changes as 'appropriate under any ownership structure', but
they are understood to be crucial for its negotiations with new investors.
Until the SecPac merger, the firm was planning a management buy-out of 51
per cent, and a gradual earnout over 10 years of the balance. The management
hopes to have a stake in any new ownership.
However, Mr Meinertzhagen said yesterday that the management could not -
even after the trimming of the business - finance a full MBO unless it
operated on the bare minimum capital 'which would be unwise'. Capital of
about Pounds 50m is thought to be needed to support the firm's annual costs.
There are three main changes:
The number of stocks researched will fall by 30 per cent, but the firm
estimates that it still covers 80 per cent of the UK stock market's value.
Its eight-strong economics team has been cut to three, and Mr Richard
Jeffrey, the firm's leading economist, departs.
It will stop market making in stocks in which it has less than about 7 per
cent market share - cutting its coverage by 137 to 400 equity, convertible
and ADR stocks.
Its mergers and acquisition department closes, with the loss of some 10 jobs
 -the department had begun to conflict with the interests of the firm's
corporate clients.
Mr Meinertzhagen said that he regarded these activities as expendable for a
corporate broker.
However, some institutions said yesterday that they were puzzled that the
moves appeared to leave the firm part-way between a niche business and a
generalist.
Executives in rival broking houses said that they feared that the burden of
comprehensive coverage was an inescapable consequence of the market's
intense competition, and a fundamental change in its structure since Big
Bang.
In Mr Meinertzhagen's view 'Some of the old past practices are now seen to
be more effective than today's integrated houses. Those don't have the the
ethos of the individual, and Hoare Govett has survived because of that
ethos. This is not nostalgia.'

Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, where turnover for the half year to October 31

The company has cut its costs by Pounds 2.7m, but is still gloomy about the

'There are few prospects of an early comprehensive recovery,' said Mr
Richard Lay, chairman. 'The second half of our financial year will not be
easy and I look beyond 1992 for the beginning of a worthwhile recovery in
our markets.'
Earnings per share came out at 1.22p against 4.11p last time, and there is a
reduced dividend of 1p (2.4p).

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Power Corp awaits end of joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Power Corporation, the Dublin-based property company, saw pre-tax profits
for the nine months to September 30 fall to IPounds 5.1m (Pounds 4.8m),
compared with IPounds 6.68m for the six months to June 30 1990.
Mr Robin Power, chairman, said the results were satisfactory in the light of
the delay in unwinding the company's joint venture with Brent Walker.
He added that agreement had been reached with the Brent Walker board but was
subject to the consent of Brent Walker's bankers, ex-pected in the next few
weeks. A statement would be made once full agreement was reached.
The joint venture covers the Trocadero, in London's West End, the nearby
Island Site, and sites in Los Angeles and Blackpool.
Turnover was IPounds 13.1m, against IPounds 22.7m. Earnings per share were
3.42p (4.44p) and the interim dividend is 2p (1.9p).

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Aerospace Eng dives Pounds 271,000 into
loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional charges of Pounds 391,000 relating to cost-cutting and
reorganisation threw Aerospace Engineering into the red in the six months to
October 31.
The Wiltshire-based specialist engineer reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds
271,000 for the period, against profits last time of Pounds 1.38m. Turnover
declined to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 18.2m).
Mr John Davies, chairman, said the outcome for the second half was 'unlikely
to improve' on the first six months. 'I do not now believe that we will see
any significant upturn in trading during the current year' he stated.
The group has made efforts to reduce borrowings and plans to sell certain
'non-core' assets. Interest charges during the period amounted to Pounds
736,000 (Pounds 609,000).
Losses per share emerged at 0.47p (earnings of 2.55p); the interim dividend
is cut from 1.56p to 0.5p.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Nobo cut to Pounds 62,000 in line with
warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In line with forecasts and as a result of some of the poorest trading
conditions in its history, Nobo Group, the office products company, reported
sharply reduced interim profits, down from Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 62,000
pre-tax.
The figure for the six months to October 31 was hit by a Pounds 227,000
exceptional charge for compensation to a senior director who left the group.
Turnover was down 23 per cent from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 9.92m, with office
furniture being worst affected. Operating profit was down at Pounds 658,000
(Pounds 1.86m), and interest charges were reduced from Pounds 513,000 to
Pounds 369,000.
Earnings per share came out at 0.06p (7.93p). There is a reduced interim
dividend of 1p (2.42p).
The company also announced that Mr Reg Barr, executive chairman, was to
become non-executive chairman.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Poor response for Cluff rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cluff Resources has failed to find many takers for its Pounds 8.4m,
11-for-20 rights issue. More than 60 per cent was left with
sub-underwriters.
Kleinwort Benson Securities, Cluff's advisers, said acceptances had been
received in respect of 9.7m new ordinary shares, representing 37.8 per cent
of the total offered to shareholders at 34p each. Last night the shares
closed 1p up at 32p.
Hutchison Group, which owns 24.6 per cent of Cluff, had irrevocably
undertaken to take up its entitlement, suggesting shareholders took only
13.2 per cent.
The cash raised will be used to develop a new gold mine in Ghana, which the
company said was another step in its transformation into an old-style mining
finance house focusing on Africa and gold.
At present its income comes from gold mines in Zimbabwe.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Burndene shares show 50% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Burndene Investments yesterday rose by almost 50 per cent to 175p,
the highest level for almost three years, following the announcement of
annual pre-tax profits ahead by 14 per cent, writes Nigel Clark.
The increase was the result of a second half recovery at Willerby Caravans
and a continued improvement at Pretty Legs, the hosiery manufacturer.
Mr David Caldow, chairman, said that the weather had played an important
part in the results.
Following two warm summers the more typical weather in the first part of
1991 helped the hosiery side while the sunnier climate from the third week
of July onwards came in time to boost the caravan business.
He added that Willerby had a 'most creditable performance' in difficult
market con-ditions and succeeded in increasing its share of a reduced
market.
In the first quarter of the current year sales of caravan holiday homes were
slightly higher while the hosiery division had maintained sales. However, on
prospects Mr Caldow said that they were governed by the rate of recovery in
the UK economy and the weather.
Pre-tax profits for the year to September 28 were Pounds 4.33m (Pounds
3.81m) and followed interim results of Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 2.19m).
Divisional breakdown showed that caravan manufacturing and park operating
contributed Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 3.31m) with Pounds 686,000 (Pounds 219,000)
from hosiery.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 47.3m (Pounds 49.3m) and the pre-tax figure was
struck after lower net interest costs of Pounds 576,000 (Pounds 730,000).
From earnings per share of 29.31p (24.88p) directors are proposing an
increased final dividend of 6.5p for an unchanged total of 8.5p.

FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Royal Life maintains bonuses on endowments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL LIFE, the life arm of Royal Insurance, has maintained the bonuses on
its endowment savings policies.
Final pay-outs on 25-year term policies increased by 12 per cent, the
highest increase recorded by a life company so far this year. However,
Royal's performance on 25-year policies is still a long way behind its
competitors - using standard industry assumptions, a 25-year Royal Life
policy now pays out Pounds 55,062, while Commercial Union announced last
week that an exactly equivalent policy would pay out Pounds 65,596.
Pay-outs on 10-year policies fell 5 per cent, in line with an almost
universal trend in the industry. Royal Life appears to agree with the theory
expressed by Norwich Union when it announced its bonuses last month that
investment returns will be lower in the next decade, thanks in part to the
discipline of membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Mr Icki Iqbal, actuary for Royal Life, said: 'We may be entering a decade of
low inflation, with consequently lower investment returns. Any reduction in
bonus rate that is brought about by an era of stable money must be seen as
good news for customers.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / US legal actions against PPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE SEPARATE US legal actions against directors and auditors of Polly Peck
International have emerged, adding a further twist to the complex legal
disputes already surrounding the collapsed fruit and electronics group.
'We want the money we paid back plus damages,' said Mr Walton Bade, a lawyer
acting for Lindner Fund, a Louisiana mutual fund which lost Dollars 7m
(Pounds 3.9m) on investments in the group.
Mr Bade said that if successful, his action might have a direct bearing on
Polly Peck's main US asset, PPI Del Monte, the pineapple export business
bought by Polly Peck in 1989 and which the administrators are planning to
float on the New York Stock Exchange this year to raise funds to pay
creditors.
Lindner has brought actions against all the directors of Polly Peck
International and its auditors, under two separate sections of the US
Securities Act covering fraud and the filing of false or misleading reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is claiming punitive
damages.
Lindner Fund has also launched personal bankruptcy proceedings against Mr
Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, in a New York federal court. Mr
Nadir was declared bankrupt in the UK two months ago.
The Lindner action is not the first to be brought in the US. Last May,
Stull, Stull &amp; Brody, a New York law firm, launched a class action against
Mr Nadir and the company on behalf of other US shareholders.
In London yesterday the central bank of the internationally unrecognised
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus lost a High Court application to get a
freezing order on its assets relaxed to allow it to withdraw funds from
deposits held in the UK. The bank is one of seven defendants in an action
brought by the administrators of Polly Peck to recover company funds. Five
defendants, including the bank, have been served a freezing order on their
assets.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Air France close to deal with Sabena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE expects to clinch a partnership agreement with Sabena this year
and open the way for the development of Brussels into a new European airline
hub.
Mr Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman, confirmed yesterday that the
French flag carrier was ready to invest FFr700m (Pounds 72m) in Sabena in
return for a 37 per cent stake in the Belgian airline.
Although talks between Air France and Sabena remain suspended because of the
uncertain political situation in Belgium, Mr Attali said he was 'quite
hopeful' that the negotiations would end successfully.
Air France emerged as Sabena's favoured partner after talks between the
Belgian airline and British Airways collapsed last year.
After failing to reach an agreement with Sabena, BA has turned its attention
to negotiating an even more ambitious partnership with KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines and Northwest, the US carrier in which KLM has a 20 per cent stake.
BA has so far refused to comment on its talks with KLM which are understood
to be at a sensitive stage.
The complexity of the proposal to create a new global airline partnership
between BA and KLM modelled on the Anglo-Dutch Unilever and Royal Dutch
Shell conglomerates is expected to entail several more weeks of discussions.
Both the Air France-Sabena and the BA-KLM negotiations reflect the scramble
by international airlines to develop significant partnerships and position
themselves in an increasingly global and deregulated airline market.
Apart from the proposed alliance with Sabena, Air France has already
completed a series of strategic agreements and acquisitions including a
co-operation pact with Lufthansa, an investment in CSA of Czechoslovakia,
and the acquisition of the French carriers Air Inter and UTA.

FT  15 JAN 92 / AT&amp;T, Dutch PTT in Ukraine deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph and state-owned PTT Telecom of the
Netherlands have formed a joint venture with the Ukraine government to
modernise and operate the long-distance and international telecommunications
network in the former Soviet state.
The deal represents a significant expansion in eastern Europe for both
companies, particularly for AT&amp;T, the biggest US long- distance telephone
operator, which will own 39 per cent of the venture. The Dutch company will
hold 10 per cent and 51 per cent will be owned by the Ukraine's state
committee of communications.
AT&amp;T, which has been expanding rapidly outside America and wants to become
the leading global telecommunications company, said this was the first time
it would play a leading role in building and operating a long-distance voice
network outside the US.
The Ukraine venture has two main elements.
One involves building, owning and operating a new international network. At
present international communications to and from the state is routed through
Moscow on 150 circuits. Ukraine's state communications committee is adding
60 new circuits - 30 to western Europe and Israel via PTT Telecom's
Amsterdam facilities and 30 to North America.
The second element involves building and operating a long-distance network
connecting 13 of the Ukraine's 25 telephone districts. AT&amp;T's main financial
commitment to the joint venture will take the form of 13 switching systems
to link the regions.
PTT Telecom's stake will take the form of an unspecified sum in hard
currency.
Both foreign investors see big opportunities in the Ukraine, which has a
population of 52m people and already has 7m telephone lines, high by the
standards of the former Soviet Union. The government wants to have 22m lines
in service by the turn of the century and the joint venture will work on
plans to double the number of local lines to 13m.
For PTT Telecom, which is 100 per cent state-owned but operates at arms
length from the Dutch government, the Ukraine deal represents a further step
to expand internationally and overcome the limited size of its home market.
PTT Telecom also has a presence in Czechoslovakia, where it has set up a
consultancy joint venture to help the country build a modern telephone
system. AT&amp;T has been building its business in eastern Europe over the past
two years, with the emphasis on Poland. In October it inaugurated a direct
dial service between Armenia and the rest of the world.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Japanese derivatives to be reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo Stock Exchange has announced that a task force will be established
to 'reform' the country's stock derivatives markets, a move which could hurt
foreign securities houses.
TSE officials said they want to tighten control over stock index futures and
options trading, which it claims are the source of violent price movements
and enduring weakness in the cash market. Foreign securities houses have
been particularly successful in these areas and lead their Japanese
competitors in expertise.
Mr Minoru Nagaoka, the TSE president and an increasingly strident critic of
derivatives, said the futures market was designed for hedging purposes, but
'it has been used primarily for speculation' and has caused unnecessary
disruption to the cash market.
He said the taskforce, whose membership is yet to be decided, would be
jointly established with the Osaka exchange (OSE), Japan's second largest,
and is expected to recommend new controls and changes to format of the
products.
A UK broker welcomed the appointment of a taskforce in the belief that the
TSE investigation will conclude that tighter controls are a mistake and that
derivatives are not the cause of stock price weakness in Tokyo: 'It is
better that they study the system than make rash changes.'
Foreign brokers have already criticised Japanese exchanges' attempts to
tighten control over stock index futures and options trading by increasing
margin deposit requirements on three occasions last year. TSE officials had
justified these moves by suggesting that the large trading volumes in these
areas have 'confused' the cash market.
Mr Nagaoka said the 'abnormal trading imbalance' was shown by the fact that
daily average turnover for stock index futures on the TSE and OSE last year
was Y2,300bn (Pounds 10bn), more than five times the amount of turnover on
the Tokyo market's first section.
He argues that the huge volume of arbitrage-related trading between futures
and cash stocks is causing unnecessary price fluctuations, and that this
volatility is discouraging participation by individual investors.
The Tokyo market has been weak since the frenzied buying of late 1989, when
the Nikkei stock average peaked at 38,915.87 and the collapse of Japan's
financial 'bubble' is generally reckoned to have begun - the Nikkei average
closed yesterday at 21,775.13.
Investor confidence has been hurt in the past year by the spate of stock
market scandals, by fears of a collapse in property prices, by concerns
about the health of financial companies and, more recently, by a decline in
business confidence that has accompanied the slowing of economic growth.
The market downturn has badly bruised the leading Japanese brokers, which
reported profit falls of 64 per cent and more for the first half to the end
of September, but the Tokyo operations of some foreign houses have profited
from their expertise in derivatives. Salomon Brothers, the US house,
reported a 74 per cent increase in operating income for the first half.
A heavy-handed attempt to control the derivative markets could become a
source of trade friction between Tokyo and Washington, which has shown
increasing anger at what it considers to be the unnecessarily slow pace of
financial reform in Japan.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Stakis seeks to extend debt pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAKIS, the UK hotels and health care group where a rescue is in progress
under chairman Sir Lewis Robertson, is to negotiate with its bankers an
extension of a standstill agreement on repayment of Pounds 192m debt.
This follows its decision not to sell 19 casinos which it had hoped would
raise Pounds 100m. Sir Lewis said it had not been possible to sell the
casinos at an acceptable price and Stakis would keep them for their
'generally strong and dependable cash flow'.
Stakis yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 47.4m for the year to
September 30 after exceptional costs of Pounds 43.7m which were announced
with the interim results in June. These involved a Pounds 32.2m write-down
on property developments and other assets, and Pounds 11.5m of provisions
for restructuring.
In 1989/90, Stakis reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 30.6m including
disposal profits of Pounds 18m.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations. Stakis is paying a
final dividend of 0.45p making a total for the year of 0.9p compared with
2.70p in 1990. Interest paid was Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 8.9m).
Stakis embarked on a recovery programme last June after sacking Mr Andros
Stakis, son of the company's founder Sir Reo Stakis, as chief executive. It
decided to concentrate on hotels and nursing homes and withdraw from some
leisure activities while planning a phased withdrawal from property.
The company last month installed Mr David Michels, a former executive of
Hilton International, as chief executive. It has raised Pounds 30m by
selling its pubs, restaurants and pizza houses, bringing debt down from a
peak of Pounds 215m at the end of September.
The standstill agreement on repayment of Stakis's bank debt expires in
March. Stakis wants to renegotiate it for a further year and Sir Lewis said
that its main banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, had authorised him
to say that they were sympathetic to the renewal. However, Stakis has debts
to 21 banks, some of them overseas. Talks with the banks begin next week.
Sir Lewis said gearing was 63 per cent and that it was 'far better for the
banks to have a going concern than to enter into the uncertainties of
receivership'.
He said all divisions had made operating profits, except property which lost
Pounds 1.1m.
Sir Lewis added that Stakis had surmounted internal problems but because of
the recession, the company's potential was unlikely to be realised 'on a
useful scale' before the end of the current financial year.

FT  15 JAN 92 / BCCI liquidation accelerates: High Court order opens
worldwide sale of assets to repay creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLDWIDE liquidation of Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday moved into full swing as the High Court in the UK issued a winding
up order against one of the group's two main operating arms.
That allows liquidators to begin the process of selling off the group's
assets and repaying creditors some of the Dollars 20bn owed.
The court order also triggers the UK's deposit protection scheme, by which
sterling depositors can claim 75 per cent of their deposits, up to a maximum
of Pounds 15,000.
A similar winding up order against the other substantial part of the group
was expected to be issued later in the day in the Cayman Islands.
It also emerged yesterday that BCCI's liquidators hope to conclude a
compensation deal with Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, by the
end of this month. The deal is expected to involve the Gulf emirate in
paying the group's depositors between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn. In
return, the liquidators would give up certain rights to sue third parties,
including Abu Dhabi itself.
The High Court in London issued a compulsory winding up order against BCCI
SA, the Luxembourg arm of the group which controlled the bank's branches in
various countries, including the UK.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice chancellor, said that the bank was 'plainly
and hopelessly insolvent'.
Earlier applications for a winding-up order, made by the Bank of England,
had been adjourned to allow time for the provisional liquidators, from
Touche Ross, to reach an agreement with Abu Dhabi about compensation. In
court yesterday, Mr Michael Crystal QC, counsel for Touche Ross, said that
the liquidators hoped to conclude a deal by the end of the month. Details
would be revealed when the terms are put to the court subsequently for
approval.
Yesterday's application, brought nearly two weeks after BCCI SA had been put
into liquidation in Luxembourg, was not opposed.
Hearings in the Cayman Islands and Scotland yesterday, and in the Isle of
Man today, had been arranged to coincide with the UK hearing, in order to
move the worldwide operations of BCCI into liquidation at the same time. The
liquidation of the Luxembourg-registered holding company is not expected
until April.
The High Court in London granted legal costs to the provisional liquidators,
the Bank of England, the depositors' group represented in court and former
employees of the bank, to be paid out of money recovered in the liquidation.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Core inflation rate continues to slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S core inflation rate fell further last month, reflecting sluggish
demand but supporting government hopes that upward pressure on prices will
continue to ease.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that in December the
year-on-year rate of increase in prices of goods at the factory gate - the
key measure of core inflation - was the lowest for 2 1/2 years.
In December, prices at the factory gate were only 5 per cent higher than in
December 1990, compared with a rise of 5.1 per cent in the 12 months to
November.
Although the figures provide little evidence of any immediate respite from
the economic gloom, the government believes lower inflation will provide the
platform for higher industrial investment and a recovery later this year.
The latest data suggest many manufacturers are continuing to cut prices to
maintain sales in a climate of fragile demand, while at the same time
benefiting from lower raw material and wage costs.
Stripping out volatile food, drink and tobacco prices, the output price
index rose by 3.8 per cent in the year to December - the lowest rate
recorded since February 1987 when the annual rise was also 3.8 per cent.
It compares with highs of 6.5 per cent in January and February last year.
Last month the cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry
fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent against the previous month, after
a 0.5 per cent rise in November. This left the price index of these
materials down by 1 per cent on the year compared with a 0.4 per cent annual
decline in November.
The fall in the cost of raw materials and fuel reflects the weak demand for
many types of commodities such as oil and metals. The price index for
petroleum products fell by 1.6 per cent on the year, while metals fell by
0.3 per cent.
Mr Gwyn Hacche, an economist at James Capel, said the fall in input prices
should encourage industry as pressures on profit margins eased.
The Treasury was heartened by the figures. It said they showed a continued
reduction in underlying inflationary pressures in the UK economy.
'The producer prices numbers should feed into lower underlying retail price
inflation in the months ahead,' a Treasury official said.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the figures as evidence that
the UK was 'genuinely achieving lower inflation than other European
Community countries'.

FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Life insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's new business figures from Prudential seemed scant justification
for shaving 2p off the shares. The tone of the stock market, after all, was
generally firm and the pattern of healthy single premium sales and static
annual premium growth from the Pru was much as expected.
A more plausible explanation is that investors remain bothered by the
possibility of a Labour government, a factor which has already contributed
to the life sector's underperformance this year. There are several concerns
here, notably that the lucrative personal pension contracts which account
for 45 per cent of the Pru's new UK business, and more than 50 per cent of
Legal and General's, will be badly hit. Labour is clearly committed to
beefing up the state earnings related pensions scheme (serps), and to
limiting the tax relief on pension contributions (presumably to the basic
rate). It is also likely to require better guarantees for those opting out,
something which is unlikely to appeal to pension providers.
The market's reaction is nevertheless curious because most of this has been
known for months and the polls are still inconclusive. There would also be
some pluses with Mr Kinnock at Number 10. A Labour government would probably
introduce a more complex tax system - thereby creating opportunities to sell
some sophisticated new products - while a wider spread of disposable income
might spur sales of standard policies. In the short term, however, the
sector may find it hard to shake off the tag of political risk.

FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's unusual decision by Libya to make a voluntary cut in its oil
production was the second outburst of self-sacrifice within Opec in a matter
of days. As with Venezuela's similar cut, the actual volume of oil is much
less significant than the suggestion that relations within Opec are not
nearly as bad as the market has been assuming. After all, the traditional
pattern for producers is to bump up their production ahead of Opec meetings
in order to make any agreed or forced reductions from a higher base.
It would perhaps be unwise to read too much into the cuts, but they have
helped the oil price to rally from its embarrassing lows last week. For the
main producers, including those outside Opec, that is just as well. If Brent
crude prices were to stick around Dollars 18 per barrel, for example, the
North Sea would barely produce sufficient cashflow to fund this year's
exploration programmes, let alone the sort of safety and maintenance
spending required in 1991.
Yesterday's demand forecasts by the International Energy Agency thus
provided some comfort. Its assumed fall in Russian consumption may not
happen, but, even if it does, demand looks pretty resilient given the weak
world economy and mild winter. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that
Opec will have to come up with much bigger production cuts when it meets
next month if it is to push the oil price up much further. Until then, the
market will continue to be dominated by the traders whose short-term outlook
drove the price down.

FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with declining inflation is that it is a mixed blessing when
nominal interest rates are stuck at a high level. Yesterday's UK producer
price figures showed both a healthy decline - to a year-on-year rate of 3.8
per cent - in underlying output price inflation and a welcome 12-month drop
in input prices. Admittedly the data only cover the manufacturing sector:
services inflation is more stubborn, thanks to the likes of British Rail
with its annual fare increases.
But producer price trends still point in theory to a gentle economic
stimulus from declining manufacturing costs and to scope for an eventual
sharp fall in interest rates as decelerating wholesale inflation feeds
through to the retail level. All the more so, since the annual rate of
producer price increases should fall even more sharply next month as last
January's exceptionally large 1.2 per cent rise falls out of the equation.
Unfortunately membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism means UK interest
rates are affected less by domestic inflation than by their differential
with those of Germany. Recent French experience suggests that is unlikely to
change even if headline UK inflation falls below that of Germany in February
or March. With a showdown over wages looming in the German steel industry,
the Bundesbank is unlikely to start cutting rates soon. Until it does,
declining inflation in the UK will simply mean higher real interest rates.
That in turn is likely to negate any economic benefit from weak commodity
prices.

FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: A new regime for Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,516.3 (+26.2)
The rise in Fisons' share price in response to the abrupt departure of Mr
John Kerridge is thought-provoking. Mr Kerridge and the City had not seen
eye to eye for years; most recently, he has borne responsibility for
blunders in the US. But he is also the man who rescued Fisons and brought it
to a pitch of operating efficiency over the past decade. He leaves the
company searching for a chief executive and in the presumably temporary
hands of a non-pharmaceuticals executive from Unilever.
The sanguine view of the market can perhaps be justified on two counts.
First, the great drawback about Fisons as an investment under Mr Kerridge
was its lack of disclosure. The more open approach promised by his successor
should be worth something on the price in itself. Second, Mr Kerridge was
opposed to the idea of merger. Conceivably, that might change as well.
But there is room for caution here. The notion of Fisons being the target of
a hostile bid was always very doubtful. Even in the world of drug giants, a
starting market capitalisation of Pounds 2.5bn is a formidable proposition,
particularly since Pounds 2.1bn of that consists of goodwill. An agreed deal
with - for example  - ICI might have its attractions; but mergers are by
their nature harder to bring off.
Then again, the shares are perhaps attractive even without a deal. They have
recently taken their worst hammering since the dark days of the 1970s, for
reasons which are public and quantifiable; and even Fisons' harshest critics
never denied the underlying quality of the business.

FT  15 JAN 92 / IG Metall calls steel strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering and metal workers'
union, yesterday backed away from the double-digit pay rise demands which
have been a significant factor behind the Bundesbank's high interest rate
policy.
However, the union also called a strike ballot among its 135,000 steel
industry members, whose 10.5 per cent claim has been rejected by employers.
'We deliberately want to refrain from putting in double-figure claims,' said
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the engineers' leader, who announced a 9.5 per cent
ceiling for regional pay claims this spring by the 4m-strong union.
The recommendation demonstrates IG Metall's awareness that public opinion is
swinging in favour of wage restraint, but the claim is still more than twice
the inflation rate and is almost certain to be rejected by employers,
swamped recently by gloomy forecasts.
The union's engineering branches are due to put in claims in March, when
most forecasters expect Germany's economic downturn to be accelerating.
Gross national product figures, due tomorrow, are expected to show nil or
negligible growth in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter.
The union recognised Germany's economic difficulties, Mr Steinkuhler said,
and its 'recommendation' took account of what was socially desirable and
economically possible and necessary.
In spite of its apparently conciliatory tone, however, IG Metall decided to
go ahead with a strike ballot among its steel industry members.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, deputy head of IG Metall, said steel employers had shown
an unyielding attitude. As a result the steel talks had assumed 'a
significance way beyond that of the sector', but added that the union would
still negotiate.
The talks are deadlocked with an offer of just over 5 per cent tabled by
employers and proposals for more than 6 per cent from the union side. The
strike ballot is due to be held on January 26 when a 75 per cent majority
would be needed to call the workforce out.
Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of the country's largest steelmaker, Thyssen
Stahl, claimed that a settlement of the dispute with steelworkers was
possible, but he insisted it had to be less than 6 per cent.
He underlined his message by revealing a 42 per cent drop in profits, and
announced 2,000 steel job losses at the company this year.

FT  15 JAN 92 / EC set to recognise Yugoslav republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST United Nations peace observers arrived in Yugoslavia yesterday as
the European Community prepared to recognise the breakaway republics of
Croatia and Serbia from today.
In Lisbon, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal, current
holder of the EC presidency, confirmed that all 12 Community members were
expected to meet today's deadline for recognising the two republics.
However, EC differences were underlined when Greece started a diplomatic
campaign to prevent Community recognition of a third Yugoslav republic,
Macedonia, until it drops an implied territorial claim in northern Greece.
Both Mr Deus Pinheiro and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who was
speaking in London, cautioned against exaggerating hopes of a breakthrough
for peace.
In Yugoslavia, hardline statements from both sides echoed this message. In
Zagreb, Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, vowed to recover all
territory lost to Serbia during the last six months of the war.
Mr Tudjman said a full-scale UN peace-keeping force, which could be
dispatched to the area next month, should help ensure that Croatia won back
its territory. If this failed 'the Croatian people, who have succeeded in
defending themselves, will save their entire land', he said.
The UN peace plan sponsored by Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of
state, calls for the withdrawal of the Serb-dominated federal army from
Croatia and the disarming of paramilitary forces.
Mr Hurd, addressing the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, said
that 10,000 UN troops could be sent to the region in three to four weeks'
time. The 50-member unarmed UN advance team which arrived yesterday will
liaise between Croatia and the federal army and help observe the latest
ceasefire.
In spite of official approval from Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, Serb leaders from Croatia have rejected the UN plan. Mr Milan
Babic, the leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in
southern Croatia, said: 'The UN troops will be deployed to stop bloodshed'
but added that they would not disarm Serbs in Krajina.
Mr Hurd attempted to play down any ill feeling in the EC towards Germany for
pushing through recognition of Slovenia and Croatia. Germany had 'held back
for a considerable time' before pressing for recognition, Mr Hurd said.
In Yugoslavia yesterday the truce appeared to be holding but Croatian radio
said one Croat soldier was killed and one wounded in Sibenik, the Adriatic
port.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: The causes of an increased tax burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For Labour's success in drawing attention to the increased tax burden
under the Tories to be condemned by your leader ('Campaigning in earnest',
January 11) as 'remarkably dishonest electioneering', it must have touched a
raw nerve, indeed]
The truth may hurt especially when it collides with conventional wisdom and
the outpourings of the government propaganda machine, but that is no reason
for it to be withheld from public debate.
The causes of the increased tax burden lie in a combination of increased
VAT, national insurance contributions and rates/poll tax, even as marginal
rates of income tax have come down; at the same time rising personal incomes
and the resultant fiscal drag have pushed the average tax burden up, since
marginal income tax rates, though diminished, still exceed the average. But
this simply confirms Labour's contention that economic growth, given our
still elastic tax system, inevitably yields a useful fiscal dividend.
Labour's research, based on official answers to parliamentary questions,
also shows that the rising tax burden hit those on average earnings and
below, while only those on well above average earnings enjoyed a reduction.
Hence, the case in social justice for Labour's proposed national insurance
and tax changes affecting top earners - and the linked increases in pensions
and child benefit.
Incidentally, what is true of household taxation under the Tories also holds
for the corporate sector. While the statutory rate of corporation tax has
fallen from 52 per cent to 33 per cent, the phasing out of initial capital
allowances and other factors have resulted in a near doubling in the
effective rate of tax on non-North Sea industrial and commercial companies:
from 16.6 per cent in 1978 to 28.6 per cent in 1990.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES CALVERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Do the leaders of British industry and commerce really want to climb
out of the recession?
As part of my Politics and East Asian Studies course at Newcastle University
I spent a year at Fukuoka University, Japan, acquiring fluency in Japanese.
Equally valuably, I gained an understanding of Japanese society and culture.
I am now in my final year and I accept that I have much still to learn. I do
not dismiss the many graduate opportunities available, but the typical
graduate recruitment programme does not recognise the particular merits of
employing those who speak Japanese.
Japan is a major economic power, with substantial investments in the UK, and
it offers a vast potential market for UK business. However, something like
three quarters of British companies trading with Japan employ no Japanese
speakers. With one notable public sector exception, I have received no
indication that Japanese is of immediate interest to prospective employers.
Japanese speakers, like other modern language graduates, can make an
immediate contribution to the company they join. The problem with languages
is 'use it or lose it'; but do any captains of industry care?

FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Nothing bilious about Seville
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr EWAN FERLIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reading Peter Bruce's bilious piece ('Revels for a state without a creed',
January 3) on Spain's plans for its 1992 festivities while on a return
flight from Seville, I found his comments on Seville and Andalucia difficult
to understand. Unlike northern Spain, it indeed has little 'smokestack'
industry, but this may be a strength. Instead, there has been expansion of
high-margin agriculture in the countryside, and the service sector in the
southern cities.
The Expo 92 site in Seville will be re-used as a research and development
park. Far from being a 'lethargic, sun-drenched tourist venue' of the 1950s
cliche, Seville is a bustling and self-confident centre of economic
activity.
The problem, if anything, is one of excessive and unsustainable growth (a
nice problem to have]). In the long run, with its combination of high-margin
agriculture, wine, tourism and research and development, Andalucia could
indeed emerge as the California of 21st century Europe.

Sir, The article by Christopher Lorenz ('When service with a smile is

Smaller companies must supply first, only to find no matter how efficiently

FT  15 JAN 92 / Personal View: If it's in the newspaper, it ought to be true
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOWARD DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a saloon bar cliche that every newspaper article one reads on a
subject one knows well is wrong in some important detail. Most such cliches
are themselves inaccurate. Yet personal experience frequently confirms that
newspapers are riddled with errors.
Experience also confirms that it is a waste of time trying to correct errors
in newspapers after the event, as the damage has been done and retrospective
apologies are treated with suspicion or ignored. It is odd that this should
be so, and it reveals a curious case of collective cognitive dissonance.
People who know that what is written about them is wrong are willing to
believe what they read about others.
Most journalists are indifferent to these complaints. If the punters are put
out, they reason, they must be on to something.
Journalists are also aware that they can afford to be indifferent to public
complaints about their competence. Few, if any, newspapers systematically
monitor the accuracy and relevance of the output of their journalistic
staff. They argue, like most professional groups, that it is impossible to
capture the value of their effort in any quantitative way.
Just as doctors wave their shrouds and teachers lock the door to their
secret garden, so the Fourth Estate begins to talk loftily about the
inestimable value of a probing free press, ready to take risks in pursuit of
truth and justice.
Well, up to a point, Lord Copper. Investigative journalism is fine and
dandy, but if the facts are wrong and the 'analysis' baloney, it is not
clear that the frontiers of human knowledge have been advanced very far.
So, along with most professions, journalism is under pressure to raise
standards. But most of this pressure is focused on taste or intrusiveness -
peripheral matters, for the quality press at least. About 90 per cent of
their activity is devoted to reporting the news in, supposedly, an accurate
and informative way. What is needed is a system to monitor its
effectiveness.
Any such system needs to focus first on the individual, not the paper as a
whole. Apart from leaders, most articles are written by an individual
journalist with little amendment thereafter. This makes it a sensitive
exercise. But journalists, with their passion for bylines, should not mind
having their personal successes and shortcomings highlighted.
The starting point should be an assessment of crude output. This is not
simply to ensure that the individual is working. It is clear from other
professions, such as hospital doctors, that accuracy may be influenced by
the volume of work. Newspapers could easily monitor column inches per
working journalist on a weekly basis.
Thereafter, a first qualitative indicator might be the proportion of copy
submitted that is published. A monthly league table would be useful, but
this would not necessarily be a measure of quality: a journalist
consistently producing sensational but erroneous material would score more
highly than a conscientious analyser.
A crude measure of accuracy might be the number of letters and corrections
received in relation to the individual's pieces. But this is unlikely to be
enough since many people regard correcting errors in newspapers as a waste
of time or counter-productive.
So the complaint count needs to be supplemented with robust data. Many
public services do this by surveying their clients and asking for their
views. Newspapers rarely do so, arguing that their indicator of client
satisfaction is the number of newspapers sold. But even in the case of a
quality newspaper, this may be a poor or even inversely correlated indicator
of accuracy.
The people who should be polled are the press officers of government
departments, agencies and companies that supply the raw material on which
the news is based. They are well placed to judge accuracy. Most would be
fair-minded enough not to comment on opinion - which in any case should not
be found in a news report.
There is another element of the performance of working journalists that is
hard to monitor: newsworthiness. Here, clients are less useful, as they are
unlikely to be enthusiastic about stories which appear in advance of the
intended time.
Nonetheless, it should be possible to track the follow-up of journalists'
stories over a period, to assess the extent to which they are breaking news
or simply following the pack.
Here the National Health Service can offer a guide. Progressive doctors
operate a system of peer review in which small groups of colleagues select a
case at random and discuss the way in which one of their number handled it,
including the medical outcome.
Journalism lends itself to this treatment. Journalists can easily identify
the extent to which one of their colleagues has been ahead of the pack in a
particular case. One might select, to take recent examples, the Citizen's
Charter White Paper, or the Soviet coup, and check how many of the moves
were correctly forecast by each political correspondent.
Taking these ideas together, one can see the outline of a robust performance
monitoring system for journalists. In a perfect world, the results would be
publicly available. League tables of political or economic correspondents
would be compulsive reading. Assembling them would give the Press Complaints
Commission something to do. And they might even sell more newspapers.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Contract for electricity supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Newbery is correct to call for increased competition in
electricity generation (Personal View, January 10) but the analysis of the
industry presented is incorrect in one important respect. It is argued that
'future contract prices are likely to approximate the expected pool price'.
This may be the case in competitive markets or where arbitrage is a
possibility but not in the electricity industry where two generators have
significant market power and where contracts tend to be specific and not
widely traded. The generators may wish to limit the supply of such contracts
(or make them expensive) and attempt to restrict the liquidity of the
contract market. Indeed, it could be argued that the premium of the contract
price over the spot (pool) price is precisely a measure of the lack of
competition.
At present this is bad news to many electricity consumers and in particular
to the regional electricity companies which buy large amounts of electricity
at the volatile pool price and sell at a price fixed by regulation. However,
the contract market may also hold the key to increasing the competitiveness
of the industry. What is required is a standardised, transparent contract
market which can be regulated attentively. If generators truly competed in a
liquid contract market pool problems would be reduced significantly. It is a
high contract price, representing the long-term price of electricity, which
would attract entrants to the industry.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Who runs against Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAKES little difference these days whether President George Bush speaks
in Tokyo or Kansas City, or whether his targets are Japanese industrialists
or European farmers, because the message is increasingly the same. He is
running for re-election and he has calculated that he will win with the
great four letter word - jobs. If stealing the clothes of the Democratic
party is a crime, which it is not, the president rivals Fagin.
Given that his popularity continues to fall, if not yet catastrophically,
and that his trip to the Far East was ill conceived and received, this is
hardly surprising. He sets off today on the campaign proper to New
Hampshire, an iconoclastic state featuring an iconoclastic Republican
challenger, Mr Pat Buchanan, with some reason to be nervous. But Mr Buchanan
is not going to be the Republican presidential nominee, nor is the odious
right-winger David Duke, under whatever political guise he finally runs.
Assuming his health holds up, a reasonable post-Tokyo caveat, the president
will be the man to beat. The question is who, and armed with what policies,
will the Democrats run against him.
Although very early days, the increasing presumption is that this could be
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. He seems to be the principal beneficiary
of the non-running of Governor Cuomo of New York and the withdrawal of
Governor Wilder of Virginia; he is better organised, financed and prepared
than anyone else; he is a border southerner, which helps where the Democrats
have become weak, and a Rhodes scholar, which gives him legitimate
intellectual and foreign pretensions, if not actual experience. He is not an
outright protectionist, he knows a bit about education, he is apparently
pragmatic and he speaks well.
Stronger armour
There seem, in sum, fewer holes in his armour than in that of his main
rivals. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska has charisma, but has shown less
substance; Tom Harkin from Iowa, the home state favourite in the first
caucuses next month, has the substance, but it is of the prairie liberal
variety so roundly rejected under the Mondale banner in 1984; Paul Tsongas
could create problems in his own New England in early primaries but is too
much of a muchness with the hapless Michael Dukakis to travel well. A
protracted campaign for the nomination cannot be ruled out, nor therefore
the emergence of a powerful late entrant. But if not Mr Clinton, the current
probability is that the Democrats will field someone like him; bland
perhaps, untested certainly, but not instantly divisive.
Domestic issues
The Democrats start with the advantage that the domestic issues consuming
Americans are, with the important exception of tax levels, their issues,
which is why Mr Bush is trying to steal their protectionist clothes. The
Democrats' weakness, to the extent that the public is exercised, is in
foreign policy, though here again this once overwhelming Bush strength now
looks more fragile than it did last summer. Saddam Hussein still rules Iraq,
Mikhail Gorbachev is gone, the new world order is unmade and the purpose of
overwhelming military might, as the administration itself has conceded, is
now less than imperative. Mr Clinton has been sharp enough to devise one
good counter slogan, neatly embracing all foreign policy concerns without
providing a solution for any of them, that 'national security is largely
economic'.
The battle ground, however, is not only for ideas, but also for people. The
US is a vast and not necessarily homogenous country. Its regions respond to
different political stimuli and so do its whites, blacks, Hispanics and
Asians. The Democrats once understood this complex matrix better than the
Republicans, but the last three presidential elections have been won by
appealing to the mostly white and suburban middle classes. In the US, as in
Britain, after a decade of prosperity this group is in a fractious mood and,
increasingly, not voting. Whoever finds out what they want will be the next
president of the United States.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Parliament as watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE SOLE aim of Mr Frank Field and the parliamentary select committee on
social security which he chairs is to court publicity, they have certainly
achieved it this week. There are two reasons, however, why Mr Field and his
committee were mistaken in summoning the Maxwell brothers to answer
questions on their role in the Mirror Group pension fund.
The first is that it was unlikely that the brothers would have anything to
say and on Monday, flanked by lawyers, they duly kept silent. The second,
and related, reason was that for the committee to misjudge its role in this
way risks bringing the entire select committee system into disrepute. That
is a pity.
It is not that the select committees lack powers. On the contrary, the
biggest single weakness of the system since it was established in its
present form in 1979 has been the failure of the committees to realise how
potentially powerful they are. The committees are entitled to 'send for
papers, persons and records'. They may sit at any time, regardless of
whether Parliament is in session, in any place, and may report whenever they
like.
Nor do the committees lack resources. They are empowered to appoint
technical experts to assist them on any subject. Moreover, under the House
of Commons (Administration) Act 1978, the funding for such activities is
controlled not by the Treasury, but is voted directly by the House of
Commons. The committees are thus an extension of the House proceedings,
devoted to detailed and specialised work. They can report to the full House
at any time.
Star witnesses
There was a period, shortly after they were established, when some of the
new departmentally-related committees seemed exceptionally useful. The
select committee on the Treasury, for instance, attracted star witnesses and
written submissions on monetary policy and the conduct of the economy. The
City and other interested observers queued up to listen and to read. More
recently, the select committee on the DTI has done some helpful ferreting on
dubious foreign arms sales. By and large, however, the performance of the
committees has not lived up to the promise of their creation.
Valid reason
Perhaps that was what Mr Field was trying to rectify in his search for
publicity. He of all people should have known better. Mr Field is the most
independent of MPs, an expert on social security matters respected as such
on all sides of the House. He is also more skilled than most in eliciting
information, whether by Parliamentary Question or the use of the committee
system. For him to call witnesses already under investigation elsewhere and
who thus had a valid reason to avoid self-incrimination before the
committee, lacked wisdom.
But the important underlying question is why the system has not been working
as it should. One of the explanations is the power of the whips, the party
managers who have some say in who goes on what committee. It is unlikely,
for instance, that the Tory Party would allow too many members of the Bruges
Group on to the select committee on foreign affairs.
Allied to that is the lure of government. An ambitious MP looking for
office, whether shadow or real, may be reluctant to be associated with a
committee which is critical of party policy. Not least, the government of
the day can give the nod to officials as to how much information the
committees should be given. The present tendency is very little; there is no
reason to believe that the Labour Party, with its own hopes of office, much
dissents.
The question comes back to individual MPs. The powers are there; why do they
not use them? It is not primarily a question of producing long reports,
often published after parliament has gone into recess; it should be more a
relentless probe of how government is run, how decisions are made and how
public money is being spent. As parliament's role as lawmaker diminishes,
its no less honourable and important role as scrutineer needs to be
enhanced.

Lord Rothschild's six year reign as chairman of the National Gallery
Trustees may have ended, but his most permanent contribution to the place
has yet to emerge. As a farewell present he is paying for the renovation of
the cavernous Central Hall - and restoring it to its 1887 glory.
The Hall will act as a meeting place where the gallery's visitors - up by
over 500,000 last year to a record 4.3m - can get their bearings. His
farewell gift will cost Lord Rothschild Pounds 1m. But this is not the end
of his usefulness to the National Gallery. In the spring he takes over as
chairman of the National Heritage Fund, which receives Pounds 12m a year
from the government to help keep in the UK masterpieces threatened with
export. Why should not some of them find a permanent home in the National
Gallery ?

John Fairley's promotion to managing director of programmes at Yorkshire TV
means that the race for the most powerful job in the new ITV power structure
 -the network's central programme scheduler  - is again open.
Fairley had the backing of Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association, for a
job which involves putting an annual programme budget of Pounds 425m to work
and refereeing any disputes between the big ITV companies and the
independent producers. However, Fairley seems more interested in chasing
foxes than chancing his luck on a bed of nails, so the field has opened up
again.
Charles Denton of Zenith, the independent programme production company, Andy
Allen, director of programmes at Central and his counterpart at Granada,
Steve Morrison, are all in the running. But getting everyone to agree is
going to be hard and at the end of the day the Independent Television
Commission may have to impose its choice.
So coming up on the rails is the perfect compromise candidate in Paul Bonner
who, as director of the programming planning secretariat at ITV, is already
doing the equivalent job. Bonner has the programme-making credentials - he
was head of science and features at the BBC and director of programmes at
Channel 4 before immersing himself in the ITV bureaucracy.
He also has a secret advantage. He's less than three years off retirement.
So if he doesn't suit . . .

When it comes to economics Brazil has never been short of original thinkers,
and Fernando Collor is no exception. On his first day as president he froze
80 per cent of the population's bank accounts.
Hence, no surprise last week when he began publishing a series of articles
entitled 'agenda for consensus', aimed at provoking debate on his ideas for
modernising Brazil.
Debate there has been - but not quite along the lines Collor had hoped. For
by his fifth article, the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper had discovered that
with the exception of a few paragraphs the text was copied from the
manifesto of the Social Liberalism party of which Collor is not a member.
Moreover, this manifesto, coincidentally also titled 'agenda for consensus',
had been lifted from essays by a diplomat who died last year.
Red faces all round. The initial explanation was that the late diplomat had
in fact been inspired by the president. But then the president's aides
thought better of this and issued a statement saying that their master's
ideas were not intended to be original.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By all accounts Frances Heaton, new director general of the takeover panel,
is a jolly good egg. But given the rarity of women in the top echelons of
City merchant banks the appointment is pretty remarkable, Opportunity 2000
notwithstanding. She was the first woman to become a Lazard director in
1986, and her departure means that only one member of the 40-strong board
will now be female.
She is one of a growing number of women who made their initial mark in the
Treasury before moving out - Rosalind Gilmore of the Building Societies
Commission, is another. However, Heaton seems to have found the bureaucracy
of the civil service stultifying and after a two-year secondment to SG
Warburg, she decided to start a second career as a merchant banker.
It is always hard for non-professionals to judge whether the director
general of the takeover panel is doing a good job. But the 47-year-old
recruit starts with right sort of qualifications, and her sense of humour as
well as inside knowledge of Whitehall should stand her in good stead
particularly if there is a change of government.
Her appointment means that three of the City's key regulators - the Serious
Fraud office and the Building Societies Commission are the others - are now
headed by women. The real breakthrough will come when a woman is put in
charge of running a big City institution, as opposed to regulating it.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Sinking funds: The so-called pensions experts to task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The enormity of the scam perpetrated by the late Robert Maxwell on present
and future pensioners of his ailing business empire still leaves even
sophisticated observers aghast. Yet there is something equally shocking
about the loud protestations from pensions experts that no pension fund can
be fully protected from a determined crook bent on theft.
This is beside the point when the inadequacy of a regulatory structure based
on the rickety protection of trust law has constituted an open invitation to
crooks for 30 years or more. Employees and pensioners both in and out of the
Maxwell empire deserve a better answer to the question of why it was allowed
to happen.
The warning signals have been there for years - not least in the newspaper
industry. After the News Chronicle went bust in 1960, employees and
pensioners discovered that their retirement incomes were funded out of
revenue without the backing of a fund. When a shareholder challenged an
attempt to compensate people at the defunct paper for the loss of pension
rights, the High Court ruled against compensation.
Since then there have been countless cases where directors of relatively
small companies have looted pension funds when their company ran into
trouble. Pensions experts said the abuse was confined to a small minority of
funds. Some consolation for those whose retirement was wrecked.
Then there was the plight of hundreds of thousands who lost their jobs in
the recession of the early 1980s. The rules of most pension schemes ensure
that so-called early leavers end up subsidising the benefits of those who
are lucky enough to keep their jobs. The huge resulting transfer of real
wealth from the less fortunate to the more fortunate went largely
unremarked. Yet this abuse of trust was arguably a far worse scandal than
anything done by Mr Maxwell.
But the biggest scandal of all is that this Pounds 400bn industry has been
hijacked for purposes quite different from those for which occupational
pension schemes were originally set up. A pension fund exists to deliver the
best possible retirement benefits to employees or it is nothing. Yet the
trustees of pension schemes across the land have allowed pension funds to be
turned into profit centres for the company.
Money that should have been devoted to improving pension benefits - not
least for existing and deferred pensioners who have been appallingly
short-changed - has been used to bolster profits through pension holidays
and now withdrawals. This may differ from the Maxwell case in that there is
not necessarily any suggestion of illegality and such practice has been
encouraged by government and by Inland Revenue rules on the uses of pension
fund surpluses. But is it moral?
The scandal extends far beyond Maxwell. And clearly politicians and their
officials are substantially to blame. Having failed to deliver a decent
state pension scheme, successive governments failed to deliver adequate
regulatory arrangements for private occupational pensions. Industrialists,
in their role as trustees, have also behaved less than admirably, since they
have increasingly lost sight of the real purpose of the trust (and in some
cases made disproportionate claims on their own pension funds for inflated
retirement incomes).
But in the final analysis perhaps it is the ever-vociferous pensions lobby
that deserves most scorn. I recall, as long ago as 1978, writing an
investigation for The Economist on incestuous financial relations between
companies and their pension funds - in other words, incipient Maxwellitis.
The response of the then chairman of the National Association of Pension
Funds was that 'the last thing we want is more legislation and control'.
As irony would have it, the gentleman in question was also director of
pensions at Reed International, then the owner of - you've guessed it -
Mirror Group Newspapers. No doubt the 'we' in question referred not to the
pensioners but to the pensions industry - that gaggle of actuaries, lawyers,
bankers and consultants who have profited so mightily over a long period
from one of Britain's richest gravy trains.
Their response to calls for tighter regulation, better treatment of deferred
pensioners or better treatment of virtually anyone else, has invariably been
to appeal to the lowest common denominator of 19th century corporate
behaviour by claiming that the slightest increase in costs would cause
employers to reduce benefits or close down the funds. They even managed to
argue that the introduction of compensation funds to protect victims of
abuse would be too expensive, while simultaneously claiming that abuse was
minimal.
When the government finally and belatedly frames a new pension act in
response to Maxwell, it should treat this dismal, self-serving lobby with
the disrespect that its past performance deserves. It should aim for a
thorough ring-fence around the fund to ensure the greatest possible
independence from management; better treatment for pension rights in a
winding-up; a decent compensation scheme; and an end to the ambiguity over
the ownership of pension funds.
Pension rights that can be so easily removed from employees are not worthy
of the name. They are a fraud, like the late Mr Maxwell.

FT  15 JAN 92 / A flawed character: The man who saved Fisons but fell foul
of the City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The saddest comment on Mr John Kerridge's career came yesterday from the
stock market. When the news broke of his resignation as head of the drug
company Fisons, the shares jumped 6 per cent.
Yet Mr Kerridge was, by common consent, one of the outstanding British
managers of his generation: the man who, 11 years before, was credited with
saving Fisons from extinction. Over the years, the City has made a fortune
out of Mr Kerridge. Now it is glad to see the back of him. Where did it all
go wrong?
The immediate cause is clear enough: the announcement in December that a
regulatory foul-up in the US has cost the company about a quarter of last
year's profits. In recent months, the share price has fallen by nearly a
third. But the problem goes deeper than that.
Mr Kerridge is described by those who have worked with him as a highly
complex personality: a brilliant strategic thinker, but obsessive over
detail; self-confident and at times apparently arrogant, but abnormally
thin-skinned. This sensitivity to criticism has undoubtedly played its part
in souring relations with the investment community and the press.
Going by his record, Mr Kerridge had little to be sensitive about. When he
was appointed chief executive of Fisons at the end of 1980, the company had
just gone through the most disastrous year in its history. Chiefly because
of the fertiliser business which had formed the bulk of its operations since
the mid-19th century, it had plunged to a net loss of Pounds 17m and was
about to slash its dividend.
The top management was in turmoil. The chairman, Sir George Burton, was
about to retire after 47 years with the company. The previous managing
director, Mr Ron Bounds, had just departed with a massive payoff. The new
chairman, Sir Ronald McIntosh, declined to take up the post on discovering
that the company was about to shut its Mayfair headquarters and move back to
its historic base in Ipswich.
Before becoming chief executive Mr Kerridge had run Fisons' fertiliser
business, which had its roots deep in the company culture. His crucial
contribution was to realise that, for strategic reasons which he was later
to expound with admirable clarity, the company had to get out of fertilisers
once and for all.
The successful sale of the business to Norsk Hydro a year after his
appointment was the turning point. Fisons went on to enjoy the growth and
stock market rating of a successful drug company. Norsk went on to do bloody
battle with the other giant of UK fertiliser production, ICI, which ended
with losses all round and ICI shutting up shop last year.
The two businesses which Mr Kerridge concentrated on - pharmaceuticals and
scientific instruments - were not there by accident. Sir George Burton, when
he was made chief executive in 1966, had decided that Fisons must reduce its
dependence on fertilisers - then 80 per cent of the business - and develop
research-based businesses, chiefly pharmaceuticals. The stroke of luck which
was eventually to save Fisons came shortly after, with the discovery of the
asthma drug Intal.
But it was only in the 1980s that the potential of the drugs business was
fully realised. Since 1982, when the company was stabilised by the sale of
the fertilisers business, earnings per share have risen six-fold. And from a
professional manager's viewpoint, perhaps the most telling statistic from
the Kerridge years is the group's return on operating assets. In his first
year in charge, in 1981, it was 9.3 per cent. It has risen every year
thereafter, the latest figure being 37.3 per cent.
But there were other aspects of Fisons' managerial adroitness which the City
found less compelling. It could never understand, for instance, how Fisons
managed to make a profit on borrowing money: in 1990, it made Pounds 0.9m of
net interest receivable on net debt of Pounds 116m. Nor could it work out
how the group tax charge was kept so low. Mr Kerridge's response to this was
invariable: that it was the result of hard work and good management. It was
open to other companies to do the same, but he was not going to help them by
showing them how.
When the news of the company's US fiasco broke last month, it also did not
help the City's temper that it felt it had been here before. Mr Kerridge's
appointment in January 1981 had coincided with the announcement that a
supposed blockbusting drug, Proxicromil, was being scrapped at the last
moment because of side effects. The City complained that the company had
been reassuring right up to the moment of disaster. Again, in the mid-1980s,
hopes had been raised too high over another new drug, Tilade, at least
partly with the company's encouragement.
The tendency to fatal optimism may fairly be blamed on the Fisons culture
rather than on Mr Kerridge alone. There is also no denying that despite its
history of success, Fisons has always been accident-prone. In the 1960s, in
a curious anticipation of its latest problems in the US, the company so
botched the US launch of its first big drug Intal that by the mid-1970s its
US sales were actually falling. But the latest upset, which turns on Fisons'
failure to pass US quality standards in drug manufacture, may be Mr
Kerridge's fault in another sense.
'One of his great strengths,' a City analyst says, 'was that he ran the
business on purely commercial lines, whereas most pharmaceuticals companies
don't. But if you look at Fisons' margins by comparison with the bigger drug
companies, they may actually be too high. He may have pushed the company too
hard, and not spent enough on manufacturing and infrastructure.'
However that may be, the refusal to explain things is eminently in
character. 'He could never relax with the City and the media,' a close
observer of the company says. 'He always felt that by explaining he might
lay himself open to further criticism. And adverse criticism was something
he couldn't bear.'
This again raises the question of why so successful a man should be so
thin-skinned. There may be a clue in Mr Kerridge's origins. Like Fisons
itself, he comes from Ipswich, where his father is variously described as
having been a garage owner or a car mechanic. Either way, when the young
Kerridge won an Oxbridge scholarship he could not afford to take it up, and
went into the army instead.
From there he made his way into marketing, and joined Fisons in 1969. On
becoming chief executive 11 years later, he moved the headquarters back to
Ipswich. As the base for an international drug business, Ipswich is not an
obvious choice. It perhaps makes more sense as the setting for a local boy
made good.
It seems clear that the company's expressions of regret at his departure
yesterday can be taken at face value. 'He could have ridden out the storm,
and I believe he should have,' says one of his colleagues. The new chairman,
Unilever veteran Mr Patrick Egan, says 'when John took over the company, it
had a market value of Pounds 40m. He brought it up to Pounds 3bn. That's a
marvellous record.'
Mr Egan defends Mr Kerridge over the US fiasco. 'We have been criticised for
not sounding a cautionary note sooner. There was certainly a good deal of
wishful thinking in our pharmaceutical department. But I didn't feel as a
non-executive director that I'd been misled. We were collectively confident
as a board that things could be sorted out.'
All the same, it sounds as if the Fisons tradition of secrecy and
sensitivity is to change as well. 'I have a more open style,' Mr Egan says.
'With the benefit of hindsight, we should have got closer to opinion-formers
in the City.' A City analyst agrees: 'This could open the doors. Fisons
could learn to love its shareholders and its shareholders to love it.'
Conceivably, it could also open the door to takeover or merger. As a drug
company, Fisons is still a minnow in a world of whales. Not surprisingly, Mr
Kerridge was adamantly opposed to the idea of Fisons losing its identity in
a merger. For a long while, this was an effective barrier. In the
pharmaceutical industry, hostile bids are conventionally seen as too risky
and expensive to be feasible.
If that were now to change, the situation would be deeply ironic. When Mr
Kerridge took the company on, it was being widely touted as a bid candidate.
Now that he is leaving, it is in the same position all over again.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: Roll out the 'bloomers' bandwagon - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something endearingly old fashioned about A Time To Dance, Melvyn
Bragg's adaptation of his own novel for BBC1. It feels closer to DH Lawrence
than to - say - Fay Weldon or Martin Amis, or even Kingsley Amis, come to
that. No doubt there are still working class teenagers who flower under the
loving care of a devoted teacher. Similarly, bank managers in advanced
middle age probably do still find spiritual renewal by lifting up their eyes
unto the hills. And it is not unlikely that passionate love does still leap,
flame like, across the gaps of age and class which separate such people. Yet
writing about all this seems to be out of fashion. By and large Episode 1
made it seem feasible enough, only two scenes stretching the suspension of
disbelief to the limit. However enflamed his loins, it seems unlikely that
the bank manager would literally chase the teenage girl through a small
country town where, presumably, both would be widely recognised. And,
however keen to expunge the image of the rapist lodger, it also seems
unlikely that the girl would select quite such a chilly day to strip off in
the middle of Lakeland and then choose to lie head down on a considerable
slope to make love. Despite that the casting - with Ronald Pickup as the
bank manager and Dirvla Kirwan as the teenager - is clever enough to sustain
the credibility of the relationship, and one was left rather keen to know
what happens next, which is more than can be said for an awful lot of
television drama serials.
*****
The best so far of this year's drama serials written expressly for
television are BBC1's Love Hurts by Marks and Gran, who wrote Shine On
Harvey Moon; and Tony Marchant's Goodbye Cruel World on BBC2. In the first
Zoe Wanamaker plays a businesswoman who takes her talents into the charity
business and is pursued by a cockney millionaire played by Adam Faith (more
good casting) and in the second Sue Johnston plays a woman suffering from a
disease like multiple sclerosis who, with her husband, launches the first
charity for sufferers. Experience suggests there will be yet more drama
about charities before the year is out. The worst production in this
category so far is BBC1's Moon And Son, an unconvincing thriller made worse
by a lot of 'new age' mumbo jumbo about dowsing and astrology.
*****
What a surprise to find that Gerry Sadowitz, who had been given such a big
build up as the new daring comedian - 'He's abusive. You'll hate him' said
BBC2 in its billing for the first show in his series The Pall Bearer's Revue
 -is, first and foremost, a conjuror. Of course the same was true of Tommy
Cooper, and, like Cooper, Sadowitz is well on the way to exploiting his
magic solely as a prop for his comedy. Nevertheless, his opening programme
scarcely justified the BBC's description of 'outrageous'. On the other hand
that word would have been fully deserved by Bill Hicks who, on Channel 4 in
the first week of the new year, presented a 60-minute show called Relentless
which was more explicit than any comedy I have ever seen on television. A
sequence about auto-fellatio (the next step in man's evolution, said Hicks,
will include the loss of one spinal vertebra - 'Come on guys, work it out,
you all know what I'm talking about') was capped by a gag about his parents
commenting on his act: 'You're not still doing that 'suck your own cock'
sketch?' Some of Hicks' material would make Lenny Bruce's live act look like
the height of circumspection, though much of it is also very funny.
*****
At 7.30 on the evening of Sunday December 29, 15 minutes into Auntie's
Bloomers, a BBC1 copy of ITV's It'll Be All Right On The Night, I switched
on the VCR and walked round the block to get a breath of air and post some
letters. I returned saying that the programme must be getting an awfully big
rating because, in the odd quiet of the London streets, clear of traffic
during that dead period with which the British now mark the winter solstice,
great bellows of laughter could be heard rolling out of virtually every
house. It turned out that ITV was simultaneously screening a collection of
accidents captured on home-video, called You've Been Framed, and since that
achieved a rating of 12.06m it was doubtless responsible for some of the
laughter. But, sure enough Auntie's Bloomers topped the Christmas ratings
with 18.24m - so 30m people were watching television at 7.30 that evening.
Just why collections of off-cuts, showing the mistakes and disasters which
inevitably overtake actors and broadcasters during the making of programmes,
should be quite so popular is a mystery. But that they are popular has been
well established by 'It'll Be All Right'.
So it was a little surprising to find Terry Wogan, presenter of Auntie's
Bloomers quoted in one newspaper as saying of the record ratings 'This
demonstrates that rumours of my demise are a little previous' for all the
world as though it was the linking sentences that he read off the autocue
which attracted the viewers, rather than the sight of Guy Michelmore
spilling coffee on his desk seconds before he was due to read the news, or
the baby elephant spilling everything on the Blue Peter studio floor. My
guess is that programmes of this sort would get the same ratings whether the
'bloomers' were linked by Wogan, Denis Norden, or the car park attendant.
Indeed, the worst aspect of such programmes is the desperate and of course
unsuccessful straining of the presenters to be as funny as the clips.
*****
Having jumped so successfully onto the 'bloomers' bandwagon, BBC1 followed
up on Friday with the first in their own regular collection of accidents
captured on home video: Caught In The Act. The presenter, Shane Richie,
claimed 'Yer all runnin' round the country whippin' out yer hand-helds for
me'. A clip showing a toddler poking himself in the eye with a plastic
aeroplane was voted by the studio audience to be marginally less amusing
than the sight of a black labrador mounting a small white goat. The man who
shot the dog/goat video consequently won the holiday in Florida. If in the
1990s even the BBC is going down this road, perhaps this is the decade when
television criticism really will cease to be a job for adults.
*****
It is hard to imagine a current affairs series specialising in, say,
politics or crime which did not have on it an expert in politics or crime,
yet the BBC's only serious series devoted to the subject of television
itself appears to have no expert on broadcasting. Biteback, screened at the
dead hour of 4.25 on Sunday, devoted considerable time this week to an
argument springing from the widespread belief not only that advertising is
prohibited on the BBC but that you are not even allowed to mention brand
names on BBC programmes. At no stage did anybody point out that what Clause
12 of the BBC licence actually says is that the Corporation shall not
'receive money or any valuable consideration' for anything it may broadcast.
This, the only clause dealing with advertising, would appear to legitimise
all those house-ads for Radio Times and the like, and obviously does not
prevent anybody from mentioning Big Macs, let alone Hoover or Biro.

new home is smaller so Mr Ortiz-Patino is having a clear out from his art
collection. The resulting auction at Sotheby's New York on May 21 and 22
should bring in over Dollars 25m, providing just the kind of tonic the art
market needs.
Some of the objects on offer are quite exceptional, most notably a
collection of English 'chinoiserie'-style silver, all the rage in the 1680s.
It includes the Brownlow Tankards which sold for Pounds 56,000 when last at
auction in 1968, setting a record for English silver. They now carry an
estimate of up to Dollars 1.5m, which is around Dollars 500,000 below the
current record, but competitive bidding could push them near a new high.
Among the French silver there is a group from the 3,000 piece service that
Catherine the Great ordered from the Parisian silversmith Jacques-Nicholas
Roettiers in 1770 as a present for her lover, Count Gregory Orloff. One
item, a soup tureen, cover and stand, carries a top estimate of Dollars
1.8m.
Mr Ortiz-Patino is also selling off French furniture and Old Master
paintings, including eight Venetian scenes by Guardi. But he will continue
to collect Paul de Lamerie silver, Dutch and Spanish Old Masters, and rare
French manuscripts.
Sotheby's arch rival Christie's can just about match the Ortiz-Patino sale.
On March 31 in New York it starts the dispersal of the finest collection of
Japanese swords to be assembled in the past fifty years. It was brought
together by the late Walter A. Compton and should realise Dollars 20m .
There are over 1,000 lots in the collection, ranging from warriors' swords
to art swords, carefully crafted blades which the samurai valued higher than
land or gold and presented as offerings to Shinto shrines. A blade made by
Kunitoki around 1300 and ranked by the Preservation of Japanese Art Swords
as 'Especially Important Sword,' should make the top price of over Dollars
100,000.
These two auctions are just what the auction houses need - celebrated
collections of important works of art appealing to connoisseurs rather than
investors - to restore confidence to their battered market.

An extraordinary night for history. BBC2 begins a new series, The Day The
World Changed with Steven Berkoff making his choice: November 7 1938 when
Herschel Grynszpan shot a German diplomat in Paris. That was followed by
Kristallnacht which led eventually to the Holocaust (8.00).
Timewatch (8.10 BBC2) investigates 'the battle of the styles' in the 1830s
when classicists and modernists argued about the sort of building that
should replace the old Houses of Parliament which had burned down in 1834.
The argument scarcely differed from that which we hear today about the
design of public buildings.
ITV are wrapping their two-hour drama documentary The Treaty around 'News At
10', so this account of the emergence of the Irish Free State begins at 9.00
and ends at 11.45. BBC1 begins a 4-part series, Churchill, which claims to
be 'the first complete television biography of Britain's wartime leader'. It
is written and presented by Martin Gilbert who spent 25 years researching
and writing the 8-volume official biography. Today's programme covers
Churchill's early life and political career up to 1940 when he became Prime
Minister.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: The Bells - Riverside Studios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After his first night triumph in The Bells at the Lyceum in 1871, Henry
Irving was asked by his wife on the way home to Fulham: 'Are you going to go
on making a fool of yourself like this all your life?' Whereupon, the family
history goes, Irving descended from the carriage, at Hyde Park, never went
home, nor spoke to his wife, again.
Over the years Britain's first actor-knight performed the leading role in
The Bells more than 800 times and was still performing it almost the night
before he died in 1905. Afterwards, the role passed to his elder son, H B
Irving, who went on playing it to some acclaim until the end of the First
World War.
That information is drawn from a fascinating book, Henry Irving and The
Bells, published by the Manchester University Press in 1980. Some of the
history is worth bearing in mind if you contemplate seeing a new version of
the piece by Daryl Runswick from the Green Light Music Theatre at the
Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. For The Bells is full of paradoxes.
Although thought of as a quintessential bit of British theatre history
because of the association with Irving, it is not an English play. The
original version was called Le Juif Polonais and was first performed in
Paris just before the Franco-Prussian War. The action is set in Alsace.
Several versions quickly appeared in London: it was a drunken
journalist/lawyer named Leopold Lewis who turned the original into the more
English-sounding The Bells which was to be the making of Irving. The bells
are those of a snow-sleigh, not the church.
It is also questionable how far the piece can be accurately described as a
play. There was always a good deal of music in it, including an overture.
That was partly the fashion of the time: somewhere between opera and drama.
The music for The Bells was written by Etienne Singla who had produced the
score for Le Juif Polonais and was brought to London to conduct the first
Irving performance.
The piece has no great or even long speeches. It lasted no more than 90
minutes, the same as the new version at the Riverside. It is about a man who
committed a murder for money, became rich and respected thereafter, and
remained unsuspected. The psychological drama is about the guilt in his own
mind. Exactly 15 years later, it catches up with him. There is no more to it
than that. Irving must have made his mark more by his presence and gestures
than by any of the lines he had to speak. It was said from the first night
onwards that it was a one-part play.
The version at the Riverside, directed by Stephen Langridge, is certainly
not that. It may even claim to be more opera than drama, though even that is
debatable. There were times when I was reminded of Benjamin Britten's The
Turn of the Screw, but the music is never quite assertive enough for long
enough for the music to take over. Only towards the end does it become
dominant. Apart from the singing, it is confined to clarinet, cello and
piano. Appropriately, however, the tiny chamber orchestra sits in the pit.
Yet none of those comments should detract from the pleasure of seeing this
production. The Bells in any form is a haunting work and the Riverside is a
haunting theatre. The production has at least two alphas: the tight use of
gauze behind which the stage action and the singing takes place and which
makes the performance more ghostly; and the brilliant use of taped
half-heard conversation during the wedding reception. Nothing is ever
overdone.
Mathias, the villain-hero, is played and sung by Philip Langridge, the
father of Stephen, the director. Philip is not Irving, but nor is he meant
to be. This is a sub-Brittanesque gloss on an old favourite. Nevertheless,
the magic still works.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies could soon be blushing green with embarrassment over their
environmental and safety records if a private member's bill successfully
passes its second reading in Parliament on Friday.
The Corporate Safety and Environmental Information Bill, sponsored by Jeff
Rooker MP, would amend the 1985 Companies Act and force businesses to add a
new section to the directors' report in the annual report and accounts.
Any company with more than 50 employees would have to include a new
paragraph called 'Safety and the Environment' alongside existing required
disclosures on issues such as the disabled, political contributions and
employee consultation - as well as pure financial information.
Information required to be disclosed includes:
Enforcement notices served by the regulatory authorities.
Convictions for environmental and safety offences.
Serious accidents suffered by employees.
Compensation payments made after injury or fatal accidents.
The idea originally came from the Citizen Action Compensation Campaign.
Henry Witcomb, a barrister who helped draft the bill, says: 'Our concern was
that existing legislation doesn't do enough for prevention. It just leads to
compensation, which is never adequate. Putting the facts down on paper
should be a crucial stimulus to change.'
Some safety and environmental action taken by regulatory bodies is already
published in local public registers. However, the information revealed is
relatively minimal and inaccessible.
Emily Russell, a researcher with the Campaign for the Freedom of
Information, which jointly sponsored the bill, said it took a long time to
unearth details of action taken against companies. She analysed more than 20
large companies convicted on safety or environmental offences during
financial years since 1989. None revealed this information in annual
reports.
For example, during 1990 ICI received a Pounds 100,000 fine after two
workers were killed by an explosion in 1988, and a Pounds 250,000 fine after
another explosion killed a fireman and injured 93 people in March 1989. The
annual report simply stated: 'ICI places the highest priority on the safety
and health of employees, customers and the general public.'
Shell Transport and Trading Company received a Pounds 1m fine in February
1990 after 156 tonnes of crude oil spilled into Mersey from a fractured
pipeline. No mention is made of the incident in the report and accounts.
Russell argues that companies already have to collate most of these
statistics for statutory purposes. She argues that any additional costs in
their compilation and presentation in accounts would be minimal.
'The bill would force directors to place their true record against the
public relations blurb they usually produce,' she says. 'But it doesn't have
to be negative. It allows companies to put the action into context and
explain any remedial action they have taken.'
A separate survey conducted last year by Company Reporting, a journal which
monitors annual reports, unearthed similar lack of disclosure. In a sample
of 670 annual reports it found that only 3 per cent highlighted
environmental information in a separate statement. 'The majority of
disclosures are of such a low level as to be virtually meaningless,' it
said.
Courtaulds, the chemicals and fibres group, supports the spirit of the bill.
Freddie Daniel, public affairs manager, says: 'I think the initial response
from some companies is likely to be defensive, but there is no point keeping
your head in the sand. We try to take as open an attitude as we can.'
However, he says simple totals should be given in the report to prevent a
very long list, with a separate report giving further details; and that the
privacy of individual confidential compensation payments should be
respected.
He also adds that many environmental and safety problems are caused by
employers in sectors such as farming and construction with fewer than 50
employees, which are excluded under the current wording of the bill.
Rob Gray from the University of Dundee, who specialises in 'green
accounting' issues, says: 'I am pleased to see any developments in the
annual report like this. Whether publishing this sort of information
achieves anything is unclear. But at least it would disclose new facts, and
act like a ratchet on greater disclosure.'
But first the campaigners face what is likely to be an extremely difficult
task in trying to get the bill through parliament on Friday.
The Department of Trade and Industry, for example, is believed to be opposed
to the bill, on the grounds that while the information it would require to
be disclosed is important, the annual report is not the appropriate vehicle
in which it should appear.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Jobs: A good way of demotivating the majority' - Study casts
doubt on the usefulness of performance-pay schemes for executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY'RE like illicit love affairs . . . or so I'm told, anyway' said Derek
Torrington of University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology.
'When you're not personally involved in one, you feel you're missing out on
something marvellous. When you are involved, you spend most of the time
being miserable.'
What the UMIST professor was talking about was performance-related pay
schemes for higher-ranked staff, which used to be called incentive-pay
systems. And by the end of his session at the British Psychological
Society's conference the other day, he and his audience had shed light on
the reasons for the change of title. For one thing, some 95 per cent of
those present felt that, in general, such schemes had more of a disincentive
effect than the opposite.
Derek Torrington has studied their workings in eight big business groups in
Britain. Although he may not name them, they comprise one each in chemicals,
oil, specialised lubricants, water-supply, telecommunications, computers,
plus a bank and a conglomerate.
One of his findings is that the schemes are apt to be inflationary. When the
groups decided to instal them, the usual prediction had been that they would
add 3 to 3 1/2 per cent to the relevant paybill. As things turned out, the
increase ran into double digits in several cases, and in one of them was no
less than 27 per cent.
The unexpectedly high expense was perhaps the main reason why all the groups
remained firmly committed to the schemes as an important part of policy. For
the commitment could scarcely be explained by the way they were working. Of
the eight, only one could honestly say that its scheme was successful.
The professor suspects that whether such devices work hinges decisively on
company culture. For instance, the successful one was in the computer group
marked by sales-orientation of a strength far more often found in the United
States than the United Kingdom. Moreover, the tenet that pay should depend
much on performance-measures is a fundamental principle of the company's
philosophy.
'If that's what everyone believes, you're maybe OK,' he said. 'But otherwise
you can easily raise the spectre of unfairness.'
In a real pay-by-performance culture, employees presumably see themselves as
resembling market traders. In Britain if not Europe generally, however, most
people expect something different from employment. Derek Torrington
illustrated the difference by contrasting his efforts as an author of books
on management - he has at least partly written 25 of them - with his work as
an academic. In his author's role, he would never think it unfair that
popular novelists should make so much more money out of the activity. But he
might well be aggrieved to find the same was true of his fellow professors.
What's more, the bulk of the schemes included so-called performance criteria
that certainly did not reduce the risk of raising the spectre of unfairness.
The bank was the most eccentric in dishing out the performance pay in
advance on estimates of staff's likely achievements over the next 12 months.
True, there was machinery for adjustments the following year in the event of
shortfall. But the mechanism was apparently not often used. And while the
rest waited for results to happen before rewarding them, their measures of
what constituted above-average achievement were sometimes questionable to
say the least. In the conglomerate, for example, managers in the Pounds
20,000 salary range were receiving performance bonuses for being punctual.
So it is perhaps hardly surprising that seven of the eight schemes studied
had proved less than a resounding success. Indeed it may even be, as a
member of the audience suggested, that with only rare exceptions the effect
of performance-pay schemes is to encourage the few at the cost of
demotivating the many.
NOW to the table below which shows a sample of the international living-
costs indicators drawn up by the P-E International management consultancy.
Anyone wanting the full survey, which gives data on many more places than
the 60 I have room for and costs Pounds 300, should contact Simon McBride of
P-E at Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; tel 0784 434411, fax
0784 437828.
The cost indices in all cases refer to particular cities as distinct from
entire countries, and are based on London prices at 100. Since the survey
takes time to compile, its findings are not bang up to date. The actual
levels reflected by the indices are those prevailing last October. The
currency exchange-rates are those of the same date, but the inflation rates
are the latest P-E could obtain from official sources before the survey went
to press. Unfortunately, since nobody seems able to devise an
internationally consistent gauge of housing costs, no account of them is
taken in the indices.
Otherwise, they should be a tolerably approximate guide, not least because
prices tend to stay fairly stable and so can be updated for currency
fluctuations.
The adjustment is made by taking the exchange rate shown in the table,
dividing it by the latest market rate, and then multiplying the result by
the index figure.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Management: Blasts of hot air help to clear the atmosphere -
A US group's efforts to involve its workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Bethlehem Steel's vast plant on the southern tip of Lake Michigan, a
blast furnace worker is being rude about a foreman.
A group of workers and managers listen as Brian Piers criticises the
supervisor for acting as if he knows everything about steel-making. 'He's
been here since the furnace was made of wood,' says Piers dryly.
Such tension between workers and those in charge of them is common in any
workplace. But the reason for Lee's remarks is exceptional: he has been
asked to be offensive as part of a training course. The group of a dozen
employees is halfway through a three-day course aimed at raising the
involvement of workers in decision-making.
Bethlehem Steel is one of many American companies now feeling their way
towards new forms of work organisation. Its employee involvement programme
at the Burns Harbor plant is part of a broad attempt to push down the level
at which decisions are taken and free workers from a traditional model of
overbearing management control.
The experiment is not the most radical in American workplaces. Car making is
one industry which has moved swiftly towards team working and employee
involvement. Companies such as General Motors have been pushed into
experiments including one at the Saturn plant in Tennessee by the salutary
example of Japanese working methods.
But Bethlehem's smaller-scale effort is notable in two ways. It is ironic
because Bethlehem Steel was one of the first companies in which traditional
working practices were developed 80 years ago. And despite some unions'
suspicion of employee involvement programmes, this one is being jointly run
with the United Steel Workers of America.
The USW has proved a tough adversary for the American steel makers in the
past. It has achieved high wages for its members and was criticised as
intransigent and short-sighted by Sir Robert Scholey, chairman of British
Steel, when negotiations over a joint venture between the two companies
collapsed last November.
But the union is enthusiastic about the employee involvement venture despite
some initial misgivings. 'It is a dramatic change for us,' says Paul Gipson,
president of the USW local branch. 'It does not take us away totally from
the adversarial picture, but it certainly gives us a lot more participation
in decision-making.'
On the company's side, there were also early fears about the idea. 'If you
had told a steel executive in the 1940s about something like this, he would
have said it was communism,' says Gary DeHart, the plant's human resources
manager.
But he believes it has already helped to raise the company's profitability
and production quality. This has not been achieved without difficulty.
Employee involvement was introduced in the 1988 wage deal as part of a
complex profit-sharing arrangement. But the formula was abandoned last year
after a series of disputes and the employee involvement programme was left
to carry on without being linked to workers' pay.
All the plant's 4,600 hourly-paid workers are to attend a three-day course
in employee involvement and team working by 1993. The company and the union
have established 42 problem-solving teams throughout the plant.
The teams include management and union representatives as well as workers
from each unit and department. The aim is simple, according to Bill Brooks,
the management co-ordinator of the programme.
'We did not have people who could sit down together and talk. That was our
starting point,' he says. 'We had people who would even go to great lengths
to avoid seeing each other physically.'
Such a manoeuvre is possible in many parts of the three-and-a-half mile long
plant. Built in 1962, it is Bethlehem's newest integrated plant and one of
its most profitable.
Despite the contraction of the steelmaking plants in Pennsylvania during the
1980s, Bethlehem made Dollars 800m of capital improvements to Burns Harbor.
Burns Harbor is one of five plants lining the shore of Lake Michigan, which
produce about 20 per cent of America's steel. Two-thirds of the sheet steel
from Burns Harbor is for the automotive industry, and the rest goes to
consumer and office products. Its plate steel is mostly used for railways
and shipbuilding. Brooks and John Greaves, the programme's union
co-ordinator, share an office. As if to emphasise the joint nature of the
enterprise, it is arranged symmetrically.
Above Brooks' desk is a Bethlehem Steel pennant, above Greaves' a USW
pennant. Between the two is a poster of a common cause: the Chicago Bears
football team.
The two men administer the programme and the training sessions in which
workers are taught about new approaches to management which try to engage
the commitment and participation of the whole workforce.
'It is easier to have an adversarial relationship. This way is better but it
is tough to make it work,' says Brooks.
There is a considerable irony here, for it was at Bethlehem Steel at the
turn of the century that Frederick Taylor developed his theories of
scientific management. Taylor's ideas about not allowing workers autonomy
and controlling work strictly helped to develop the traditional assembly
line in many US companies.
In the training room opposite the office, a training session is in progress.
The trainer is Marty Marciniak, a former machine shop worker. He is asking
questions and cajoling the group of 10 workers, surrounded by posters with
slogans such as 'The best decisions will result when they are made at the
lowest practical level'.
Part of the involvement programme is a suggestions scheme, which now draws
about 200 suggestions a month. The programme costs about Dollars 950,000 a
year to run, but the company estimates that it made a net saving of Dollars
3.4m dollars from the scheme in 1989, apart from the improvements in
efficiency from greater co-operation.
Although the average age of workers at Burns Harbor is 42, the plant has a
relatively young and well-educated workforce for the steel industry because
it was built in the 1960s.
'We have no burden of history. They were all brand new when they started,
and they do not talk about the labour battles of the 1930s,' says DeHart.
That was one advantage in starting the employee involvement programme.
Another was the plant's profitability, according to Gipson of the USW.
'It think it is unique that we were not forced into it by the need to make
money. We wanted to make the plant more comfortable rather than more
profitable,' he says.
The employee involvement process is at a relatively early stage, and is
being used to influence worker attitudes rather than change working
practices. Even this degree of co-operation scares some managers, according
to DeHart.
'For managers who are used to the control mode, it is a very frightening
thing,' he says. But he believes the company is now committed to developing
the process.
'You go through an early cosmetic phase when managers still make decisions
although they pretend to discuss them, but the evolution is inexorable,' he
says 'Soon you are no longer pretending and the workers are really part of
the process.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard urges backing for
participation - Employment Questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE companies were urged to encourage employee participation in management
on a voluntary basis by Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, yesterday.
Insisting that voluntary arrangements were preferable to statutory
requirements, he described the best practice of British industry as 'second
to none'.
Mr Howard reaffirmed the government's determination to resist the imposition
of a 'statutory straitjacket' by the European Community.
He welcomed the part being played by the CBI in 'encouraging others to
follow the lead set by the best in industry'.
Mr Howard again attacked the Labour party's proposals for a statutory
minimum wage, claiming they would destroy 'countless jobs', particularly if
better-paid workers sought to maintain their differentials.
To Labour cheers, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, hit back
by calling on Mr Howard to accept that the recession was much deeper than
the government had so far been prepared to admit.
Mr Blair accused the government of cutting training provision at a time when
Britain had the fastest rising unemployment anywhere in Europe.
Mr Howard told Labour MPs that they were in no position to demand more
resources for training when it was not one of the priority areas for
increased expenditure authorised by Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief
secretary to the Treasury.

FT  15 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Bank cannot retain leases as security for
father's overdraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK AG v IBRAHIM AND OTHERS Chancery Division (Mr DE Neuberger QC
sitting as a deputy High Court judge): December 18 1991
A BANK is not barred by the unenforceability of an overdraft guarantee for
lack of written memorandum, from asserting its right to retain title deeds
deposited with it under a contract to secure the overdraft. But the owner of
the deeds is entitled to their return if there was no contract between him
and the bank, in that consideration for the deposit passed not to him but to
the customer. Also, he would be entitled to their return even if a contract
were to exist, if he agreed to their deposit as a result of the customer's
undue influence of which the bank had notice.
Mr DE Neuberger QC, sitting as a deputy Chancery judge, so held when giving
judgment for the defendants on further argument on a claim and counterclaim
in an action by Deutsche Bank AG against Mr Datuk Mohamed Ariff Haji Ibrahim
and his two daughters.
On December 3, 1991, the judge dismissed the bank's claim for a declaration
that it had valid equitable mortgages of two leases owned by the daughters,
held by the bank as security for Mr Ibrahim's overdraft (FT, December 13,
1991). He held that the bank could not enforce the security because it
constituted a guarantee which was unsupported by a written memorandum signed
by the daughters in accordance with section 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677.
Section 4 provided that no action should be brought 'upon any special
promise to answer for the debt default or miscarriage of another' unless the
agreement on which the action was brought or some memorandum or note of that
agreement, was in writing and signed by the party to be charged with the
promise.
The daughters' counterclaim for delivery up of the title deeds was adjourned
for further argument until the present hearing. At the hearing the bank
applied to recall the judgment on the claim for further argument. It wished
to raise two new arguments aimed at rebutting the defendants' reliance on
section 4.
The application was granted on the grounds:
(1) that the argument related to a point taken and pleaded for the
defendants after the case had opened;
(2) the hearing had not closed, in the sense that the counterclaim still had
to be argued;
(3) there was no suggestion of prejudice to the defendants outside the
proceedings in that they had not acted in reliance on the judgment, nor
inside the proceedings in that the argument was one of law and did not
require further evidence.
HIS LORDSHIP said that the first new argument on the claim was that draft
memoranda sent by the bank to the daughters on November 19, 1985, for
signature were sufficient to satisfy section 4.
Those memoranda recorded the deposit of the title deeds as security for Mr
Ibrahim's indebtedness, and asked the daughters to acknowledge that fact.
The court had found that the memoranda were received by the daughters, but
were never acknowledged by them, nor executed them in any way.
In those circumstances they were not sufficient memoranda for the purposes
of section 4.
The bank said the memoranda had the daughters' names on and therefore should
be treated as having been authorised by them because, having received them,
they stood by and did nothing.
It would be quite wrong in legal principle or common sense to infer approval
on the daughters' part, whether of the memoranda generally or of inclusion
of their names.
The second new argument on the claim was that the daughters should not be
able to use section 4 as an engine of fraud.
The argument was rejected.
The circumstances in which the engine of fraud principle might be invoked
were restricted to two classes of case, set out in Williams on the Statute
of Frauds, section 4 1932, page 223:
'1. Cases where one party has partly or wholly performed his side of the
contract and the other thereupon, designing to secure the benefit of such
performance without performing in return the obligations which the contract
imposes on him, sets up a plea of non-compliance with the statute. 2. Cases
where such a plea is set up by one who has, by fraud, prevented the
execution of sufficient writing.'
The bank could not bring the facts into either class. Mere refusal to sign
was not enough (see Wood v Midgley 5 De GM &amp; G 41).
The second new argument was therefore rejected.
Accordingly, despite recall of the judgment dismissing the claim, the
further argument did not cause the court to alter its conclusion.
The claim having been dismissed, the daughters counterclaimed for return of
their title deeds.
They argued first that as the claim failed under section 4, the counterclaim
must succeed.
The bank said section 4 did not provide that the absence of a signed
memorandum rendered a guarantee contract void. It merely provided that no
action might be brought on the contract.
Accordingly, the bank argued, it could contest the counterclaim and refuse
to hand over the title deeds on the basis that they were deposited as
security for Mr Ibrahim's borrowings, which had not been repaid.
In Maddison v Alderson(1888) App Cas 467, 475 Lord Selborne said section 4
'does not avoid parole contracts but only bars the legal remedies by which
they might otherwise be enforced'.
The counterclaim would have been dismissed had it been based only on that
ground.
However, the daughters had raised other points.
First it was said there was no consideration for the guarantee.
The court accepted that Mr Ibrahim's promise to provide the title deeds was
made in consideration of the bank's extending his right to an overdraft.
But the question was whether he was making that promise on behalf of his
daughters.
There was nothing to suggest that he had their express authority to make the
promise.
There was nothing in the documents or in the evidence to suggest that he
sought their consent to commit them to depositing the title deeds as
security for his overdraft.
The bank then alternatively relied on estoppel.
There was no action or omission on the bank's part after the title deeds
were handed over to it which gave rise to any argument of estoppel.
On the evidence there was nothing the bank did or did not do which it would
or would not have done if the title deeds had not been handed over to it.
Unless the bank could establish some sort of estoppel in relation to the
deposit of the title deeds, it was in the same position as a bank which had
gratuitously received title deeds from a third party as security for the
debt of another after that debt had been incurred, following which the third
party changed his mind and sought to collect the title deeds from the bank.
Unless the bank could say it had acted to its detriment in reliance on the
security, there being no contract, it would be obliged to hand back the
title deeds.
Accordingly, the daughters' argument based on absence of consideration
succeeded.
Their final point was that if there was a contract between them and the
bank,it was voidable or void on grounds of undue influence.
Where two people who were unmarried provided security for the liabilities of
their father without any independent legal advice, there was a presumption
of undue influence (see Lancashire Loans v Black (1934) 1 KB 380.
There was no evidence that the daughters got independent advice.
When the bank saw the leases in November 1985 it almost immediately
appreciated that they were granted to Mr Ibrahim's daughters.
It knew enough to be unable to claim to be an innocent third party without
notice so far as voidability of the agreement at the daughters' suit was
concerned.
It knew the title deeds were being offered as security for Mr Ibrahim's
overdraft. It knew they were in his daughters' names. It must have
appreciated that it was through his influence on the daughters that the
title deeds were produced.
It would be inappropriate for the court to criticise the bank's conduct of
the matter. All it could say was that if an organisation chose to deal with
matters in a comparatively informal way, it could scarcely claim it had no
notice of matters such as undue influence in circumstances such as these.
Judgment for the daughters on the counterclaim.
For the bank: Guy Fetherstonhaugh (Clifford Chance)
For the daughters: John Lambert (Stunt Palmer &amp; Robinson)

NEGOTIATIONS to keep Quebec within Canada have hit another snag with a sharp
disagreement between the leaders of two of the country's most powerful
English-speaking provinces.
Mr Bob Rae of Ontario and Alberta's Mr Don Getty have expressed
diametrically opposed views over the two highly-charged issues of official
bilingualism and reform of the upper house of parliament, the Senate.
The public disagreement is bound to complicate the federal government's
efforts to stitch together a package of constitutional proposals acceptable
both to Quebec and to the rest of the country. Senate reform, in particular,
is viewed by Alberta and other parts of Canada as a key bargaining chip in
return for concessions to Quebec.
Mr Getty echoed the views of many English-speaking Canadians by suggesting
that it was time for Ottawa to stop 'forcing' the use of both French and
English.
Mr Rae, however, told a parliamentary committee drawing up proposals for a
new constitution that Ontario would fight to preserve bilingualism.

A JAPANESE delegation arrived in Hanoi yesterday as a preliminary step
towards resuming official aid to Vietnam, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
Mr Takao Kawakami, director-general of the economic co-operation bureau of
Japan's Foreign Affairs Ministry, met Mr Vu Khoan, Vietnamese deputy foreign
minister, ahead of talks on settling Vietnam's debt to Japan, necessary
before aid can be resumed.
Japan suspended assistance after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and has
since followed a US-led embargo on aid and official investment, despite
being Vietnam's biggest trading partner.
Tokyo is seeking a key role in rebuilding the region after a Cambodian peace
agreement was signed last October. Diplomats expect Japan to resume official
aid to Vietnam in the second half of the year.
Separately, a German delegation arrived in Hanoi to try to reach agreement
with Vietnam on the repatriation of thousands of Vietnamese asylum-seekers.
More than 20,000 Vietnamese contract workers have come home from former East
Germany since 1989, but thousands of others crossed into former West Germany
following unification.
Between 20,000 and 30,000 workers there have already or are expected to
apply for asylum, but are not considered political refugees by the Bonn
government.
The German delegation is expected to sign an agreement today providing DM10m
(Pounds 3.5m) for job training and soft loans to help resettle returning
Vietnamese workers.
Germany says it wants to help resettle the workers at home, but needs a
guarantee from the Vietnamese government that it will not punish them for
seeking asylum.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S overall and domestic wholesale price indices (WPI) were steady in
December compared with November levels but fell from a year earlier mostly
because of a strong yen and a slowing domestic economy, economists said,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'Any increase in domestic prices is likely to have been cancelled out by
lower import prices due to the strength of the yen,' said Mr Kusuo Aoki, an
economist at the Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics.
The nation's overall wholesale price index was unchanged in December from
the previous month but fell 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, the Bank of
Japan (BOJ) announced earlier today.
Import prices declined 16.7 per cent year-on-year compared with a 15.5 per
cent drop in November.
Japan's domestic WPI, a key component of overall WPI, was unchanged on the
month but fell 0.2 per cent from a year earlier, the BOJ said.
The yen's strength against the dollar was also a factor for the year-on-year
decline in overall wholesale prices, economists said. The dollar closed on
average in Tokyo at Y128.07 in December 1991 compared with Y133.72 in
December 1990, according to BOJ statistics.
A decline in imported oil prices also contributed to the drop in the WPI
from the previous year. Oil prices rose to over Dollars 30 a barrel in
December 1990 because of the Gulf crisis but have since eased to around
Dollars 20 per barrel.
Trends in the WPI tend to foreshadow the performance of the overall economy,
economists said. Hence, wholesale prices may be expected to pick up by the
end of the second quarter as Japan's economy is forecast to resume its
expansionary trend by summer.

THE RIVAL Cambodian factions agreed yesterday to allow new political parties
and a free press as the Red Cross gained its first access to political
prisoners due to be released, western diplomats said, Reuter reports from
Phnom Penh.
The agreement was reached at a meeting of Cambodian faction officials,
representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council,
and officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in
Phnom Penh.
Two diplomats representing the five Security Council permanent members
called it an important breakthrough, implementing terms of the peace treaty
the Vietnamese-installed government and its guerrilla opponents signed in
Paris in October to end 13 years of civil war.
'What has been agreed on freedom of assembly and association and the press
means that in principle there is no reason for any more political
restrictions as of today,' one said.
Mr Jean-Jacques Fresard, chief ICRC delegate in Phnom Penh, told reporters
Red Cross officials had visited two prisons in the capital yesterday
morning. He said 290 prisoners would be released today.
Mr Fresard said 118 political or war prisoners were registered in Phnom
Penh's T-3 prison and 182 at Prey Sar jail on the city's outskirts. Fifteen
were in military hospitals where some would have to remain until their
health improved. Mr Fresard refused to give details of the prisoners' health
or to describe conditions in the jails.
He said the three guerrilla factions that have opposed the Phnom Penh
government, including the radical Khmer Rouge, had invited ICRC teams to
their respective zones.
The two non-communist guerrilla factions said that as far as they knew no
prisoners were held in their zones, but there was evidence to suggest
prisoners were held in all three guerrilla zones, the ICRC representative
said.
All sides agreed to allow new political parties to take part in
UN-supervised elections envisioned for 1993 as well as to permit a free
press, breaking the rigid government monopoly, the diplomats said.
Another accord guarantees the right of the 350,000 Cambodian refugees due to
return from Thailand to live where they choose, unless there are practical
reasons to prevent it, such as overcrowding.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S trade deficit declined sharply to Dollars 1.34bn (Pounds 740m)
between April and September 1991, compared to Dollars 3.04bn in the same six
months of the previous financial year, according to half-yearly figures
released by the Indian government yesterday.
But the figures are deceptive since they reflect a substantial reduction in
imports because of balance of payments difficulties and diminishing foreign
exchange reserves. Exports have, in fact, declined by more than 6 per cent.
Imports fell by 17.5 per cent to Dollars 11bn in the period compared to more
than Dollars 13bn in the same period last year. Import restrictions have
held back industrial production owing to scarcity of raw materials,
components and capital goods.
Some economists even fear that the economy is in the grip of a recession
because of the import cuts. Industrialists have been urging the government
to withdraw the restrictions but, despite a marked improvement in the
foreign exchange reserves which stand at present at over Rs95bn (Pounds
2.1bn), the government has not responded positively.
The trade figures have been presented in a new format to differentiate
between hard currency areas and rupee payment areas (Russia and some east
European countries). They show that exports to hard currency areas rose in
the six-month period by 5.6 per cent and fell by 54 per cent to rupee
payment areas.
The object of the new format is to show that hard currency earnings are
increasing and that the drop in earnings from eastern Europe (which involve
barter arrangements) do not matter since hard currency is not involved.
Nevertheless, overall export performance is dismal.

FT  15 JAN 92 / IFC calls for trebling of sub-Saharan investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TREBLING of private investment is required in sub-Saharan Africa if the
region is to achieve long-term economic recovery, Mr William Ryrie,
executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
said in London this week.
Mr Ryrie, speaking at a conference chaired by Mr Babacar Ndiaye, president
of the African Development Bank, said achieving the target figure of 15 per
cent of GDP was 'doubtful at best'.
'In most countries, even with the best will and the best policies, it will
probably be the first decade of the 21st century before we begin to see real
results - that is to say steadily rising private investment, sustained
higher rates of growth and job creation', he added.
Mr Ryrie said the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, was
investing approximately Dollars 200m a year in about 35 companies in
sub-Saharan Africa. He estimated that projects in which the IFC had recently
participated accounted for around 10 per cent of total private investment,
domestic and foreign, in the region.
Much of the IFC finance has gone into a few large investments, he
acknowledged.
'What is lacking is a flow of medium-sized investments in manufacturing
businesses,' Mr Ryrie said.
He said private investment in sub-Saharan Africa has been running at about
Dollars 8bn a year, with foreign private investment contributing less than
Dollars 1bn a year.
Net official development assistance to the region between 1980-89 had been
Dollars 105bn, or about Dollars 30 per capita each year. He said the flow of
aid had 'no parallel in history' but standards of living had continued to
fall.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Politics of bribery claims a fresh victim in Japan: Why the
downfall of a close associate is putting Miyazawa on the defensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY JAPANESE political standards, the downfall of Mr Fumio Abe, the senior
Japanese politician arrested on Monday for alleged bribe taking, has more to
do with ineptitude than corruption. Instead of spreading his favours and his
sources of finance, Mr Abe relied heavily on one rather shoddy property
development company for his money.
The case has drawn comparisons with the demise of Mr Sousuke Uno, the
short-stay prime minister entangled in the 'geisha' scandal of 1989. It is
no secret that Japanese politicians often keep mistresses, but Mr Uno was
thought particularly inept because his stinginess prompted a frustrated
companion to tell all to the tabloid press.
Mr Abe, who admitted himself to hospital in the time-honoured tradition of
the scandal-afflicted, appears to have had a lifestyle no more lavish than
other senior MPs. He dined well in Tokyo's nightlife districts and is said
to have bought a gold-plated watch for a well-known actress who caught his
eye, but prosecutors have been unable to uncover any truly outlandish
exploits by a man who routinely flew economy class.
One of Mr Abe's staff alleged that his boss had received a significant
amount of money - reportedly Y500m (Pounds 2.2m) - from Kyowa, a steel frame
manufacturer turned property developer, but that Mr Abe had done nothing out
of the ordinary in collecting his money. 'He acted as a go-between for the
company - everybody does that.'
But not 'everybody' is a close associate of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, who is dependent on the tolerance of other Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) factions for his power. Mr Abe was the Miyazawa faction manager
until a month ago, when the the scandal forced him to resign the post.
The largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, formerly the
Japan Socialist Party, says it will apply the blowtorch to the prime
minister's belly when parliament resumes next week. Mr Miyazawa has denied
reports that his faction received Kyowa money, but he will be forced to
offer a detailed explanation, and to clarify again his role in the Recruit
stocks-for-favours scandal of 1988-89.
It is Mr Miyazawa's hope that the new scandal will slip into the recesses of
the voters' memory before an Upper House election in the summer that is
likely to determine whether he has a second year in office. Not that the LDP
will lose power, but if the party does not regain control of the house,
other faction heads will probably decide that Mr Miyazawa does not deserve
an extension of his tenure.
Given the slowness of the Japanese judicial process, it could be a decade or
so before final judgment is passed on the unfortunate Mr Abe. But the coming
weeks are likely to see a rush of embarrassing allegations made against the
former cabinet minister, now fair game for the often merciless Japanese
tabloid press.
Whatever the sum received by Mr Abe, 69, who characterises himself as a
battler made good, the charges against him centre on Y80m and the alleged
leaking of planning information during his stint as director-general of the
Hokkaido Development Agency from August 1989.
The case is a by-product of the financial excesses of the late 1980s, as
Kyowa was a long-established maker of steel frames for the construction
industry until a change of management and a sudden embrace of property
development. As a result, the company allegedly sought confidential
information from Mr Abe about the route of a new Hokkaido motorway with a
view to buying property in the vicinity.
Kyowa collapsed in late November 1990, after an increase in interest rates
and a softening of the property market undermined its ambitious resort and
golf course projects, and left it with outstanding debts of about Y200bn.
But, in its last two years of life, the newly-aggressive company managed to
tarnish several prestigious names.
In mid-1990, Kyowa was involved in a serious of fictitious deals that led to
the bankruptcy of a steel trader and the sullying of the reputation of
Marubeni the trading house, in whose famous name the fraudulent deals were
made. A Marubeni manager was later arrested and the company admitted that
its 'honour and reputation' had been damaged by Kyowa.
It remains to be seen how much Mr Miyazawa's honour and reputation will be
affected by the new scandal. Even though he resigned as finance minister in
1988 after admitting that one of his aides accepted cut-price stock offered
by Recruit, Mr Miyazawa was thought to be a 'clean' politician. The arrest
of a close associate can only harm that image.
The prime minister would regain public respect if he pushed ahead with an
overhaul of the electoral system and other reforms intended to make Japanese
politics cheaper for the participants and thus less prone to financial
scandal. But Mr Miyazawa will be cautious, as the enthusiasm of Mr Toshiki
Kaifu, the former prime minister, for these very same reforms irritated the
LDP elders and prompted them to terminate his mandate abruptly late last
year.

FT  15 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Mercedes leads Czech truck race - Imminent
restructuring for foreign involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czechoslovak truck industry faces sweeping restructuring soon as
intensified negotiations between western buyers, local companies and
government reach a head.
Last week Mercedes Benz, the vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany,
signed joint venture letters of intent with Avia and Liaz, local
manufacturers of light and heavy on-road trucks respectively.
If agreed by the government, which has until March 30 to decide, the deal
will place Mercedes in a position to dominate the country's truck industry,
beating competition from Renault of France and Iveco of Italy.
The Czechoslovak truck industry is made up of Avia, Liaz and Tatra, the
off-road truck maker. Its restructuring is likely to involve the merging of
at least two under the umbrella of a joint venture with a foreign partner.
Negotiations have been dragging, however, as industry and government
officials try to reconcile the need to bring in foreign capital and the
desire to maintain, at least in part, the independence of the Czech-oslovak
truck industry, whose tradition goes back to the 1920s.
The Czech government retains the right to reject Avia's choice of the German
group. Mr Jan Vrba, industry minister, was quoted in the local press this
week as saying that specific requirements made by Mercedes were 'wholly
unacceptable' and that compromises would have to be reached.
These requirements include important tax breaks for 10 years from the
formation of the joint venture or five years if profits are made. They also
include the imposition for six years of a 40 per cent customs duty on
imports of utility vehicles.
While negotiations will focus on these issues, the government also reserves
the right to consider new proposals from rivals such as Renault. Under the
country's large-scale privatisation programme, competitive bids can still be
submitted up to January 20. If the deal is approved, the venture would be
created in July. Mr Zdenek Bakala, head of the Prague office of Credit
Suisse First Boston, which advises both Avia and the Industry Ministry,
says: 'Very clear financial advantages must be put forward in order for the
deal to go through. If not, the government may re-open discussions with
non-German investors.'
Under the agreement, the German group will acquire an initial 31 per cent of
Avia and 20 per cent of Liaz, which will contribute its motor assembly line
in Jablonec. Mercedes will invest DM350m (Pounds 123.2m) over the next three
years and raise significantly its equity participation in Avia.
Mercedes intends over the next two years to replace the production of Avia
trucks, which have been manufactured under a Saviem-Renault licence since
1967.
The German company will instead make two types of its own small and
medium-sized trucks.
Sales plummeted last year as a result of the recession in the domestic
market and collapse of the Comecon trade on which all three enterprises
relied heavily for their exports.
Avia, which in 1991 had a turnover of Kcs4.1bn (Pounds 75.9m), has been
faring better than its siblings because it was able to maintain its domestic
sales, which average 9,000 trucks. Producing smaller trucks and vans, the
company has been able to tap into the nascent entrepreneurial private sector
in the country.
Its exports have fallen dramatically, however, mostly because the former
Soviet Union, which in 1990 imported 21.8 per cent of its output, is unable
to renew orders.
By comparison, Tatra, which produced an estimated 10,500 heavy off-road
trucks in 1991, has found buyers among Siberian oil companies able to pay
with supplies of raw materials, mainly because of trade joint ventures set
up in the region by Motokov, Czechoslovakia's main exporter of trucks.
Technically competitive in world markets, Tatra's self-confidence was
particularly boosted when more than 1,300 trucks were bought by the allied
forces during the Gulf war.
Despite the interest of both Iveco and Mercedes, the enterprise recently put
forth a privatisation project which would leave, in a first stage, nearly
all its equity in the hands of Czechoslovak citizens in the form of
vouchers.
Foreign investors would have a chance to acquire a stake in Tatra at a later
stage though, according to Mr Oldrich Svajda, deputy director of Motokov.
Liaz, by far the worst off of the three companies, suffered an important
fall in production this year.
While output reached 15,000 trucks in 1990, sales for 1991 are estimated to
have been less than 5,000.
The company's decline stems mostly from its reliance for sales on hard-hit
domestic buyers, such as construction companies.

THE automobile committee of the European Business Committee submitted a
statement yesterday to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
proposing a target of 10 per cent of the Japanese market for European cars
in 1995 and 17.5 per cent in 2000, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
European cars presently hold 4 per cent of Japan's car market.
The EBC is a Tokyo-based advisory committee to the European Community,
representing companies from EC member states doing business in Japan. The
proposed targets do not include Japanese-brand cars made in Europe.
Last week Japanese car makers announced plans to more than double their
purchases of US-made cars and car parts to Dollars 19bn (Pounds 10.6bn) by
1994/95. An EBC official said European car makers wanted the Japanese
government to buy cars, grant preferential tax treatment and revise
regulations on construction of dealerships.

JAPANESE car makers operating in the US have launched an outspoken attack
against the Big Three US vehicle producers, intensifying the bitter debate
over Japanese car sales in the US.
Mr Richard Recchia, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America and a former Chrysler executive, said the
difficulties faced by the US auto industry had been caused by its inability
'to change to meet world-wide competition'.
Mr Recchia was responding to the attack on Japan led by Mr Lee Iacocca,
chairman of Chrysler, at the end of last week. On his return from Tokyo,
where the chairmen of the Big Three car makers - General Motors, Ford, and
Chrysler - were part of the delegation accompanying President George Bush,
Mr Iacocca accused Japan of 'predatory' trade practices and claimed that the
Japanese had the US auto industry 'targeted'.
In a speech to the Automotive News World Congress, Mr Recchia, said: 'It
seems that when economic times are tough in the US, there is a latent
ugliness in America that bubbles to the top. That ugliness very often
becomes apparent not only in political rhetoric but also sometimes in
business rhetoric.'
Protectionist legislation is being proposed in the US Congress which would
further restrict Japanese vehicle imports and impose curbs on vehicles built
in Japanese plants in the US, so-called transplants.
Mr Recchia claimed that the US auto industry had failed to take advantage of
the period since 1982 when a voluntary limit was accepted for Japanese auto
exports to the US.
Instead of driving for increased market share and instead of taking
advantage of the limited availability of products to the Japanese importers,
US auto producers had pushed for increased prices and increased profits, he
said. Combined profits of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, had risen from
Dollars 6.2bn in 1983 to a peak of Dollars 11.2bn (Pounds 6.2bn) in 1988.

FT  15 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Rover plants in Russia seen as long-term
vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, said yesterday it was
prepared in principle to involve itself in car manufacturing in Russia,
including the possible transfer of production equipment for its Montego
range after UK production finishes in around two years' time.
But it said the subject had been raised only in passing, during talks over
the sale of an initial 5,000 built-up Montegos this year, which it is hoped
will increase to up to 50,000 Rover models of all kinds from 1993 onwards.
Reports that Rover was actually negotiating on a manufacturing plant, joint
venture or other initiatives were 'hopelessly premature', a Rover spokesman
declared.
Speculation over a possible involvement by Rover in a Russian vehicle
manufacturing venture has been spurred by the arrival in the UK this week of
a delegation from NAMI, the former Soviet, now Russian, state-controlled
entity responsible for controlling the standards of imported cars and the
conditions of their sale.
However, Rover insisted yesterday that its only contacts with the NAMI
delegation will take place tomorrow and Friday, when Rover is scheduled to
undertake a series of 'teach-ins' for the Russians.
These entail the setting up sales and service facilities for the Montegos,
which are being sold to Russia under a Pounds 50m deal arranged through
Orbicom, an Anglo-Soviet trading company based in Shrewsbury.
Orbicom is forming a joint venture company with NAMI which provides for the
establishment of a Rover test centre in Moscow and the setting up of a
dealer network for Rover vehicles in Russia. The first outlets, in Moscow
and St Petersburg, are to open in the Spring. Rover itself plans to have no
equity stake or other direct participation in the sales and distribution
venture.
Mr Mark Jones, Orbicom's chairman, said last night that both Orbicom and
NAMI had held outline discussions with Rover about the possibilities of
eventual manufacture. However, this was very much a long-term issue.
'It has very much to be market driven', said Mr Jones. Unlike some
transferred car manufacturing ventures, Orbicom insists that the Montego is
viewed as a high quality vehicle in Russia 'which is sold up against
perceived rivals like the Mercedes 190.'

FT  15 JAN 92 / EC must embrace eastern states, says Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday suggested bringing
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary speedily into a broader form of European
political union to help support their fledgling democratic systems.
Spelling out eastern Europe's vulnerability to economic and political
backlash, Mr Hurd said it was against western Europe's interest that 'a
quagmire of disillusioned, disappointed and disgruntled states' should arise
east of the Oder-Neisse.
In all the former communist countries - including the independent republics
in the former Soviet Union - 'democracy is not irreversible,' Mr Hurd told
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons.
'Democracy must deliver the goods - in a literal and a metaphorical sense.'
Eastern Europe had probably been 'innoculated for the time being' against a
return to totalitarianism by their experience under communism. But,
reflecting their much longer history of one-party rule, this was not true of
the Soviet republics, Mr Hurd warned.
Incorporating Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary into a wider 'political
dialogue' with the EC would help bridge the gap before they became full
members of the Community. He said he would be 'disappointed' if this step
did not take place before the year 2000.
Mr Hurd hailed the association agreements signed between the three eastern
European countries and the EC last month, intended to speed up their
integration in the economic sphere.
He voiced renewed concern about the problems of controlling nuclear weapons
across former Soviet territories. This will be a key issue in his
discussions in Russia, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine during a visit to India
and the former Soviet Union starting today.
Russia has agreed to take over the nuclear control obligations of the Soviet
Union. Two of the other republics with strategic nuclear weapons  - Ukraine
and Belarus - have agreed to become non-nuclear signatories to the Nuclear
Proliferation Treaty, while Kazakhstan will probably do so before long.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, was moving quickly yesterday to
resolve a delicate political crisis after his health minister, Mr Julian
Garcia Valverde, was forced to resign. Mr Gonzalez, to whom cabinet changes
are anathema, was understood to be preparing to name a successor.
Mr Garcia Valverde resigned because of a growing scandal surrounding land
speculation near Madrid by the state railway monopoly, Renfe, of which he
was president before being promoted to the government nearly a year ago. He
thus became the first minister in any of Mr Gonzalez's governments since the
Socialists first came to power in 1982 to resign as a direct result of
corruption charges, despite a string of political scandals.
El Pais, the country's biggest newspaper, yesterday welcomed the
resignation. 'In a country that seems to be getting used to a rigid division
between the reality of the lives of its citizens and their political
leaders, and in which the word resignation appears to have no place, Mr
Garcia Valverde's decision is highly significant,' it said.
By taking responsibility for a series of payments by Renfe to intermediaries
in order to buy land which it hoped to sell later to finance the
construction of a new railway line, Mr Garcia Valverde has overnight
converted himself into a minor folk hero. Last year alone the government was
caught up in at least four serious corruption scandals.
Mr Gonzalez, who is anxious to discard his government's shaky ethical image,
is understood to want to appoint a successor to Mr Garcia Valverde quickly
and is unlikely to use the resignation as an excuse for a large cabinet
reshuffle. But there are serious doubts about the health of his veteran
foreign minister, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, whom illness forced to
miss last month's Maastricht summit.
A rapid appointment to the health portfolio would help the prime minister
allay speculation that he might call a general election before he has to in
October 1993.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Russia takes control of foreign debt bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA HAS completed its takeover of the former Soviet banking institutions
by taking Vnesheconombank, the foreign affairs bank responsible for paying
the estimated Dollars 84bn Soviet foreign debt, under its direct control.
Under the terms of a resolution of the presidium of the Russian parliament
adopted on Monday, the bank is likely to be split into three parts - one
acting as an agency for foreign debt servicing, the second as an independent
commercial bank, and the third being merged with Vneshtorgbank, the Russian
foreign economic bank.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the Russian central bank chairman, said yesterday there
was no agreement between the republics on sharing the debt between them, and
that calculations about individual shares were 'very difficult, almost
impossible: after all, these debts were accumulated in the course of 74
years (the Soviet period)'.
He said the request for a postponement on any repayments of the former
Soviet debt - made yesterday by Russian negotiators in Frankfurt to a
committee of banks headed by Deutsche Bank - should be confined to at most
one year.
'It would be more useful to us to change the structure of the repayments,
giving us a longer period to repay, rather than a long postponement of
repayment. Now about half the debt has to be repaid in a year or so,' he
said.
Mr Matiukhin confirmed earlier indications that the bank and the Russian
government intend to introduce a special rate - to be set at between Rbs8
and Rbs10 to the dollar - at which foreign investors planning to buy shares
in Russian enterprises would be required to change money.
This would be far below the present market rate. Mr Matiukhin said that
unless this was done, 'they (foreign investors) could buy everything at
fantastically low prices'.
The Russian bank has fixed the rate of exchange at Rbs110 to the dollar,
roughly shadowing the market rate.
'Our task here is to increase the rate of the rouble against the dollar as
quickly as possible. Otherwise, given the rate of the rouble to the dollar,
paralysis of the economy would be inevitable.'
He said the bank was now operating a 'very tough' monetary policy,
restricting the issuing of credit to banks - including the central banks of
other republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States - to set amounts
which they could exceed only by paying 20 per cent interest.

FT  15 JAN 92 / Klepsch wins easy victory for presidency: European
Parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EGON KLEPSCH yesterday won a relatively easy victory over three rivals to
become the new president of the European Parliament.
The 1989 deal between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists - the two
biggest battalions at Strasbourg - to split the presidency over the
five-year life of the current parliament ensured victory for Mr Klepsch, the
German leader of Christian Democrat MEPs. He won 253 votes out of 474 cast,
and is succeeded as CD leader by Mr Leo Tindemans, a former Belgian prime
minister.
Mr Klepsch follows Mr Enrique Baron, a Spanish Socialist, in a job that has
a powerful influence on the internal organisation - or disorganisation - of
the Community's legislature and on its negotiations with the Brussels
Commission and the Council of Ministers.
Having a German presiding over the European parliament should give
Chancellor Helmut Kohl extra ammunition against his domestic critics who
complain that he did not win enough political concessions at last month's
Maastricht summit to justify surrendering the D-mark into a European
monetary union.
A strong belief in consensus politics has helped push Mr Klepsch to the top
of the greasy pole in Strasbourg over nearly 20 years as an MEP. But many of
the UK Labour MEPs, the largest national contingent in the Socialist group,
balked at what they saw as a Faustian compact with the Christian Democrats.
Ironically, the price the CDs have paid for the presidency has been to turn
over to the Socialists the chairmanship of most of the important committees.
Close co-operation between the CDs and Socialists, who together pool 3,083
votes in the 518-member parliament, is made more necessary by the Maastricht
requirement that the parliament muster an absolute majority - 260 votes - to
exercise its new law-making powers.
But the two big groups have taken their co-operation a stage further by
supporting rule changes that would prevent smaller political groupings from
cluttering up Strasbourg plenary sessions with myriad amendments.
Mr Klepsch strongly backs this efficiency drive. But for someone considered
a procedural expert, he has been rather cavalier about rules himself. On
more than one occasion he has been caught pushing voting buttons for an
absent group colleague as well as for himself. Only last week he said he had
seen nothing wrong with this: it had been common in legislatures like the
French National Assembly.
The verb to 'klepsch' has now entered the Strasbourg vocabulary to describe
such sleight of hand.

FT  14 JAN 92 / L'affaire Lindros puts Canada's language differences on the
ice: The athlete who snubbed francophone Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERIC LINDROS is one of North America's finest up-and-coming athletes. Named
by the New York Times as the sportsman to watch in 1992, the lanky 18-year
old Canadian ice-hockey player is already being compared to the legendary
Wayne Gretzky, 12 years his senior.
Unfortunately, Canadian politics and the peculiar way ice hockey does
business have thrown a cloud over Lindros's career. Every hockey buff (and
many others too) seems to have a view on whether Eric is a spoilt brat or an
astute businessman, a small-town bigot or a normal teenager who just wants
to feel at home in the place where he earns a living.
In francophone Quebec, 'l'affaire Lindros' has little to do with No 88's
skills on the ice. The refusal by an English-speaking Ontario boy to play
for a team in French-speaking Quebec City has become a cause celebre
reflecting the ethnic prejudice many of Quebec's 5m francophones detect in
anglophone Canada.
Feelings are running so high that several Quebec members of parliament want
Lindros barred from Canada's team to the 1992 winter Olympics. Even prime
minister Brian Mulroney has been drawn in, trying to smooth French-Canadian
feathers by singing the praises of Quebec City.
The Lindros affair has also put a spotlight on the cartel-like National
Hockey League, in which team owners decide among themselves on the rules for
selecting rising players. 'Everyone has the right to work where they want to
work,' Lindros told a Canadian magazine recently. 'The old way has got to
change.'
Under NHL rules, the bottom team at the end of the season gets first choice
in the following year's 'draft', where new players are distributed among the
22 teams. The system is designed to even out talent and prevent wealthy
owners in cities such as New York and Montreal buying up all the best
players.
To no one's surprise, the laggards of the 1990/91 season, the Quebec
Nordiques, pounced on Lindros at last June's draft.
But Lindros and his ambitious parents had already made it clear that, if
called, he would not serve. When the Nordiques' pick was announced in front
of the TV cameras, Lindros pointedly turned his back on the tradition of
donning a team jersey.
At first, the reason the Lindroses gave was money. The deal Quebec offered,
reportedly worth between CDollars 30m (Dollars 26.3m) and CDollars 50m over
10 years, was not generous enough. Playing for a mediocre team from a
smallish city in French-speaking Quebec, the Lindroses reasoned, would limit
Eric's income from advertising contracts and sponsorships.
The fuss might have died down had the Lindroses then not made some
indiscreet remarks about Quebec politics, and how difficult life would be in
Quebec City for a monolingual teenager from Oshawa. 'He'd be living in a
community that's an emotional time bomb,' Lindros senior told the Toronto
Globe &amp; Mail recently, referring to the debate on Quebec separatism.
Lindros and his supporters are urging the Nordiques to trade him to a team
more to his liking. The Nordiques could probably pick up several first-rate
players in exchange.
But under NHL rules the team owns the rights to its draft choice for another
two years. It initially took a hard line, hoping that Lindros might change
his mind and help revive its flagging fortunes. Mr Jamie Wayne, a Toronto
sportswriter, notes that 'he's the sort of asset any team waits a lifetime
to get'.
The Nordiques have, however, lately reconciled themselves to Lindros never
putting on their jersey. In early January the team's general manager said he
was willing to consider offers from other clubs for the young
superstar-to-be.
For the time being, Lindros remains with the Oshawa Generals, an amateur
team from the gritty industrial city east of Toronto where General Motors'
Canadian subsidiary has its head office. But he has already signed
advertising contracts worth at least half a million dollars.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Europe warned it must act on immigration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE should adopt a continent-wide approach to controlling what could be a
flood of immigration from the former Soviet Union, according to the
Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies.
In a report on the 'new realities' after the Soviet collapse, the
London-based security think-tank said that up to 3m Soviet immigrants could
arrive over the next 18 months.
'By refusing to confront the problem head on western Europe has not merely
exacerbated the threat of migration but left the east Europeans dangerously
exposed.'
The report proposes standardised entry requirements, quotas for religious
and political refugees and a pooling of relief aid.
It also warns against underestimating the power of Russian nationalism and
the tenacity of the Russian authoritarian tradition.
'The threat of the further disintegration of Russia itself raised the
spectre of a revived, albeit ostensibly defensive, Russian nationalism which
might seek to preserve its control by force over the dissident non-Russians
within its borders.'
The report also points to the large Russian minorities in many of the new
republics which 'must inevitably constitute potential flashpoints for ethnic
tensions'.
It also warns that Kazakhstan 'may well succumb to Islamic fundamentalism'
because its development, and that of the other Moslem republics, was held
back by communism.
The report urges western support for the Commonwealth of Independent States.
'The west should be grateful that instead of a rabble-rouser calling the
masses to revolution, we have seen eight leaders, three of them
democratically elected, sitting around a table and drawing up a blueprint
that enshrines human rights, the principles of a market economy and strict
control of all weapons, including nuclear.'
But, it concludes 'such a structure may not survive. The emerging picture is
still one of heightened instability and volatility. . . . This is a danger
which must be armed against. In the long term, Russia's economic potential
and military power will inevitably ensure that it returns as a very powerful
player on the world stage'.

FT  14 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures lead an erratic equity sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC and currency worries continued to overhang the UK stock market
yesterday and share prices again traced a sharply erratic pattern, often
directed by the trend of stock index futures. Although there was no lack of
specific features, trading volume overall slipped back from last week's
slightly improved levels.
The stock market was unsettled by the growing sounds of the political battle
building up ahead of this year's general election in the UK. The latest
statistics on domestic consumer credit, showing a dip in new credit and also
the fourth consecutive monthly fall in net credit, together with a very
modest increase in November's retail sales, appeared to undermine further
hopes that consumers will lead the UK economy out of recession still
overhanging the broad range of manufacturing companies.
Concern over the outlook for UK interest rates continued as the pound,
although calmer yesterday, softened further against the German D-Mark. Hints
of further strains among the home loan companies were no help to underlying
investment confidence in the equity sector.
The first day of the new equity account opened with share prices generally
lower in reaction to falls in stock prices in both Tokyo and New York.
London's setback was emphasised when an early premium on the FT-SE March
contract immediately brought in sellers, first of the future and then of the
underlying stocks.
A loss of 21 on the Footsie scale, however, was recovered as sterling
performed steadily and London picked up hints of a firmer opening on Wall
Street. The early setback in the Footsie was converted into a 13.7 points
gain. In the event, the Dow Average was a few points easier in UK hours but
the Footsie received further encouragement in late dealings from a renewed
rally in the futures market.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,490.1 for a rise of 12.2 on
the day. At the session's best, the Footsie was still more than eight points
short of the 2,500 mark, and traders said there was not enough support
behind equities yesterday to give credence to this fresh move towards an
important chart hurdle.
Seaq volume slipped to 429.3m shares from Friday's 589.7m and dealers
believed that yesterday's total took in an increased proportion of
intra-market business. Customer, or retail, business increased at the end of
last week as some profits were taken.
Some disappointment was expressed yesterday that the new account had not
brought much sign of institutional buying.
Among the heavyweight blue chip stocks, bullish views on the US dollar kept
share prices firm. Oil shares staged a recovery as some UK securities firms
restored BP and Shell to their buying lists. But the UK financial sector
remained nervous, and modest losses were scattered across the leading names.
Pharmaceuticals, however, still seen as the most favoured sector for the
1990s, moved forward again, led by Glaxo.
The disappointing data on UK domestic credit made little impact on a retail
sector which had already failed to sustain its Christmas rally. Share prices
for the high street stores edged higher yesterday, but traders said this was
a technical rally rather than a change of stance by investors.

FT  14 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK index futures sector finally boiled over yesterday, at least for a
while, and a hurried shrinking of the premium on the March FT-SE contract
brought some rapid footwork in the stock market by leading securities firms,
writes our markets staff.
The March contract opened firmly, showing a premium of about 26 points
compared with an estimated 22-point premium on fair value, the calculation
which allows for financing and dividend flows.
Sellers quickly appeared, as London traders noted the fall in Tokyo, and the
future came back smartly, driving the stock market down. By midsession the
March contract was close to fair value, and a few buyers appeared again.
This was the pattern for most of the session, until in the final minutes of
stock market trading the March contract advanced again, taking share prices
with it. Traders doubted whether the premium could avoid further selling
this morning.
In traded options, business was reduced and only 18,384 contracts traded,
compared with 24,779 on Friday. The FT-SE contract remained busy, however,
recording 4,832 deals against 4,988. British Airways topped the active
stocks list with 1,779 contracts traded.

to equity sector

<TEXT>
Wall Street
WEAKNESS in the bond markets fed through into equities yesterday, with share
prices edging lower in relatively light trading, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 13.86 down at 3,185.60. The more
broadly based Standard &amp;Poor's 500 eased 0.76 to 414.34, but the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks bucked the wider market trend, rising
1.93 to 617.63. Turnover on the New York SE was modest by recent standards
at 200m shares.
There was little to spark yesterday's selling, save for further increases in
bond rates amid dwindling hopes for another cut in interest rates. The stock
market had shared those hopes, so it was no surprise that equity prices
softened, especially as some investors began taking profits after the big
gains during the turn-of-the-year rally.
Among individual stocks, Citicorp advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 in
turnover of 6.1m shares after the troubled banking group predicted that it
would report a Dollars 125m loss for the fourth quarter of 1991, and one of
up to Dollars 475m for the full year. The extent of the losses were expected
by Wall Street, and investors took comfort in the bank's prediction that it
would return to profitability in 1992.
Chase Manhattan was also in the earnings picture yesterday, the stock adding
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 20 1/4 after news of a 30 per cent decline in
fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 135m which left full-year profits at
Dollars 620m. JP Morgan, depressed by profit-taking, shed Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 65 3/4 .
Oil shares bucked the wider market trend, thanks to a rally in crude oil
prices which took them back above Dollars 18 a barrel. Chevron moved up
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 68 1/4 , British Petroleum ADRs Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 62 1/2 , Exxon Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 59 1/4 and Texaco Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 59 1/8 .
Reports that full tests on the safety of silicone breast implants produced
by Dow Corning were delayed for several years, and that tests which were
conducted were inadequate, left Corning Dollars 10 5/8 weaker at Dollars 68
3/8 .
On the American Stock Exchange, Enzo Biochem jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars
5 3/4 on news that the company's diagnostics unit is introducing eight
products which will help researchers identify and trace the origins of
metastatic cancers.
Leading stocks on the over-the-counter market were mostly firmer, with Amgen
up Dollars 1 at Dollars 76 3/4 , Sun Microsystems Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at
Dollars 32 and Microsoft Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 127 1/8 . The
exception was MCI Communications, down Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 31 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks took a breather after last week's heavy gains and ended flat
in moderate trade. Dealers said, however, that the market is becoming
increasingly optimistic that recent cuts in US and Canadian interest rates
will be enough to spur a recovery in the economy.
The composite index finished just 1.0 higher at 3,594.4. Declining issues
narrowly led advances by 334 to 293 following a volume of 26.4m shares,
against 44m on Friday.
Rogers Communications said it will issue 13.3m units at CDollars 15.10 a
unit. Each unit is composed of one class 'B' share and half a warrant to
purchase an additional 'B' share for CDollars 17. Rogers 'B' fell CDollars
7/8 to CDollars 13 7/8 , while the 'A' shares slipped CDollars 1 3/8 to
CDollars 14 1/4 .
MDS Health Group 'A' gained CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 21 and 'B' CDollars 1
3/8 to CDollars 20 1/2 . Corning said it agreed to buy MDS Health's US
clinical-laboratory business and assets.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips in quiet session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE foreign exchange markets saw cautious trading yesterday, with the dollar
consolidating after a strong upward run at the end of last week and sterling
remaining just above its floor within the European exchange rate mechanism,
writes Simon London.
Having peaked in New York on Friday, the dollar eased slightly during Far
Eastern trading yesterday from the US closing level.
By the close in Tokyo, the dollar stood at DM1.5720, down from New York's
DM1.5735 finish and a high of DM1.5880 in US trading. The pattern was
similar against the yen, with the dollar ending at Y126.70, from Y127.05.
Dealers said trading in the US currency now had little direction following
better than expected US non-farm employment data on Friday.
The figures left a balance of dealers prepared to buy the dollar on
expectations of a further rise, and banks which retain a negative outlook
for the currency.
Further US economic releases this week could crystalise the position. Today,
retail sales figures will be announced, followed by retail price inflation
figures on Thursday.
A quiet morning session in Europe saw the US currency tread water, closing
at DM1.5725 and Y126.80 in London, from DM1.5825 and Y127.00 on Friday. In
New York the dollar edged up to end at DM1.5780 and Y127.05.
Sterling remained pinned close to its floor within the ERM grid. Having
opened at around DM2.8380, from a close on Friday of DM2.84, the pound
weakened slowly through the day to end at DM2.8350.
The UK currency's effective floor stood at DM2.8330, as determined by the
position of the Spanish peseta within the ERM, little changed from last
week.
Dealers said negative sentiment against sterling was increased by the
weekend publication of the first opinion polls of the new year, which showed
the opposition Labour party holding a lead of 5 percentage points over the
government.
The D-Mark itself could be tested by the outcome of the current round of
wage negotiations between employers and unions in the steel sector, seen as
setting the trend for the rest of German industry. The union meets today to
consider its next action in pursuit of a 10.5 per cent pay increase.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar firmed after concerted intervention by the
domestic monetary authorities and the US Federal Reserve, following a
one-point cut in interest rates last week. The Australian currency closed at
Dollars 0.7420, up from Dollars 0.7365 on Friday.
The Canadian dollar was buoyed by the launch of several international bond
issues, including Ontarion Hydro's CDollars 1.5bn global bond issue. From a
close on Friday in Canadian trading of CDollars 1.1543 against the US
dollar, the Canadian dollar strengthened to end at CDollars 1.1485 in
London, just off its high of CDollars 1.1460.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates close level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK money rates were squeezed higher yesterday as sterling remained under
pressure on the foreign exchange markets, but closed little changed from
Friday, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the
morning, later revised up to Pounds 1.1bn.
In early assistance, the Bank injected Pounds 456m funding, including a
Pounds 90m repurchase agreement maturing in equal portions on January 27 and
28 at 10 7/16 per cent.
In addition, the Bank purchased outright band 1 bank bills at 10 7/8 per
cent, band 3 bank bills at 10 3/16 per cent and band 4 bank bills at 10 1/8
per cent. In late morning a further Pounds 122m assistance was forthcoming,
comprising purchases of band 1, band 3 and band 4 bills at the same rates.
An afternoon liquidity injection comprising the purchase of Pounds 179m band
1 and band 3 bills was followed by Pounds 310m late assistance. This brought
total assistance for the day to Pounds 1.067bn, just short of the forecast
liquidity shortage.
The squeeze on liquidity during the day forced overnight unsecured money
rates up to 11 per cent in the afternoon session, from 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent
at the close on Friday, before falling back to close at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per
cent.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange finished at 89.49.
In Frankfurt, call money interest rates were squeezed upwards as financial
institutions moved to build reserves ahead of a deadline for taxation
payments later this month. Overnight money traded at 9.45/55 per cent, from
the 9.40/50 per cent level which prevailed for most of last week.
Market participants commented that rates could be pushed higher still during
the middle of this week, although most expect call rates to remain below the
9.75 per cent Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate for
financial institutions.
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan recalled Y80bn loans from financial institutions
in the face of a forecast Y110bn liquidity surplus. In spite of this action,
overnight money rates declined to 5 3/8 per cent, from 5 1/2 per cent on
Friday.
Today, market conditions should be tighter. The Bank of Japan said it will
set a Y300bn auction-style repurchase pact for funds maturing on February
25.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec expected to agree formula
for output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIYADH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GULF OIL industry officials were optimistic yesterday that the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree on a formula to cut output for
the second quarter.
They expected the decision to be taken at Opec's next ministerial meeting on
February 12, if, as expected, demand for crude of members states looked set
to fall.
Moreover, an agreement to reduce output could take immediate effect after
the meeting in Geneva. Saudi Arabia is prepared to cut its output, at
present running at near capacity of 8.5m barrels a day, provided it does not
have to bear the greatest part of any overall cut in output, the official
said.
Opec agreed at its last ministerial meeting in Vienna in November to allow
its 11 fully producing members to pump oil flat out for the first quarter of
this year - rolling over a notional ceiling of 23.65m b/d from its September
summit.
However, the Opec ministers deferred until the February meeting the more
ticklish question of where to set output when demand for Opec oil is
expected to soften.
A production-cutting deal in February would be unlikely to entail a return
to a quota system as such.
Quotas were last formally agreed by Opec at its July, 1990, meeting, before
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Rather, oil industry officials suggested, ministers might agree a flat-rate
percentage cut to be made by all producers.
Algeria, which has been among the most vocal in calling for tighter Opec
discipline, is understood to have signalled its readiness to agree to some
such formula.
Saudi Arabia could favour such an approach, not least because this would
preserve its augmented share of Opec output since the Gulf crisis.
Saudi oil now accounts for more than 36 per cent of Opec output, against
less than 25 per cent before August 2, 1990.
The kingdom, which pumped 5.4m b/d under its July, 1990, quota, will also
insist that cuts should be made based on production capacity, which now lies
near 9m b/d for Saudi Arabia, since its accelerated expansion programme
began during the Gulf crisis.
Kuwait, which is now lifting 550,000 b/d, will be exempted from any cuts to
allow the emirate to recoup revenues lost during the crisis.
Iraq looks certain to remain sidelined during the second quarter, despite
making some progress in recent talks with the UN on the export of Dollars
1.6bn worth of oil under a permitted exception to the oil embargo against
Baghdad.

<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN and Caribbean banana producers have made little progress in
their effort to resolve differences over their approach to the European
market. But theyhave agreed to continue their discussions.
At a meeting in Belize at the weekend, government leaders and ministers
sought to reconcile the Caribbean desire for a continuation of protected
access when the single European market is created in just under a year, and
the Latin American position that the market should be totally free to all
producers.
Caribbean producers have said they cannot compete on an open market because
their production costs are about one third higher than those of the Latin
producers. The European Community has said Caribbean producers will be 'no
worse off' than they are now when the single market is created.
Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, told the meeting that the
banana industry was important to the small economies of the Caribbean
islands, and that they needed continued privileged access to guaranteed
markets in Europe.
Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's foreign trade minister, and Mr Juan Luis
Miron, Guatemala's economy minister, said the banana trade should be
deregulated and included in the current Uruguay Round of negotiations under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
A statement issued after the meeting said the Latin American and Caribbean
countries recognised the social and economic value of the banana industry,
and said the discussions would continue.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oman wants fishermen to cast
their nets wider - Decades of over-exploitation of inshore waters have hit
stocks hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KHOZEM MERCHANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMAN'S FISHERMAN are casting their eyes - and nets  - a little further
afield these days. They are venturing into the fertile continental shelf,
beyond the narrow strip of inshore water off the Omani coast where for
decades fishermen have practised their trade.
This concentration of activity in inshore waters has led to huge
over-fishing, notably of high-value lobsters and abalone in the south. The
continental shelf offers a relative bounty: plenty of high-quality
king-fish, tuna and Spanish mackerel.
Official concern at the over-fishing in 1990 prompted a joint survey by Oman
and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation of the country's 200-mile
exclusive zone. The report will 'form the basis of determining the total
catch in Omani waters', says Mr Thabit Zahran al-Abdul Salaam, director of
the Marine Sciences and Fisheries Centre, the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries' research arm.
'After so much over-fishing, we need to manage our resources in a more
responsible manner otherwise they will be depleted; we must encourage
fishermen to exploit the richer fields further away,' he adds.
Poor quality wooden houri (boats) have for decades confined fishermen to
inshore waters. In any case, few boats possessed any form of modern cooling
and processing equipment, necessary for longer journeys. Also, lobsters and
abalone, among the more sedentary fish in inshore waters, were easy targets
for fishermen reluctant to change the ways of a lifetime.
Nevertheless, the government has over the past two decades tried to change
age-old ways. It has offered generous incentives and loans for the purchase
of high-quality fibre-glass boats; distribution and marketing of fish has
been improved; and several 200-tonne government-funded cold storage centres
have been set up, some recently sold to the private sector in a bid to make
it play a more active role in the industry.
Leading the way is Oman Fishing Company (in which the government has a
quarter share), which was formed in 1989 with subscribed capital of OR12.5m
(Pounds 18.65m).
Better boats and more developed on-shore infrastructure have, however, only
served to highlight the problem of over-fishing.
Apart from periodic exhortations, the government's immediate response has
been to introduce permits for fishermen (initially being enforced only for
larger companies) and to reduce the fishing season. For lobsters, the season
has been reduced from six months to two (December and January). Quotas have
been imposed on industrial vessels.
Hardly surprisingly, these measures have proved unpopular with many of the
country's estimated 18,500 self-employed fishermen whose efforts help to
make fish Oman's biggest non-oil export. Many protested and indeed won
concessions from the ministry; initially the authorities had proposed a
total ban on lobster fishing.
'For decades the industry has been unregulated. But the time has come to
limit entry,' says Mr Abdul Salaam. 'Our measures do affect their livelihood
but we have to take the long term view,' he insists.
The long term view - outlined in the current five-year plan  - includes an
ambitious programme to build eight small, self-contained harbours (at
al-Jazar in the south and Shines in the north-east, for instance). These
will mainly service small fishermen who last year accounted for some 85 per
cent of the total haul of 119,000 tonnes, earning revenues of some OR17.8m.
The rest was caught by industrial vessels. Some 20 per cent of the total
catch was exported to neighbouring states and also Japan.
Large-scale port development is also planned at Sur and Qurayat in the
north-east, enabling them to accommodate industrial vessels and ease
pressure on Mina Qaboos. Industrial vessels - including some from Japan with
which the authorities have signed fishing concessions - caught some 10 per
cent of the total haul in 1990.
All the ports will boast enhanced processing and cold storage facilities.
The work is expected to be finished by 1994, completing the transformation
of an industry which was once as conspicuous for its foul smells as for its
delicious catches. Southern fishermen's haul of sardines - later sold as
fertiliser  - would be left to dry on the southern beaches. The fumes were a
reminder when the boats were in.
Today, though there is some concern among traditional fishermen who fear for
their livelihood, it is the general air of optimism that is more striking.
For most fishermen realise that their government is making a huge investment
in an industry whose importance will grow given Oman's very limited oil
reserves.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Matushka poised to shed
businesses in big shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATUSHKA Group, formerly Germany's leading independent financial services
group, is poised for a drastic restructuring which will leave the
Munich-based group with less than a quarter of the 468 employees that it had
at its peak barely two years ago.
Shareholders and partners in the group - which in the mid-1980s looked as
though it could mount a serious challenge to the German banking
establishment in its chosen areas - are today holding the first of three
meetings to debate plans to sell off all the group's businesses apart from
venture capital and corporate finance.
At the same time, they will consider proposals for a restructuring of the
corporate shareholding. Institutional investors include Nomura, the Japanese
securities house, General Electric Capital of the US, the French Suez group
and Charterhouse, the UK merchant bank, which together with two other
institutions took a total 25 per cent stake in Matushka in September 1989.
According to Mr Manfred Meyer-Preschany, the Frankfurt-based 'corporate
doctor' who has been acting chief executive at Matushka since June last
year, it is certain that the proposed sale of the group's currency trading,
property and portfolio management businesses will be sold off following the
meetings.
'Quite frankly, there is an absolute need to do this,' Mr Meyer-Preschany
said in an interview with the Financial Times at the weekend. 'In certain
areas in the group there simply wasn't the bulk of business to justify the
cost structure. The right relationship between cost and income just wasn't
there, to put it mildly.'
He refused to comment on details of the reshuffling of shareholders. It
seems likely that some will take the opportunity to cut loose from the
group, while at least one will increase its holding.
The Matushka Group takes its name from Count Albrecht Matushka, the maverick
aristocrat who founded the group in 1970 and has over the years been a
forthright critic of the German financial services sector and its domination
by the large universal banks. His group was the nearest thing to an
Anglo-Saxon financial services conglomerate in Germany.
The group now employs 136 and Mr Meyer-Preschany predicts that number will
fall further to 90 to 95 by the beginning of next month.
Profit figures have never been disclosed but it is understood that the group
is budgeted to make an operating profit of DM5.8m for 1992, after taking
into account non-recurring severance payments, on fee income of DM65m to
DM66m. This is before interest on bank debt and on partners' loan capital.
Mr Meyer-Preschany, who played a leading role in restructuring AEG, the
electrical group now owned by Daimler-Benz, before he left Dresdner bank's
main board in 1984, says that Matushka Group is paying the price for
over-reaching itself in the 1980s. 'Ambitions to become a 'world-player'
were unrealistic,' he says.
The Count, who is likely to remain with the rump of the group, could not be
contacted yesterday.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: MoF considers licences move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance may grant investment trust management licences
to investment advisory companies, Reuter reports.
The idea is expected to be incorporated into the reform proposals made by
the Securities and Exchange Council, an advisory panel to the ministry. The
proposals will be submitted next month at the regular session of parliament.
The investment trust management business has been limited to securities
houses so far.
If investment advisory firms receive the licences, their holding companies
may gain an opportunity to enter the investment trust management field
through their subsidiaries.
However, sales of investment funds are seen as unlikely to be opened to
investment advisory companies, with brokerage houses continuing to
monopolise investment funds' sales by also marketing funds formed by
investment advisory firms.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall amid doubts over cut in
interest rates
</HEADLINE>

US TREASURY prices fell across the board yesterday as doubts spread over
whether the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down
15/32 at 105 27/32 , yielding 7.500 per cent. The short end of the market
also weakened considerably, the two-year note easing  3/16 to 100 3/32 , to
yield 4.931 per cent.
The downturn in prices yesterday was a follow-on from last Friday's
testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. Although Mr
Greenspan said the Fed would be ready to ease monetary policy again, he also
said he felt policy had been loosened enough already, and that by historical
standards there was enough monetary stimulus in the pipeline to spur a
recovery in the struggling economy.
The Fed chairman's comments came after the release of another set of bad
employment figures, which suggested to bond investors that the weak December
jobs data was not bad enough to prompt further easing. Given that prices,
especially at the short end, have risen steadily recently on hopes of
interest rate cuts, yesterday's setback was a logical correction.
UK government bond prices weakened yesterday on concerns about future supply
of gilt-edged stock and following the US Treasury market's lead.
An announcement by the Bank of England on Friday that it would auction gilts
in the 1998-2002 maturity range on January 29 helped to push down prices,
particularly of medium-dated issues. The 10 per cent gilt due 2001 fell from
its opening of 102 1/2 to 101 15/16 by late afternoon. Long-dated gilts were
less severely hit, while short-dated gilt prices slipped on worries about
sterling weakness.
Final retail sales and consumer credit figures for November released
yesterday had little impact on gilts.
GERMAN government bonds ended little changed on the day as worries about a
possible steelworkers' strike, the Bundesbank's commitment to high interest
rates and an increase in supply held the market in check.
News that German steelworkers were preparing to go on strike following the
breakdown of pay negotiations on Sunday night, deterred many investors from
buying bunds yesterday.
Traders saidinvestors may be waiting to see whether the strike goes ahead
and pushes bund prices lower so they can buy more cheaply. The Liffe bund
futures contract opened at 88.04 and traded at 88.03 by late afternoon after
trading in a range of 87.92-88.17.
JAPANESE government bond prices closed almost unchanged on the day as yen
weakness against the dollar and the drop in Tokyo stock prices contributed
to the market's slightly bearish mood yesterday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 ended at 5.35 per cent, after moving in a
range of 5.335 per cent to 5.355 per cent on a relatively low volume of
Y358bn.
The dollar strengthened against the yen in New York on Friday after
stronger-than-expected US jobs data for December dampened expectations of a
further ease in US monetary policy.
The overnight unsecured call money rate was ended at 5 3/8 per cent, down
1/8 .

<TEXT>
THE share price of Corning, the US consumer products group, tumbled more
than 13 per cent on Wall Street yesterday after US newspapers reported that
its subsidiary, Dow Corning Wright, had resisted pressure from its
scientists to conduct critical safety studies of the company's silicone
breast implants, writes Patrick Harverson.
Dow Corning is the leading producer of the implants, and yesterday's
revelations follow last week's call by the US Food and Drug Administration
for a moratorium on the sale and use of the implants pending the completion
of new safety tests. The reports claimed internal documents showed Dow
Corning had rushed the implants onto the market in 1975 before doing proper
safety tests, and had mislead plastic surgeons about the risks of silicone
leaking from the implants into the the body.
Dow Corning maintains the implants are safe and the documents cited in the
press are being misinterpreted.

<TEXT>
ALEXANDER &amp; Alexander, the world's second largest insurance broker, said
that it expects to make losses in the fourth quarter and 1991 overall after
taking a Dollars 75m charge to cover an operational restructuring and
various asset write-downs.
The company said that it also plans to sell certain 'non-core operations'
during the first three months of 1992, including a non-broking business in
the Netherlands and a Florida operation that administers workers'
compensation self-insurer funds.
It said that the sales should generate about Dollars 57m, reducing to about
Dollars 40m after tax.
A&amp;A, which has seen net profits slide from Dollars 34.9m to Dollars 24.8m in
the first three quarters of 1991, said more than half the special charge
relates to restructuring costs. This principally affects the US operations,
where the company has the largest concentration of offices at present.
The company said it planned to divide offices into three main categories:
those handling global accounts, which would be concentrated in 16 cities;
regional centres which would look after small commercial business; and
'middle market' offices, concentrating on national and regional business,
and focusing on certain specialised areas like healthcare and energy.
It declined to say how many jobs would be affected, but suggested that this
should not exceed the rate of job losses seen over the past three years -
around 400 a year. The company also said that it was maintaining its regular
quarterly dividend at 25 cents a share.
A&amp;A has had a particularly painful year, with flat commissions, a slow turn
in the property/casualty cycle, and declining investment income.
Cost-containment has, therefore, become a high priority.
The announcement came after the market closed. A&amp;A shares were unchanged at
Dollars 20 3/8 .

A NEW force in retailing is being formed in Norway with substantial Swedish
financial support, it was announced yesterday.
ICA, one of Sweden's largest food retail distribution companies, has
acquired a 30 per cent stake in the Norwegian grocery group Hagen, which has
a turnover of NKr7bn (Dollars 1.1bn) a year through its Rimi, Arena and
Matroken chains of shops.
The share purchase will result in the establishment of Hakon Gruppen in
which ICA will invest NKr500m.
The Swedish group is to pay NKr250m for the shares,which are being sold by
the Hagen family.
ICA is also contributing NKr125m to strengthen its own capital in the Hagen
group and lending the Norwegian company a further NKr125m on favourable
terms.
The new retail group will be 70 per cent owned by Mr Stein-Erik Hagen who
will become its president and chief executive.
The aim of creating the new company as far as ICA is concerned is to
establish Nordic co-operation in the food retail distribution business.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Australian retailer may float
Woolworths chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADSTEAM, the Australian retailing and manufacturing group which is being
restructured by its banks, yesterday confirmed it is considering floating
its Woolworths supermarket chain after the completion of a ADollars 6bn
(USDollars 4.4bn) refinancing deal.
'A float of Woolworths is constantly under review. However, no decision has
been made on the timing of a float, and no decision is imminent,' said Mr
George Haines, the group's chief executive.
Analysts say Woolworths could raise between ADollars 1.5bn and ADollars 2bn
on the Australian stock exchange, which would make it Australia's second
highest capitalised retailer.
Woolworths is the main competitor to Coles Myer, Australia's largest
retailing chain. It has continued to perform strongly in spite of Adsteam's
financial problems.
Woolworths made pre-tax profits of ADollars 211m in the year to June, and is
expected to report profits of about ADollars 240m this year. Growth is
expected to slow over the next few years following the completion of an
investment programme.
Mr Haines said Adsteam was able to consider Woolworths' flotation 'in an
orderly manner' because of the completion of a refinancing deal for
Industrial Equity (IEL), the Adsteam affiliate which owns Woolworths. IEL,
jointly owned by three other Adsteam companies, has agreed credit lines of
ADollars 1.45bn with a syndicate of 14 banks which replaced its previous 51
lenders.
Adsteam said refinancing agreements for other companies in the group would
soon be completed, and would involve a cur in the number of participating
banks. Adsteam is said to have negotiated with about 80 banks.
The Adsteam group, formerly run by Mr John Spalvins, reported a consolidated
net loss of ADollars 1.57bn for the year to June, following interim losses
of ADollars 1.2bn. Adsteam's banks stepped in to restructure it in late
1990, after the shares came under selling pressure due to concern about the
group's cross-shareholding structure and extensive inter-company debt. Mr
Spalvins and two other directors were fired in December 1990.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ames reorganisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMES DEPARTMENT Stores, the US discount stores group which went into
bankruptcy almost two years ago, yesterday filed an 'all equity'
reorganisation plan, writes Nikki Tait.
The scheme envisages Ames' creditors would exchange their claims for Dollars
352.5m in cash, plus stock in the reorganised company. Unlike many bankrupt
companies, Ames does not plan to issue new debt securities as part of the
reorganisation attempt. Senior creditors will finish with about 47.1 per
cent of the equity, general unsecured creditors with around 45.7 per cent
and bondholders with 7.2 per cent.
Making various assumptions about the value of Ames' new shares, the scheme
is reckoned to give senior creditors about 64 cents on the dollar and
unsecured creditors about 39 cents on the dollar.
Total estimated claims against Ames, when the company filed for bankruptcy
in April 1990, were put at Dollars 1.6bn. Ames has already pruned its
operations sharply, closing over 300 outlets.
Ames' plan received a conditional endorsement from unsecured creditors. But,
the company added it was contingent on the successful negotiation of a new
Dollars 200m seasonal working capital facility, to replace a revolving
credit line currently provided by Chemical Bank.

Newspaper flotation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN investors gave a rousing welcome to the flotation of WA Newspaper
Holdings (WAN) last week, raising hopes of similar success for two other
media flotations due later this year.
WAN, which owns the West Australian daily newspaper published in Perth,
closed at ADollars 1.70 after its first day's trading on the Australian
Stock Exchange (ASX), a premium of 70 cents over the issue price.
The first-day closing price was at the top end of expectations for the
flotation, which raised ADollars 185m (USDollars 136m) from more than 16,000
shareholders. The ASX said more than 15m WAN shares were traded that day.
Brokers said the flotation augured well for News Corporation, Mr Rupert
Murdoch's media group, which is expected to raise about ADollars 380m
shortly from the part-flotation of its Pacific Magazines offshoot.
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian proprietor of the UK Daily Telegraph group, is
also expected to float about 80 per cent of the Fairfax newspaper chain
following the acquisition of the company late last year.
The WAN flotation will provide stable ownership for the West Australian, the
last independently-owned metropolitan daily newspaper in Australia.
The newspaper was owned by the Herald and Weekly Times (HWT) group from 1969
to 1987, when HWT was acquired by News Corporation, and the West Australian
was spun off to the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Group.
A year later, Mr Holmes a Court sold 19.9 per cent of Bell Group to Mr Alan
Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings, and a similar stake to the West Australian
State Government Insurance Commission in a deal which was investigated by
the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), the then corporate
regulator. Bond Corporation was forced to acquire 74.5 per cent of Bell and
the company collapsed following Bond Corporation's inability to service its
debts.
The biggest shareholder in WAN is the Australian Foundation Investment
Company, a listed investment group, controlling about 6.5 per cent of the
shares. Several other financial institutions are also large shareholders.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: A more primitive Citicorp after
shake-up at the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS BEEN a rough couple of years for Mr John Reed, the Citicorp chairman
who yesterday unveiled a senior-level management shake-up at the nation's
largest bank.
At the close of 1990, with real estate loan losses rising and Citicorp's
core capital-to-asset ratio slipping beneath the 4 per cent regulatory
minimum, Mr Reed began slashing the bank's dividend and workforce.
In October 1991, with Citicorp embarked upon a Dollars 1bn cost-cutting
plan, Mr Reed was again embarrassed - and Wall Street was severely
disappointed - when he revealed Dollars 1.6bn of loan write-offs, Dollars
885m of third-quarter losses, a radical revision of the cost-cutting plan
requiring an additional Dollars 700m of cuts in operating expenses and the
first halting of Citicorp's dividend in its 179-year history.
Now Mr Reed is to shuffle the bank's top management, moving to what he calls
'a much more primitive structure' to achieve better credit controls. He is
also acting to bring down costs as needed, to return to profits in the first
half of 1992 and to boost the bank's 3.6 per cent core capital ratio above 4
per cent by mid-1992.
Yesterday's management changes include the setting up of a series of
corporate task-forces that will deal with problem areas and seek to identify
asset disposals that will help strengthen capital.
Mr Reed says Citicorp's operating expenses are running at Dollars 10bn a
year, down from Dollars 10.7bn a year ago. His goal is annual costs of
Dollars 9bn by the end of 1992, to be achieved through further operational
cuts of Dollars 600m and sales proceeds of Dollars 400m.
The most visible changes, however, revolve around the ousting of Mr Michael
Callen, the head of Citicorp's US, European and Japanese corporate
businesses and the man who had responsibility for US real estate until Mr
Reed took personal charge of that portfolio last year.
Mr Callen, whose departure is termed a resignation, was a Reed loyalist. His
corporate division responsibilities will be taken up by Mr Onno Ruding, the
former Dutch finance minister who on January 21 will be named as a Citicorp
vice-chairman and board member.
Yesterday, Mr Reed was not shy about criticising the past management of the
corporate division, which suffered a Dollars 298m loss in the third quarter.
'One of the things I have been correctly criticised for is that the
management (of the corporate division) has produced some pretty horrendous
results. We are guilty of having run the business a bit cavalierly,' Mr Reed
said in an interview.
'When you run a corporate business that has the ability to destroy consumer
profits you are obviously running it with the wrong risk-reward ratio,' he
said, adding: 'I don't want a business to jeopardise the whole company.' He
noted that strengthening the corporate division's management was important
because this was 'not an area I myself have worked in'.
Turning to US commercial real estate, where Dollars 4.4bn, or 31 per cent,
of Citicorp loans are classified as non-performing, Mr Reed said he believed
that 'unusually high commercial real estate write-offs' would continue for
the next seven years.
He said he expected real estate write-offs, bad debt provisions and carrying
costs on foreclosed property to total Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn during
the next seven years, 'which for all practical purposes is forever'.
As for his own future, the subject of Wall Street speculation, Mr Reed was
brief: 'I will be in my position until I get the job done. I'm working my
tail off.'

135m

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHASE Manhattan, the New York money-centre bank, yesterday reported
fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 135m, down from Dollars 193m last year
when its figures were flattered by a Dollars 51m after-tax gain from the
sale of overseas real estate.
The results, which were broadly in line with market expectations, underlined
the efforts Chase has been making to cut its costs and the improved spreads
US banks have been enjoying between the cost of borrowing and lending money.
However, the figures also point up the continuing impact on bank profits of
the American property market slump.
Chase's net interest revenue during the fourth quarter rose from Dollars
839m last year to Dollars 868m, which, it said, reflected improved spreads
on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a higher average level of
non-performing assets and the effects of asset securitisation.
Its net interest margin - the difference between the average cost of
deposits and average yield on loans and other assets - was 3.95 per cent, up
from 3.66 per cent a year earlier.
However, the bank's provision for possible credit losses totalled Dollars
315m, up from Dollars 200m in the same period of last year and Dollars 265m
in the third quarter.
Excluding Third World debt, net write-offs in the quarter were Dollars 309m,
up from Dollars 240m last year. The increase included a Dollars 44m increase
in US commercial write-offs and Dollars 18m in US consumer write-offs.
The loan loss provision for the full year was Dollars 1.1bn, compared with
Dollars 1.3bn in 1990, and the bank warned that in view of the depressed
real estate market it was likely that 'the provision for possible credit
losses will continue at the relatively high level recorded in 1991'.
Fee and commission revenue totalled Dollars 436m, up from Dollars 417m a
year before, while revenues from trading jumped from Dollars 20m to Dollars
101m.
Other operating expenses totalled Dollars 986m, up from Dollars 960m in the
fourth quarter of 1990, due mainly to the takeover of a group of banks in
the state of Connecticut.
Mr James McDermott, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, commented:
'Their charge-offs are high but their expense control seems to be on track.'
Fourth-quarter net income per share totalled 80 cents, compared with 93
cents a year ago, excluding the benefits of the 1990 property disposals
which boosted the total to Dollars 1.32.
For the full year, the bank reported net income of Dollars 520m, or Dollars
3.12 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 334m, or Dollars 3.31 a share,
in 1990.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Macy debt downgraded by S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POORS, the US credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded the
subordinated debt issued by RH Macy, the US department store chain which
sent a shudder through the retail industry on Friday when it announced it
would be late making January payments to suppliers.
S&amp;P said its action reflected Macy's weaker-than-expected performance during
the crucial Christmas season, leading to near-term liquidity pressures. It
lowered the rate from triple-C-plus to triple-C-minus.
Meanwhile, Macy's senior management has been repeating that it is working on
a comprehensive plan to reduce its debt and has been trying to dispel
persistent rumours it may be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
In a series of interviews, Mr Edward Finkelstein, Macy's chairman, and Mr
Myron Ullman, its vice-chairman, have insisted they have no plan to file for
Chapter 11, which they say would not be in the company's interests.
However, they declined to give details of their new financing plan, which is
being worked out with investment bankers at Goldman,Sachs.
Macy's, which went private in a leveraged buy-out in 1986, is one of the
leading department store groups in the US, but it has been struggling under
a burden of more than Dollars 3.5bn in long-term debt, which it has
difficulty in servicing. The group lost Dollars 155m in the quarter to early
November.
As a private company, Macy does not give out monthly sales figures, but
analysts believe its sales were probably flat to slightly lower, compared
with the group's hopes of a 5 per cent increase.
The company said on Friday it would not be sending out any cheques to
vendors until January 25, two weeks late.
This was because an agreement with its commercial bank lenders required it
to cut its revolving borrowings to specified levels between mid-December and
mid-February.
The agreement with the banks was negotiated in early December, when Macy
apparently hoped Christmas sales would be sufficiently strong for it to both
cut borrowings and pay vendors, but last week that proved impossible.
S&amp;P said a critical element in Macy's avoidance of default had been its good
relationships with suppliers and banks, but the vendor moratorium had now
jeopardised this, 'substantially increasing near-term risks.'

unpaid accounts

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, the US theme park operator, was yesterday facing a claim for
FFr850m (Dollars 157.4m) in allegedly unpaid accounts from 16 disgruntled
French building contractors.
The group, due to open its 5,000-acre leisure complex east of Paris on April
12, emphasised that it expects to settle practically all the claims
amicably.
It stressed that negotiations of this kind are not surprising in a project
of this size - the largest of its type in Europe  - it is estimated the
complex will swallow FFr35bn by the time a second theme park is open on the
site in 1995-96.
A Euro Disney spokesman said the claims were 'outrageous and exaggerated'
and deplored the threats by the contractors to try to stop the opening of
the park. The row is unwelcome publicity so soon before the opening. Euro
Disney's share price slipped FFr2.20 to FFr146.30.
The French building contractors, a small minority of the 700 companies
working on the site, have formed an action group to present their demands,
but they have not yet resorted to joint legal action. The companies leading
the group, which also represents 300 sub-contractors, are Chagnaud, CGCE,
Torno and Gabo.
Euro Disney said it was reaching the final stages of the first phase of the
project, including handing over and inspection of the works, in which it and
the contractors were drawing up accounts for any extra sums to be paid to
contractors for modifications during the contracts.
Nestle, the Swiss food company, confirmed that it had wanted to bid for
Source Perrier, the French mineral water leader, but was thwarted by Italy's
Agnelli family, Reuter reports.
'I can confirm we had the intention of making an offer for Perrier,' a
Nestle spokesman said. However, the hold the Agnelli family had built up
over Perrier now made it 'impossible for that intention to be realised'.

A GROUP of five leading Finnish industrial companies is in talks which may
lead to the purchase of forest industry and engineering company Tampella,
Reuter reports from Helsinki.
The five companies are Ahlstrom, Enso-Gutzeit, Valmet, Outokumpu and Repola,
according to Mr Krister Ahlstrom, Ahlstrom chairman
'We are very early in negotiations. We can't be more specific,' he said.
Mr Heikki Hakala, Repola executive vice-president, said: 'It is very
difficult for me to comment . . . I know that there are some discussions but
I don't know more.'
Valmet, Outokumpu and Enso declined to comment and there was no immediate
comment from Tampella.
Tampella was formerly about 60 per cent owned by SkopBank, the Finnish
savings bank of which the Bank of Finland took administrative control in
September.
The central bank set up a series of holding companies to remove risks from
SkopBank's balance sheet. One holding company, Solidium, acquired 66.1 per
cent of Tampella. The five companies had been in talks with Solidium,
according to Mr Ahlstrom.
He said one of the problems to be discussed is Tampella's debt. SkopBank
last month said it had foregone claims on Tampella of about FMk1.5bn
(Dollars 350m). Tampella said Solidium would buy loans to Tampella from
SkopBank of FMk3.25bn. Solidium turned FMk530m of this into new Tampella
capital.

<TEXT>
SWISS authorities have turned over more than 20,000 bank documents to the
Serious Fraud Office in connection with its investigation of Polly Peck
International.
The move demonstrates the Swiss desire to shed its reputation for shielding
financial criminals, especially since Britain has refused up to now to sign
mutual assistance treaties on criminal matters with Switzerland.
'What is interesting about this story is that the documents are going to
Britain. I had not heard that the British were willing to co-operate with
us,' Mr Andreas Hubschmid, first secretary of the Swiss Bankers Association,
said yesterday.
Mr Peter Cosandey, the Zurich district attorney, said that the documents
concerned bank transactions worth more than SFr100m (Pounds 39.5m) adding
that no bank accounts had been blocked as there was now no money in them.
He said that the records were transferred to the SFO in connection with
charges of theft, fraud and false accounting laid against Mr Asil Nadir, the
group's former chairman.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Robert Lowe back in black in second half
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHT CONTROL of money, production and sales helped Robert H Lowe, the
Cheshire-based maker of leisure and childrens' wear and owner of the
Baby-Gro brand, return to profits in the second six months of its year to
end-October.
It reported a pre-tax profit for ongoing activities of Pounds 100,000,
compared with a loss of Pounds 500,000.
Full year pre-tax losses fell from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 297,000. The
reported comparable loss was Pounds 453,000
The figures continue a gradually improving trend and Mr Tony Cant, chief
executive, sees 1992 as a year of further consolidation 'against a difficult
trading background'.
Of the year under review he added: 'We cut working capital, reduced stock
losses and production overruns.'
Falling interest rates helped cut the interest charge to Pounds 1.53m
(Pounds 1.86m). The company also reduced its level of debt in October with a
Pounds 3.4m rights issue and gearing has fallen from 167 per cent a year ago
to between 90 and 100 per cent now.
'This is still too high and we are aiming for 50 per cent in another year,'
said Mr Cant. He added that the ultimate aim was zero gearing.
Trading profit for ongoing activities doubled from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds
1.23m Turnover for the year edged higher to Pounds 34m (Pounds 33.6m).
After a tax charge of Pounds 191,000 (credit Pounds 151,000) losses per
share came out at 11.19p (9.11p).
The company is proposing passing its final dividend for the second year in
succession. There was no interim dividend.
At the time of the rights issue, the company said it did not foresee any
dividend being paid for 1992.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 500,000, compared with Pounds
700,000 income, reflecting the 'final' costs of withdrawing from some
business sectors, largely in the Irish market.

<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Cityvision, the video hire chain, have been approached by a
former executive who is urging a plan intended to provide an alternative to
the Pounds 75m agreed offer from Blockbuster, the US-based video hire chain.
Mr Ray Hipkin, a founder of Cityvision's Ritz chain, and Mr Philip Crane, a
former video shop entrepreneur who sold out to Cityvision, met with several
institutional shareholders last week to outline a new management and
marketing strategy.
The two are said to be critical of the current management, arguing that it
had failed to capitalise sufficiently on the Ritz brand name.
Last month, the management agreed to a cash and shares deal from Blockbuster
valuing the company's shares at 48p, well above the prevailing price.
However, some shareholders were unhappy with the bid, believing Blockbuster
would be acquiring the chain at its trough.
Mr Hipkin and Mr Crane are said to have presented shareholders with a
marketing strategy, similar to that used in Scandinavia, which would
encourage film studios to spend more to promote films on video. A detailed
letter is expected to be sent to shareholders later this week outlining the
proposals.
Shares in Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation have been listed on the
Stock Exchange. The company sought the listing in connection with its
proposed acquisition.

INCHCAPE, the international services and marketing group, said a delayed
postal delivery resulted in a number of acceptances for the group's recent
Pounds 376m rights issue being received two days after the final payment
date.
The group said 952 provisional allotment letters for 1.53m stock units,
representing 1.2 per cent of the shares on offer, were postmarked by the
Royal Mail on or before January 3, but not delivered to Barclays Registrars
until January 9, two days after the due date.
Inchcape said it believed it would be possible for the group to issue those
affected with new shares, in lieu of the stock units they would have
received, at the same cost.
Acceptances were received for 89.3 per cent of the issue by the due date.
Internatio-Mueller Engineering, a Netherlands-based trading and transport
concern said it was negotiating the sale of its Wm H Mueller shipping agency
to Inchcape. Internatio said the sale would help it concentrate on
engineering and trading activities.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Disposal of MGN 'may take years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE disposal of Mirror Group Newspapers could take 'months if not years',
according to a financial consultant with a close knowledge of the process.
Accountants Arthur Andersen, which are acting as administrators to the
Maxwell private companies under UK insolvency legislation, are still 'at the
development stage in formulating a sales strategy', he added.
Mr John Talbot, a partner of Andersen in charge of the administration, is
understood to believe that there is no pressing need for an early sale.
'MGN is a much more robust business than other assets of the private
companies', said the consultant, 'so the priority is to sell these other
assets first.'
The sale is also being delayed by the difficulty of drafting a reliable
balance sheet for MGN, following the withdrawal of assets from its accounts
and from its pension funds' accounts by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The Maxwell private companies own 51 per cent of MGN, but these are
controlled by a handful of banks, which were given the shares as collateral
against loans they made to the private companies. Andersen will need to get
the banks' approval for a sale timetable.
National Westminster Bank controls 131.4m MGN shares while Midland and
Lloyds speak for 40m and 7m respectively. Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank, controls a further 40m.
'We were hoping for a quick sale,' said a banker. Any delay in the sale is
costly for the banks, for two reasons:
Their capital is tied up in loans to the private companies which are not
paying interest.
The banks are forced by regulators to make big provisions to cover the risk
of loss on the loans.
The delay will come as a serious blow to the management team trying to buy
out Mirror Group Newspapers. Mr John Sharkey, special adviser to the buy-out
team led by Mr Richard Stott, the editor of the Daily Mirror, said last
night he planned to appeal to the administrators to speed the process up.
Mr Sharkey said he feared that MGN would be damaged by delay and
uncertainty. He did not believe, however, that the decision by Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, to pull out of the running would make any
difference.
'There is just one fewer contender. We are still pressing ahead and there is
no shortage of applicants prepared to help with the financing,' said Mr
Sharkey. The management buy-out is backed by Electra, the venture capital
group.
It became clear yesterday that Pearson became interested in MGN earlier than
previously realised. In early December, when Mr Ian and Mr Kevin Maxwell had
only a few days to raise several hundred million to keep the banks at bay,
Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson managing director, suggested an offer of Pounds
175m for 51 per cent of MGN.
The administrators were called in before anything could be done.
The immediate financial pressure on MGN receded yesterday as the newspaper
group's banks said they were sympathetic to providing a Pounds 20m package
to fund MGN until the end of May, in addition to Pounds 35m already lent.
Meanwhile the MGN pension trustees yesterday issued a preliminary report
warning that the pension scheme does not have adequate security for all its
benefits.
'If none of the missing funds is recovered, the scheme is unlikely to have
enough money to guarantee in full the benefits of existing pensioners,' the
trustees say.
The trustees emphasise that existing pensioners will continue to be paid in
full while new pensioners will still be able to take part of their pension
in the form of a lump sum.

FT  14 JAN 92 / MI Group sales side to work only for Citibank
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sales force at MI Group, the life assurance and pensions group, has
formed itself into a new company which will sell policies exclusively for
Citibank Life Assurance.
Mr Simon Ingram, chief executive of MI Group, has formed a company to be
known as City Financial Partners Ltd which will include an estimated 700 of
MI's 800-strong sales force and administrative staff. The new company is
expected to receive regulatory approval by late January and begin operations
before the end of the month. He said that CFPL intends to continue the
practice of cold-calling prospective clients to sell Citibank policies - a
sales tactic which earned MI much adverse publicity. However, Mr Ingram said
that only 5 per cent of policy-holders are contacted through cold calling.
Citibank's UK life assurance operations, purchased from British National
Life Insurance in 1986, are minimal, with only Pounds 100m under management.
A spokesman for Citibank said the new link will double the number of tied
agents used by the company. A spokesman said the US-based bank is not
troubled by MI Group's reputation for a hard-sell approach to life
assurance. 'If MI Group were out there operating, then Lautro (the UK
regulators) must have been satisfied they were complying with the law,' a
spokesman said.
Mr Ingram said that CFPL's sales force will be paid only for each policy
they sell, although additional bonuses will be paid to agents able to
generate more than Pounds 60,000 in commissions annually with a policy
cancellation rate of less than 25 per cent every 24 months. Overall, nearly
one-third of MI Group's policies are cancelled within two years.
MI's existing 150,000 policy holders - with roughly Pounds 500m under
management - will continue to have their investments managed by the company.
Mr David Young, secretary of MI Group, said the company had decided to
abandon its direct sales force because 'expenses do not keep up with premium
income.'
Citicorp, the biggest US bank that has been struggling to contain losses and
cut costs, has replaced the head of its corporate lending and investment
banking division and recruited as a vice-chairman Mr H. Onno Ruding, a
former Dutch finance minister, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, yesterday briefed his top managers on the
changes, which he said were aimed at simplifying the bank's management
structure.
Mr Reed, who was criticised on Wall Street after announcing an Dollars 885m
loss in the third quarter and the halting of dividend payments, yesterday
said he expected continuing high loan write-offs for the fourth quarter of
1991.
He said the bank would return to profit by the end of 1992 and that its
cost-cutting programme was beginning to result in improved margins, which
for 1991 would be Dollars 5.8bn, up by 20 per cent on 1990.
He said that after taking around Dollars 650m of fourth-quarter commercial
loan write-offs and write-downs and a Dollars 200m increase of loan loss
provisions the bank would report a Dollars 125m to Dollars 150m
fourth-quarter loss. This would translate into a loss of Dollars 475m for
all of 1991.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Tomkins rises 40% on growing US sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING sales of bicycles, baths and handguns in the US and tight cash
control on both sides of the Atlantic helped Tomkins, the UK industrial
conglomerate, to increase pre-tax profits by 40 per cent to Pounds 43.7m in
the six months to November 2.
The conglomerate's figures, which included a 52 per cent rise in turnover to
Pounds 594.5m from Pounds 390.7m, were driven up with the help of a 26-week
contribution from Philips Industries, the US industrial group acquired in
August 1990, compared with 10 weeks in the first half of last year.
As Philips was bought for Dollars 550m (Pounds 307.2m), funded by a 3-for-4
rights issue, the US share of Tomkins's trading profit has gone up to two
thirds.
Philips is now in a division called Tomkins Industries, which more than
trebled trading profit to Pounds 17.6m from Pounds 5.2m on sales of Pounds
288.9m up from Pounds 95.7m. Philips's head office costs were halved and
nine factories closed but Mr Gregory Hutchings, chief executive, said no
costs arising from this action had been taken as extraordinary or
exceptional charges.
'Reorganisation is part of our business,' he said.
He named several ex-Philips subsidiaries, including Lasco Bathware and Lasco
Panels, as star performers alongside the bicycles and lawnmowers sold by
Murray Ohio, but some UK activities suffered: three were building related
and four in the fasteners industry. The group had Pounds 70m in the bank and
Mr Hutchings said he would prefer the next acquisition to be in the UK.
He complained that companies were still too 'highly rated even though they
are not doing well'. He was cool on the idea of expanding in continental
Europe because of 'getting companies to operate properly', referring to
labour laws and language barriers. Group trading profit rose 41 per cent to
Pounds 37m, while interest received advanced to Pounds 4.15m from Pounds
2.63m. The Pounds 70m cash compared with Pounds 45m at the start of the
year.
Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, said the growth in interest income came in
spite of rates falling from 15 per cent to between 10 per cent and 12 per
cent.
The group tends to borrow in the US and deposit in the UK to take advantage
of differing rates. 'This time last year the gap was 4 per cent, now it's 2
per cent,' said Mr Duncan, stressing that at least half the interest income
came from 'money in the bank' as opposed to exploiting the rate gap.
Growth in fully-diluted earnings per share was limited to 9.7 per cent,
making 9.01p, against 8.21p, because of the equity issued for the Philips
deal. The interim dividend was raised 15 per cent from 2.8p to 3.22p.
The breakdown of results from the five divisions showed that only the two
dominated by US companies made progress. After Tomkins Industries, the next
best performance came from professional, garden and leisure products.
Trading profit rose to Pounds 7.5m from Pounds 6.6m on sales of Pounds
176.5m, up from Pounds 156.8m.
Murray Ohio increased its sales of bicycles, mainly at the expense of
importers, and demand for lawnmowers remained firm. Exports of Smith &amp;
Wesson revolvers reached record levels and domestic sales also grew.
In the services to industry division, good performances in the distribution
of valves and vehicle components were more than offset by depressed demand
for fasteners. Trading profit slipped to Pounds 4.8m from Pounds 5.3m on
sales of Pounds 59m, down from Pounds 62.1m.
Fluid controls fell back from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 4.1m on sales of Pounds
39.3m against Pounds 45.7m, affected by the slump in UK construction, while
industrial products declined to Pounds 3m from Pounds 3.4m.
Mr Duncan said that where turnover had fallen, the cash position had been
improved by cutting stocks and debtors and other economies.
The interest income generated in the UK had been more than the net figure of
Pounds 4.15m, while the former Philips group had incurred an interest
charge.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE and Snecma, the French state-owned aircraft and jet engine
makers, yesterday revealed they were seeking substantial injections of
capital.
This provides the latest evidence of the financial pressures on the French
aerospace and defence industries, faced with falling orders from the
declines in air travel and arms budgets, plus heavy investment demands for
new products.
The gloomy background was reinforced yesterday by the DGA, the French state
weapons procurement agency, when Le Monde newspaper quoted DGA estimates
that the French arms business would lose up to 18,000 jobs this year.
Neither Aerospatiale nor Snecma gave exact details of their funding needs,
though officials indicated that Aerospatiale was negotiating to raise around
FFr1bn (Pounds 103m) by selling a minority equity stake to Credit Lyonnais,
the state-owned bank. Snecma has indicated in the past that its financing
needs this year will be FFr750m.
Mr Henri Martre, chairman of Aerospatiale, said he was negotiating for a
capital increase with a state-owned bank, while Mr Louis Gallois, chairman
of Snecma, warned that if the government could not provide the capital
needed, he would seek an alliance with a new private or public partner.
Aerospatiale revealed that new orders declined sharply last year to FFr28bn
 -14 per cent below forecast  - from FFr55bn in 1990, leaving total orders
at FFr100bn, or 2 1/2 years work.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Groupe Bull completes Dollars 1.1bn debt refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE BULL, the lossmaking French computermaker, yesterday completed a
Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 613m) refinancing, representing most of the group's
debts.
The state-controlled group's problems, the deteriorating market conditions
for information technology companies generally, and the tightening of
conditions in the international loans market have all helped to push the
margin on the public, syndicated part of the refinancing to 70 basis points
(0.7 per cent) over the London inter-bank offered rate. This is considered
high for a three-year facility.
The company said this margin was lower than those paid on the two largest
facilities it was refinancing, accounting for a total of Dollars 835m lent
to two US subsidiaries. However, given that the new loans are to the group
parent, and so considered more secure, the overall bankers' terms were
actually worse than before.
The refinancing, which is thought to cover all loans falling due in 1992, is
planned to help the group complete a restructuring programme announced last
year.
Yesterday, Mr Francis Lorentz, chairman, said 1991 operating losses were
likely to be about half the total for the previous year. Groupe Bull's total
pre-tax loss for 1990 reached more than FFr6bn (Pounds 619m), after it had
narrowly failed to break even in the previous year.
About Dollars 850m of the finance announced yesterday is being provided by a
syndicate of 26 international banks, arranged by Banque Nationale de Paris,
JP Morgan, Societe Generale and National Westminster.
Most of these are believed to be banks already owed money by the group,
reflecting the reluctance of new lenders to extend credit to the troubled
computer maker.
The remainder is being provided by one-to-one deals with large lenders. Bull
said these were Commerzbank, Manufacturers Hanover, Tokai Bank and Barclays.
The syndicated portion of the deal, which has taken about four weeks to
complete, was scaled up from Dollars 700m, although the troubled nature of
the group is believed to have made the financing difficult to complete.
The new syndicated loan, made to the group parent, replaces a range of
facilities extended previously to subsidiaries around the world.
The refinancing accounts for most of Bull's FFr11bn debts at the end of
1991.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Steel strike threatens in Germany as pay talks break down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first strike in the German steel industry for more than 10 years loomed
closer yesterday after pay talks broke off.
An increased management offer, and a conciliatory proposal from union
negotiators failed to break the impasse in the eighth bout of negotiations.
As the wages commission of IG Metall, the country's biggest union, gathered
later to plan strike action, the leader of the DGB trade union federation
declared that the Bonn coalition and employers were 'back on the old
confrontation course' with the unions.
The roots of the current strife lie in union claims that wage earners have
been obliged to pay more than their fair share of the costs of unification.
Although they were assured by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that there would be no
tax increases following unification in October 1990, they have since been
burdened with a two-year 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge to pay for
community works in the east.
Cigarettes, heating fuel and petrol have also been laden with extra duties
to raise funds for the five new states. Unions also claim that, while
company profits have boomed thanks to increased sales to the former DDR,
their real earning power has been eroded.
The gap between employers and steel unions has, however, closed markedly,
with management offering a phased deal worth 5.2 per cent, and the unions
dropping their 10.5 per cent demand to a package worth 'just over 6 per
cent'.
Both sides seem increasingly anxious to avoid a strike. Steel companies are
concerned that confrontation now with the country's 135,000 steelworkers
might lead to greater conflicts later with the 4m engineering industry
workers who have yet to put in their 1992 pay claim.
Steel industry employees are also under psychological pressure from the
likelihood of job losses later this year as rationalisation in the industry
progresses. Thyssen, the biggest steelmaker in the country, is reviewing its
production, while Krupp and Hoesch, two leading manufacturers are in the
process of merging.
Even so, the structure of the three-stage IG Metall proposal, ending with a
6.7 per cent increase for the last four months of the one-year deal, was
unacceptable to employers.
IG Metall's wages commission was expected to declare the negotiations with
management formally at an end and call a strike ballot.
The first union claims for increases of about 10 per cent ran into early
opposition when they were put in late last year.
Resistance has hardened since Christmas as economists have steadily
downgraded their forecasts for west German economic growth this year.
The government, which will shortly publish a situation report showing that
growth in the west could be as low as 1 per cent, has lately piled on the
pressure for restraint.

membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The visit,
which would be short, has yet to be finalised.
The invitation, seeking to confirm the prime minister's role on the world
stage, coincided with Tory demands for greater clarity in Labour's defence
policy.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the government of
'looking for a photo-opportunity, not an agenda'. Page 2

FT  14 JAN 92 / Yeltsin pressed to quit post of PM: Head of Russian
parliament may sack cabinet in protest at soaring prices

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yes-terday came under strong pressure to resign from
his post as prime minister amid fierce criticism of his decision to free
prices.
Mr Yeltsin's press secretary denied rumours that he was quitting as head of
the Russian cabinet of ministers, but government advisers said he was under
mounting pressure to do so.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, said during a
discussion with Italian senators that now was the time for Mr Yeltsin to
replace the 'incompetent' cabinet - or else the parliament would vote it
out.
He added that Mr Yeltsin should 'distance himself' from the government,
since 'a president is a person standing, as it were, above the state'.
The cold blast of public distaste for price rises, which in some cases have
increased by as much as 30 times, is now blowing through the highest levels
of the state.
Deputies and officials have been inundated with complaints from furious
constituents, and demonstrations, the largest organised by hardline
communists, have begun to gather force.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, was
subjected to stern criticism by the presidium of the Russian parliament, the
forum in which Mr Khasbulatov made a speech calling for the government to
resign.
Mr Khasbulatov's remarks, made after a trip to provincial cities at the
weekend to gauge the level of dissatisfaction at first hand, were followed
by a an Interfax news agency report that several people were being canvassed
as prime ministerial material. These included Mr Khasbulatov himself, Mr
Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, and Mr Svyatoslav Feodorov, an eye
surgeon, and formerly a candidate for the post.
Mr Alexei Trepekhalin, an aide to Mr Khasbulatov, said last night: 'The
chairman has no intention of becoming prime minister, and will stay as
chairman.' However, his defection to the ranks of the government's critics
means that two highly placed critics - he and Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the
vice-president - are in open revolt against the government.
The high prices are also provoking calls for the government's resignation in
Ukraine.

FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Aerospatiale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mme Cresson is doubtless still smarting from Brussels' decision to veto the
Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland. But she has obviously not forgotten
that Sir Leon Brittan also gave his blessing to Credit Lyonnais'
participation in Usinor Sacilor, and is expected to approve BNP's FF1.25bn
capital injection for Air France. It is only natural to assume that
yesterday's confirmation of talks between Aerospatiale and an unidentified
French bank is the prelude to a similarly controversial deal.
With state owned engine-maker Snecma also renewing a request for outside
funds, pressures on the economie mixte look to be intensifying. In the
Snecma case private or foreign shareholders have not been ruled out. In the
state-owned insurance sector, rules restricting private shareholders to 25
per cent have been relaxed. But, as with airlines and steel, the solution
for the aerospace and defence group seems likely to involve an equity link
to a state-owned bank.
There are plenty of reasons why Aerospatiale requires fresh funds at this
stage: the impact of French defence cuts, the cash requirements of its
helicopter, regional aircraft and Airbus joint ventures, and the proposed
development of the A319 airliner. Given its pivotal position in European
alliances - and the speedier reaction this side of the Atlantic to changed
military circumstances - there may also be a commercial case for making such
an investment. The question is whether its new state-inspired partner will
be able to arrive at commercially sensible terms.

FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10 per cent increase in Tomkins' interim earnings was impressive enough
to raise the question of whether the merits of contra-cyclical conglomerates
have been underestimated. Given that Tomkins' shares have outperformed the
market by 45 per cent over the last 18 months, the answer might seem in the
negative. The slightly less fashionable Williams Holdings also recently
joined the FT-SE, so conglomerates are scarcely under-represented.
All the same, veterans like Hanson and BTR have had a harder time. It is
instructive to go back 10 years and discover that their shares did even
better in recession than Tomkins has managed this time around. Over a
similar 18-month period from the start of 1980, Hanson and BTR both
outperformed the market by 70 per cent. Hanson in particular really took off
after that, so Tomkins is perhaps taking a view on the spirit of the 1990s
in allying itself more to BTR as an asset manager. In addition, BTR won its
battle for Hawker Siddeley last year, whereas Hanson managed only an agreed
deal with Beazer.
If Tomkins had treated its restructuring costs as extraordinary in the
traditional way, yesterday's 15 per cent dividend increase would have been
more in line with earnings. As it is, it reinforces the impression that the
group is finally limbering up for a UK bid of its own, possibly using its
highly-rated paper. While Tomkins' managers are still buying their own
shares, investors will doubtless choose to hang on for a while yet.

FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign buyers who pumped a net Y112bn into Japanese equities last month
must be feeling frustrated. Once again, the Nikkei index was hovering
yesterday uncomfortably close to the levels which pose capital adequacy
problems for the banks. Nor is there any particular reason why it should
recover in the short term, now that the market seems to have decided to
ignore last month's interest rate cut. Corporate profits have fallen further
than expected, and there is again a hint of political scandal. Retail buyers
are disillusioned. The tokkin funds, through which companies invest surplus
cash, are due to become net sellers as they stock up liquidity before the
end of the financial year. Futures arbitrage activity could also put
pressure on physical equities.
Yet this is the fifth time since last August that the index has slid to the
mid-21,000 range. That suggests a fairly solid floor around these levels.
Admittedly the index could fall steeply were it to break out of this range,
possibly returning to the lows around 20,000 seen in October 1990. But the
weakness should not last, both because equities would then be cheap in
absolute terms and because institutional investors would come under pressure
to prevent a banking crisis by supporting the market. The downside risk is
thus limited. Even if there is no solid rally till the new financial year
begins in April, foreign investors might recall that the chances of currency
gain look to be greater now than later in the year.

FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group's latest issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,490.1 (+12.2)
Pearson's decision not to bid for Mirror Group is discouraging for MGN
shareholders but not fatal. It is now clear that Pounds 400m of pension fund
assets are missing, plus Pounds 100m of cash: and Pounds 500m was MGN's
market value at the time of its suspension. But it does not follow that MGN
is worthless. Suppose, on a worst conceivable case, that the full Pounds
500m were irrecoverable and had to be replaced immediately. That would give
rise to an interest bill of perhaps Pounds 55m a year. Since last year MGN
made some Pounds 84m before tax, the remaining Pounds 29m would have a
market value of Pounds 170m, assuming the same multiple as before.
The reality would be less depressing. The pension fund was Pounds 150m in
surplus, so the true deficit is only Pounds 250m. It is scarcely conceivable
that the actuary to the scheme would require all of this to be made good in
year one. Granted, a return even to normal funding would knock some Pounds
18m a year off MGN's profits, and there would be a further interest bill of
Pounds 11m to replace the missing Pounds 100m in cash. But there seems
little doubt that MGN is a viable business as it stands, particularly since
the banks which own the majority of its shares have no obvious incentive to
pull the plug.
For minority shareholders, the position remains unsatisfactory. Precisely
because MGN is healthy, its disposal is likely to be a low priority for the
administrator. In the meantime, there seems no reason why the shares should
not be traded again. The market may have no idea of the group's true
liabilities, but neither has anyone else.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Letter: Too sanguine a view of past recovery and current
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MUELLBAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, January 9) is too sanguine in
drawing parallels between the 1981-83 recovery in the UK economy and current
prospects. He argues that the 1981-83 recovery took place despite rising
real interest rates, and hence we should not worry overly about high and
rising real interest rates in 1991-92. However, he neglects to notice two
important factors fuelling the 1981-83 recovery, apart from falling nominal
interest rates from late 1981, which were negative portents.
First, in 1981-83, sterling fell at the same time as inflation, so that our
international competitiveness recovered from the absurdly damaging levels of
1980-81. In contrast, since mid-1990, our international competitiveness has
deteriorated sharply, although it has now stabilised. Second, 1981-83 saw
dramatic financial deregulation. Hire purchase controls disappeared. The
clearing banks marched into mortgage markets, more than doubling their
lending volume in 1981 to over 20 per cent of the building societies' level,
and to over 35 per cent in 1982.
By contrast, since the 1989 peak of financial liberality, the Building
Societies Commission has tightened prudential controls, the asset position
of lenders has deteriorated sharply, and bitter lessons of the consequences
of poor screening of credit risks have been learned. Financial liberality is
now in partial withdrawal from the excesses of the late 1980s.
Finally, debt-to-income ratios are higher than they were in 1981, though
backed by higher asset-to-income ratios. As most econometric models
underestimate the role of debt, there must be caution about more optimistic
forecasts for 1992.
Without endorsing the Liverpool position, I stick to the analysis in my
piece on productivity and competitiveness in the Autumn issue of the Oxford
Review of Economic Policy: a modest exchange rate adjustment in the context
of a wider EMS realignment would carry little inflationary risk, provided
domestic disinflationary policies remained in place. Since our
competitiveness against dollar and yen currency areas is in even worse shape
than against Europe, the only hope is for a spontaneous rise in the dollar
and yen. This is likely to occur later in 1992, but the position now is
grim.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Italy heading for relegation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAFT treaty on Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) makes it quite likely
that Europe will have a single currency by 1999; but its convergence
criteria make it still more likely that a two-speed Europe will result.
Since only the economically chaste will be allowed to join Emu, life before
Emu for those now ineligible will be decidedly austere. Italy, in
particular, will not merely have to make a swift move to fiscal chastity,
but will have to undergo a period of repentance for past sins as well.
Yet there is little sign that Italy's politicians appreciate the sacrifices
they will have to make if Italy is to meet the convergence criteria, every
one of which it currently fails. The 1992 budget deal, for example, agreed
before the statutory deadline for only the ninth time in the last 40 years,
ensures that Italy will end 1992 even further away from meeting the fiscal
convergence rules than at present.
The Emu treaty makes it possible to exclude any country with a national
budget deficit that exceeds 3 per cent of gross domestic product, or an
outstanding public debt that exceeds 60 per cent of GDP. But the proposed
Italian budget implies a deficit of 10.5 per cent of GDP in 1992, while the
primary deficit, excluding interest payments, which is set at 0.4 per cent
of GDP in 1992, will raise the ratio of debt to GDP above its current 104
per cent. A primary surplus of 2.8 per cent of GDP is needed just to
stabilise the debt ratio.
Over-optimistic
Even before it has been signed, and despite its evident inadequacy, the
proposed budget already looks over-optimistic. It anticipates GDP growth of
2.3 per cent in 1992, for example, higher than the OECD's optimistic
forecast of 2 per cent; it does not incorporate the higher cost of debt
service imposed by the recent rise in interest rates, from 11.5 to 12 per
cent; and it relies on further revenue from privatisation, if the
politicians can agree on what to privatise, even though expected revenue
from 1991 sales is only half in.
The election coming up this spring provides the politicians with a ready
excuse. The necessary reform of the bloated pension system and cuts in state
subsidies to industry would be highly unpopular. In addition, a sufficiently
large primary budget surplus might be highly deflationary for the Italian
economy.
Political cost
Yet every year is likely to be an election year in Italy; and the political
cost of incurring the voters' wrath now may be small against those created
by relegation to the European second division. Even so, a serious attempt to
reduce the budget deficit would probably require constitutional reform to
strengthen the government.
The text agreed in Maastricht could, in principle, permit Italy to dodge the
fiscal criteria. The treaty provision on deficits can be over-ruled if the
excess is 'exceptional and temporary' while the debt ceiling only applies if
'the ratio is not sufficiently diminishing . . . at a satisfactory pace'.
To allow Italy to enter Emu in anything like its present fallen state would
make a mockery of guidelines whose entirely proper aim is to reduce the risk
that one country's fiscal misbehaviour would impose higher than necessary
interest rates on all participants in Emu.
Currently, the Italian government pays high interest rates on its domestic
debt, to compensate investors for the risk that inflation will spirit it
away. Notionally, the European Central Bank will be prevented from bailing
out a defaulting government; but it cannot hope to make that commitment
fully credible. The fear that the European central bank might bail out a
potentially defaulting Italian government would introduce a general
inflationary risk into Emu, resulting in higher interest rates for everyone.
The political difficulty of disciplining national members once the Emu club
is operative makes it all the more important that those most likely to sin
are prevented from joining. If that is what it takes to compel the Italian
government towards fiscal self-discipline, the convergence criteria will
have served Europe, and Italy, well.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: Acis and Galatea - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is perhaps no form harder to bring off in performance today than the
baroque pastoral. Handel's score for Acis and Galatea is among his most
exquisite achievements, but the plot does not have the force or tension that
hold an audience through his Xerxes, Julius Caesar or Semele. Listening to
Handel's idea of Arcadian nymphs and shepherds is glorious, but how do you
make that idea watchable? One way, of course, is to stage it in an
approximation of the style of Handel's day: which is what the English Bach
Festival attempted on Sunday night.
But what a huge gap there is between theory and practice in reviving these
baroque operas in period style. On one level it is so distracting to watch
modern performers' efforts to recapture the exquisite refinements of an
unrecapturable era that you can hardly attend to the music. On another level
it is so interesting to be given a visible image of the idioms of that lost
time that you are grateful to find new things to hear in the music. I find I
spend half the time fending off the incidental details of the performance
before me and trying to perceive the ideal that the revival is aiming at.
The most important features of this English Bach Acis were in the music.
With just four or five voices for the choral music and eight players in the
orchestra, correspondences between song and accompaniment become keener.
The closeness between oboe and tenor in 'Consider, fond shepherd' was a
typical pleasure, and the intimate vigour of the great 'Wretched lovers'
chorus was a highlight.
The most striking feature of the stage action was its sheer amount of dance.
Choruses and arias were often accompanied by a dance quartet (choreographed
by Sarah Kremer), and I was glad to have the dance content of this music
underlined. And yet I took little pleasure in the dancing itself.
Decked out in airs, graces and smirks, it made Acis seem supercilious and
bogus - Marie-Antoniette-ish. And weren't the women's dresses, revealing the
ankles and more, anachronistic? The 1731 arrangement of Handel's 1718 score
was being used, but in 1731 only the young ballerina Marie Camargo (in
Paris) dared to shorten her skirts that far.
As Polyphemus, Jonathan Best made the strongest impression. Made-up and
costumed in nicely grotesque style, he looked and sounded the least
inhibited person onstage. His attempt to acquire courtly refinement of
gesture and gait during 'Would you gain the tender creature' was the
freshest moment of the stage action, because it commented on the whole
business of period style.
Sally Harrison sang Galatea with sweet purity, and - for a singer  - showed
a remarkable degree of understanding baroque stance, gesture and dance. It
is hard not to make Acis a tender wimp, and that is all Richard Edgar-Wilson
could manage. He looked stiff and gormless, though he sang with - yes  -
sweet purity. (That's enough sweet purity. Ed.) (But it was that kind of a
show. AM)

FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: A humorous Watteau - The work of Nicholas Lancret
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL JEROMACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most delightful small exhibitions in America at present is the
retrospective of paintings and drawings by the French 18th-century artist
Nicholas Lancret (1690-1743), lately at the Frick Collection and which
reopens at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas from February 15 to
April 2. In the Frick, a veritable chapel for devotees of the ancien regime
with its masterpieces by Boucher, Fragonard, Greuze, Chardin (and a
just-acquired early Watteau of 'Soldiers at Rest Before the Gates of a
Town'), the 28 paintings and 14 drawings by Lancret are shown to the best
advantage in the most congenial company.
Curated by American scholar Mary Tavener Holmes, the Frick show is,
surprisingly, the first ever devoted to the artist and, while a
rehabilitative effort, may be taken on its own terms just to see some of the
most delightful genre paintings of the 18th century.
The son of a coachman, Lancret begun his career as a painter of
fetes-champetres in the manner of Watteau, who, after first befriending the
younger man, became infuriated when some paintings by Lancret were
mistakenly taken to be his own. Lancret enjoyed great success in the
pastoral genres that Watteau initiated, earning the Royal patronage of Louis
XV and Frederick the Great of Prussia, who collected dozens of paintings by
Lancret and his rival, Jean-Baptiste Pater, for his palaces at Potsdam and
Sans Souci.
Although Lancret has retained a devoted following among private collectors,
the artist's critical fortunes have greatly suffered, due to the artist's
initially close dependency on Watteau. For much of this century, Lancret has
usually been dismissed as a mere facile imitator of Watteau, relying, in the
words of one ungenerous critic, on 'a set formula without understanding
(Watteau's) poetry or originality.' The Frick show demonstrates that
Lancret, while unable to fully divest himself of Watteau's style (especially
in his drawings, which as a whole are rather weak), was no slavish follower
and he explored genres and subjects that were very different from the older
master.
Whereas Watteau's genius is demonstrated in the compelling, haunting
ambiguity and silvery tones that imbues his canvases, Lancret opted instead
for both richer, bolder colours and narrative clarity in his
fetes-champetres and genre scenes, adding a cheerful humour that Watteau
eschewed.
What Lancret lacks in poetry, he makes up in affable charm. There is no
mistaking the meaning of Lancret's jolly Luncheon after the Hunt, from the
Boston Museum, featuring a gaggle of pleasantly inebriated nobles lounging
in their chairs. And the poignancy of Watteau's view of childhood is
replaced by the simple pleasures of Lancret's Toy Windmill, depicting a
pug-faced little girl blowing herself purple while vainly attempting to make
a booby-trapped toy spin.
In such paintings, Lancret is the French heir of the seemingly
straightforward 17th century Flemish and Dutch genre subjects of Dou, Metsu
and Teniers that 18th-century French connoisseurs were infatuated with
(Diderot once remarked that he would give ten Watteaus for one Teniers).
Occasionally Lancret pandered to that taste by adding figures to
17th-century Dutch kitchen interiors by Kalf, Saftleven and others (a good
example, unavailable for the Frick show, is the Wallace Collection's Flea
Catcher), and in at least one instance, Lancret's additions have been
cleaned away by judicious 20th-century restorers.
Another aspect of Lancret's art that may have been provisionally influenced
by Dutch examples, and one minimally dependant on Watteau, was the
conversation piece. Lancret was one of the very few proponents in France for
this essentially English convention, and he is represented here by his very
best examples, notably the famous La Tasse de Chocolat from the National
Gallery, London, and the Seated Hunter with a Servant (private collection,
New York), which especially recalls Gainsborough.
According to one account, Lancret's only vice was his great love for the
theatre and opera, and one of the fruits of his obsessions, and a highlight
of the show, is the pastoral portrait of the prima ballerina La Camargo
dancing with a companion (National Gallery, Washington).
If the Frick show finally coaxes Lancret's reputation out from under
Watteau's shadow, it is worth recalling that for his contemporaries, there
was no confusing the two artists.
Commenting on two Lancrets, one astute 18th century critic decreed that
while they were 'in the genre of Watteau, but in a style that M Lancret had
already created for himself - and true connoisseurs will not confuse them'.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Technology: Service to say 'Wow]' about - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Galvin, president of the US electronics company Motorola, has an
approach to 'service' which owes more to evangelism than the dictionary.
Asked to define the term he says: 'When someone received it, they always
said 'Wow]''
Few would disagree; the problem is quantifying the 'Wow]' factor in a
business environment where a 'service culture' is often taken to mean little
more than courses in courtesy for surly staff.
Service, however, is being increasingly invoked as a source of product
differentiation and competitive advantage in the 1990s. A recent survey
carried out by Digital Equipment established that more than 90 per cent of
4,000 executives polled worldwide believed that service would become more
important over the next five years.
The fact remains that just what 'service' is, and how it can be applied to
give a company an edge, is frequently misunderstood. It is often confused
with quality. OTR, a consultancy based in Brussels and London, started
investigating 'service' as a source of competitiveness last year.
It defines service as: 'The provision of something to an individual that
exceeds expectation and adds value at the same time.' An example is BT's
much improved computer-based directory inquiry service which has put an end
to delays and mumbled numbers: 'It was so good,' OTR says, 'that people
would often call a second time just to see if this impressive improvement in
service was real or just an illusion.'
OTR was particularly concerned to examine the role of information technology
in securing advantage. Its conclusions* are thought provoking. Managing
director Colin Jackson reckons that ill-thought out use of IT has played a
big part in damaging companies' attempts to improve their competitiveness
through service.
The study points to car manufacturer BMW's innovation in fixing charges for
labour and parts in motor repairs, with bills provided through a computer
system.
There was, it says, an 'automation trap' in the process. The system assumed
each repair was carried out in isolation but when more than one repair was
done at the same time, the number of hours billed often exceeded the total
time the car was physically present at the garage. Result: a clutch of
unhappy customers.
And some kinds of service need make no use of IT at all. A motor vehicle
designer studied the simple example of a motorist putting petrol into his or
her car with a view to incorporating electronics that would demonstrate that
the car was safe and efficient.
The options included indicators to show the state of the car with the engine
turned off and ones to demonstrate the number of miles' or kilometres' worth
of petrol in the tank. A technique for estimating the value of a service,
called Service Assessment, which OTR is promoting, showed that a simple
petrol cap retainer would be welcomed far more than sophisticated displays.
The study also explains why 'sustainable competitive advantage', a buzzword
of the 1980s, proved false. Service involves exceeding customer
expectations, which evolve over time. 'Wow]' quickly becomes 'Ho-hum'. So
competing with service means continually moving on. Advantage has to be
reinvented.
So do competitive methods. Service may be the touchstone for the next few
years, just as quality was for the 1980s, but competition is a great
leveller. The winners in the late 1990s will be those who know when to say
'Wow]' next.

Concurrent engineering? Never heard of it, say 66 per cent of senior

That is one finding of the 1992 Manufacturing Attitudes Survey* sponsored by

survey, conducted by Benchmark Research, polled 152 senior managers.
It confirms that UK manufacturers have made great strides in reducing costs
and improving product quality but they still have plenty of catching up to
do on reducing product development times.
The survey makes interesting reading in the aftermath of last week's
initiative by the National Economic Development Council to spread the word
about new manufacturing techniques throughout British industry.
When asked what the key manufacturing issues would be in the next five
years, more than 95 per cent of respondents said cost-reduction and more
than 80 per cent said quality. Just 60 per cent said reducing
time-to-market.
Garreth Evans, Computervision UK managing director, said: 'The success of
many multinational companies demonstrates that reducing time-to-market has a
colossal beneficial impact on costs and quality. Why don't UK organisations
recognise this?'
Encouragingly, the survey found that 70 per cent of the sample had
introduced multi-disciplinary project teams - an essential element of the
concurrent, or simultaneous engineering, approach.
And 44 per cent of these sites had included customers in the teamwork
process. Of the 34 per cent who had heard of concurrent engineering, 72 per
cent agreed that it offered a significant advantage over current methods of
development.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Putting your money where
your mouth is - Personal guarantees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few aspects of the relationship between the banks and their smaller business
customers generate more emotion than the issue of personal guarantees.
Deciding to trade as a limited company offers no protection because bank
managers routinely require directors to sign personal guarantees anyway. Nor
is this just a question for the smallest of firms: the directors of
businesses with turnover of up to Pounds 10m have been asked for personal
security.
A recent suggestion from the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies was for the
family home to be excluded from personal assets liable to be forfeited.
The bankers argue that many young businesses may have few assets - sometimes
just Pounds 2 of paid-up capital - and the only prudent way to cover the
risk on their loan is to demand a personal guarantee, backed by a charge on
the owner's house. It is not uncommon for unscrupulous business owners to
shut down one business and, protected from their creditors by limited
liability, start up again under another name.
Worries like these explain why nearly 26 per cent of small business owners
provided personal guarantees compared with just 24 per cent who provided
business collateral, according to a survey by the Forum of Private Business,
a lobby group.
Taking up personal guarantees also acts as an additional motivation, the
banks believe. 'Most small businesses are entirely dependent on one or two
individuals,' says Andy Hunter, deputy head of small business services at
National Westminster Bank. 'Without personal guarantees they could walk away
when the going gets tough.'
But small business owners reject this argument and say that the fear of
losing your home as well as your business puts an intolerable strain on the
individual. 'We find it insulting that banks should demand personal
guarantees to demonstrate commitment,' says Stan Mendham, chief executive of
the forum.
'When a bank takes security it stops worrying about you and feels less need
to provide advice,' says Richard Parkinson, managing director of The Bank
Relationship Consultancy.
Small business owners claim they are frequently brow-beaten into providing
personal guarantees when they are desperate for funds. The Hertfordshire
businessman quoted above recalls his bank manager asked for an unlimited
guarantee saying: 'It is only a formality.' But the business's income dried
up and the businessman was forced to put his business into liquidation.
There followed a two-year battle, eventually successful, to resist pressure
to call in the personal guarantee.
For their part, the bankers have developed a weary caution to their
customers' complaints that they were cajoled into giving guarantees. 'It is
only a sensitive issue when we call the guarantee in,' says Stuart White,
manager of the enterprise unit of Midland Bank.
White, and other bankers, insist they do not 'rush in with all guns blazing'
when it comes to calling guarantees. The banks are sensitive to the bad
publicity which would result from putting families out on the street. They
will therefore attempt to recoup their losses by selling business assets,
personal insurance policies and share securities before calling in their
charge on the business owner's home.
What they hope is that the owner will realise the extent of his problems and
sell up, perhaps moving to a smaller house. But what may appear to be
sensible advice from the point of view of the bank manager can look like
unwarranted pressure in the eyes of the unsuccessful businessman or woman.
Personal guarantees are probably more likely to be asked for than in the
past in the present tough economic climate. But before providing guarantees,
would-be borrowers should:
Do all they can reduce the likelihood of the bank manager asking for
guarantees by providing as much information as possible on the state of
their business. In particular, businesses should provide information to
demonstrate how they are managing their cash as well as forecasts of future
cash flows.
Refuse to sign unlimited guarantees. Guarantees and the charges and
mortgages which support them should roughly match the amount which has been
borrowed, says Parkinson.
The banks sometimes argue that it is not necessary to place a limit on the
guarantee since they are only able to recoup the amount they are owed. But
business owners claim that bank managers will refuse to increase a loan
facility on the grounds that the borrower can offer no further security -
even when the security already pledged is far larger than the original sum
borrowed.
Place a time limit on the guarantee. If they sign an open ended guarantee,
it may be difficult persuading the bank manager to release them from it
later. Insist that the guarantee is subject to regular review or tie it in
to performance criteria so that the guarantee expires when the business
generates sufficient profits and assets of its own.
If a guarantee has been lifted, make sure this fact is recorded at Companies
House or at the Land Registry, advises David Burton of The Centre for
Consultancy (Surrey). It is not the bank's job to set these records straight
and the business may have problems raising loans in future if expired
charges are still on the record.
Make sure that the earnings on any securities or cash deposited with the
bank to support a personal guarantee are credited to the customer's account.
Take professional advice. The bank's contract documents can be all-embracing
and the pressure to sign personal guarantees can be continuous - in regular
review meetings and even at social occasions. Do not sign on the spur of the
moment and weigh the cost of taking professional advice against the possible
loss of personal assets if things go wrong.
Finally. Do not be afraid to negotiate. The bank may tell you that its
method of valuing businesses and personal assets has to be applied but the
customer does not have to accept this. It may tell you that the wording of
its legal contracts cannot be changed but the customer should negotiate all
the same.
All of the banks which have produced codes of conduct for dealing with
business customers - Midland, Lloyds, NatWest, Barclays, Bank of Scotland
and TSB - refer to the issue of collateral and personal guarantees. But they
have not won high ratings from the Forum of Private Business, which has
attempted to assess the banks' codes. With the exception of the Bank of
Scotland, which was rated 50 per cent for its policy on security, all were
rated just 33 per cent.
The forum wanted a clear explanation of the security required; of the period
for which it would run with review dates; and one month's notice of any
changes in the security needed. The banks do not appear to have matched even
these basic requirements.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Secrets of marketing
success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do small businesses market themselves successfully?
Researchers in the north-east of England have been studying local
fast-growth businesses to see what makes them different from less successful
rivals. A study* of 30 companies - each about 10 years old and employing
more than 100 people - revealed the following success factors:
Marketing expertise was available from executive board members or
non-executives.
Marketing was regarded as fundamental to the business's operations. Less
successful firms viewed it as 'best left to the marketing people'.
Market and customer information was gathered rapidly but selectively, and
drawn upon in taking decisions. Less successful firms gathered similar
amounts of information but did not make use of it.
Top management made itself available to customers. Some gave customers'
office, car phone and home numbers.
Quality of product or service and customer care were given high priority.
British quality assurance standard BS 5750 had become the norm.
A willingness to take on their customers' problems as their own. In some
cases companies actively sought out problems facing their customers and
devised solutions.
A strong corporate identity and internal corporate culture. Overalls in the
company colours bearing the corporate logo, letterheads and the colour of
office furnishings all demonstrated a corporate unity and the 'feel' of
success.
Close partnership with suppliers and distributors. One company fitted phones
in its distributor's lorries to keep customers informed about deliveries and
delays.
Key management travelled extensively to stay in touch with customers.
They concentrated on developing markets and fulfilling market demand before
developing new products.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Schoolmaster's majority frees his
tongue - Some Budget musings from backbench sage Terence Higgins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A harsh UK recession that refuses to bend to the political cycle, and
Tory MPs with small majorities beginning to sweat, these are testing times
for backbench loyalists, even of the stature of Mr Terence Higgins.
The dutiful, respected chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee is
a barometer of backbench opinion amid the increasingly frenzied pre-election
campaigning at Westminster.
His standing makes any criticism of the government, and his suggestions for
the Budget, all the more powerful. As MPs returned yesterday from the
Christmas recess, he called on the government to inject a 'fiscal stimulus'
into the economy by allowing local authorities to spend some of the receipts
accumulated from the sale of council houses.
Such steps have been advanced by the Labour party but Mr Higgins, a former
Treasury minister, says it would have to be a strictly time-limited bonanza,
through fear of jeopardising government control over expenditure when solid
economic growth re-emerges.
If there is scope for tax cuts in the Budget, he said Mr Norman Lamont, the
Chancellor, should raise allowances so fewer people pay tax - rather than a
straight cut in the basic rate. The impact, he believes, would not be felt
until after the election anyway.
His pet argument is that the inadequacies of economic forecasting should
mean Treasury ministers regularly using the Budget and the autumn statement
for both expenditure and taxation decisions.
Like ministers, he is cautious about the prospects for recovery but insists
that it is underway. 'I think it is beginning to start now,' he said.
An 18,500 majority, such as he holds at Worthing, certainly helps keep a
cool head. But it is not in Mr Higgins's nature to be unduly rebellious or
to court publicity. Respected by Labour and Tories alike for his seriousness
and economic expertise, he knows that the damage inflicted by a political
spat with the Treasury would be measured in votes.
Mr Higgins's reputation at Westminster is for greyness, conscientiousness
and a distaste for rocking the boat. He is not a politician's politician.
Despite a low public profile, he has been tipped as the next Speaker of the
Commons.
Such a cautious, dutiful approach can only earn the respect of Mr John
Major. It is not the only similarity. Both are acolytes of Mr Iain MacLeod,
under whom Mr Higgins served in the early 1970s. Mr Higgins is a confidant
of the prime minister and was an active member of his campaign team during
the 1990 Tory election leadership. He describes himself as 'rightwing' on
economic issues, 'more progressive' on social issues.
The difference with Mr Major, which probably explains why he has not been
offered a ministerial post under the new regime, is generational. Mr Higgins
is 63 - although he displays the fitness of the former Olympic runner that
he is.
With beaked nose and triangular chin, he sometimes looks, colleagues on the
Treasury select committee say, like an embarrassed schoolmaster controling
recalcitrant children. The committee is known for its idiosyncratic
membership, including adherents to almost every economic theory.
He is a 'thoroughly decent chap,' said one MP. 'A more interesting person
would do the job far less well,' said another.
Committee reports have been critical of the Treasury. It warned of the
dangers of recession well before ministers conceded the possibility and told
them that it would be longer and deeper than they expected. Yet Mr Higgins
likes his committee's reports to offer 'persuasive criticism'. He writes the
first draft himself, and even after amendment they are often strongly his
work.
His consensus-itis irritates some colleagues. Mr Brian Sedgemore, maverick
Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, has attacked him for not
speeding its investigation into the collapse of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International. Mr Higgins insists that the timetable was agreed by
the whole committee.
The Commons select committee system is 'enormously close to my heart', he
said. Set up under the government of Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1979, he said
it might be her most lasting achievement.
'The Falklands war will recede into history, trade union reform may become
embodied in our legal framework but hopefully we will still have a
departmentally related select committee for many years to come.'
He thinks carefully about the constitutional role of MPs, describing himself
as a 'Burkeian' in which an MP is a representative, not a delegate of his
constituency. Hence he can vote against capital punishment in spite of the
almost certainly less inhibited views in his affluent, but sleepy, seaside
constituency.
His parliamentary longevity gives him an air of experience and
level-headedness. Besides the Treasury committee, he also chairs the Commons
liaison committee, which links all the departmental select committees. He
also serves on the executive of the 1922 committee of backbench
Conservatives.
To get involved in murky world of modern electoral politics is, thus,
perhaps somehow out of character. Hence he is believable when he says his
concern about Budget measures is over the long-run impact on the economy. 'I
don't see this in terms of the election at all,' he says.

   ADVOCATES of a National Lottery yesterday called on opponents
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
particularly the football pools companies - to recognise that they were
backing a losing cause and to concentrate instead on ensuring they benefited
from its introduction, David Owen writes.
They admitted, however, that a bill to establish a lottery may not complete
its passage during the present session.
Mr Ivan Lawrence (C Burton), the bill's sponsor, said: 'Even if a general
election were to stop the bill's passage through Parliament, if public
support is shown to be strong enough the next government will almost have to
establish a national lottery.'
The proposed legislation, expected to receive support of MPs in both major
parties, will be debated in the Commons at the head of the list of private
members' bills on Friday.
Mr Lawrence yesterday projected that a lottery would raise about Pounds 3bn
a year, of which Pounds 1bn would be paid out in prizes and a further Pounds
1bn allocated to 'good causes.'

FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell issue sets committee at
centre stage - The powers of parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of parliament's select committee system has been thrown into the
balance as a consequence of the Maxwell brothers' refusal yesterday to
answer questions on the management of the Mirror Group's pension fund,
several MPs claimed last night.
If parliament does not now act decisively, some academics agree that the
backbenchers' committees - chiefly intended to act as a check on the
executive power of government - could suffer an irreversible diminution of
power.
But others - not least, in private, many government ministers  - are likely
to counter that the committees' powers have always been exaggerated and
centre specifically on a custom-and-practice, not legal rights, to question
the government.
Responding to the challenge yesterday, Mr Frank Field, the chairman of the
social security committee that had attempted to question the brothers, said
the issue must now be tackled by parliament itself.
'This has raised questions of crucial constitutional importance and I am
anxious they are dealt with in as non-controversial a way as possible,' he
said.
Nonetheless, while emphasising that the interests of parliament, the Mirror
Group pensioners and the Maxwells were all at stake, he added: 'The Maxwell
brothers in one stroke have brought two issues to a head: the lack of
ownership members have of pension funds and, second, what will happen to the
select committee system.'
The question of the Maxwell's right to stay silent in the face of
questioning by the committee will now go to the 'usual channels' - a
parliamentary euphemism for a behind the scenes negotiation between the two
main political parties.
Once a decision is taken, the committee will formally report the event by
publishing a report to the House. Many committee members of all parties
believe that the government and the Labour leadership can have little
alternative but to take some action or risk being seen as defending the
Maxwells' interests before those of parliament or aggrieved Mirror
pensioners.
They also pointed out that some questions asked yesterday did not raise any
suggestion that the brothers had been involved in alleged wrong-doing,
thereby rendering invalid the claim that they could prejudice any future
trial.
But what recourse does parliament have? The last time a citizen was fined
directly by parliament for contempt of its powers was as long ago as 1660
and the last custodial sentence was in 1880. Both decisions were of dubious
legality.
This century the last time punitive action was taken against a citizen was
in 1955 when Sir (then Mr) John Junor, a journalist, was called to the bar
of the Commons for an official reprimand for imputing that MPs were
receiving excess petrol rations.
What is more the modern select committee system has only been in force since
1980 when Mr Norman (now Lord) St John-Stevas overhauled it to allow MPs to
'shadow' government departments. Though this has raised a perception of
enhanced powers for backbenchers, hopes that they would become as powerful
as their US Congressional equivalents have been largely disappointed.
In reality, ministers have proved adept at stonewalling the committees when
they so desire. There are also no sanctions to force them to give evidence
or even to oblige them to attend. Furthermore, with (in most cases) a
government majority built-in to committee memberships, questioning can often
be tame.
As one former Cabinet minister noted contemptuously last month: 'A third of
a committee's members are young supporters of the government anxious for
office, a third are has-beens and a third are political opponents whose
criticisms can be dismissed.'

FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Independent Bank is central,
Ashdown says - Liberal Democrat Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATIONAL independence for the Bank of England was yesterday spelt out as
a key aim for Liberal Democrats in a hung parliament.
In a letter to the party's MPs, Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said that
removing the control of interest-rate policy from politicians to an
independent bank would be particularly important in the context of a hung
parliament 'to provide economic stability and credibility'.
Neither Labour nor the Conservatives favour giving the Bank of England
independence, although its role would necessarily change as a result of
European economic and monetary union.
The letter elaborates on Mr Ashdown's weekend statement that a four-year
government programme and no income tax cuts would be among the conditions
for Liberal Democrat support if no party had an overall majority.
He has already made clear that the party would insist on electoral reform as
the essential condition for involvement in a coalition government.
Mr Ashdown's letter balanced the need to invest in public services,
especially education and training, with a commitment to use Liberal Democrat
influence to stop Labour imposing 'penal tax rates' on middle management
employees earning salaries greater than Pounds 27,000.
Senior ministers in the present cabinet had called for a freedom of
information act before taking office, Mr Archy Kirkwood (Lib Dem Roxburgh
and Berwickshire) said yesterday as he launched his freedom of information
bill.
The private members bill may be debated in the Commons on January 24.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Small business cites satisfaction as goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than nine out of 10 people running small businesses in Britain would
start up all over again in spite of the obstacles and relatively meagre
rewards, according to a survey published yesterday by Barclays Bank.
Independence rather than a desire for riches is the main incentive for
people setting up businesses, the survey adds.
The owners of such small businesses worked on average more than 60 hours a
week and earned only Pounds 6.67 an hour, compared with the average wage of
Pounds 7.30 an hour for a normal 40-hour week.
There are 400,000 more small businesses than a decade ago.
Of the 400 business owners questioned in the survey 68 per cent said they
found more satisfaction from being their own boss than from working for
somebody else. Although money was not the main motivation for run-ning their
own businesses, 32 per cent thought it would offer better financial
pros-pects.
A third said that when they worked for others they thought they could do
better than their employers or other businesses in the field. A further 31
per cent thought they could do as well as existing businesses. Nineteen per
cent had identified a gap in the market or developed a new product or
service.
The qualities that those questioned said were needed to succeed were hard
work, mentioned by 91 per cent, determination (89 per cent), pride (87 per
cent) and being good with people (76 per cent). The less highly rated
characteristics were intelligence (21 per cent), aggression (13 per cent)
and cunning (9 per cent). The single most important piece of advice offered
by people who had started up businesses was to 'research your market' (19
per cent) followed by 'get good advice' (18 per cent).
Women believed that they faced more difficulties than men in getting started
in business. Forty-five per cent said they were not taken seriously, while
40 per cent mentioned the additional burdens of family responsibilities, 26
per cent sex discrimination by suppliers or customers and 15 per cent
pressure to stay at home.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Air traffic musters modest effort to shake off recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR TRAFFIC is continuing to recover from its depressed levels of last year,
according to figures released yesterday, but the civil aviation industry is
still struggling to climb out of recession.
BAA, the former British Airports Authority, reported that passenger traffic
at its eight airports increased by 3.1 per cent to 5.5m passengers last
month compared with December 1990.
British Airways also reported continued recovery in traffic last month with
a 0.3 per cent rise compared with the same month of 1990.
Although the latest BAA and BA statistics have confirmed a tentative
recovery in air traffic after the collapse caused by the Gulf war and the
recession, airline yields remain under severe pressure because of the
intense competition in the airline business.
One of the reasons for the rise in air traffic is the significant discounts
on fares being offered by international carriers. The discounts have
depressed the carriers' yields.
The latest BAA figures showed that the traffic on UK domestic routes was
still 1.6 per cent below 1991's level, reflecting the effects of the
recession on domestic air travel.
Against that, all other markets showed an increase. European scheduled
traffic increased by 1.1 per cent and European charter traffic was 10 per
cent higher.
North Atlantic and other long-distance routes rose by 6.6 per cent and 6.3
per cent last month compared with December 1990.
Overall, BAA handled a total of 69.59m passengers last year, a 6.2 per cent
decline compared with 1990.
Much of that increase has arisen from the opening of Stansted's new terminal
last spring. Passenger traffic there increased by nearly 46 per cent to
1.68m people. At Heathrow airport passengers declined by 5.6 per cent to
40.25m last year, while at Gatwick it declined by 11.2 per cent to 18.69m.
BA's figures also showed growth in air traffic restricted to
intercontinental services, with the domestic UK and European markets still
contending with sluggish demand.
That pattern is further confirmed by the latest traffic statistics released
by the Association of European Airlines (AEA). Those showed an increase of
3.6 per cent in overall international passenger traffic in November 1991
compared with November 1990 but a 1.1 per cent decline in European traffic.
The AEA, which groups 22 European carriers, said the fall in European
passenger traffic was a reflection not only of the persistent economic
recession but also of the impact of Yugoslavia's civil war on air travel.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Slaughters tops takeover advice table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLAUGHTER and May, the City firm of solicitors, has emerged as the leading
legal adviser to companies and financial advisers involved in UK public
takeovers during 1991.
The firm ended the year well ahead of its nearest rival as a result of its
part in 24 UK public bids with a combined value of Pounds 5.49bn, according
to a league table that ranks lawyers by the value of the takeovers in which
they acted as advisers.
The table, produced by Acquisitions Monthly magazine, places Freshfields
second, with 21 deals which were worth Pounds 4.17bn, and Norton Rose third,
with 18 deals worth Pounds 2.85bn. Freshfields came first in 1990.
In 1990 Slaughters was third in the rankings, having dealt with a total of
30 deals worth Pounds 5.5bn.
Although it was ranked leading adviser in the first six months of 1991,
having acted for Williams Holdings in its Pounds 406m bid for Yale &amp; Valor
and helped Frogmore Estates beat off a Pounds 139m bid from Southend
Property, most of its mergers and acquisitions work fell into the last
quarter.
In the last three months of 1991, it acted for BTR in its Pounds 1.4bn bid
for Hawker Siddeley, Lasmo in its Pounds 1.03bn bid for Ultramar, and
Williams Holdings in its Pounds 764m unsuccessful bid for Racal Electronics.
Slaughters, however, is ranked only fifth in the league table of those
working for financial advisers involved in UK public bids in 1991, having
acted notably only for Kleinwort Benson in its advice to American Brands in
its unsuccessful Pounds 350m bid for Invergordon Distillers.
Freshfields was the top legal adviser to financial advisers in 1991, having
acted for Hambro Magan and BZW on their advice to BTR in its bid for Hawker
Siddeley, and for County NatWest, which advised Beazer on its Pounds 403m
sale to Hanson.
Overall, the 20 most active law firms in the field acted on 145 failed and
completed UK public bids worth Pounds 15bn in 1991. This compared with 200
deals worth Pounds 24bn in 1990 and 263 deals worth Pounds 137bn in 1989.
This demonstrated the dramatic decline in merger-and-acquisition activity in
the UK over the past two years.
The magazine comments that in spite of the decline law firms seem to have
survived the recession very well. Unlike bankers, they do not work on a
contingent fee basis and so they get paid regardless of the outcome of a
deal. Also they do not take any risks in the corporate market in terms of
lending, investing or underwriting.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Treatment works to cost Pounds 350m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE WATER companies are to invest a total of Pounds 350m in advanced water
treatment works to make their operations conform with the European Community
drinking water directive.
The nine cover 7 per cent of England's water supply and serve more than 4m
people. The UK government is at present before the European Court over its
failure to ensure that drinking water in parts of England meets the European
standard.
Yesterday Mr Michael Healey, chief inspector of the Drinking Water
Directorate, announced that Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, had
approved undertakings from the nine companies. They provide for the best
available treatment technology to be installed at 32 treatment works to deal
with pesticide residues in drinking water.
Britain should have been conforming with the EC Drinking Water Directive by
1985.
Most of the improvements announced yesterday will be completed by 1995 but
four new plants will not be finished until 1996 and 1997.
The nine companies are: Severn Trent, Southern, East Surrey, North Surrey,
Tendring Hundred in Essex, Sutton in Surrey, and Eastbourne.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Japanese critical of skill levels in
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is likely to lose its dominant share of European inward investment
from Japanese companies as they start to produce more sophisticated products
away from home, according to a report commissioned by the Department of
Employment.
The report, leaked to the magazine Personnel Today, says that personnel
managers in Japanese companies are highly critical of UK skill levels and
the poor quality of job candidates.
The report was drawn up by the National Training Task Force, the voluntary
body set up in 1989 to advise on the establishment of Training and
Enterprise Councils.
It says 85 per cent of personnel managers in Japanese manufacturing
companies in the north-east found that candidates had serious skill
shortcomings.
In the Midlands and south Wales the figure was about 70 per cent.
In Scotland it was five out of 10 and in north Wales four out of 10.
According to the report, literacy, numeracy and technical skills are in
particularly short supply.
Mr Clive Morton, personnel director at Komatsu, said: 'Where investors run
into trouble is in starting up with the existing level of skills in Britain.
We have a long way to go before we meet the standards of Germany and
France.'
According to the Japanese External Trade Organisation, 137 Japanese
companies are considering investment plans in Germany, compared with 107 in
the UK.
Britain has so far attracted more than Pounds 12bn in Japanese inward
investment, almost half of Japanese investment of the total for Europe.
Recently, though, Mitsubishi Electric decided to build a Pounds 500m
semiconductor plant in Germany rather than the UK.
A separate report in Personnel Today says that Asda, the supermarket group,
is reviewing its participation in the government's National Vocational
Qualification scheme.
Asda, which was a pioneer of the scheme, is reported as saying that the
system has become too costly and bureaucratic.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Leyland DAF sees truck sales 'turning corner'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND DAF, which has deposed Iveco Ford as the UK truck market leader,
says it believes commercial-vehicle sales may be 'turning the corner' after
the worst year for truck sales in the UK since 1954.
Only 32,154 trucks 'proper' - those weighing more than 3.5 tonnes  - found
buyers last year. This is 33.7 per cent less than in 1990 and less than half
the level of 1989, when 69,234 were sold.
However, according to Mr David Gill, Leyland DAF's truck marketing and sales
director, 'all the evidence suggests there will be recovery this year'.
Leyland DAF's forecast - echoed by some other manufacturers  - is for a
recovery to between 38,000 and 42,000 sales this year.
The severity of the slide in the truck industry was reflected in short-time
working, job cuts and a widespread plunge into losses. The difficulties were
exacerbated by the steepness of the fall in sales.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show the fall
in sales to have been the sharpest since the Second World War.
Total sales of commercial vehicles, including vans and coaches and buses,
were 209,021, down 28.78 per cent on 1990's 293,473. That represents a 43.68
per cent drop on sales in 1989.
Statistics for sales last month showed a slight improvement, with a drop of
only 12.37 per cent in sales of all commercial vehicles, to 11,288, compared
with the previous year's level.
The figures showed that the share of the total market taken by imports last
year fell to 35.51 per cent from 37.62 per cent in 1990.
The sharpest fall in imports was in the sector for small vans, mainly those
derived from cars. This is one of the biggest market sectors. The share of
importers - led by French carmakers the Peugeot group and Renault - fell by
45 per cent, compared with a market decrease of 31.87 per cent. By far the
biggest beneficiary was Ford, whose sales in the sector fell by only 15.14
per cent as new products such as its Fiesta-based Courier van arrived on the
market.
Ford, whose Transit van range has allowed it to dominate the market for
medium-sized vans for many years, lost ground in the sector to Leyland DAF.
That followed the decision to switch production to a new version of the
Transit in the autumn. However, Ford expects the move to increase market
share this year. Even so, it still outsold second-placed Leyland DAF vans by
more than three to one.
Imports in that sector fell to 40.8 per cent from 44.02 in 1990. The biggest
casualty was Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer, whose sales fell by 42.04
per cent. That was partly the result of a long-running row between Nissan
and Nissan UK, Mr Octav Botnar's import and distribution organisation. The
dispute turned into open warfare and the eventual termination of Nissan UK's
franchise.
Production changeovers, as Iveco Ford prepared for the launch of its new
Eurocargo truck range, were also seen as a possible factor in Leyland DAF's
assumption of the truck market leadership after several years of intensely
close competition between the two rivals.
The worst affected sector of all was that for heavy trucks - those weighing
more than 15 tonnes - where sales fell by 34.82 per cent. The sector
suffered as replacement demand failed to materialise in the construction and
other key truck-using industries.
According to Leyland DAF's Mr Gill, however, an increasing number of
operators this year will be unable to defer for any longer the replacement
of their ageing fleets.
Mr Gill said companies would be forced to make 'distress purchases' of
vehicles 'which have finally turned their wheels in the air'.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Wage gap 'wider than in 1886'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between the earnings of the highest and lowest-paid employees is
wider today than it was in Victorian times, according to an analysis of
official figures carried out for the Council of Europe by the Low Pay Unit
pressure group.
According to the LPU analysis the lowest tenth of male earnings was 68.6 per
cent of median male earnings in 1886, when pay figures were first recorded.
In 1991 the figure had dropped to 64.2 per cent.
At the same time the high-est tenth of male earnings were 143.1 per cent of
the median in 1886 and 160.1 per cent in 1991, the figures show.
More than 27 per cent of full-time workers earn less than the LPU's low pay
threshold - set at two thirds of average male earnings  - even when overtime
pay is included, according to the group.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Ford workers warned that productivity must rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Ford's Fiesta production plant at Dagenham have been told that
productivity must improve sharply if the plant is to be sure of having a
role in building the present model's successor.
Ford denied last night that it had issued an ultimatum to the workforce but
acknowledged that it had set targets to improve performance.
The company said that if those were not met, the 'ultimate sanction is that
the business can be lost'.
According to a confidential internal Ford memo the 7,000 workers employed on
Fiesta production at Dagenham required 52.2 hours to build a car in 1990.
That compares with 33.3 at Ford's Valencia plant in Spain and only 29.9
hours at its Cologne plant in Germany.
Dagenham's figure for 1991 was forecast to improve to 40 hours a car,
compared with marginal improvements at Valencia and Cologne. However, it is
understood to have achieved only about 46 hours a car, resulting in the
performance targets for this year in a series of briefings to employees by
Mr Albert Caspers, Ford's vice-president of manufacturing.
The company maintains that although wage rates are lower than in the
continental plants, Ford's UK labour and overhead costs are substantially
higher.
Ford's present Fiesta model is only two years old and is unlikely to be
replaced before the mid 1990s. Nevertheless, it has been indicated to
Dagenham employees that fundamental decisions about how production of the
replacement will be distributed are likely to be taken within the next 12
months.
In spite of the productivity gap Ford has been relatively complimentary
about the improvements achieved at the plant since Sierra production was
withdrawn and it began producing only Fiestas two years ago. In 1989, for
example, it took Dagenham 59.4 hours a car.
The improvement has been sufficient for Ford to have resumed significant
exports to the Continent. About half Dagenham's output of 223,000 Fiestas
was exported last year.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Water authority plans new charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for a national charges scheme for the taking of water from rivers,
lakes and underground sources in England and Wales were put forward
yesterday by the National Rivers Authority, the environmental regulator.
Most organisations, including water companies and industries that abstract
water, need an NRA licence and have to pay charges.
The scheme, to start next year, would replace the present complex and
bureaucratic regional system, which produces more than 450 combinations of
charges.
There would be two elements to the new system, which should be finalised in
the summer after consultations with water companies, industry, farmers and
others. Those are an application charge and an annual charge, which would be
set to cover the costs of the NRA's work on dealing with low-flow rivers and
of planning future resources. About Pounds 74m is needed to fund work this
year.
Annual charges would be based on the volume of water authorised to be
licensed each year and calculated using a unit rate of charge, which the NRA
would fix each year, together with factors representing the nature of the
source from which water is abstracted, the season when water is taken and
the net loss to water resources.
The NRA proposes a different unit charge rate for each of its 10 regions,
although a single national rate has not been ruled out.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Allowances to workers in London
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLOWANCES of more than Pounds 3,000 a year for staff working in central
London are now commonplace, according to a study.
The report by Incomes Data Services, the pay research group, found that two
thirds of employers increased allowances last year in spite of the
recession. There are, however, significant sectoral variations.
Three quarters of companies in retail and oil and chemicals increased their
allowances last year, but only about half the finance sector organisations
did so. Of the big four high street banks, all but one - National
Westminster - held their allowances at 1990 or earlier levels. The
government refused for the third year running to increase London allowances
for civil servants.
The study examined allowances paid by 170 organisations in London and the
south-east. Of those, 59 had inner-London allowances of Pounds 3,000 or
more, mostly in the finance sector.
About two thirds of building societies increased location allowances last
year. Alliance &amp; Leicester's service-related payments are the highest -
rising to a maximum of Pounds 4,440.
Among oil and chemicals companies, the highest allowance is paid by Imperial
Chemical Industries (Pounds 3,400).
In retailing, 16 of 21 organisations surveyed increased allowances last year
in spite of the recession. The highest allowances are reserved for stores in
the West End. Littlewoods pays Pounds 53.12 a week, BHS Pounds 64.20 and
Burtons Pounds 37.

FT  14 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): BT to appeal against RSI damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT ANNOUNCED yesterday that it would appeal against a court order to pay
damages to two former keyboard operators who suffered repetitive strain
injury (RSI).
The case is widely regarded as a test case on RSI and is being watched
closely by employers and unions.
In an unusual move, BT said it would be offering a 'substantial financial
contribution' to the National Communications Union, which backs the former
keyboard operators.
BT said: 'This is clearly a test case of some importance, not only to us but
to other companies.'
It said that it was making the contribution to what will be 'hefty costs'
for the NCU in defending the appeal 'as a matter of goodwill'.
The former keyboard operators were awarded Pounds 6,000 damages each for
pain and suffering, plus Pounds 660 in interest at a county court in the
City of London last month. Loss of earnings have yet to be calculated. The
court ruled that BT had failed to provide adequate desks and chairs for the
operators and had failed to ensure correct posture.
Another nine associated cases have still to be heard. According to the NCU
more than 90 other cases against BT are pending.
RSI mainly affects the arms and hands of workers and can cause severe pain
and disablement. It has been associated with manufacturing jobs but is
increasingly being linked to keyboard work.
BT said it was appealing against the judgment because, in its view, the
organisation 'should never have been held responsible for injuries the
nature of which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the causes of
which are still the subject of medical controversy'.
Financial Times journalists yesterday decided to hold a new ballot on
industrial action after the 28-day mandate of a previous ballot expired.
The journalists voted by 173 to 67 to take strike action last month after
the management said it was considering compulsorily retiring nine
journalists on health grounds.
The journalists affected are all suffering from repetitive strain injury.
The management has said it will be presenting a new offer in the near
future.

FT  14 JAN 92 / James McCallum: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES (Jim) McCallum, who died in hospital on Sunday at the age of 28, had
already established a reputation as a skilled and accurate FT reporter who
could get to the heart of complicated financial markets and explain them
with clarity and authority.
Educated at George Heriot's school in Edinburgh and at the London School of
Economics, he started in journalism in 1985 with the Financial Times World
Commodity Report. Brief spells there and at the shipping magazine Seatrade
led him to the Knight-Ridder financial news agency in 1986.
He had discovered the subject in which he was to specialise: the working of
the world's financial mar-kets.
In September 1989 he joined the FT's UK stock market reporting team and
quickly established a reputation with his colleagues and the markets. In the
2 1/2 years he worked for the paper he wrote on stock markets, stock index
futures, currencies and the money markets.
Those are not always the most intrinsically exciting of subjects but Jim
could explain why their daily movements were important and he could do so
with skill and authority.
His reports were required reading for those earning their living in these
markets. Senior figures in the City always found the time to talk to him and
his sharpness of mind and cheerfulness of disposition easily converted
contacts into friends.
He stood at the threshold of a wider career in journalism but his reputation
among his colleagues was already secure. His goodheartedness, genuine
affection and concern for his fellows was rooted in his active socialism, a
central feature of his character.
He suffered an aneurysm of the brain on New Year's Day and was immediately
admitted to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.
He is survived by his parents, Mr and Mrs Ian McCallum of Edinburgh, and
their family.

THE crown jewels, one of Britain's most priceless assets, are to be made
more accessible to the public. The move is aimed at maximising revenue for
the Department of the Environment - currently estimated at Pounds 11.5m a
year in visitors' receipts. But it might prove a nightmare in terms of
security.
The centuries-old jewels consist of the regalia of the English crown - the
Scottish regalia are kept in Edinburgh Castle - together with jewellery
brought together by a variety of European sovereigns. They include the
Imperial State Crown, which contains 3,538 diamonds, 17 sapphires, eight
emeralds, five rubies and 165 pearls.
The Historic Royal Palaces Agency, which manages the jewels on behalf of the
DoE, has approved plans to move the jewels from their present location 50 ft
below ground at the Tower of London to a larger room on the ground floor of
the Tower by April 1994.
The jewels' present home was built in 1967 when the Tower was taking in
between 5,000 and 8,000 visitors a day. A trebling in the number of
potential visitors to the Tower over the last 20 years has meant that the
jewels have become increasingly difficult to look at in comfort.
Col Hamish Mackinlay, deputy governor at the Tower, insisted last night that
in its drive to make the jewels more accessible to the public, every
precaution would be taken not to make it easier for 'another Captain Blood'
to attempt to steal them.
In 1671, Irish-born Captain Blood, a renegade officer in the service of King
Charles II, was arrested with his two accomplices after attempting to run
away with various regal items of considerable worth.
One security expert, aware of the present-day existence of more
sophisticated criminals, warned that there would have to be a thorough
'threat analysis' before the jewels were finally transferred. 'Security is
going to have to be the best available. If anything was to happen to such a
valuable asset, it would be disastrous.'
Lehrer McGovern International, the US construction management company owned
by Bovis, the UK construction group, has won the project management for the
contract. Security Training International is acting as the consultant on
security.
During the Second World War, George VI ordered Garrard's, the royal
jewellers, to remove the jewels from the Tower and submerge them in a lake
at Windsor Castle in order to prevent the Germans from getting hold of them.
Yesterday the Tower said the jewels were temporarily closed to the public,
for their two-week annual cleaning by Garrard's. Last night Garrard's would
not put a value on the jewels. It said: 'The jewels are irreplaceable.'

FT  14 JAN 92 / Hopes fade for TV deal in west country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLENDER chances of a deal between Television South West and Westcountry
Television before next week's judicial review in the High Court of the ITC's
franchise decision seemed to fade last night.
Over the past few weeks there have been informal contacts between the two
commercial television companies, usually through third parties.
In October the Independent Television Commission announced that Westcountry
had won the franchise for the south-west with a bid of Pounds 7.82m. TSW was
rejected on the ground that its Pounds 16.2m bid was too high to sustain its
programme service throughout the 10-year franchise.
TSW successfully appealed against a High Court refusal to grant a judicial
review of the ITC decision and the hearing is due to go ahead on Monday.
However, there has been a series of contacts between Mr Stephen Redfarn,
chief executive of Westcountry and Mr Harry Turner, chief executive of TSW.
First Mr Redfarn offered to talk and Mr Turner said 'No'. Then after Lord
Donaldson granted TSW a judicial review, Mr Turner suggested talks and Mr
Redfarn and his board declined.
Although it was never spelt out, the implication of the contacts was that
there might be terms under which TSW might withdraw its judicial review. One
possibility would be that the TSW shareholders would get a minority stake in
Westcountry.
The unusual contacts continued last Friday when Mr Turner telephoned Mr
Redfarn under the mistaken assumption that Westcountry was prepared to talk.
Mr Redfarn believes the ITC's case is a strong one, although he would
consider a formal proposal from TSW.
TSW, the Plymouth-based ITV company, will rely on information from an ITC
secret document questioning whether the company's bank would actually give
it the Pounds 10m overdraft promised. Apparently that was never checked.
In the document the ITC said that if advertising revenue grew at only 4 per
cent a year in real terms, compared with the TSW forecast of 5.3 per cent,
the company's fixed costs would total 105 per cent of revenue between 1993
and 1995.
'With no dividends until 1996, a lean cost structure and limited strength in
the projected balance sheet, the risks to the programme service posed by the
size of the are very great,' the secret ITC staff document says.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Brooke warning on round-table talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, North-ern Ireland secretary, warned yesterday that unless
outstanding differences were resolved soon it was unlikely that 'round
table' talks on the province's political future would start before the
general election.
His remarks followed a meeting with Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian
Paisley, leaders of the province's two main Unionist parties.
The meeting was the latest in an intensive round of meetings between
Unionist and Nationalist leaders over the last two months.
Until this week there were hopes that the talks, which collapsed last July,
might resume shortly. Mr Brooke conceded that 'significant problems'
remained but he was careful not to play down too far the chances of success.
His comments may have been designed to increase pressure on the leaders to
resume talks.
Further talks with the province's political leaders are likely to held later
this week in London.
Mr Brooke also denied speculation that the Tories were trying to attract
Unionist support in anticipation of a hung parliament after the general
election. He said there was 'zero truth' in the rumours.
Unionists say they have accepted Mr Brooke's formula for resuming talks on a
devolved government in the province and on relations with Dublin and London.
But Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party,
has accused them of submitting new pre-conditions.

<TEXT>
THE COUNCIL of Lloyd's will tomorrow respond positively to a series of
suggested reforms of the insurance market, Richard Lapper writes.
One member of the 28-strong council, which governs the market's affairs,
said there had been a 'marked degree of unanimity' about the conclusions of
a report drafted by a task force. 'Without exception, we all feel very
positive about it,' he added.
The task force, chaired by insurance broker Mr David Rowland and advised by
McKinsey, the management consultants, has examined Lloyd's capital
structure, competitiveness and cost base.
Its report is expected to recommend the maintenance of Lloyd's controversial
principle of unlimited liability, but it is also expected to introduce a cap
limiting the 'excessive' losses of Names - individuals whose assets provide
the market's capital.
Its 200 pages will contain more than 50 other recommendations.

FT  14 JAN 92 / BR chief hints at alternative to rail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BOB REID, chairman of British Rail, yesterday appeared to suggest that
greater private-sector involvement in the railway could form a substitute
for full-scale privatisation in the short term.
Speaking at the Chartered Institute of Transport in London, Sir Bob said he
could see no objection in principle to the involvement of private-sector
capital in the rail business.
'Much of what was part of BR has already been privatised - ferries, hotels,
manufacturing - and some Pounds 3bn of private-sector capital is invested in
the business of carrying freight by rail,' he said.
'We look for opportunities to contract out services where it is economic to
do so. We work in partnership with the private sector in freight and
parcels. The Heathrow Express is an ambitious venture with BAA.'
Sir Bob said he wanted to see more joint operations with the private sector.
Opening access to other train operators was a government policy aim, he
said, and the privatisation debate had to bear in mind the implications of
that.
'When they (the implications) are followed through, they may prove a very
significant element of the new policies. The current public discussion does
not seem to address this.'
Sir Bob was speaking as Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary,
reconfirmed the government's intention to produce its railway privatisation
white paper before the general election. The white paper has been delayed by
ministerial disagreements on what is probably the most complex privatisation
yet attempted by the government.
Sir Bob appeared to be using his first public appearance this year to
suggest a way out of the stalemate. He denied, however, that he was
attempting to advocate a solution.
'The board has consistently said that ownership of the industry is a matter
for the shareholder (the government),' he said. 'Our job is not to advocate
and not to oppose. It is to advise, as railway professionals, on the
practicality of any evolving proposals.'
Sir Bob said he had never expressed a desire, as some had suggested, to see
the railway sold off as a whole.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Ravenscraig-related job losses estimated at 5,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRASER of Allander Institute, Scotland's leading economic forecasting
body, says about 5,500 people - excluding steelworkers  - will lose their
jobs in the next four years because of British Steel's closure of steel
plants in Lanarkshire.
That is considerably lower than figures in the region of 16,000 indirect job
losses circulated last week when British Steel said it would be closing the
remainder of its Ravenscraig complex later this year with the direct loss of
1,220 jobs.
The Fraser of Allander estimate, based on its computer model of the Scottish
economy, takes into account last year's closure by British Steel of the hot
strip mill and a blast furnace at Ravenscraig, the shutting down of much of
the nearby Clydesdale tube works and this year's closure of the remainder of
Ravenscraig.
Taken together, those involve 4,400 direct job losses, the institute
suggests.
The estimate assumes that British Steel will maintain the Dalzell plate mill
at Motherwell, which employs 500 people, the Imperial tube works at Airdrie
(400 people) and the remnants of the Clydesdale works (200 people). Further,
it assumes that the government will intervene to offset the steel closures.
It says the loss of steel at Ravenscraig and the other plants will reduce
Scottish gross domestic product by less than 0.5 per cent and make
Scotland's GDP growth only 0.07 per cent less than it would otherwise have
been.
Yesterday the Lanarkshire Development Agency, which had previously used the
16,000 indirect job losses figure in seeking government funds, said it
regarded the Fraser of Allander job losses figures, which total almost
10,000, as realistic.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish Secretary, told the House of Commons yesterday that
the Ravenscraig closure, which was announced last week, would cost 2,400
direct and indirect jobs, pushing up unemployment in Lanarkshire by less
than 1 per cent. Related job losses in other parts of Scotland might bring
the total to 3,000.

FT  14 JAN 92 / US battle of the peace dividend: Politicians set their
sights on defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE defence budget has always been the biggest piggy bank in town for US
politicians in search of funding for favourite projects.
The collapse of the Soviet threat has removed the Pentagon's strongest
protection just when politicians are hungrier than ever for money to pump
into the recession-weakened economy.
In less than a month President George Bush will announce his budget proposal
for 1993, which is expected to include cuts of up to Dollars 50bn over the
next five years.
From Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts on the left to
Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas on the right, congressmen of every
political hue have announced their own suggestions for defence cuts.
Far-reaching shifts in the US military posture have often been impelled by
late-night wranglings over the annual defence authorisation bill, and key
weapons systems have lived or died by the clout of the senators in whose
home states they are manufactured.
This time, budget negotiations will be an even more crucial force, at a time
when US defence policy is undergoing its most profound revision since the
end of the Second World War.
Since the Berlin Wall fell, President Bush has already announced one plan to
restructure US military forces - on the very day, August 2 1990, that Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
The policy he and Defence Secretary Richard Cheney laid out then and in a
subsequent five-year plan entailed cutting the US force structure by 25 per
cent over five years to a minimum level dubbed Base Force: 12 active army
divisions in 1995, 50 per cent less than in 1990; 15 active air force
tactical fighter wings, instead of 24; and 12 navy carrier battle groups,
instead of 14.
The Gulf crisis tempered some of the enthusiasm for defence cuts, but it
also strengthened those who believed that the collapsing Warsaw Pact threat
meant the US should rethink defence policy more radically, to face
emergencies that were more likely to come from another Saddam Hussein than
from the Soviet Union.
General Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says that the
Base Force already represented just such a rethink.
'For the first time in my memory in the Pentagon we haven't just said:
Here's our wish list. We know we can't afford it. You all up there in
political land, figure it out for us. We have taken a hard look at our
worldwide requirements, the new geopolitical situation; we've designed a
force that we think is responsive to that,' he told Congress in September.
But Congressman Les Aspin, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed
Services Committee, calls the Base Force 'essentially less of the same, that
is a downsized force largely shaped by Cold War priorities'.
'The new American force must be created from the bottom up, not just by
subtracting 25 or 30 or 50 per cent from the Cold War structure,' he argued
in a paper on national security policy delivered last week to the Atlantic
Council.
Mr Aspin also takes issue with Gen Powell's contention that the Base Force
is an irreducibleminimum, and some defence analysts have proposed a much
slimmer force structure.
Professor William Kaufmann and Mr John Steinbruner of Washington's Brookings
Institution suggest that a force with only seven active army divisions and
six carrier battle groups could meet the test of another Desert Storm,
although it would hedge much less than the Base Force against other
simultaneous contingencies.
But the debate over future threats rages mainly in academic circles; the
force driving US defence planners is the need to slice still more money from
the 1993 defence budget, which was already intended to drop by 4 per cent in
real terms.
The lower troop levels already proposed by Mr Cheney will yield substantial
savings - personnel costs made up over half the 1992 defence budget of
Dollars 291bn - but only slowly.
Accelerating these cuts would entail politically unpalatable layoffs for
many of the heroes of Desert Storm.
Mr Bush has already announced cuts in the country's nuclear arsenal, and
much deeper cuts are expected as a result of the break-up of the Soviet
Union. Immediate savings, however, are likely to be small, because of the
cost of disabling warheads.
Budget cutters are more likely to set their sights on some of the costly
weapons systems.
Some may be killed outright, such as the B-2 stealth bomber and Seawolf
submarine programmes. The Pentagon is reported to be planning severe cuts in
both, but is unlikely to go nearly far enough to meet Congress's appetite
for killing these two systems, viewed by critics as classic Cold War
weapons.
Other programmes may be delayed, spread out or reduced, although this can
entail higher unit costs. In 1991, when the Pentagon ordered 108 F-16s, they
cost Dollars 19m apiece; in 1992, when it will get 48, they cost Dollars 24m
each; in 1993 it wanted 24 at Dollars 34m each.
In the end, the thirst for money to fund an economic growth package is so
great that the need for an immediate peace dividend seems likely to win out
over Mr Aspin's call for a more considered revision of the threats the US is
likely to face in the future, and the military options it wants at its
disposal to face them.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Tokyo rewards South African efforts to dismantle apartheid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has formally restored diplomatic links with South Africa, which Tokyo
feels deserves recognition for moving to dismantle apartheid and establish
democratic institutions, writes Robert Thomson.
The two countries exchanged notes yesterday allowing ties to be upgraded
from consular to ambassadorial level. Tokyo expects links to be enhanced
when South Africa's President F W de Klerk visits Japan later this year.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the decision followed talks in
South Africa last month on the drafting of a new constitution. They
suggested Tokyo would work to develop 'stable relations with a new South
Africa'.
Japanese companies welcomed the resumption of ties, which follows the
lifting last October of economic sanctions, including a ban on direct
investment and imports of gold coins and steel.
Tokyo had asked the corporate sector to exercise 'self-restraint' after
bilateral trade swelled to Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in 1987. The figure
fell to Dollars 3.32bn in 1990, although the African National Congress
condemned some Japanese companies for trading through third countries.
Diplomatic relations were severed after the outbreak of the Second World
War, but consular links were re-established in 1952. Japanese officials
expect Mr de Klerk to visit Tokyo in the second half of this year.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Moslem militants polarise Arab world: Fears over the spread
of fundamentalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGING by the wary reaction throughout the Arab world to events in Algeria,
Arab leaders do not for one minute believe that attempts to deny Algeria's
Islamic party a ballot box victory will be the end of the story.
Rather, concern over the spread of fundamentalism is almost palpable in Arab
capitals, at a time when the Islamic tendency has been on the rise
regionally.
The Algerian drama also coincides with deepening disillusionment with
autocratic regimes across the region, fuelled partly by economic distress.
Militant Islam, while most conspicuous, is by no means alone in its
opposition to the established order.
Concern will be greatest among Algeria's Maghreb neighbours - Tunisia and
Morocco. Tunisian leaders, who crushed the local Nadha (Renaissance)
fundamentalist party after concluding several years ago that dialogue would
serve no useful purpose, had been most openly fearful that free elections in
Algeria would bring the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to power.
Tunisian newspapers, predictably, have voiced relief over the steps to deny
Algeria's fundamentalists control of parliament. The independent daily,
Assabah, yesterday compared developments 'to a last-minute change of
direction by a train heading towards the abyss'.
King Hassan of Morocco, who has kept silent in the face of disturbing events
across the border, is certain to be relieved that the fundamentalists have
been stopped, if only momentarily, although he cannot be particularly
sanguine about the future. Morocco banned an incipient fundamentalist
movement in January 1990, but Islamic militancy will almost certainly
continue in an autocratically governed country burdened by economic
deprivation.
In Egypt, where there is persistent tension between the authorities and
Islamic militants, the interior minister warned just hours after President
Chadli Bendjedid's resignation that the security forces would not tolerate
any attempt to sow instability.
'Our commitment to democracy does not limit our movement to confront
immediately any attempt to break the law or destabilise security, whether by
religious extremists or others,' Mr Abdel-halim Moussa told a parliamentary
committee. Egypt's banned but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood had cheered the
FIS's first ballot triumph as an inspiration for the religious across the
region.
Mr Mohammed Hamed Abul-Nasr, the Brotherhood's spiritual guide, wrote to the
FIS: 'I pray God to grant you a complete and sweeping victory in the final
stage and that all Moslems will stand united so that there is no weakness
for Satan to exploit.'
Saudi Arabia has remained silent on developments in Algeria, but its rulers
 -under pressure from extremists  - are likely to be quietly relieved that
the FIS has been denied control for the time being.
The Saudis have been grappling with a resurgence of Moslem militancy among
their subjects, a challenge which has provoked unusually forthright
criticism from a member of the royal family and from the country's spiritual
leader.
In statements widely quoted in December in the Saudi press, Sheikh Abdel
Aziz Ben Baz, the country's spiritual leader, condemned as a 'conspiracy'
against Islam a campaign by militants to undermine the authority of the
ruling family.
Extremists have attacked Saudi rulers for alleged personal excesses, for
their attempts to modernise the state by allowing a greater role for women,
and for their support of the US-sponsored Middle East peace process.
Prince Turki al-Faisal, son of the late king and head of the Saudi
intelligence services, expressed the ruling family's concerns in a speech at
a Riyadh mosque last month attacking the underground campaign being waged by
Saudi militants.
Egyptian and Saudi leaders have also been looking askance at developments in
Sudan, where General Omar al Bashir's ruling junta is widely regarded to be
in the thrall of the powerful National Islamic Front (NIF), headed by the
charismatic Dr Hassan al-Turabi.
The recent visit to Khartoum of Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani and reports that Tehran was supplying Sudan with military
training and equipment was enough to generate heated criticism in Cairo's
official press.
Mr Ibrahim Nafeh, editor-in-chief of the Cairo daily newspaper, Al Ahram,
and a confidante of President Hosni Mubarak, attacked Sudan's alliance with
Iran. 'God help the brotherly Sudanese people,' he wrote. 'For years, the
situation in Sudan has been deteriorating with governments changing hands
consecutively until Gen Al Bashir rose to power in a military coup d'etat
and overshadowed all previous leaders in his blunt efforts to push Sudan
down the drain.'
There is little doubt that in both Algeria and in the wider Arab world, the
battle between the secularists and Islamic militants has been joined.

THE Middle East peace process took a decisive step forwards yesterday when
Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian negotiators resolved a procedural
deadlock that had until then blocked progress.
Delegates reached a compromise on a 'twin-track' negotiations, settling a
dispute over whether Israel should meet with separate Jordanian and
Palestinian delegations or with a single joint delegation.
At last month's first round of bilateral talks, delegation heads wrangled
over this procedural point on a sofa in a State Department corridor,
refusing even to enter the rooms set aside for them.
Yesterday, however, a preliminary round of haggling led to a procedural
compromise: Israel will discuss Palestinian issues with a sub-committee
composed of nine Palestinians and two Jordanians, and Jordanian issues with
another sub-committee composed of nine Jordanians and two Palestinians.
'Corridor diplomacy is ended,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the
Palestinian delegation.
The arrangement is expected to allow discussions to begin on substantive
issues, including the question of autonomy or self-government for
Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
'Well, they resolved something this morning because - and I use their term,
not ours - they are off the couch,' added Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the State
Department spokeswoman.
Israel also held separate bilateral talks with Syria yesterday, while a
meeting with Lebanon was put off until today because the chief Lebanese
delegate had influenza.
The talks are likely to be short, however, because Israeli negotiators, who
arrived in Washington last week, have warned that they plan to leave
tomorrow night.
The Arab delegations delayed their arrival in protest at Israel's decision
to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories, and only agreed to
come after last week's strongly worded condemnation by the United Nations
Security Council of the Israeli decision.
Nevertheless, Washington observers point out that the peace process is at
least still under way. None of the parties has moved to break off talks, and
several countries have, in fact, begun to show signs of flexibility in their
negotiating positions.

The US believes Pakistan possesses the 'Islamic bomb' and fears it could

a US senator said yesterday, Reuter writes from Islamabad. Pakistan has
denied developing nuclear weapons, but Republican Senator Larry Pressler
told a news conference in Islamabad that Washington was convinced it had a
usable nuclear device.
'These are unenlightened, uninformed views of a man who has not studied this
region seriously,' said Mr Sardar Asif Ali, economics minister of state, who
recently led a Pakistani delegation to the newly independent states of
Central Asia.
Mr Pressler is vilified in Pakistan as the author of legislation under which
all US military supplies and new economic aid were cut in 1990 over fears
that Pakistan was making nuclear weapons.

The retention of Mr Jibril Aminu, current Opec president, as petroleum

FT  14 JAN 92 / Algerian Islamic party calls for resistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSLEM militants, accusing Algerian authorities of treason, appealed
yesterday to the army and people to struggle and block the 'giant of power'
which had robbed them of victory through the ballot box.
The appeal from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was, however, couched in
moderate terms and did not urge the people to take to the streets or start a
general strike.
In its first statement since President Chadli Bendjedid resigned on Saturday
and the High Security Council scrapped a second round of general elections,
set to put the fundamentalists in power, the FIS said: 'We call on veteran
fighters, thinkers, religious leaders, senior army officers and soldiers,
and sons of the martyrs, social organisations and all who love Algeria to
take a stand against this giant of power.'
The FIS said the authorities had betrayed God and the people in cancelling
the elections.
The FIS statement was issued after a secret leadership meeting in an Algiers
suburb.
Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, sent the army to guard key points.
Algiers was calm yesterday. A few dozen tanks, deployed at key buildings and
intersections over the weekend, remained in place, but the military
otherwise kept a low profile.
Religious leaders, meanwhile, sent out orders from the country's mosques
warning militants to remain calm.
France, Algeria's former ruler, appeared to signal relief yesterday that the
army had prevented a fundamentalist victory through the ballot box.
But French analysts warned that the 'constitutional coup' after Mr Chadli's
resignation was a short-term expedient that could spark violence and
discredit democracy and the army in the eyes of a frustrated younger
generation.
An ultra-cautious French Foreign Ministry statement omitted any mention of
the suspension of democracy.
Algeria now faces a constitutional vacuum because its constitution does not
appear to have an answer to a situation in which the president has resigned
and his normal interim replacement, the president of the National Assembly,
is no longer in office.
The National Assembly was officially dissolved on January 4, although the
first news of this decision only came when Mr Chadli mentioned it in his
resignation speech.
Algerians appear not to expect any trouble from the FIS before Friday, when
weekly prayers in the mosques might be followed by a show of force.
The leaders of the FIS are confronted with a dilemma. If they fail to react
to cancellation of the second round of the election the fundamentalist
movement, especially if it is forced underground, may be taken over by its
small extreme wing.
On the other hand, they can have no doubt about the severity of a crack-down
if they challenge the army.

<TEXT>
THE chairmen of the big three US car makers are seeking an urgent meeting
next month in the US with Japanese auto industry leaders to continue
pressure on Japan to reduce its trade surplus with the US following last
week's visit by President Bush to Tokyo.
Mr Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, the world's largest car maker
which is currently running up record losses, insisted that the visit by
President Bush with an American business delegation had been 'a historic
trip'.
The visit had strengthened ties between US government and US business. The
Department of Commerce had become 'pro-American business and activist', he
said.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrat chairman of the Senate finance
committee, has repeated claims that the Dollars 41bn (Pounds 23bn) trade
deficit with Japan had cost 800,000 American jobs.
The US auto industry is disappointed by the small concessions made by the
big five Japanese car makers towards reducing the trade deficit.
It is eager to exploit mounting protectionist sentiments in the US in order
to put renewed pressure on Japanese car makers to take voluntary actions to
curb the deficit.
General Motors, which last month announced a programme to close 21 plants
and cut its workforce by 74,000 in the next four years, has felt itself
forced reluctantly to join the mounting campaign against Japan by qualifying
its previously staunch support for free trade.
'I like free trade, but I want fair trade,' said Mr Stempel. 'It is a subtle
difference, but it is a difference.
'That was why we could go united to Tokyo.'
It was this change that enabled Mr Stempel to share a platform last week in
Japan with Mr Lee Iacocca, the strongly protectionist chairman of Chrysler,
who launched a vitriolic attack against Japan last Friday on his return from
Tokyo accusing Japan of 'predatory' trade practices.
Mr Stempel claimed that the Japanese car industry was the only one not to
cut its stock levels in America at the beginning of last year in the face of
the deepening US recession.

TELECOM Australia (International) has signed a joint-venture agreement with
Vietnam to develop and operate a national mobile telephone service.
The project's cost and the terms of the agreement are undisclosed, but it is
believed that Telecom is providing finance for the equipment and management
training, while the Vietnam Directorate General of Posts and
Telecommunications is providing local premises and customer access.
Mr Ken Loughnan, Telecom International's managing director, said
construction of mobile-based stations would start in April. He said that the
joint venture would initially provide an analogue mobile system in Hanoi and
Ho Chi Min City. It would then expand services to other regional centres and
gradually introduce digital services over the next two years. Mr Loughnan
said that in the medium term, returns on the service could match those in
Thailand, which has roughly the same population as Vietnam, and where mobile
telephone services turn in about ADollars 200m (Pounds 81.6m) annually.
Telecom's new investment puts Australia ahead of its European competitors in
the race to modernise Vietnam's telecommunications. The project complements
the international satellite system being operated by OTC, Australia's
international carrier.

FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Washington keen for Mexican oil reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is likely to push for a substantial liberalisation of Mexico's oil
sector as part of the free-trade negotiations between the two countries, but
will fall short of demanding changes to the Mexican constitution, according
to a document from the US industry sector advisory committee on energy trade
policy matters.
Under the Mexican constitution, hydrocarbon ownership is limited to the
Mexican nation. However, current practice allows Pemex, Mexico's oil
monopoly, to hire private sector oil companies in exploration and drilling
on condition that the contract signed is a service one - that is, that
payment received does not depend on oil found.
Nevertheless, in a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative,
the advisory committee says: 'Mexico has an unofficial, yet effective, ban
on American land drilling rigs.' Offshore drilling contracts, says the
report, are hampered by the need to use middlemen, and it is 'extremely
difficult to obtain work even with an agent'.
The advisory committee calls for a substantial liberalisation of existing
laws and regulations in Mexico, saying this would 'increase the value of its
(Mexico's) hydrocarbon resources'. This reform could be carried out within
the current constitution.
'The US industry has demonstrated great flexibility in developing
contractual arrangements for oil and gas exploration and production to
accommodate a variety of legal, political and economic situations,' the
letter goes on. 'If Mexican authorities are interested in obtaining outside
participation in upstream activities, contractual arrangements could be
developed which would meet their constitutional requirements, assure Mexico
favourable investment returns, and provide US companies with incentives
necessary for participation.'
While Mexico's constitution limits ownership of oil to the nation, it is
only the regulation which governs the constitutional article that rules out
risk-sharing exploration contracts.
The report highlights other areas that block foreign investment. Service
stations and refineries in Mexico, it says, are solely owned by Pemex. The
report concludes: 'The downstream sector should be open to foreign
investment, as it is in the US and Canada. Such investments will bring
necessary technology to address environmental problems.'

THE European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer) claims
Polish beams are being dumped in the European Community and plans to make a
formal anti-dumping complaint to the EC Commission,
A Eurofer spokesman said yesterday that the beams, used mainly in the
construction industry, were being sold at an unfair price on the EC market.
It believes the association agreement recently concluded between the EC and
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia could exacerbate the problem.
Quantitative restrictions on imports from Poland disappeared at the
beginning of January.
Eurofer said it believes the association agreements 'will be interpreted by
producers in these countries as an invitation to increase their exports . .
. through abnormally low prices, favoured by considerable public subsidies.'
A Eurofer official said the German industry was being hit hardest by the
imports. Polish beams are being sold at around DM480 (Pounds 169), while EC
prices are between DM150 and DM200 higher, he said.

SPAIN'S health minister, Mr Julian Garcia Valverde, resigned last night amid

The scandal centred on land speculation in the Madrid suburbs of San

Budget shortfalls to finance a new rail link into the capital prompted the
dealing, in which Renfe paid a grossly inflated price for land it had
intended to sell to pay for the project.
Mr Garcia Valverde said: 'If there were any irregularities in the land
deals, I want to make clear this was without my knowledge and was an abuse
of my confidence.'
He was due to appear before the high court tomorrow, the first of 71 people

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S fragile coalition government yesterday faced the most serious
industrial action since the demise of communism. An estimated 2m Solidarity
trade union members mounted a one-hour nationwide strike in protest against
the imposition of higher energy prices and lower living standards.
Solidarity members outside Warsaw's FSO car plant, which is seeking western
investment to finance a modernisation programme, said that 'people were
tired of price rises and wages which failed to match.' The impact of the
protest, to be followed by a full one-day strike on Thursday by OPZZ, the
former Communist trade union, was heightened by the endorsement of President
Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity leader.
Mr Walesa, who opposed until the last moment the formation of the new
government under Mr Jan Olszewski, said the strike might lead to 'wise
programmes' and again hinted that he was prepared to become prime minister
himself, although not immediately.
Mr Andrzej Drzycimski, his spokesman, said the stoppage showed people were
tired of the present political situation but that 'democracy would decide'
when a change of government was necessary. Mr Drzycimski said that 'for the
moment there was no need for the president to take over as prime minister as
well'.
The centre-right coalition government, formed just before Christmas, has
tried to present itself as being more aware of the social and economic
consequences of the IMF-backed economic stabilisation policies associated
with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister in the first post-communist
governments.
However, Mr Olszewski's government is constrained by a tight budget drawn up
by its predecessor to restrain a runaway budget deficit. The inherited
measures included a sharp reduction in energy subsidies on January 1. This
led to a 70 per cent rise in energy prices, which sparked off the latest
round of labour unrest.
The government has little room for manoeuvre, as the budget deficit over the
first quarter of this year is expected to reach Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 894m)
even after the cut in energy subsidies. Last year the IMF suspended
disbursement of its Dollars 1.7bn extended loan facility because the
government had failed to hit agreed targets, including the budget deficit
which, at Dollars 2.8bn last year, was seven times higher than originally
planned.
The steep fall in production by state enterprises, widespread tax evasion
and the slow progress of privatisation cut tax revenues sharply at a time of
rising demand for unemployment pay and other government services.
Mr Olszewski's tough stance on energy prices is designed to show the IMF
that his government, which criticised previous administrations for allowing
industrial output to fall by more than 30 per in two years, is determined to
control the budget deficit.

presence at UN talks will let members voice concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S prime minister Mr John Major has invited President Boris Yeltsin
of Russia to visit London on his way to a United Nations security council
summit in New York, now confirmed for the end of this month.
In the short visit, which has yet to be finalised, the two leaders will
discuss a range of issues, including Russia's application for full
membership of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The news of the invitation was seen in the UK as highlighting the prime
minister's role on the world stage in the run-up to the election,
particularly as it coincided with Tory demands for greater clarity in
Labour's defence policy.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the government of
'looking for a photo-opportunity not an agenda'.
Speaking in Downing Street after a meeting with Mr Boutros Ghali, who took
over as UN secretary-general at the beginning of this month, Mr Major said
the meeting, on January 31, would both be the first occasion for Mr Yeltsin
to attend the security council as Russian president, and an early
opportunity for security council members to discuss a range of matters with
the new secretary-general.
It will also enable security council members to discuss with Mr Yeltsin
concerns about the effective control of the former Soviet Union's nuclear
weapons following the country's dissolution into independent republics.
There are particular worries that the smaller independent former Soviet
republics might sell off some of their nuclear weapons and technology to
foreign buyers.
Mr Major singled out as other key subjects for discussion the enhancement of
the UN's role as a 'peacemaker, peacekeeper and settler of disputes' in
regional conflicts; and the 'very great importance the UN generally gives to
good government and human rights'. As the UK took over the rotating
presidency of the security council at the start of the month, Mr Major will
chair the general meeting.
Mr Major himself said yesterday that he did not claim credit for the idea of
the meeting, which came from President Mitterrand of France some months ago,
but that he was confident in view of the warm response it had received that
it was 'an idea whose time has come'.
His remarks came after both Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, and Mr
Tom King, the defence secretary, renewed their demands for Labour to 'come
clean' on its defence policy.
Underlining that the opposition had failed to produce a document on defence
despite more than 70 policy launches in the past two years, Mr Patten said
Labour's position was merely 'to sit on the fence and say as little as
possible.'
But Mr Kaufman countered by charging the government with calling a 'stunt
debate' for electoral purposes while ignoring the key issues raised by the
break-up of the Soviet union.
Tabling an amendment to the motion for debate in the Commons today, he
demanded substantive government action to address the issues of nuclear
proliferation, arms control and defence diversification.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Brussels wants universal letter monopoly to continue in
Community countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday said its green paper on European postal
services would advocate the continuation in EC countries of monopoly
universal letter services that were both affordable and efficient.
A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, said: 'What it
emphatically does not do is challenge or attempt to whittle away at basic
minimum postal services in each member state.'
It will advocate that the EC should have a universal letter monopoly.
But this will not exclude measures designed to increase competition, such as
ending cross-subsidies from reserved, or monopoly, areas to non-reserved
areas. Thus member states will not be able to finance international mail
with profits made from letters monopolies.
Brussels intends to publish a policy paper on postal services within three
weeks, which could be followed by draft legislation. Officials said the
paper would concentrate mainly on international and intra-Community mail
rather than domestic services.
The green paper will not prejudge the content of future legislation on the
issue, which would have to be approved by a qualified majority of EC member
states.
The paper will make it clear that liberalisation should be the rule and
monopoly the exception. But it will not propose to end all existing
monopolies.
Member states will be able to decide to have a monopoly letter service more
limited than the one proposed by the Community, but will still have to
ensure a minimum universal letter service.
The paper will advocate continued monopolies for some letters, postcards and
addressed direct mail (up to certain limits).
It will not include publications, goods-bearing items or express items, all
market segments which have been subjected to extensive liberalisation
efforts in individual EC states and in which there is often fierce
competition with private sector providers.
Some countries, however, such as France and Italy, have been conservative in
their approach toward liberalisation of monopoly postal services. Britain
and the Netherlands are the most advanced among EC states in opening up
their postal services to private-sector competition.
Each EC country will be able to define the universal service that must be
provided. Any service now outside a country's national monopoly cannot be
made part of that state's reserved area simply because the service is
included in the set of reserved services defined at Community level.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi is the main commissioner responsible for drafting
the paper, but Sir Leon has also been heavily involved in preparing it.
Sir Leon is a strong advocate of breaking up public monopolies where they
appear to distort competition or restrict benefits for consumers, but the EC
treaty stops the Commission dictating whether particular businesses should
be publicly or privately owned.

THE government's mortgage rescue schemes, announced in recent months to ease

An earlier scheme to encourage lenders to make empty repossessed homes
available to the homeless through housing associations, announced at the
start of November, has also failed to make progress.
There appears to be little evidence that lenders have eased repossession
policies since the pre-Christmas package.
Some housing association executives at a seminar organised by the National
Federation of Housing Associations suggested that the government had acted
hastily in announcing its plan without finalising the details.
Under the scheme announced by the chancellor on December 19, the government
agreed to pay social security benefits designed to cover mortgage interest
direct to the lenders. In return, the lenders agreed to measures aimed at
helping homeowners in difficulties and at reducing repossessions by 40,000
this year.
These included a less aggressive approach to repossessing the houses of
people in arrears and a mortgage-to-rent scheme whereby housing associations
would buy homes about to be repossessed and rent them back to their former
owners.
To make the rents afford-able, the lenders said they would provide almost
Pounds 1bn of low-interest loans to the housing associations. The
associations say they need funds at rates as low as 5 per cent to enable
them to charge afford-able rents.
Housing associations - which were not consulted over the package  - have
been inundated with requests from homeowners in arrears seeking to join the
scheme.
But Mr Stephen Duckworth, head of housing finance at the NFHA, told the
seminar that only a 'limited number' of associations and lenders had even
begun negotiating terms for the loans.
One housing association executive said he felt that the lenders, having
achieved the direct payment of social security benefits, had now lost
interest in delivering their part of the bargain.
Another executive, Mr Bill Payne of the Yorkshire Metropolitan Housing
Association, said there was 'a chasm' between the interest rates housing
associations could afford to pay and the interest rates lenders wanted to
charge. 'I wonder whether it isn't all a political move to take the problem
off the agenda until after the general election,' he said.
Few lenders appear to have changed their policies since the government
announcement.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Bush blasts EC 'iron curtain'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush last night called on the European Community to lift
its 'iron curtain of protectionism', amid fears that EC opposition to farm
subsidies reform may still wreck the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
Mr Bush, speaking to American farmers in Kansas City, accused the EC of
using 'massive' subsidies to protect its farm exports. He vowed to continue
US subsidies in the absence of an agreement under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 'I will not unilaterally disarm American farmers,'
he said.
Mr Bush's comments appeared to be part of a political initiative within the
US to gain support from a key economic sector. He said he was not
pessimistic about the chances of a Gatt agreement and his intervention was
not seen as an attempt to increase tension in the EC-US conflict on farm
subsidies.
Mr Bush was speaking after the countries taking part in the trade
liberalisation talks in Geneva yesterday unanimously agreed to try to
complete the talks by Easter.
But the EC remains opposed to the draft agreement on farm trade reform, the
most crucial of the 26 draft accords concluded last month.
The draft was prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, after
the US and the EC failed to reach agreement following weeks of intensive
talks. The EC's stance is seen by negotiators as by far the most
threatening.
The EC received some support at yesterday's meeting of the top-level Trade
Negotiations Committee (TNC), called to decide the future of the
five-year-old round. Japan, South Korea, Canada and Switzerland were among
participants also expressing serious reservations about proposals in the
agriculture text.
Mr Dunkel, who is also chairman of the TNC, said he was prepared to serve as
'honest broker' in the resolution of any outstanding differences.
He warned, however, that any move to adjust the 436-page text 'must be very
precise and concentrated entirely on what we all can collectively agree to
without unravelling the package'.
The EC delegation is ready to continue negotiations despite reservations.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Australian appointed to stir up statistics office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP in the way Britain monitors its economy is likely following the
appointment of Mr Bill McLennan, a top Australian statistician, as new head
of the Central Statistical Office.
The appointment, to be announced by Downing Street today, marks one of the
most ambitious efforts in recent years to inject new ideas into a UK
government department.
The CSO, the main agency dealing with economic statistics and answerable to
the Treasury, has been criticised by some economists and politicians for
failing to use the latest ideas and technology to track economic change.
Mr McLennan, 49, has the reputation of being an innovator, and is well known
in the international statistical community.
As deputy head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), he introduced
schemes to raise money for Canberra by marketing economic statistics to
specific industrial sectors.
The Australian has also been given credit for introducing new surveys at the
ABS and for using computers to collect and analyse data in a more timely
fashion.
Several UK economists and statistical experts were sounded out, but the
government's interview panel was struck by the Australian's forcefulness and
reputation.
Mr Ivan Fellegi the Canadian government's chief statistician, said Mr
McLennan was 'capable, imaginative and energetic' and that a 'period of
rejuvenation and excitement' was likely for the CSO.
Mr McLennan has worked all his career at the ABS, joining in 1960 as a
teenage 'statistical cadet'. He takes up the UK post on March 2 from Sir
Jack Hibbert, who is retiring.
In his new position he will have close links with Treasury officials and
will report ultimately to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
The Treasury has in recent years been heavily involved in efforts to improve
the quality of the CSO's output, which some argue has been affected by staff
cuts suffered by government statisticians in the early 1980s.
However, the CSO collects and analyses its statistics independently from the
Treasury, to guard against claims of political bias.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Maxwells defy Commons: Controversy over refusal to answer
select committee questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL and Mr Ian Maxwell defied a parliamentary select committee
yesterday, triggering heated controversy over parliament's right to inquire
and the citizen's right to remain silent.
Their refusal to answer questions about the disappearance of hundreds of
millions of pounds of pension fund money from their late father's business
empire may provoke a full debate of the Commons, possibly as soon as next
week.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP leading the social security committee's
inquiry into Mirror Group Newspapers' pension fund affair, said last night
the Maxwells' defiance 'raised matters of crucial constitutional importance'
that put the future development of the committee system in the balance.
In the absence of clear precedent, the social security committee would now
take the advice of the Commons - a procedure involving direct
behind-the-scenes talks between the two main parties - before formally
reporting the Maxwells' refusal in an official report.
There was widespread speculation last night that this may lead to a full
Commons' debate and possibly even punitive action, though fierce controversy
continued over whether parliament has the right to fine or even imprison
those who defy its authority.
Lawyers for the two brothers said their refusal to testify or produce any
documents demanded by the select committee was because criminal charges were
expected soon. During the hearing the only words spoken by the brothers were
their names, and when they said three times, barely audibly: 'I will answer
only through my counsel.'
In a packed Grand Committee Room in Westminster Hall, Mr George Carman QC,
Mr Kevin Maxwell's lawyer, said: 'It is plain and clear and respectful but
unambiguous that Kevin Maxwell is not going to answer any questions.'
The brothers had 'a precious constitutional right and an historic one' to
remain silent, to prevent them from incriminating themselves in any future
criminal charges from the Serious Fraud Office's five investigations into
the Maxwell empire, their lawyers argued.
Mr Carman said: 'In my judgment, criminal charges are likely, and they are
likely soon.' He and Mr John Jarvis QC, for Mr Ian Maxwell, said that the
Maxwells vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
Gesturing at the banks of television cameras in the hall, the QCs said the
committee threatened to become a 'trial by television, not to be tolerated
in a civilised society' which could prejudice potential jurors in future
cases.
Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP and committee member, committee, said:
'They're trying to block us at the first hurdle, but we don't stop there.'
With the committee meeting in private later this week to consider
precedents, the brothers risk being held in contempt of parliament, a charge
comparable to contempt of court.
Late last night, Mr Graham Allen, a Labour member of the Commons procedure
committee, said it was clear the House could not 'let this go' without
severely diminishing parliament's powers.
Prof George Jones, a professor of government at the London School of
Economics, said that the row represented a 'turning point' in the future of
the committees, reformed in 1980 to enhance their powers.
Mr Field described as unacceptable the conditions cited by the lawyers in
order for the Maxwells to give written answers. These were confidentiality
from SFO probes as well as from the media.
In the last, tense half-hour, Mr Field persisted in putting the committee's
questions to the brothers. Only his fourth question - whether the brothers
could offer advice about safeguards for pension funds - extracted a
concession that the Maxwells might comment in writing.
Hours before the select committee started, Mr Kevin Maxwell was in court to
hear his bid to be allowed to remain silent renewed in the Court of Appeal.
He is appealing against the decision of Mr Justice Hoffmann in the High
Court on December 23 that he must answer questions put to him by the
provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, who is trying
to trace more than Pounds 450m missing from Maxwell pension funds.
The appeal is expected to last two days and may be followed by a
cross-appeal from Mirror Group Newspapers.

FT  14 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms leaders switched
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S two telecoms leaders, BT and Cable and Wireless, moved in opposite
directions as institutions switched from BT into the latter in the wake of
last week's widespread downgrading of BT shares and the worries that Oftel,
the telecoms regulator, may insist on larger price cuts than previously
predicted.
The strong performance by C and W was additionally fuelled by revived hints
that AT&amp;T, of the US, may buy a stake in Mercury Communications, C and W's
UK telecoms division.
Specialists also spoke of stories that C and W plans a flotation for
Mercury, or may seek a trading link with Vodafone, which is at present
competing with Cellnet, BT's subsidiary, for leadership in the UK cellular
phone market. C and W touched 603p before ending a net 11 up at 600p.
Both classes of BT shares came under pressure, although quotations were
adjusted to allow for the 7.6p gross interim payment. BT 'old' settled at
318p ex-dividend, down 5, while BT 'new' closed 6 off at 114p ex-dividend.
Dealers reported plenty of switching between the two classes of BT.
Abbey National sold
Abbey National, the building society turned bank, came up against a flurry
of speculative selling pressure and substantially underperformed an
otherwise resilient banks sector. The weakness followed widespread hints in
the stock market that at least one of the UK's big building societies, and
possibly as many as three, was in trouble.
Dealers said the failure of a big building society, while having little
direct financial impact on Abbey, would inevitably have an adverse affect on
sentiment in Abbey shares. 'All the leading financial institutions have
suffered from a deterioration in lending quality,' said one banks
specialist.
Abbey shares lost ground as the session progressed, closing 6 1/2 off at
273p, albeit in relatively thin turnover of 1.9m shares but against the
closing trend of the stock market.
Reuters recovers
Reuters Holdings rose yesterday to the highest level since August 1990 as
buyers continued to pin their hopes on exceptional growth this year. The
shares closed 19 stronger at 1064p after turnover of 1m.
The stock appears to be recovering from the disastrous plunge suffered 18
months ago when it lost 184 points to 1045p after the company warned of a
decline in second-half profits. One analyst said: 'Even the great detractors
have to admit that Reuters is one of the quality stocks in the sector.' The
shares have strongly outperformed the FT-SE All-Share Index over the past
three months and are on a very high rating.
Bears of the stock, such as agency broker James Capel, believe a ceiling for
the shares is being reached, but buyers are confident that heavy investment
by the banks in Reuters' electronic dealing system will provide the company
with the sort of sharp growth that has been seen by Glaxo and Wellcome.
Chemicals active
A downgrade and change of stance from a leading UK securities house affected
the shares in chemicals companies Laporte and BOC.
Kleinwort Benson cut its estimate for Laporte's 1991 profits by Pounds 5m to
Pounds 105m and next year's by Pounds 8m to Pounds 94m. Analyst Mr Jeremy
Chantry said he was quite positive on the company but was advising investors
who were overweight in the stock to reduce their holdings because of the
'ongoing effects of the recession'. Laporte fell 12 to 604p.
Mr Chantry also pointed out the defensive qualities of BOC, which added 12
at 627p. It was one of the most heavily traded stocks in the chemicals
sector with turnover of 1.4m shares.
Lonrho saw the biggest percentage fall of any of the stocks in the FT-SE 100
list as traders reacted to negative weekend press comment. The shares fell
12 to 164p, more than 6.8 per cent, with 5.2m traded. A Sunday newspaper
article said there was disappointment that executive director Mr Terry
Robinson resigned from Lonrho last week and there had been speculation that
Lonrho had cash flow problems and might cut its dividend.
Glaxo was the most actively traded major stock yesterday. It reached a new
high despite a cautionary note from SG Warburg, the UK investment bank, and
a slight easing of interest from US investors. In its regular bulletin on
the pharmaceuticals sector, Warburg highlighted the premium rating of all
but one of the stocks. Glaxo was 3 easier in early trading but London
investors bought into the weakness of the shares which closed 14 ahead on
the day at 930p with 4.9m traded.
Other dollar earners were also firm. SmithKline Beecham rose 9 to 946p,
Wellcome 6 to 1041p and Reckitt &amp; Colman 5 to 692p. Fisons, which Kleinwort
moved from a sell to a hold and highlighted as the only underperformer
against the market, improved 7 to 354p.
BP rose 4 to 286p, stimulated by a strong showing by oil prices, a broker
buy recommendation and news that the oil company is intensifing its
operations in Colombia, a move which specialists said indicated BP's
optimism about the Cusiana discovery announced last year.
Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, the stockbroker, helped sustain the BP share
price in highlighting the stock's yield attractions. Mr Chris Perry at
Girozentrale adopted a bullish tone on BP's dividend policy after recent
market worries.
'Contrary to popular opinion BP has committed itself to long-term real
dividend growth and refuses to cut the payout,' said Mr Perry. He expects BP
to increase the fourth-quarter payout to 4.5p, making 17.1p for the year. He
added: 'Even if the dividend is not increased, shareholders are guaranteed a
year-on-year dividend growth of 4.7 per cent and a yield of 8.2 per cent
compared with a market average of 5 per cent.'
Burmah Castrol added 10 at 496p, still responding to the recent Smith New
Court buy note, while there was more heavy activity in Lasmo, which gained 6
more at 244p.
The influential retailing team at County reinstated some buy recommendations
after the sector underperformed by 6 per cent since it suspended all its
previous buys. 'With the uncertainties of Christmas behind us and seemingly
not matching worst expectations we believe the sector is due a bounce,' said
County. It reinstated its buys on Argos, Boots, Dixons and WH Smith. Argos
rose 4 to 260p. Jacques Vert slumped 77 to 116p after the losses and halved
interim dividend.
Shares in Rank Organisation suffered a retreat of 11 to 609p as securities
house Hoare Govett highlighted the stock as one of its three key sells in
its weekly market overview. The house said it had changed its stance some
time ago but this was the first time it had published it.
Kleinwort Benson downgraded its 1992 profits estimates for both Sedgwick and
Willis Corroon and recommended a switch from Sedgwick into Willis, up 4 at
235p.
Birse, the building group, came under intense selling pressure and fell to
62p at one point, before stabilising and closing a net 8 off at 66p amid
stories that a statement on trading is imminent.
Tomkins was volatile as the company reported interim figures at the top end
of market expectations. Profits rose 40 per cent to 43.7m and the stock
advanced 5 to 439p.
Charterhouse Tilney, which raised its full-year forecast by Pounds 1m to
Pounds 131m, believes there is little scope for the shares in the short
term, but remains a buyer for the long term.
Favourable press comment on the possible link-up between British Airways and
KLM boosted the shares of the UK airline, which gained 7 to 236p on turnover
of 4.8m.
GW Thornton jumped 53 to 203p after being relisted following an announcement
that Bromsgrove Industries was making a recommended Pounds 14.6m offer for
Thornton.
The recent favourable view of Rolls-Royce was further boosted by news of a
Dollars 67m order for the US Navy. The shares gained a further 5 to 137p on
turnover of 4.9m.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Appointments: Milne quits ScotMet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon Milne, 55, has resigned as managing director and from the board of
Scottish Metropolitan, the Glasgow-based property company. He has paid the
price for a mistimed stepping up of the company's property development
activity, particularly in the south of England. Milne is replaced by Scott
Cairns who joined ScotMet two years ago after being property director of
Martin Retail, the stores group.
Cairns says he intends to return ScotMet to its original vocation of being a
property investment company rather than undertaking speculative
developments. He also wants to reduce ScotMet's heavy borrowing which had
reached Pounds 201m (a gearing ratio of 140 per cent) at September 1991.
In October ScotMet angered the market by announcing an unexpected pre-tax
loss of Pounds 8.3m (compared with 1990 profit of Pounds 10.4m) including
writing off Pounds 9.4m on a site in Bournemouth and incurring Pounds 2.2m
costs on renegotiating bank covenants.
Milne took enormous pride in Saltire Court, an architecturally distinguished
office development in Edinburgh to which he lured many distinguished
tenants. It is now 70 per cent let but has not produced the expected
profits.
Paul Birch, director in charge of development, has also left the company.

Justice Balcombe and Lord Justice Staughton): December 20 1991
STATEMENTS recorded surreptitiously on tapes without the speaker's knowledge
or intention are made orally, not in a document, and are therefore not
admissible in civil proceedings unless proved by direct oral evidence by the
person who made the statements, or by someone who heard them made. But a
statement recorded with the speaker's knowledge and intention is made in a
document as well as orally and is therefore admissible as an out of court
statement, subject to production and proof of the tapes or copies by direct
oral evidence or by a second out of court statement as to how they were
made.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing in part an appeal from a decision
of Mr Justice Hirst (FT, December 20 1991) refusing to admit taped
conversations as evidence for the defendant representative underwriter, Mr
Trevor Rex Mountain, in an action by the plaintiff, Mr Apostolos Konstantine
Ventouris.
Before the judgments on the appeal were handed down, the underwriters
withdrew the allegations against Mr Ventouris which had formed the
background of the appeal. The Master of the Rolls said the judgments should
be read in the light of that withdrawal as far as Mr Ventouris's reputation
was concerned, but it had no other effect on the judgments.
LORD DONALDSON MR said Italia Express was sunk by explosives while
undergoing repairs at Drapetsona outside Piraeus harbour.
Mr Ventouris owned the vessel. He claimed under a war risks insurance
policy. The defence was that the loss was caused by his wilful misconduct.
The underwriters alleged that in January 1988 a plot was hatched between Mr
Ventouris and his cousin, George Dimitrios Ventouris (GDV), whereby in
return for a very substantial payment GDV was to recruit divers to blow up
the vessel.
The enterprise was abandoned on February 13 1988.
It was alleged that Mr Ventouris then engaged divers himself, without
involving GDV, and that they achieved the desired objective five weeks
later.
The underwriters wished to prove the original conspiracy between GDV and Mr
Ventouris by surreptitious tape recordings of conversations between those
alleged to have been involved, including the divers.
The tapes had been provided by GDV who featured in all the conversations. He
was unable to come to the UK to give evidence, being on bail in Greece on
terms which precluded his leaving the country.
Section 1 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 provided that hearsay evidence was
admissible in civil proceedings only by virtue of the Act and other
statutory provisions, or by agreement.
Section 2 provided for admissibility of out of court statements made orally
or in a document as evidence of facts stated therein.
Section 2(3) provided that where a statement 'made otherwise than in a
document' was admissible by virtue of section 2, no evidence other than
direct oral evidence by the person who made the statement or who heard or
perceived it being made, was admissible for the purpose of proving it.
By section 4 a statement contained in a document was admissible if the
document formed part of a record compiled by a person acting under a duty.
By section 10(1) a 'document' included any 'tape . . . or other device in
which sounds . . . are embodied'.
The underwriters sought to introduce the tapes or copies in evidence as 'out
of court statements' and to verify and explain them by written 'out of court
statements' by GDV and others.
The first question was whether the tapes were admissible as evidence of
facts stated by the interlocutors other than GDV.
That depended on whether the statements were made 'orally', or 'in a
document' or both.
The answer must depend on what the maker of the statement thought he was
doing and intended to do. The statute looked at the matter from the point of
view of the maker of the statement, not from that of his audience.
It was assumed that the interlocutors, other than GDV, were wholly unaware
that their statements were being taped.
It followed that the tape was GDV's record of the conversations. The other
interlocutors were intending to make and were making statements orally, not
in a document.
That conclusion differed from that of Mr Justice Hirst, who regarded the
statements as having been made in a document.
In the light of that conclusion, section 2(3) applied and the statements
recorded on the tapes could only be proved by direct oral evidence by the
person who made each statement, or someone who heard them made.
Those conditions could not be met and accordingly the tapes were not
admissible as evidence of the facts stated by the interlocutors other than
GDV.
The second question was whether the tapes were admissible as evidence of
facts stated by GDV.
Here there was a vital difference. GDV knew the conversations were being
taped. So far as his own statements were concerned, GDV was quite
deliberately making simultaneous statements both orally and in a document.
Subject to production and proof of the tapes or authenticated copies, the
statements made by GDV would be admissible as evidence of the facts so
stated. The statements of the other interlocutors would not be evidence of
facts thereby stated but, in so far as they provided the context in which
GDV's statements were made, would be evidence of that context.
The third question was whether an out of court statement could be proved by
another out of court statement.
There was no reason why not - though direct oral evidence was always
preferable and had greater weight.
Section 2 was designed to render out of court statements admissible as
evidence of the facts stated therein.
Here the maker of the second out of court statement was stating facts
concerning the making of the first out of court statement, not about the
truth of anything therein contained.
Mr Justice Hirst held that was not permissible.
He relied on Cross on Evidence 7th ed 541-2 which stated that a principal
object of the 1968 Act was to ensure that all first-hand hearsay statements
were admissible, provided certain conditions were fulfilled; and to allow
second-hand hearsay to be received if contained in a record. Cross said
'first-hand' meant a statement proved by the maker's direct oral evidence or
by production of the document in which he made it, or by direct oral
evidence of a witness who heard him make it; and 'second-hand' included all
hearsay statements which were not first-hand.
Mr Justice Hirst concluded it was fundamental to section 2 that the
statement, whether oral or in a document, should be first-hand. He said it
would be highly anomalous if the section 2(3) principle for oral statements,
did not apply to documentary statements.
There was no trace in the wording of the Act of Professor Cross's
distinction between first-hand and second-hand hearsay except in section
2(3), where restrictions were imposed on the way in which second-hand
hearsay could be adduced if the underlying first-hand hearsay was contained
in a statement made orally.
That pointed strongly to the policy of the Act being to permit second-hand
hearsay in all other cases. The rationale for that limited restriction was
no doubt that evidence of a statement made orally was inherently more
unreliable than evidence of one made in a document.
The fourth question was whether the tapes were admissible under section 4 as
forming part of a record compiled by a person acting under a duty.
In February 1989 GDV appeared before an investigating judge in Greece and
deposited nine tapes with the judge. At the same time he made a statement
under oath, identifying the interlocutors involved in the recorded
conversations.
As Mr Justice Hirst pointed out, section 4 only provided for admissibility
of the record itself, not for admissibility of information tendered to the
recorder who did not include it in his record.
The appeal was allowed to the extent indicated.
Their Lordships gave concurring judgments.
For the underwriters: Christopher Clarke QC and Andrew Popplewell (Ince &amp;
Co)
For Mr Ventouris: Stephen Tomlinson QC and Stephen Hofmeyr (Hill Taylor
Dickinson)

<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER, the electricity company privatised in June, has made Murray
Stuart its non-executive deputy chairman. Stuart, 58, recently resigned as
chief executive of Berisford, the food, commodities and property group,
having brought it back from the brink of liquidation in 18 months.
Stuart, who became a director of ScottishPower in 1990, was formerly
chairman of MB Group, previously known as Metal Box. He is to work closely
with Sir Donald Miller, chairman, and Ian Preston, chief executive, on
developing ScottishPower's corporate strategy.
This will mean spending two days a week in Scotland and Stuart, who lives in
Surrey, says he will soon be buying a property there. Although he says he is
soon to take up another appointment in England he indicates that he could
eventually follow the path of many an expatriate Scot (he was born in
Glasgow, educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University and is an
accountant by training) and return to his native land.
Neither he nor ScottishPower has anything to say on suggestions that he
might be groomed to succeed Miller, 64.

fears of political scandal

Tokyo
FEARS OF a new political scandal, and continued arbitrage-linked and
investment trust selling took equities into a second consecutive steep fall
yesterday, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 685.04 or 3.1 per cent lower at 21,696.86, after
opening at the day's best of 22,299.63 and touching a low of 21,596.95. The
index dropped 3.2 per cent on Friday. Volume came to 180m shares, after
Friday's 225m. Declines led rises by 905 to 74 with 115 issues unchanged,
while 131 stocks fell to their lowest levels since the beginning of 1991.
The Topix index of all first section shares lost 40.32 to 1,619.84 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.93 to 1,216.92.
The market plunged just after the opening, on the unwinding of arbitrage
positions in light trading. Selling by investment trusts, and fears that
this will continue until the closing of their books on March 31, put a
further dampener on sentiment. The market was faced with more talk that the
Finance Ministry will restrict arbitrage trading, possibly later this week,
and this prompted additional selling.
However, the most dramatic depressant yesterday were reports of a police
raid on Mr Fumio Abe, a member of the House of Representatives and former
secretary general of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's ruling party faction.
'There was panic selling,' said Ms Betty Wu of SBCI Securities. 'There is
the fear that this will open a Pandora's box.'
The Bank of Japan's tight monetary stance in the short-term money market
prior to the end of a reserve management period today was another bearish
factor, Ms Wu said. She added that financial officials might now take action
to prevent further declines which would push bank capital-to-asset ratios
well below the critical 8 per cent level mandated by the Bank for
International Settlements.
Banks were among the day's largest losers, with Dai-Ichi Kangyo off Y130 at
Y2,030 and Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank down Y130 at Y1,540. NTT fell to a record
low for the second consecutive session, ending Y18,000 off at Y702,000.
Electricals fared relatively well, with Tokyo Electron gaining Y70 to Y2,350
and Toshiba Y1 to Y613.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 515.05 to 23,146.36 in volume of 53.5m
shares.
Roundup
TAIWAN AND Bombay ended on the positive side, but most markets in the region
were affected by Tokyo yesterday.
HONG KONG ran into profit-taking but closed off the day's lows. The Hang
Seng index lost 23.01 to 4,325.91 as turnover fell to HKDollars 1.33bn from
HKDollars 2.15bn.
The market was also depressed by rumours of a cash call by Citic Pacific,
the locally listed arm of China's overseas investment company, after Citic
Pacific announced plans to buy out the 64 per cent of Hang Chong Investment
that it does not already own for an estimated HKDollars 5bn.
AUSTRALIA was mixed as mining shares continued to rise as a result of the
Australian dollar's recent weakness but oil issues fell further. The All
Ordinaries index slipped 7.5 to 1,660.4 as turnover declined to ADollars
218m from ADollars 276m.
In natural resources, CRA advanced 24 cents to ADollars 12.94 and Pasminco
added 11 cents at ADollars 1.55. Soft crude prices weighed on oil shares,
Woodside Petroleum shedding 8 cents to ADollars 3.72.
NEW ZEALAND weakened in quiet trade. The NZSE-40 index fell 24.67 or 1.6 per
cent to 1,493.68. Turnover dropped to NZDollars 10.7m (NZDollars 18.8m).
Dual-listed shares were hurt by the exchange rate movements. Carter Holt
Harvey dipped 7 cents to NZDollars 2.26 on the market's heaviest turnover of
1.1m shares, while forestry and resources group Fletcher Challenge lost 6
cents to NZDollars 3.30 on volume of 490,000.
SINGAPORE saw early dumping of 'foreign' shares in blue chips with
limitations on foreign shareholdings, on weekend reports indicating that the
stock exchange wanted these limits raised, or abandoned.
However, Singapore Airlines, the worst hit, saw its F shares recover from a
day's low of SDollars 19.10 to close 50 cents off at SDollars 19.80 after
the SES said it had not changed its policy. The Straits Times Industrial
index ended 4.81 down at 1,483.25 in quiet trading.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted in continuing uncertainty about the Malaysian economy.
The KLSE composite index lost 3.21 to 548.69 as turnover slipped from
MDollars 91.5m to MDollars 66m.
SEOUL continued to fall after Friday's tumble amid reports of foreign
selling, the composite index shedding 8.02 to 609.90 as turnover contracted
from Won301bn to Won185.3bn. Political friction was said to be one reason
behind yesterday's drop.
TAIWAN climbed in hectic trading, the weighted index gaining 47.61 to
4,904.43 following a rise of 74 points on Saturday. Turnover was at its
heaviest since last June, expanding from TDollars 42.5bn to TDollars 54.3bn.
Traders said the strengthening of the plastic, petrochemical and financial
sectors in late dealing had led a general recovery after early selling
triggered by the drop in Tokyo.
BOMBAY set a new closing high on heavy speculative buying as the BSE index
added 26.35 or 1.3 per cent at 1,998.88, following an intraday peak of
2,006.84.
Brokers said a powerful group of bulls were lifting the market against an
indifferent economic news background. The BSE imposed daily limits on
purchases of two volatile stocks, Associated Cement and Apollo Tyres, to
curb excess speculation, but that failed to hold prices down. ACC forged
ahead Rs55 to Rs3,540 and Apollo Tyres moved up Rs4.50 to Rs185.

FT  14 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt attracts
bargain-hunters in heavy volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR between negative and positive views on the German market tilted in
favour of the enthusiasts yesterday, as bargain-hunters were seen in
Frankfurt and other markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had to accommodate the collapse of steel pay talks and the drop in
Tokyo, and yet the DAX put on another 6.96 to 1,622.67 after a gain of 6.18
to 658.69 for the FAZ at midsession.
Volume rose from DM6.2bn to DM6.9bn, led by Siemens which traded in a
relatively huge DM1.4bn as it rose DM6.60 to DM642.60, followed in turnover
terms by Deutsche Bank and Daimler; Veba, the energy group, came fourth as
it rose DM4.70 to DM368.10.
The feeling persisted that opinion was moving towards a more responsible
approach to annual wage rises, offering the chance of an interest rate cut
if the Bundesbank saw real evidence of change. One professional, however,
warned that speculators had taken the initiative again and that investors
might need to be careful.
Sensitive individual stocks moved either way, AMB by DM18 to DM808 on its
takeover attractions; meanwhile, a previous target, Nixdorf, fell DM45 to
DM133, having been suspended after Siemens, which had been willing to pay
DM225 a share cash for a larger minority, sought to accumulate the remaining
5 per cent or so with a paper offer worth only DM107 a share.
PARIS ran into light profit-taking in volatile trading after its gains last
week. The CAC 40 index closed down 13.15 at 1,824.29, just off the day's low
of 1,821.85 and well off the day's high of 1,839.20. Turnover was estimated
at around FFr2bn after Friday's FFr3.6bn.
In building materials, Lafarge was among the day's losers, falling FFr23 or
6.7 per cent to FFr318 after on a sharp drop in profits for 1991. Weekend
comments by the chairman, Mr Bertrand Collomb, that he saw no immediate sign
of a pick-up also dashed hopes for 1992.
Euro Disney fell as low as FFr145.50 on news that it faced a claim for
FFr850m in allegedly unpaid accounts from 16 French building contractors. It
later recovered to close FFr2.20 down at FFr146.30 with 314,700 shares
traded. Lyonnaise des Eaux continued its downtrend, falling FFr14 or FFr429,
this time on reports that the problems at a US subsidiary were worse than
expected.
MILAN overcame a weak start to end flat in technical trading as monthly
options expired. Options on all stocks were taken up, with the exception of
Olivetti and Pirelli. Trading was expected to remain technical until the
close of the January trading account on Wednesday. The Comit index eased 0.7
to 530.97 in turnover estimated at L110bn after Friday's relatively heavy
L140bn.
Among industrials, Fiat fell L87 to L4,990 and Pirelli eased L6 to L1,045.
Dealers reported a good market in telecoms, with Sip rising L18 to L1,490
and Stet up L7 at L2,215.
ZURICH eased in thin volume, the Credit Suisse index falling 3.2 to 462.5.
MADRID closed slightly off in steady trading, the general index falling 0.60
to 252.49 after falling sharply in morning dealings, and then recovering as
last week's predictions of a 0.4 per cent increase in the December inflation
rate were revised to a 0.01 per cent rise.
STOCKHOLM was fractionally higher after a weak opening. The Affarsvarlden
General index rose 4.0 to 958.0 in turnover of SKr384m after SKr502m.
Astra, the pharmaceutical company, saw its A unrestricted shares fall SKr14
to SKr566 on rumours that the company was going to open all share categories
to foreigners. The margin between restricted and unrestricted shares has
narrowed recently.
OSLO rose on domestic buying following the gloom at the end of last year.
The all-share index rose 6.85, or 1.6 per cent to 436.89 in moderate trading
worth a total of NKr318m.
Higher prices for North Sea oil took Saga Petroleum free shares up NKr6 to
NKr90. Anecdotal evidence of better tanker rates left Bergesen B up NKr6 to
NKr6 in very good volume; and talk of a return to profits in banking saw Den
norske Bank restricted up NKr2.20 to NKr12.20 in 715,000 shares.
HELSINKI rose 2.9 per cent, the Hex index putting on another 23.4 to 853.3,
11.5 per cent up from its 1991-92 low of 765.2 only three weeks ago.
AMSTERDAM rebounded from a weak opening to close near the session's highs on
the prospect of lower interest rates. The CBS Tendency Index closed at
116.6, 0.4 on the day.
ISTANBUL gained 1.2 per cent in active buying ahead of the economy package
due to be unveiled on Thursday. The index rose 55.49 in the sixth straight
day of gains to end at 4,691.25, the highest since 4,700.77 on March 20 last
year.

FT  14 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Europe rises on interest rate optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Europe outperformed the rest of the world last week, according
to the FT-Actuaries Indices, as investors piled into equities in
anticipation of falling interest rates later in the year. The FT-A Europe
index, excluding the UK, rose 1.8 per cent in local currency terms, compared
with a fall of 1 per cent in the FT-A World index.
Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, is cautious about the
interest rate optimism, and attempts to call the turn in stock markets.
While he believes that Continental rates are now at their peak, last
Friday's tough talking by Bundesbank deputy president Mr Hans Tietmeyer has
reinforced his fear that rates will stay on a plateau for several months.
Finland, one of Europe's worst performers last year, advanced 6.4 per cent
in a delayed response to the currency devaluation and the wage freeze
implemented last November. Ms Taina Uljas at Kleinwort Benson says these
measures had led analysts to reduce their corporate loss expectations. 'The
outlook for 1992 is better,' adds Ms Uljas.
Helsinki's rally concentrated on the big blue chips, such as Huhtamaki and
Pohjola, and was accompanied by relatively high volume of FM30m a day,
compared to last year's lows of around FM10m.
The implementation of stock market reforms helped Italy, another dismal
performer in 1991, to make a 5.6 per cent gain in better volume. The market
was also cheered by the near certainty of a general election in early April.
Among the senior markets, France recorded a 3.4 per cent rise in heavy
turnover, fuelled by Wall Street's record highs and by news that the French
government plans to encourage long-term savings, either through company
pension funds or personal equity plans. Hopes of further exemptions from the
bourse turnover tax also helped.
The interest rate cut on December 30 failed to have a lasting impact on
Japan, the worst performer last week as it fell 3.5 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'West likely to build uranium
flood barriers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN GOVERNMENTS might take action to stem the flood of uranium imports
from the former Soviet Union, which had sent prices plummeting to 40-year
lows, Mr Phillip Crowson suggested yesterday.
He is chairman of a working party at the Uranium Institute that has produced
the most detailed report ever on world uranium supply and demand. It
suggests the uranium market would probably be in balance by the year 2,000
if it was not for exports from the former Soviet Union and China.
At present those countries aim to export a total of 6,000 tonnes of uranium
a year, or roughly 10 per cent of world demand.
Mr Crowson, who is chief economic adviser at the RTZ Corporation, the
world's largest mining company, pointed out that the former Soviet Union
already faced dumping allegations in the US, while the European Community
was seeking to 'regulate' Soviet imports.
The institute, which includes most western producers, utilities and
merchants among its members, estimates that the former Soviet Union has
140,000 to 160,000 tonnes of uranium in stock. But this excludes highly
enriched uranium for military purposes.
Uranium has only one application - for nuclear energy. Demand depends
entirely on nuclear generating capacity in the 25 countries using that form
of power.
Spot prices of uranium oxide, at under Dollars 9 a lb, are now well below
the production costs of most mines. Prices peaked at Dollars 45 a lb in
1978.
Uranium mines recently closed down in Canada, the US and in some east
European countries.
In 1990 mine output covered only 63 per cent of nuclear reactor
requirements. The gap between the 28,340 tonnes produced and the 52,100
tonnes required by reactors was filled from stocks.
These built up in the 1980s because the industry's earlier forecasts about
world economic growth, demand for energy and the amount of electricity to be
generated from nuclear capacity were much too optimistic.
The report shows there are still 'excess' stocks at utilities of 40,000 to
80,000 tonnes and about 17,600 tonnes held by producers.
The report forecasts that total world uranium requirements will grow by an
annual average of 2.1 per cent to 64,000 tonnes in 2000. During the
following ten years the growth rate will drop to 0.3 per cent to just over
66,000 tonnes in 2010. In comparison, mine output is forecast to rise from
28,340 tonnes last year to 32,600 tonnes in 1995 and then fall back to
22,900 tonnes by 2010.
'Overall it is reasonable to conclude that most of the excess inventories
will have been drawn down by 1996-99, although some will continue in east
Asia until 2005 and in Western Europe until 2010,' the report suggests.
But there should be no shortages of uranium in the period to 2010, given
that mines will have substantial spare capacity and that there are large
stocks in China and the Soviet Union.
Also, the report says, 'easing of east-west tensions has raised the
possibility of the release of military nuclear material for use in civil
reactors'. It adds, however, 'there are substantial hurdles to be overcome
before this could occur and such transfers are most unlikely for several
years at least'.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US FARMERS have this year reduced the acreage planted with winter wheat at a
time when US stocks are their lowest in almost two decades.
A US Department of Agriculture report, released late on Friday, said farmers
had reported planting wheat on 50.2m acres, down from 51m last winter.
Mr Barry Jenkins, vice president, communications, of the National
Association of Wheat Growers, said farmers made their growing decision from
August to October, when wheat prices were low, and it seemed they could do
better planting soyabeans or maize in the spring. Furthermore, the USDA
reduced the acreage reduction programme for wheat from 15 per cent to 5 per
cent, a move that could have boosted production and sent prices down even
further.
Since then, the effects of poor weather last summer has been pushing prices
up.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NUOVA SAMIM, the metals group controlled by Italy's state-owned ENI energy
and chemicals holding company, yesterday confirmed that its zinc smelter at
Crotone in southern Italy was likely to be taken out of operation for a
refit sometime in the first half of this year.
'We are just putting the final touches to the plan,' said a Nuova Samim
official. 'There may be some delays, but it will probably be done before the
middle of the year.' Observers expect the refitting to take up to two years.
Reports of the closure of the plant, which was built in 1927 and has an
output of about 100,000 tonnes a year, helped the London Metal Exchange zinc
price for three months delivery to rally from yesterday's low of Dollars
1,095 a tone. The market is suffering from considerable overcapacity at
present.
The plant came under state control last year, when Nuova Samim bought a
controlling stake in Pertusola Sud, the company running the smelter, from
its previous French owners. Another Italian state entity, GEPI, was already
present as a minority shareholder.
The Crotone plant employs about 800 staff and is one of the larger zinc
smelters in Europe. According to the Nuova Samim official, the refitting may
be linked to a plan to increase its eventual capacity.

Gold was in retreat on the London bullion market after last week's rally.
However, prices were underpinned by support around Dollars 350 to Dollars
353 a troy ounce, and the market is still expected to challenge resistance
around Dollars 358 to Dollars 360 later this week. Dealers said the
surprisingly high level of physical gold demand generated by bargain hunting
in the first half of last week was not evident yesterday as the dollar
maintained its firmer tone, making gold less attractive in other currencies.
On the LME three-month lead closed below the equivalent of Dollars 535 a
tonne, considered by many traders a crucial chart point signalling a fall to
Dollars 500. There is no encouragement for bulls from fundamentals, with
offtake in both original unit and replacements battery sectors remaining
flat. London cocoa prices drifted lower. 'The market has been consolidating,
with possibly a bit of origin selling coming in at the higher levels putting
a lid on prices,' said one dealer, adding support was plotted around Pounds
720 a tonne for March and Pounds 740 for May. The market is looking ahead to
European fourth quarter 1991 grind figures due out this week and watching
Ivorian arrivals, which are expected to begin tapering off.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: MAP adopts indexation for 90%
of its portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAP Fund Managers, formerly Paribas Asset Management, is altering its
investment strategy and will now rely almost exclusively on indexation
techniques in the management of its Dollars 2bn portfolio.
The change in name and management policy reflects the fact that an 80.1 per
cent stake in the London-based company was recently taken by MAP Securities,
a division of Corporacion Mapfre, Spain's largest insurance group. A 19.9
per cent stake of MAP Fund Managers remains in the hands of the fund
management arm of Banque Paribas.
Mr Keith Bayliss, managing director, said that while Paribas Asset
Management followed indexation techniques with roughly 10 per cent of funds
under management, MAP would use indexation and 'tilted' indexing techniques
for more than 90 per cent of the portfolio.
Mr David Damant, formerly chairman of Paribas Asset Management and an expert
on indexation, will be managing director of the new company.
Indexation is a method under which fund managers construct a basket of
securities that replicates a stock market index, such as the FTSE-100 or the
Standard and Poor's 100 index in the US. The portfolio should then perform
closely in line with the index.
The technique does not require so-called active management under which fund
managers research the prospects of individual companies and make selections
based on analysis.
While indexation is widely used by fund managers in the US, it is little
used in the UK, where active management is the more usual choice of fund
managers who seek to maximise returns through individual stock selection.
Mr Bayliss said the pool of funds under management was expected to grow
significantly through active soliciting for customers.
The company will specialise in managing funds for insurance companies.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's lowers Finnish
foreign-currency debt rate ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US rating agency, yesterday lowered the
foreign-currency debt rating ceiling for Finland from AA1 to AA2, writes
Sara Webb. The rating agency said Finland's debt service capacity
deteriorated rapidly during 1991 as trade with the Soviet Union collapsed,
demand from western export markets dropped, and the decline in domestic
activity was greater than expected.
It added that demand for Finnish products was unlikely to recover quickly,
given the weak growth outlook for the international economy this year.
The downgrading affects about Dollars 17bn of Finnish debt, according to
Moody's.
In addition, Moody's said that it has lowered the long-term debt ratings for
Finnish Export Credit Corporation, Municipality Finance and Postipankki,
from AA1 to AA2.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Dollar sector demand remains high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOW of new issues in the dollar sector showed little sign of abating
yesterday as underwriters rushed to take advantage of demand which the World
Bank's oversubscribed Dollars 1.5bn global offering last week had failed to
satisfy.
However, the US Treasury market continued to weaken yesterday, creating a
more uncertain environment. In addition, dealers were worried by
increasingly ambitious yield spreads.
Credit Local's Dollars 500m 10-year deal, launched on Friday by Deutsche
Bank, was officially priced at a spread of 28 basis points above the
comparable US Treasury, while Denmark tapped the market for Dollars 200m of
five-year paper priced to yield 20 basis points above the five-year
Treasury.
Both deals were considered very aggressively priced - a good 5 basis points
too tight, according to many dealers - and at current levels could prove a
hard sell. Such pricing requires traders to take a view on the market: if
the market moves favourably, the paper could become attractive.
But with spreads at historically tight levels, partly because of pent up
demand for current coupon paper, dealers are unsure how great a premium
investors will pay for paper trading at or below par.
Last week's World Bank offering of 10-year bonds tightened further yesterday
to just four basis points above the US Treasury. Demand from Italian
investors, for whom these bonds are tax exempt, may have boosted it.
Swiss Bank Corporation, which arranged the Denmark deal, reported demand
from Swiss retail investors, as well as institutional players.
A Dollars 300m 12-year deal for the Republic of Austria, to be officially
priced today, was launched yesterday at an indicated spread of 30 basis
points above the 7 1/2 per cent Treasury and considered fairly priced.
Traders said it should be comfortably placed, reflecting continuing demand
for dollar securities at the right price. Meanwhile, a CDollars 1.5bn
10-year global deal for Ontario Hydro proved the most successful offering of
the day, meeting strong demand in Japan, Europe and Canada. The deal was
considered very fairly priced at 74 basis points above the comparable
Canadian government bond.
A CDollars 250m five-year deal for Deutsche Bank Finance met solid demand.
Interest in Canadian dollar Eurobonds is boosted by a relative bulge in
redemption payments of CDollars 3.6bn this month.
In the D-Mark sector, the Kingdom of Norway brought a DM1bn five-year deal,
silencing rumours of an offering in dollars or Ecu. Although the pricing was
rather on the aggressive side, some institutional investors were attracted
by the strength of the credit and the rarity of the name.
Elsewhere, Britannia Building Society became the fourth UK building society
to issue permanent interest bearing shares or Pibs. The Pounds 60m of notes
are only convertible into Pibs provided a rule change is passed at the
society's general meeting in April. This form of issue, completed for the
first time, may have allowed the society to access the market before other
potential borrowers. Investors will hold higher-ranking debt if the
agreement is not passed.
Elsewhere, Credit National launched a FFr2bn issue of seven-year bonds via
Credit Commercial de France.
Denmark is planning to launch an Ecu1bn offering of bonds listed on the
Copenhagen Stock Exchange this year. The deal will be designed to target an
audience of foreign investors, and will be underwritten mainly by foreign
banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITIC Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Beijing's China International
Trust and Investment Corporation, yesterday announced it planned to pay
HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 389m) to take full control of Hang Chong
Investment, a large Hong Kong trading and property company in which it owns
36 per cent.
The move should give Citic Pacific full control over a diversified and
well-established group. It will also help silence critics who say Citic has
only been able to build strategic stakes in key Hong Kong companies such as
Cathay Pacific Airways.
Citic Pacific described Hang Chong, which holds the franchises for several
motor dealerships, as 'an ideal vehicle' for it to increase its direct
business involvements in Hong Kong and China.
The company will largely finance the increased stake in Hang Chong through a
share consolidation and issue of new shares to raise HKDollars 2.6bn. Citic
Hong Kong, an unlisted company which holds 47 per cent of Citic Pacific,
will hold 44 per cent following the transaction.
Kerry Trading, owned by Malaysian financier Mr Robert Kuok, who has
developed close links with Citic Pacific, will raise its stake by 1
percentage point to 17 per cent.
Citic Pacific also announced it was increasing its stake in Hong Kong's
second airline, Dragonair, to 46 per cent with the acquisition of a further
7.46 per cent from Citic Hong Kong.
Over the past year, Citic Hong Kong, which is directly owned by Beijing, has
shifted a number of key stakes into Citic Pacific, which it hopes to turn
into a leading Hong Kong 'hong', or trading conglomerate. With the
completion of the transactions, which are conditional upon shareholder
approval, Citic Pacific's market capitalisation is estimated to rise from
HKDollars 8.5bn to HKDollars 11bn, making it one of the colony's 25 largest
listed companies.
However, Hang Chong's high profile chief executive, Mr Francis Yuen,
appointed by Citic Pacific to head the company in September, has resigned
following disagreements with Citic management. Mr Yuen's appointment was
questioned by some analysts since neither he nor Citic Pacific has
experience managing trading companies.
Citic Pacific led a consortium which paid HKDollars 6.94bn, equal to
HKDollars 330 a share, for Hang Chong in September. Except for Kerry
Trading, all the members of the consortium are selling to Citic Pacific at
an equivalent price of HKDollars 390 a share. Mr Li Ka-shing, who held a 19
per cent stake in the consortium, is estimated to have earned HKDollars 232m
on the transaction.

GERBER Products, the US baby foods group, is revamping part of its clothing
manufacturing operations which will result in an after-tax charge to its
fiscal 1992 earnings of about Dollars 16m, or 43 cents a share, Reuter
reports.
Certain operations will shut down, resulting in the loss of about 900 jobs.
This will include the closure of the diaper weaving operations and
consolidation of other basic textile production capabilities in order to
increase overall productivity.
Mr Al Piergallini Gerber, chairman, said the company was taking the action
to improve long-term profitability.
He added that there was a dramatic change this year in the cloth diaper
market. This was caused by reduced environmental concerns about disposable
diapers which significantly cut demand for cloth diapers. In addition, low
cost, foreign-sourced cloth diapers captured the institutional market, he
said.
Mr Piergallini said the company could not effectively compete in the cloth
diaper market with its high fixed-cost, vertically-integrated US
manufacturing base.
'We intend to remain in the diaper business, but in a competitive, flexible
manner,' he added. He said the margin improvement from this action would
enhance future earnings and cash flows.
He also said Gerber's disappointing diaper business results were already
reflected in securities analysts' consensus estimates for Gerber's fiscal
1992 year - excluding the restructuring charge.
Analysts estimate that Gerber's fiscal 1992 earnings will be in a range of
Dollars 3.74 to Dollars 3.95 a share.
For the year to end-March 1991, earnings were Dollars 3 a share.

FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Domtar anticipates recovery by
year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOMTAR, the Canadian pulp and paper and building materials group, believes a
US economic recovery spurred by cheap money will restore its profitability
by the year-end.
Domtar, owned 40 per cent by two Quebec government agencies, is Canada's
biggest producer of commodity and speciality fine papers, mainly for export
to the US, and is North America's number three producer of gypsum wallboard.
It also makes packaging products.
The company is one of the first Canadian forest products groups to be hit by
recession, but, after 1982-83, it was one of the first to recover as US
interest rates tumbled.
'This time recovery probably will be slower,' said Mr Halford Wilson, the
company's treasurer.
'But, if everything comes together, we'll be moving firmly towards profits
by the end of 1992,' he added.
He said Domtar's fourth-quarter loss would be in line with the third - then
it reported a deficit of CDollars 39m (USDollars 33.9m), or 44 cents a
share, on sales of CDollars 454m. The nine-month loss was CDollars 104m, or
CDollars 1.26, a share on sales of CDollars 1.4bn.
Domtar will continue in the red for most of 1992, said Mr Wilson, but
cash-flow will strengthen as North American timber, pulp, packaging and
finally, newsprint markets pick up.
Pulp has gained around USDollars 20 per tonne since early December and list
prices move to USDollars 540 a tonne on February 1.
Wallboard's outlook is uncertain, he said, because the two leading US
producers were in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings and were
pricing for market share.
Since US commercial building has virtually dried up, only an upsurge in the
residential sector, spurred by low interest rates, can turn the market
around.
Domtar, in good years, has shown CDollars 100m in operating profit from its
building materials business.
The company cut CDollars 150m from its cost base in 1991 and plans further
reductions totalling CDollars 100m in 1992. 'The potential for a bounceback
is strong, once demand begins to catch up with supply,' said Mr Wilson.
About CDollars 100m will be spent on capital projects this year, which is
the same as in 1991. Improvement will bring capacity at its CDollars 1bn
fine paper mill near Montreal by 1993 to 500,000 tonnes yearly from 350,000
tonnes.
Domtar's domestic plants, after the heavy restructuring and manpower cuts of
the past two years, can now compete with the Canadian dollar trading around
88 cents US, said Mr Wilson.
'As a major exporter, we want the Canadian dollar in the low eighties,
because each one-cent movement affects our profitability by about CDollars
11m a year pre-tax. But anybody thinking of 75 cents US is living in a dream
world of exchange profits.'
The Quebec government plans to sell its Domtar control during the next
industry upturn, or merge the company into a bigger group.
