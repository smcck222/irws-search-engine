FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome up ahead of results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and  COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome received a fillip ahead of tomorrow's interim
results as a number of brokers turned positive on the stock. The shares
rebounded from recent weakness to end 34 stronger at 978p.
Agency broker James Capel was advising clients to buy Wellcome after analyst
Mr Robin Gilbert recommended the stock at the house's morning meeting. He
said international prescription audit figures showed sales of Retrovir would
be up by 30 per cent against the same six-month period last year.
Further support came from Hoare Govett, which moved its recommendation from
hold to buy. Hoare's Mr James Culverwell believes the shares have
underperformed too far against the sector since majority owner Wellcome
Trust announced a planned share issue.
Security house County NatWest also reiterated Wellcome's strengths at its
morning meeting. The range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds 235m to
Pounds 243m, against Pounds 181m in the same period last year.
Laporte placings
Chemicals group Laporte fell in early trading as the placing of old and new
shares commenced, but recovered later when the whole 22.5m found a home. The
stock closed a net 10 better at 567p.
Company broker BZW did the placing with large institutions at 533p per share
in a package consisting of two old and one new. The shares were sold outside
the market and turnover recorded on the Seaq electronic trading screens was
only 1.1m.
The 15.1m old shares represented an 8.7 per cent stake in the company
acquired from Solvay, of Belgium. This follows reorganisation of Interox,
jointly owned by Laporte and Solvay, which previously had 25 per cent of
Laporte.
The 7.6m new shares were issued to fund the Dollars 60m (Pounds 34.6m)
acquisition of Rockwood, a private US chemicals company supplying the
construction sector.
P &amp; O pleases
Relief greeted P &amp; O's maintained dividend and pre-tax profits, which were
at the top end of analysts' expectations. The biggest sigh, however, was
saved for the finalisation of the group's plans for its Pall Mall property
venture with Chelsfield.
Worries over the declining value of Pall Mall's property portfolio has been
undermining the stock in recent weeks. Yesterday the shares jumped 32 to
416p in exceptional volume of 9.5m.
The deal with Chelsfield gives P &amp; O control of Pall Mall, but takes group
gearing from 45 to 70 per cent. Mr Clive Anderson at Smith New Court said
the clarification of the Pall Mall situation cleared up a lot of the
uncertainty surrounding P &amp; O's financial and trading position. 'This,
together with the dividend, no warnings over future dividend payments, and
better than expected profits, has given the market what it was looking for.'
Mr Ian Wild at BZW was pleased with the group's service industry performance
and its passenger volumes. He has raised his pre-tax profits forecast for
1992 by Pounds 30m to Pounds 310m. Smith is looking for Pounds 300m, a rise
of Pounds 20m.
Steel weakness
British Steel came under renewed pressure as two more houses turned bearish
on the stock. Large volume of 17m left the shares off 5 at 70p as worries
over the group's final dividend continued to affect the market.
Mr Alasdair Stewart, at Nikko Securities, reiterated his sell stance as he
took account of recent comments by British Steel about trading conditions,
and the dividend reduction undertaken by Bridon, a steel rope manufacturer,
which reported its finals yesterday and which dropped 14 to 75p.
James Capel downgraded British Steel. The broker is looking for losses of
Pounds 80m to Pounds 100m this year and a final dividend of 4 1/2 p. The
move comes after Monday's sell reiteration from Smith New Court.
Steetley deals
The bid battle for Steetley moved into the final straight. Two big blocks of
Steetley shares were sold into the market, one a line of 3m shares and
another of 5.5m. The deadline for acceptances is 1pm tomorrow.
Most analysts are predicting that Redland will emerge as the winner. Its
cash offer of 365p a share values Steetley at Pounds 617m and would create a
building materials group with Pounds 2bn of combined annual turnover.
In expectation of a Redland victory, Morgan Stanley has issued a buy note on
the enlarged Redland group, analyst Mr Anthony Williams describing the group
as 'an outstanding force in international building materials'. He expects
Redland shares to reach 530p over 12 months. Yesterday Redland firmed 2 to
435p, while Steetley was steady at 366p in turnover of 10m.
Speculation that Lasmo would announce a big disposal with its final results
today died away and the shares closed unmoved at 204p after being up 4
initially. The company is adopting new accounting procedures and the figures
could well be worse than most expectations.
BP was 3 easier at 255p, with a seller of 3m shares at 255 1/2 p accounting
for a large chunk of the 13m turnover.
Some oil issues generated interest after agency broker James Capel's
technical analyst pointed out that they were reaching support levels.
Enterprise was one of them and the shares gained 9 to 389p.
Glaxo forged ahead 32 to 814p on healthy turnover of 4.2m shares. Traders
said Kleinwort Benson was aggressively on the bid ahead of a pharmaceuticals
conference to be hosted by the house this week. Kleinwort divorced itself
from the interest and cited continued US buying.
Wessex remained the recovery stock among water companies, shrugging off
political worries and gaining 12 to 387p on hopes of profits from waste
disposal. Waste Management International, its partner in this venture, is
about to float its shares in London and New York.
Theme park operator Euro Disney tumbled 63 to 1590p after a downgrade by
Goldman Sachs. BET received similar treatment from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and
lost 2 to 129p.
A big agency cross in BPB Industries by Cazenove saw 8.6m shares dealt both
ways at 155p. BPB was off 2 at 157p.
Publishers bounced back on opinion polls favourable to the Tories. Pearson
advanced 15 to 785p and Reed International 12 to 511p.
Costs of a loss-making joint venture with Geest knocked 24 off Associated
Fisheries to 118p.

FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market rallies after new opinion poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market danced to the tune of the latest opinion poll and
more than recaptured the ground lost on Monday, the FT-SE Index ending a
trading session of sharply increased turnover 17.7 higher at 2,458.7.
Shrugging aside worries and press comment about the trade deficit, which
again had little effect on sterling or gilts, share prices gave an immediate
and positive response to a Harris poll published in the Daily Express which
confounded most of the weekend political surveys.
Harris indicated a five-point lead for the Conservatives over Labour,
reversing evidence from the weekend polls which gave a clear lead to Labour.
In the background to a broadly based upturn in market sentiment was a series
of positive developments involving leading UK companies.
Among these were better than expected results from P &amp; O, with figures from
the shipping to building group accompanied by a reorganisation of its joint
venture with Chelsfield.
The deal put an end to long-running nervousness among P &amp; O shareholders
about the property venture. Sentiment in the shipping group's shares was
given a further fillip by news that Lord Sterling, P &amp; O's chairman, had
spent around Pounds 1m in buying a block of 250,000 shares.
The market opened on a much brighter note with the Footsie 14.8 up, buoyed
by the overnight opinion poll indicating a lead for the Conservatives over
Labour. A bout of selling pressure, triggered by an opening discount on the
Footsie future to the cash market, saw prices falter, before resuming their
upward path over the lunch period.
The future remained at a discount to the underlying cash market for the rest
of the session. At least two programme trades were operated during the
morning period. The early afternoon saw another wave of local and overseas
buying in the market, driving shares further ahead and pushing the Footsie
to the day's high of 2,462.3, up 21.3 points.
Thereafter, intermittent bouts of profit-taking, and selling by marketmakers
unwilling to hold large lines of stock on their books ahead of the next
series of opinion polls, took the edge off the market, which ended about
four points below the day's best level.
There were suggestions around the market towards the close that the next
batch of opinion polls would show the Tory lead in the Harris poll to have
been no more than a blip.
Traders said one of the day's more encouraging features had been an
expansion in turnover. The Seaq system revealed volume of 493.2m shares,
well ahead of Monday's 370.6m.
Drug issues were among the market's outstanding performers, with Glaxo and
Wellcome prominent in the wake of keen support from US institutions.
Laporte, the chemicals group, rose strongly after announcing that it was
buying the US group Rockwood in a deal financed by the placing of a large
block of Laporte shares.
Following the redesign of the FT, Monday's yield on the FT-SE 100 Index,
normally carried in the markets panel on our front page, was omitted
yesterday. The figure was 5.06.

FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVELY trading in a tight range saw the futures market slightly down
yesterday, as UK election worries continued to undermine confidence, writes
Christopher Price.
While the March FT-SE contract opened at 2,450, trading was initially
unsettled by technical problems still being experienced by the market
following Monday's merging of the Liffe and LTOM.
An opinion poll showing the Conservative party ahead yesterday was largely
discounted by futures traders, and March was sold down - mainly by County
NatWest - to 2,438 in early trading. Aggressive buying by one trader then
helped it to rally, and by midday it had reached 2,456.
The contract drifted off in quiet afternoon trading and at one stage March
was at a discount of seven points to the cash market. It rallied later, but
weakness was noted in after-hours' trading as opinion poll worries returned.
March closed at 2,455, up 11 from the previous session but at a two-point
discount to the cash market. Volume was a dull 6,390 lots.
In the traded options market, turnover came to 30,507 contracts. The
Euro-FTSE was the most heavily traded at 2,839 lots, followed by British
Steel and Hillsdown.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Decline in car sales helps
push Dow lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
NEWS OF weak mid-March domestic car sales depressed market sentiment
yesterday as investors continued to hold back amid uncertainty about the
short-term direction of share prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 11.18 at 3,260.96. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.03 to 408.88, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks declined 3.15 to 618.68. Turnover on the New York SE
was a moderate 192m shares.
The release of mid-March car sales figures disappointed the market, which
had hoped they would show further evidence of a recovery in consumer
spending. After the biggest manufacturers had reported, it was clear that
the annual selling rate based on the 10-day period earlier this month was
below 6m cars, some way short of the 6.2m rate expected by the market, and
an indication of the continued weakness in consumer demand.
Motor shares were in the limelight following the sales data. General Motors
fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/8 after reporting US-made car sales in
mid-March were 6.1 per cent lower than at the same period a year earlier.
Ford dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 on news of a 5.4 per cent decline
in car sales in the same period, while Chrysler edged Dollars 1/2 lower to
Dollars 17 3/8 on a 26 per cent fall in sales. The one bright spot was a
rise in truck sales over the period for Ford and Chrysler.
K Mart, one of the country's biggest retailers, improved Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 54 after announcing a two-for-one stock split and an increase in
quarterly dividend.
Gap firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 in spite of news that Mr Millard
Drexler, the retail group's president, had sold  1/2 m shares in February
for about Dollars 25.6m. A Gap spokesman said the sale was part of the
normal div-ersification of the president's portfolio.
BancOne rose another Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 as investors continued
to react positively to the regional banking group's Dollars 782m purchase of
Team Bancshares, the sixth largest bank in Texas.
Sterling Chemical rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 4 3/4 on its agreement to
acquire Tenneco's pulp chemicals operations in Canada. Tenneco eased Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 .
SPS Transaction Services appreciated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 after
broking house Alex Brown &amp; Sons initiated coverage of the recently floated
company with a 'buy' recommendation.
Among over-the-counter stocks, Microsoft weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 127
1/2 after stating that it would be acquiring Fox Software. SunMicrosystems
dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 29 1/2 on the day that the company reduced
prices on its three-dimensional display workstations and its microprocessor
server family of products.
Canada
TORONTO ended slightly lower as the cash flow difficulties at Olympia &amp; York
Developments kept market participants cautious. A trader said: 'That hanging
over us as well as the constitutional (uncertainty) is really killing our
market.'
The composite index finished 5.8 down at 3,437.8. Declines led advances by
323 to 222 after volume of 32.9m shares.
'Obviously they are going to do something to help them (Olympia &amp; York)
restructure. It just puts a big pall over our financial institutions,' the
trader added.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Bank calms market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England made its desire to calm the market clear from the outset
yesterday, supplying plentiful early liquidity. 'The Bank were very helpful
on Monday, and they were very helpful again today,' said one dealer.
The Bank's morning forecast was for a shortage of around Pounds 750m, which
it immediately sought to relieve with offers to purchase bills across all
four bands. It bought a total of Pounds 709m of bills, including Pounds 640m
of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
'The Bank probably didn't need to do an early round,' said one dealer.
Without an election campaign, 'they probably would have waited till
lunchtime' to offer relief.
The Bank's action resulted in a slight easing of rates: just before lunch,
three-month money was trading at 10 13/16 - 3/4 , down from Monday's 10 7/8
 -13/16 . There were no Bank operations at lunchtime, but in the afternoon,
the Bank revised its estimate of the shortage to around Pounds 800m, and
bought a further Pounds 100m of band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Three-month money closed at 10 13/16 -, a further easing. The June sterling
contract closed at 89.05, not far from the day's high of 89.11 and up from
Monday's close of 88.97.
Overnight rates dropped as low as 7 per cent during the day, but closed at
10 3/8 - 1/8 , a level which was 'historically, almost giving money away,'
said one dealer.
'The market is not so much discounting a half-point rise after the election
as discounting the possibility of a much bigger rise if Labour forms a
minority government,' said Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation. Fears that a Labour government might face a weakening pound
increased the risk of a significant rise in interest rates - so that,
allowing for the electoral probabilities, 'the market is starting to
discount half of that.'
The Bundesbank announced that German M3 money supply grew at an annualised
rate of 8.5 per cent in February after a 9.0 per cent rise in January. The
Bundesbank's 1992 M3 growth target is 3.5 to 5.5 pct.
German call money remained unchanged at 9.65-70 per cent as tax payments
continued to put upwards pressure on rates. The Bundesbank set a tender for
a 28-day securities repurchase agreement. A DM 5.5bn facility at rates of
mostly 9.45 per cent expires today.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar fails to sustain gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was an early rise in the dollar against the D-Mark yesterday, as the
market reacted to gloomy predictions from former Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev and news of a radiation leak at a Russian nuclear plant. The US
currency opened in European trading at DM1.6720, compared with a DM1.6712
close in Asian trading and the DM1.6667 at which New York finished.
Mr Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's London office said: 'Any
bad news from the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet
Union) tends to support the dollar and undermine the D-Mark.'
The rally did not last, however. One US bank trader told the Reuter news
agency: 'The dollar gain was mostly down to interbank players trying to
relieve the boredom, and the real long-term customers showed absolutely no
interest.' By mid-morning the dollar had eased to DM1.6667.
As Mr Neil MacKinnon of Yamaichi Securities in London pointed out, the
dollar had again failed to break through the important DM1.6720 resistance
level. For it to make the breakthrough, he said, 'the market really needs
firm evidence that the beginnings of a US recovery, signalled in a number of
indicators, are sustainable'. Once that happens, he says, 'we could see a
test of DM1.7400 within three months'.
The US unit ended European trading at DM1.6670, mildly below Monday's
European close of DM1.6700. In New York the dollar eased further to finish
at DM1.6637.
Against the yen, the dollar retained its gains slightly better. It finished
in Europe at Y133.70, down marginally from the Y133.80 at which it ended
Tokyo trading and unchanged from the Y133.70 of Monday's close to European
trading.
Sterling continued to display some evidence of strength against the D-Mark,
but remained stuck firmly at the bottom of the ERM. It opened the day at
DM2.8675, and at one point touched DM2.8683.
Later, however, as rumours about forthcoming opinion polls suggested bad
news for the Conservative party, the pound lost its gains and ended at
DM2.8625, compared with Monday's DM2.8650.
Against the dollar, sterling stood at Dollars 1.7200, up from Monday's
Dollars 1.7150. On the Bank of England trade-weighted index, the UK currency
ended the day at 90.0, unchanged from the previous close.
Several analysts pointed out that it is common for pressure in EMS
currencies to show up not so much in the exchange rate but in short-term
interest rates. Thus, they argued, there was no necessary contradiction
between the relative firmness of sterling and the tension displayed in the
money markets about a possible Labour victory.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Investors and traders relieved by European
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY brought some respite to the battered European government bond
markets.
After the bad news of recent days - which have seen closing yields on
10-year German bonds climbing above 8 per cent for the first time since
January 3 and yields on comparable French bonds hitting a high for the year
at more than 8.75 per cent - the relief among traders and investors alike
was clear.
The recovery seemed to be driven as much by technical factors as by any
sense that the mark-down in prices had been overdone, observers said.
In the German and French futures markets, the fact that many traders had
gone short was said to have accounted partly for some sharp upward swings
during the day.
UK gilts meanwhile, continued to follow the mood of the political opinion
polls in the run-up to the general election. Underlying economic factors
seemed to have little immediate influence on the day's trading.
IN GERMANY, M3 money growth during February was confirmed at 8.5 per cent,
close to the level indicated at the start of the week and down from the 9
per cent growth in January.
The fall in M3 brought little consolation to the government bond market,
where a greater reduction had been looked for in some quarters -
particularly when the figure is set against the Bundesbank's target range of
3.5 to 5.5 per cent for the year.
The market is far more interested in the latest German inflation figure, due
later this week: one analyst said yesterday this was likely to show
inflation peaking at 4.7 per cent.
Early weakness in the bond market was reversed sharply in the afternoon, due
both partly to technical factors and partly to a confident start in the US.
The yield on 10-year government bonds ended the day at 8.024 per cent, down
from Monday but still well up on the beginning of the month, when it stood
at around 7.85 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds recovered strongly from Monday, in the process
narrowing the yield spread against German bonds.
At 73 basis points, this had opened up to its widest since last summer and
well outside the recent trading range: yesterday, it closed back to 70 basis
points.
Figures released yesterday revealed the French trade surplus had narrowed to
FFr407m in February, from a revised FFr3.53bn in January.
In a busy day on the futures market, with 167,000 lots traded, the June
contract closed up one-third of a point on the day, at 107.40.
A sharp bear squeeze, with some traders caught with short positions,
accounted for much of the rise, traders said.
The yield on 10-year bonds closed at 8.72 per cent, down from 8.77 per cent
on Monday.
AFTER a quiet opening, news of weak car sales and strong demand for the
afternoon auction of two-year notes sent US Treasury prices soaring
yesterday and pushed the yield on the long bond back below 8 per cent.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up 1 1/32 at 100
19/32 , yielding 7.941 per cent. The two-year note was also markedly firmer,
up  5/16 at 99 11/32 , to carry a yield of 5.720 per cent.
At first, trading lacked a firm direction in the absence of economic
figures, and activity was subdued amid concern about the impact of fresh
supply on the market.
News of weak mid-March car sales, however, boosted sentiment just before
noon, but it was not until after the sale of Dollars 14.75bn in two-year
notes that prices took off. There was good demand for the new issue,
especially from dealers. The sale was completed at an average yield of 5.85
per cent and with a high bid/cover ratio, both of which were better than
market expectations.
THE UK government bond market continued to anticipate the outcome of the
general election on April 9. A Harris opinion poll indicating a five-point
lead for the Conservative party brought some cheer back to the market, which
duly market longer-dated gilts up several points on the day. 'All we're
doing is trading opinion polls,' one observer said.
The benchmark 9 per cent gilts due 2011 rose  7/32 of a point on the day, at
95 3/8 , giving a yield of 9.52 per cent. A rise of similar proportions was
recorded by the 11 3/4 per cent gilts due 2003/07, which ended the day at
around 112  17/32 , a yield of some 9.8 per cent.
At these levels, the market is already largely discounting a victory by the
opposition Labour party, or a result which leaves no clear majority party,
traders said. But, most agree yields could yet breach 10 per cent if a
Labour victory looks likely.
JAPANESE government bond prices hardly shifted yesterday, as the end of the
Japanese fiscal year continued to suppress activity in Japan.
Despite the expectation of a discount rate cut, the market appears to lack
direction. The no 129 benchmark issue ended unchanged at 105.88.
With no sign of investor demand, traders, many of whom are holding long
positions, are apt to stay out of the market. However, the outlook could
improve, if cash balances are allocated to bonds once the new financial year
is properly under way.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Eskom returns to market with five-year
DM300m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESKOM, the South African electricity utility, yesterday launched its first
public issue in the international bond market since 1985, raising DM300m,
five-year funding in a deal lead-managed by Commerzbank.
The bonds were sold mostly to retail investors in continental Europe,
following the pattern of other recent issues by South African borrowers.
The deal is the fourth since South Africa returned to the public bond market
last September and follows D-Mark and Ecu issues by the government and a
DM200m issue in February by the Development Bank of Southern Africa.
The return of South African borrowers to the Euromarket has not been without
controversy: in November, the Independent Development Trust, a cross-party
health, education and housing charity, postponed a Dollars 200m deal
following opposition from the African National Congress.
Bankers said yesterday the referendum of white South Africans this month,
which resulted in a vote in favour of political reform, would encourage
wider international participation in future bond issues.
The syndicate of 23 banks participating in yesterday's deal was dominated by
German firms.
Among the non-German participants were Standard Chartered, Paribas, Credit
Lyonnais, Credit Commercial de France, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank
Corporation and Kredietbank.
When the government launched its DM400m, five-year issue in September, only
three non-German banks participated: Paribas, Swiss Bank Corporation and
Kleinwort Benson.
The Eskom paper carries a full government guarantee, a policy which is
likely to continue in future issues by South African borrowers. The 10 per
cent bonds were issued at 101, to yield 150 basis points more than German
government bonds. The governments D-Mark issue was launched at a spread of
175 basis points more than bunds.
Part of the proceeds of yesterday's issue will be used to refinance an
outstanding DM150m deal which falls due on April 1, said Mr Mick Davis,
chief financial officer.
The remainder has been swapped into rand, although at a rate no better than
Eskom can achieve from the domestic South African bond market, Mr Davis
added.
Eskom has another DM100m issue falling due on September 15. Mr Davis said
this would be refinanced with another international issue, although the
company may issue in the Ecu or Eurodollar markets next time.
Other South African borrowers in an unofficial queue to launch international
bonds include Transnet, the transport group, and the Office of Post and
Telecommunications, both of which have outstanding foreign currency bonds
maturing later this year.
Elsewhere, the poor tone of government bond markets continued to deter
potential Euromarket borrowers.
Syndicate officials said intermediaries and investors were focusing on the
outcome of this week's US Treasury refunding operations before committing
funds to the market.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Carolco secures Dollars 73.8m
of financing

CAROLCO, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, yesterday said it
had secured Dollars 73.8m of financing from its foreign investors and has
access to an additional Dollars 23m in new bank loans, which should be
sufficient to continue operating.
Carolco's foreign minority shareholders include Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of
Italy and Canal Plus of France.
Carolco, along with other independent film companies such as Orion Pictures,
has been caught in a financial squeeze. In December, Carolco cut its staff
of 200 by 25 per cent and said it was considering reducing the number of
deals with film-makers.
Problems at the company, which started mounting last summer, forced it to
cut off talks aimed at acquiring a 46 per cent stake in the Live
Entertainment home video supplier in November. Carolco still holds a 53 per
cent stake in Live.
The company, which is best know for its Terminator and Rambo films, was in
technical default on Dollars 172m of bank loans for much of last year.
The details of yesterday's financing and restructuring are not significantly
different from a package arranged two months ago, although the amount of
funding has increased. In January, Carolco said it had secured Dollars 45m
of financing and a deferral on Dollars 10m of debts from its US and foreign
lenders.
The major differences include the Dollars 23m in new loans that Carolco's
banks have made available to the company. Carolco's bankers include Bankers
Trust, Chemical Bank and Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland. In addition,
Carolco's investors have agreed to fund up to Dollars 13.8m of potential
bank collateral shortfalls.
While the arrangement should help Carolco keep operating in the short-term,
the company said it 'anticipates that its operations could require
additional sources of funds.'

<TEXT>
GROUPE Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company headed by financier Mr
Albert Frere, pushed up consolidated profits by 23 per cent to BFr7bn
(Dollars 205m) last year, helped by a heavy increase in interest and
dividend receipts. The group reported profits of BFr5.7bn for 1990.
The directors have proposed increasing net dividend from BFr140 to BFr142.5
per share. Although the increase is smaller than many analysts had expected,
GBL denied it had held back the payout in order to add to its substantial
cash reserves.
Interest on reserves and dividends increased from less than BFr100m to
BFr1.6bn last year. 'The (cash) amount is clearly comfortable and we could
make a large investment without having to run to the banks,' said a
spokesman, who refused to give details of the group's finances.
GBL, which owns stakes in many of Belgium's largest industrial and financial
groups, is said by some analysts to have nearly BFr30bn of cash on its
balance sheet, following a number of judicious stake sales over the last two
years.
In 1991, GBL sold part of its stake in Royale Belge, the Belgian insurance
company, and Banque Internationale a Luxembourg. However, capital gains of
BFr3.2bn were broadly the same as in 1990.
The figures, announced after the close of the Brussels stock market, were in
line with analysts' most recent expectations, although a number of brokers
had downgraded their forecasts since the beginning of the year following
poor results from some companies in which GBL has a holding.
The group said the bulk - about BFr5.1bn - of its final profit was accounted
for by interest, dividends and GBL's share in the results of other
companies.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM launches laptop in colour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) has introduced a laptop computer with
colour screen. It has also launched two lower-priced notebook computers.
IBM's colour laptop incorporates a 10.4-inch flat active matrix colour
display, jointly developed by IBM and Toshiba in Japan.
It will be manufactured in Japan to avoid dumping duties imposed by the US
government last year on Japanese-built active matrix displays. Such duties
are not imposed on assembled units.
The notebook-sized computers, called PS Notes, have monochrome screens and
weigh just over six pounds.
With these product announcements, IBM aims to shrug off a series of mistakes
in the rapidly growing market for portable personal computers, where it has
trailed competitors.
The PS/2 Color Laptop is based on a 386SX microprocessor and incorporates an
80MB hard drive. It is priced in the US at Dollars 5,995. Bigger and heavier
than the notebook computers, the colour laptop weighs 11 pounds, due
primarily to the screen technology.
The PS/2 Model N51 SLC is built around IBM's own version of the 386
microprocessor, which the company claims is up to 80 per cent faster than
standard versions. It also comes with an 80MB hard drive. The US price is
Dollars 3,295.
The PS/2 Model N51 SX is aimed at price-sensitive customers and is based on
a standard 386SX microprocessor with a 40MB hard drive.
It is priced at Dollars 2,250 in the US, placing it in direct competition
with a myriad of IBM-compatible notebook models.
Sun Microsystems Computer, the leading US computer workstation manufacturer,
yesterday cut by nearly 30 per cent the prices of its high-end workstations
for three-dimensional imaging.
The move is expected to step up pressure on such competitors as
Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment, IBM and Silicon Graphics to make similar
price adjustments.
Sun also cut prices on 19-inch monitors for all its workstations. Pacific
Bell, one of the largest regional telephone companies in the US, has formed
an alliance with IBM and Northern Telecom to develop and field test
'multimedia' telecommunications network services.
The goal of the alliance is to create services that would enable telephone
customers to communicate with data, video, images and voice as easily as
they can now place a phone call.
Focusing initially on expanding applications of existing network technology,
the companies are also planning a second phase of joint research on making
use of new broadband network technologies.
As envisioned, multimedia services would allow users simply to dial others
on their PCs. The parties could, for example, see images of each other on
their screens and use a shared computer screen 'window' to edit documents
jointly.
In a separate move, Northern Telecom - Canada's biggest telecommunications
equipment producer - has formed a joint venture, Northern Telecom de Espana,
to sell telephones, switching equipment, business communications systems and
data networks in Spain, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
NT owns 50 per cent of the new company; Agroman Inversiones owns 37.5 per
cent; and Radiotronica 12.5 per cent. Both Spanish partners are members of
the Banesto group.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABITIBI-PRICE, the newsprint and paper producer, controlled by Toronto's
Reichmann family, admitted its key markets remained depressed, but added
'the free fall in prices may be near the bottom,' AP-DJ reports.
It had already reported a 1991 loss of CDollars 75.9m, (USDollars 63.7m), or
CDollars 1.12 a share, on revenues of CDollars 2.8bn. The 1991 results
included pre-tax, non-recurring charges and write-downs of CDollars 44.4m.
Capital spending was expected to rise to about CDollars 50m in 1992 from
CDollars 38.5m last year, while long-term debt stood at CDollars 370.8m at
the year-end.
Abitibi, in its annual report, said: 'The outlook for the newsprint industry
in North America is not expected to improve appreciably in 1992 unless there
is a marked increase in US consumption or further mill or machine closures.'
It added some improvement in markets were expected in 1993.
'We are now facing the same (newsprint) price wars and ferocious competition
offshore that we have seen in domestic markets.' It expects further price
weakness in overseas markets this year.

GOAL Petroleum, the small North Sea oil exploration company, saw a 16 per
cent rise in net profits to Pounds 6.6m last year, compared with Pounds
5.69m in 1990, writes Deborah Hargreaves.
Earnings per share amounted to 4.92p (4.24p) and Goal is proposing a 14 per
cent dividend increase to 1.25p.
At the pre-tax level profits fell to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 10.6m).
The company increased production over the year by 21 per cent to 11,460
barrels a day. Turnover improved from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 44.8m.
'We have a very good mix of low-cost production and many of our fields don't
pay tax which means the company is looking robust against the current low
oil price,' Mr David Boyd, managing director, said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENDRAGON, the luxury and executive car dealer, yesterday announced a fall,
from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 4.73m, in pre-tax profits for the year to
December 31, reflecting reduced contributions from new car sales and the
contract hire business.
But Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said the company's used car sales and
after-sales division performed well as customers delayed new purchases.
Following the 5 per cent reduction in new car tax announced in the budget,
and with the uncertainty of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
removed, Mr Finn anticipated an improvement in new car sales from August and
said the outlook was promising.
Turnover fell to Pounds 168.3m (Pounds 174.4m). Operating profits were
dragged lower by higher administrative expenses, reflecting increased costs
managing franchises acquired during the year. Interest charges dropped to
Pounds 830,000 (Pounds 2.18m), helped by the proceeds of last June's Pounds
11m rights issue.
The company held net cash of some Pounds 2.1m at the year end.
More shares in issue pushed earnings down to 12.1p (15.1p). However, the
directors are recommending a final dividend of 4p to make a total of 6p, an
11 per cent increase.
Mr Finn said although used car volumes were down, margins improved. This was
because consumers delayed new purchases, leading to a shortage of low
mileage used cars on the market.

THE AMERICAN investor Warren Buffett confirms in his eagerly awaited annual
report to shareholders that his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
has purchased a stake of more than 31.2m shares in Guinness for Dollars
264.8m (Pounds 153m).
The purchase represents the first time that the investment conglomerate has
made a significant investment in a company domiciled outside the US. In the
report, Buffett writes: 'Guinness  .. earns its money in much the same
fashion as Coca-Cola and Gillette, US-based companies that garner most of
their profits from international operations.'
Berkshire owns about 7 per cent of the capital stock of Coca-Cola Co. and
about 11 per cent of Gillette. Chief financial officer J. Verne McKenzie
said the company would not elaborate on the Guinness purchase beyond Mr
Buffett's remarks.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: ADT falls 44% in line with City forecasts
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, yesterday reported
a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1991, broadly in line with market
expectations.
Pre-tax profits fell to Dollars 137m (Pounds 79m) against Dollars 244m on
sales up 9 per cent at Dollars 1.25bn. Earnings per share fell from Dollars
1.93 to Dollars 1.04.
The company repeated its statement that it would not pay an ordinary
dividend until the 1992 results at the earliest in line with the policy of
reducing debt.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, forecast that earnings per share would
increase in 1992. 'Not many UK companies would go out on a limb and say
that,' he said.
Regarding ADT's convertible preference shares which fall due in 1994, Mr
Ashcroft said: 'The last quarter of 1994 is two and a half years away, we do
not see it as a problem.'
The pre-tax figure was again boosted by profits from foreign exchange gains
of Dollars 20m, down from last year's Dollars 27m. The gain from long term
investments fell from Dollars 22.7m to Dollars 11.6m, including losses on
the sale of stakes in Christies International and Quoteplan.
The figures included a Dollars 57.9m charge above the line, most of which
was due to interest as debt rose as the group crystallised losses on
associate investments.
Debt finished the year at Dollars 1.04bn, down from Dollars 1.1bn, but Mr
Ashcroft said that taking away the value of quoted investments and liquid
assets, gearing at the year-end would be about 100 per cent on shareholders'
equity of Dollars 600m.
At the operating level, profits from security services fell slightly, from
Dollars 133m to Dollars 131m, while auctions increased profits from Dollars
64.3m to Dollars 71.8m.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Labour would delay minimum wage proposals until next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party would not implement its proposed minimum wage until next
year and would then stick to the rate of Pounds 3.40 an hour rather than the
original policy formula of half of median male earnings.
The delay and the lower rate would mean that the number of people affected
by the minimum wage would be substantially lower, the wage bill cost for
employers markedly down, and the expected job losses from the measure
reduced.
Mr Paul Gregg, senior research fellow at the National Institute of Social
and Economic Research, yesterday calculated that if the Pounds 3.40 rate
were not introduced until April next year, the number of people covered
would be 2.3m compared with nearly 4m if the median male earnings formula
were implemented next month.
He said the corresponding increase on the wages bill would be Pounds 2.2bn
compared with Pounds 3.4bn, and the number of job losses would be 100,000
compared with the 150,000 the institute had originally calculated. Two
Labour frontbench spokesmen have confirmed that, if Labour wins, the minimum
wage is unlikely to be introduced before April 1993.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, has stated that the initial rate would be
Pounds 3.40, the figure in Labour's manifesto. Sticking to the formula of
half median male earnings would, by April 1993, produce a figure close to
Pounds 3.80.
Labour leaders stress that they remain committed to the formula but have
accepted the argument of economic advisers that the seriousness of the
recession and higher-than-expected unemployment make a short delay in
implementation sensible. Union officials are unlikely to complain publicly
before the election. However, implemention at the lower level could build up
pressure for a large catch-up, to the level of the formula, in 1994.
Workers most affected by the minimum wage are in hotels and catering,
retailing, textiles and clothing, and contract cleaning. The main worry for
many empl-oyers is the knock-on effect if differentials are to be
maintained.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Radiation leak renews safety fears over Russian reactors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS over the safety of nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union were
revived yesterday following a leak of radiation from a Russian nuclear power
station at Sosnovy Bor, 60 miles west of St Petersburg.
The leak initially registered three on the seven-point scale of seriousness
devised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to classify nuclear
accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl explosion was rated level seven.
The state nuclear inspectorate, Gosatomnadzor, said radioactive iodine and
inert gases leaked into the reactor's machine room early yesterday and were
transmitted by the ventilation system into the outside atmosphere.
The agency said an emergency control system immediately came into operation
and the stricken reactor had then been closed and was being cooled.
There were conflicting reports about the significance of the accident. Mr
Yuri Rogozhin of Gosatomnadzor said the 'degree of the incident is serious,
with possible consequences for the environment and the population'.
But there was 'no comparison' between the incident and the Chernobyl
disaster, although the Sosnovy Bor reactor was of the same type as that at
Chernobyl.
Mr Sergei Galkin, deputy chief engineer at Sosnovy Bor in charge of safety,
told the official news agency Itar-Tass that the leak of radioactive gases
'did not exceed the sanitary norms for nuclear power installations'.
Nuclear safety organisations in Sweden and Finland said there had been no
rise in radioactive levels on their monitors.
Mr Matti Vuorinen, head of the Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear
Safety, said the leaks appeared to pose no threat to residents.
Western governments and environmentalists expressed concern over safety
standards for reactors in the former Soviet Union and renewed calls for
unsafe plants to be shut.
The incident also highlighted concern, especially in neighbouring countries,
over the future of ageing reactors kept in service in republics which have
no alternative sources of power - especially at a time of falling supplies
of oil, gas and coal.
Swedish inspectors who visited Sosnovy Bor noted that two of its four
reactors lacked safety fixtures to prevent radiation leaks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greatly though Lloyds Bank will miss the courteous erudition of Sir Jeremy
Morse, the succession to Mr Brian Pitman as chief executive actually matters
more. Since Mr Pitman assumed his post in 1983, Lloyds's shares have
outperformed the banking sector by nearly 90 per cent. Yesterday's
announcement about the chairmanship also brought confirmation that he is to
stay until 1995, so presumably the future is assured until then. But there
is one caveat.
Some might argue that Lloyds' dalliance with Midland meant Mr Pitman had
lost his deftness of touch. In fact a merger could just about have been
justified by the scope for cost-saving. Alternative propositions will need
an even more critical look. In the long run, shareholders would be more
grateful for surplus funds to be paid out in dividends than frittered away
on a reckless buying spree.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pru's decision to stop writing general insurance via brokers is a rare
bit of cheerful news for UK composites. The move could yet look silly if the
cycle suddenly turned - but then sceptics said the same about Mr Newmarch's
humiliating exit from the estate agency game, and who is now to say that he
was wrong? Even in better times broker-related general insurance is too
small to make decent returns.
Like Legal and General, the Pru would no doubt be happy if its
transformation to a purer life and pensions business could be speeded up
even more. Last year's somewhat disappointing 9 per cent pre-tax profits
rise, for example, bore the mark of increased losses from the non-life side
of the reinsurance group, Mercantile and General. It is too early to be
alarmist, but one wonders just how long the sizeable prior year claims will
recur. The Pru is putting its substantial weight behind M and G for the
moment, but the company may yet provide Mr Newmarch with his next chance to
swing the axe.

FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Laporte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by yesterday's results, Laporte has not been quite as successful in
defying recession this time as it was a decade ago. But a 6 per cent fall to
Pounds 97m in pre-tax profits for 1991 was not a bad performance: the figure
would have been flat had it not been for a Pounds 6m hit from the permanent
loss of one customer in its absorbents division. It is nonetheless striking
to recall that 18 months ago the market confidently thought Laporte would be
making Pounds 145m last year. It is just as well the group has insignificant
gearing and that the increased dividend was comfortably covered.
The logic of separating from Solvay was accepted when the break-up of their
Interox joint venture was announced last year. Yesterday's details suggest
both sides achieved their objective, so Laporte was ungracious towards its
partner in suggesting that Interox had become a drag on profits growth. Its
main reason to separate was to concentrate on high-margin specialty
chemicals, a strategy taken a step further by the acquisition of Rockwood, a
US pigments producer.
Investors must take the numbers on trust, but earnings from Rockwood should
more than offset the loss of the full contribution from Interox. All the
same, Laporte needs economic recovery if progress this year is to be
anything more than steady. That outlook is properly reflected by the average
rating of its shares.

FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: P &amp; O
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Relief that there was no property black hole, combined with a smaller than
expected drop in profits, contributed to an 8 per cent jump yesterday in P &amp;
O shares. That said, investors are entitled to feel a mite puzzled that
revaluations of the newly divided Pall Mall empire and other group real
est-ate produced so little bad news. P &amp; O has little exposure on the
development side, to be sure, but the negligible writedown of the Bovis land
bank and mere 4 per cent balance sheet hit for investment properties
certainly contrasts with experience elsewhere.
This would matter more if gearing, which, thanks to the Chelsfield deal is
back at 70 per cent, was steaming ahead like it was before the rights issue
last summer. Falling capital expenditure and sizeable property sales over
the next two to three years, though, promise to relieve this pressure in the
medium term. In retrospect the timing of Lord Sterling's huge investment
programme might have been a lot better, but even at last night's 416p close
the shares are an attractive recovery play. Not many companies with
cyclically depressed profits stand on a lower than market average multiple;
a 10 per cent yield implies caution on the dividend front which does not now
appear justified. Real glimmers of economic recovery, however, will have to
appear before the market is convinced.

FT  25 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: German lesson for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perplexing that German bond yields should suddenly be back over 8 per
cent. There was never any doubt that money supply growth - 8.5 per cent in
February - would be slow to return to its target range or that inflation
would be pushing up towards 5 per cent this month. Perhaps investors feared
the Bundesbank would tighten further after Friday's 9 per cent settlement
for heating workers. But Bonn is taking a tough line on public sector pay
and it would be uncharacteristic for the central bank to react to each twist
in the round. The simple explanation seems to be the market has finally
given up hope of lower money rates in the foreseeable future.
The prospect that the yield curve will remain sharply inverted thus adds to
the attraction of cash. German bankers report customer time deposits are
growing sharply. Curiously, though, money leaving the German bond market
does not seem to be seeking higher long-term returns elsewhere in Europe.
The yield curve is inverted elsewhere, of course, while the UK and French
markets have political worries of their own. But even in Denmark, where
inflation is only 2.3 per cent, the spread over German bond yields has
widened by some 30 basis points this year. That suggests deeper doubts over
currency union and yield convergence. If the Bundesbank really is determined
to stay the course, some of its partners may eventually decide they have no
choice but to realign.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Worry over training funds cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 21 per cent of business executives appointed by the government to run
Britain's 82 Training and Enterprise Councils believe a Labour government
would be damaging to their efforts, according to the first large-scale
survey of its kind.
Although Tec directors in principle support the government's contention that
employers should shoulder more of the cost of training, they voiced their
concern over cuts in state funding to training programmes in 1992-93 and
said the quality of programmes could be affected.
However, most Tec directors showed broad satisfaction with the progress of
Tecs, which were launched two years ago by Mr Michael Howard, the employment
secretary, to change attitudes towards training in the UK .
In a big survey of board members of conducted by The Financial Times, 20 per
cent of the private sector respondents - who make up the majority on Tec
boards - said Labour would have a positive effect on training. Fifty-two per
cent said the effect would be neutral, 21 per cent said it would be damaging
and 7 per cent did not reply.
A minority of these private sector executives supported statutory moves to
promote training within companies, such as the return of a levy on companies
which do not train to a minimum level. This is proposed by Labour.
Directors, whose ranks include a minority representation of trade union
members and public sector executives, were satisfied with progress in a
number of areas including relationships with schools in their areas.
Most were ambitious to expand their 'enterprise' role and to take over all
the small business initiatives of the Department of Trade and Industry.
However, they were critical of their progress in promoting and improving
training within companies. One Tec director wrote: 'Tecs do not embrace, or
have the powers to involve, employers not committed to training.'

<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, frontrunner in the race for Democratic
nomination for the US presidency, suffered a setback last night when he was
pushed into second place in the primary election in the state of
Connecticut.
Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, scored an upset victory which
renewed doubts about Mr Clinton's candidacy.
With about 81 per cent of the votes counted, Mr Brown had 38 per cent to Mr
Clinton's 35 per cent. Mr Paul Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator,
got 20 per cent even though he announced last week he was quitting the
presidential race.
Mr Tsongas was considered almost certain to have won Connecticut if he had
stayed in the race.
Mr Clinton still holds a commanding advantage in the number of delegates
committed to him at the Democratic nominating convention in July, and last
night's result does not diminish the probability he will clinch his party's
nomination.
But Mr Brown, whose attacks on Mr Clinton in the last fortnight have been
vicious and who stands a good chance of repeating yesterday's victory in
Vermont's tiny primary next Tuesday, will be able to wound his opponent over
the next two months.
President George Bush, meanwhile, again easily defeated his rightwing
challenger, Mr Patrick Buchanan, in the Republican primary in Connecticut.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Letter: World Bank and Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWIN R LIM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the article, 'World Bank criticises Nigeria' (March 16), you quoted
without our authorisation from a confidential World Bank report on public
expenditure management in Nigeria. The article gives a misleading impression
of the purpose of the report, as well as its implications for Nigeria's
prospects for debt relief.
The report is part of an extensive policy dialogue between Nigeria and the
bank. It was based on a review of federal government public expenditure
carried out by the bank staff in collaboration with the main economic and
sectoral ministries in Nigeria in the early part of 1991. The main thrust of
the report was a number of recommendations on expenditure control and
management, project selection criteria, and other measures to strengthen the
budgetary process and improve the efficiency of public expenditures. It
might be noted that president Babangida, in his 1992 budget address,
specifically articulated concerns about the need for sound public
expenditure management.
We disagree with your article's speculation that the 'report may hit
prospects for debt rescheduling'. On the contrary, we consider a candid
review of public expenditure management to be a key step in Nigeria's
implementation of its structural adjustment programme and its efforts to
secure concessionary and longer term debt relief from creditors.
The World Bank has consistently supported, and continues to support, the
government's efforts to seek relief from its external debt burden, without
which the economic recovery and growth of this most populous country in
Africa would be difficult - a point which was made in your accompanying
article on Nigeria entitled 'An urgent need for debt relief'.
Edwin R Lim,
director,
Western Africa Department,
The World Bank,

FT  25 MAR 92 / Champion of liberty and law: The work of the late Friedrich
von Hayek
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many would say that if Mrs Margaret Thatcher is a conviction politician, the
convictions are those of Friedrich von Hayek, who died on Monday at the age
of 92. Yet the conclusion would be unfair to both.
Although the former UK prime minister was a great admirer of the late
economic philosopher, Hayek mainly provided articulation and confirmation of
convictions Mrs Thatcher had already reached. The admiration was
reciprocated, yet there was much in his writings that some would see to be
at variance with Thatcherite practice.
Friedrich August von Hayek was born in Vienna on May 8 1899. His father was
a professor while the imperial city was enjoying its celebrated sunset.
Brahms had only recently died, and Freud had yet to publish his major works.
Hayek's own career began in the civil service, and after holding academic
posts in Vienna he came to the Lon-don School of Economics in 1931.
Recalling his arrival, Lionel Robbins subsequently wrote: 'I can still see
the door of my room opening to admit the tall, powerful, reserved figure
which announced itself quietly and firmly as 'Hayek' '. His lectures were so
successful that the school's director, William Beveridge, suggested that he
remain as Tooke Professor, a post he held until 1950. Hayek brought a whole
host of cosmopolitan contacts to the LSE. He was, for instance, instrumental
in the appointment of Sir Karl Popper, the philosopher and author of The
Open Society.
Although Hayek's later career took him first to Chicago and then back to
Austria and Germany (his last years were spent in Freiburg in Breisgau), he
retained his British nationality (acquired in 1938), and he remained a close
observer of the British scene. He was a joint winner of the Nobel Prize for
economics in 1974. He was twice married; he leaves a widow, Helene, and a
son and daughter.
Hayek's fortunes teach us a great deal about intellectual fashions. During
the 1930s he was mainly known for technical economic studies, which were at
the time overshadowed by the new Keynesian theories on unemployment and
economic policy. One conclusion from that period, recently disinterred, is
that market institutions could not just be grafted on to state socialism, as
mainstream economists long believed was possible.
Hayek's greatest intellectual regret for those years is that he never wrote
a full-scale critique of Keynes's The General Theory. He had previously
written a long review of the first volume of Keynes's earlier Treatise on
Money - only to be told by Keynes that the latter had changed his views.
This experience led Hayek to suppose that The General Theory was just
another 'tract for the times'.
In the 1940s Hayek became a hate figure to those on the political left
because of his onslaught on centralised economic planning and his insistence
on the links between political and economic freedom in his best-selling Road
to Serfdom: the book is said to have influenced Winston Churchill's
controversial 1945 election broadcast about the threat of a 'Gestapo' under
socialism. It is less well known that Keynes sent Hayek a letter expressing
his deeply felt agreement with at least some of the argument.
Hayek was not a charismatic public figure. His brief post-war notoriety was
followed by decades of neglect, during which his most important constructive
works on the foundations of a free society were written. Indeed, I was first
attracted to his writings by his concern, voiced in The Constitution of
Liberty (1960), 'for that condition of man in which coercion of some by
others is reduced as much as possible'.
Finally, following his Nobel prize in 1974, he emerged as a cult figure of
the radical right - which did neither side too much good. For there was far
more to Hayek than the demolition of socialism and the standard case for
free markets. In presenting him as a revered thinker with a complete system,
his followers may have made his work neater, simpler and less interesting
than it really was.
Although Hayek was far too shrewd to overrate the Nobel award, for one
reason or another the years following it witnessed a rejuvenation. Among
political theorists and sociologists critical of the new right, he was
studied more seriously than the more fashionable economic technicians. But
he took this adulation with a large pinch of salt and was no more a Hayekian
than Keynes was a Keynesian.
Hayek was unfashionable in the 1950s and 60s as much for academic as for
political reasons. At a time when most go-ahead economists were raring to
equip themselves with forecasting models and computer print-outs, Hayek - in
contrast to Milton Friedman - seemed an armchair thinker, preoccupied with
ideas such as the limitations of human knowledge and the problems that
economists would have if they tried to ape the natural scientist.
But in the longer haul the contrast did not necessarily tell against Hayek.
A disadvantage of recent methodological orthodoxy is that many economists
have acquired a vested interest in the existence of stable, discoverable
numerical relationships between phenomena such as income and consumption, or
short-run changes in the money supply and the price level. Hayek warned that
one could not guarantee the successful discovery of such relationships, but
that scientific method could still be applied to predict certain general
features of interacting systems - as it is, for instance, in biology and
linguistics.
His insistence that, while inflation is a monetary phenomenon, there is no
such thing as 'the quantity of money', and no sharp boundary between money
and other financial assets, has stood the test of time. The experience of
the British government, which has changed its view of monetary targets so
much and to so little avail, was much less puzzling to a Hayekian than to a
true monetarist believer. So, too, was the high unemployment cost of
reducing inflation, which Hayek insisted was inevitable while labour markets
were dominated by the collective bargaining mentality.
Hayek's defence of the market system was subtly different from that of many
economists. Whereas mainstream economists have been preoccupied with the
optimal allocation of resources in given conditions, Hayek was concerned
with the effect of the market system on the evolution and stability of
society. He was interested in markets as examples of human institutions,
like language or law, which have evolved 'as a result of human action, but
not of human intention'.
He insisted that wants, techniques and resources are not given, but are
constantly changing - in part because of the activities of entrepreneurs who
open up possibilities which people did not know existed before. (The dynamic
and entrepreneurial aspect was also emphasised by another economist of
Austrian origin, Joseph Schumpeter, thus providing a so-called 'Austrian'
critique of mainstream neo-classical economics, which overlaps with the
objections of 'radical' political economists.)
According to Hayek, a market system is a discovery technique. No computer
can predict the emergence of new knowledge, original ideas, or innovations -
and people's reactions to them.
His scepticism about the use of econometric relationships was based on a
wider epistemological view. For he insisted that the most important kind of
knowledge was not of propositions or theories, but of practical skills and
dispositions governed by rules which we may imperfectly discover afterwards,
but not formulate in advance.
For Hayek the cardinal sin of our times was something known by the ungainly
label of 'constructivism'. This was akin to what Michael Oakeshott called
'rationalism', and is the error of believing that any order we find in
society has been put there by a designing mind - and can be, accordingly,
redesigned from scratch.
Hayek was very far from believing the conventional bourgeois pieties. He
never imagined that there was anything just in market rewards. These
depended on an unpredictable mixture of effort, ability and luck.
Quite apart from the adverse economic consequences, it was not desirable
even to try to reward merit through public policy, which would involve some
authority deciding how much pain and effort a task had cost and how much of
a person's achievement was due to outside circumstances.
But, characteristically, Hayek spoiled a splendid and heretical contribution
by insisting that any public policy towards the distribution of income and
property (beyond the provision of a very basic social-security minimum)
involved political assessment of merit and was thus incompatible with a free
society and the rule of law.
However, Hayek did not in fact provide any easily recognisable criteria for
identifying state interventions of the harmful type. The free-market
arguments in The Road To Serfdom were based on the incompatibility of
central planning with personal liberty. In subsequent years Hayek approached
the issue indirectly. He argued, especially in The Constitution Of Liberty,
that the main condition for a free society is what he called 'the rule of
law'. By that he meant a presumption in favour of general rules and against
discretionary power. He attempted to derive from this conception not only
the fundamental political and legal basis, but also the economic policies,
of a free society.
Many writers of the most diverse political persuasion accepted that general
rules were an important protection - perhaps the most important single
protection - for freedom. But Hayek was criticised for suggesting that
general laws were a sufficient condition for a free society. Many policies
involving a high degree of coercion can be imposed by general rules - for
example, a ban on the teaching of evolution or on any literature or music
which flouts the principles of Marxist-Leninism. There is no one
philosopher's stone for minimising coercion in society.
Hayek's concern to restore a government of laws rather than men can be seen
from his later writings which warned of the degeneration of democracy into a
struggle for spoils among competing groups. He saw the source of
interest-group domination in what he called 'majoritarian' or unlimited
democracy. This is the belief that a government elected by a majority of
voters (usually a plurality) should be able to enact what it likes without
any check - a system which Lord Hailsham has termed an elective
dictatorship.
Some of Hayek's own constitutional proposals struck even his admirers as
far-fetched. But their underlying aim was important. It was to recover an
older idea of a state, which has no purposes of its own, but provides a
framework of rules and arrangements under which people can pursue their own
individual aims without getting in each other's way. This ideal - which is a
long way removed from the practice of any modern government, even of the
radical right - has been labelled by Oakeshott as a 'civil association', as
opposed to the more usual idea of the state as an 'enterprise association'
with its own aims and purposes. The close similarity of the later work of
both Hayek and Oakeshott, pursued in relative isolation, is a theme which
deserves a study of its own.
There were great ultimate differences between Hayek and others who shared a
similar outlook. Unlike most classical liberals, Hayek's espousal of liberty
turned out to be based neither on ultimate judgments, nor on considerations
of welfare, utility or happiness. He did not even accept the methodological
individualism of most mainstream economists. For him, the key to
institutions was natural selection among competing traditions.
This evolutionary approach remained in the background in the classic
politico-economic works of his middle period. But its roots went back to his
student days when he was as concerned with philosophy and biology as with
economics.
The evolutionary outlook landed Hayek with problems. For it made it
difficult to criticise any social order (eg Stalinist Russia) which was not
visibly dying out. Hayek's refuge in evolution was not just idiosyncratic,
but can be seen as a response to the failure of attempts to build deductive
systems of morality which will apply to specific cases. His own inability to
resolve the ultimate conundrums of human conduct should not obscure the
range of his achievements.
Hayek's writings have asserted the case for general rules over discretionary
authority. They have exposed the misleading identification of a liberal
democracy with the divine right of temporary majorities. They have
demonstrated the connection between economic and personal freedoms. They
have shown that the domination of both the political and economic
market-place by interest group struggles is a source of evil; and they have
explained why pecuniary rewards neither can nor should reflect merit. In all
these matters Hayek - like Keynes or Friedman or the American philosopher
John Rawls or other such seminal figures - is best treated as an
intellectual agent provocateur rather than a pundit with all the answers.

Poor old David Dinkins. It is a sure sign that the hapless mayor of New York
is in deep trouble when he has to ask a Rockefeller for help.
The black mayor, who seems to stumble from one calamity to another, needed a
new deputy, so he called in David Rockefeller, one of the banking world's
most prominent power brokers. Rockefeller, whose stable of proteges is
rarely bare, didn't take long to find the right man - Barry Sullivan, who
stepped down from the chairmanship of First Chicago in December.
Sullivan used to work for Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan before moving up to
Chicago. Although he may be a reassuring name to New York City's nervous
bankers, his record at First Chicago seems, in retrospect, as mixed as
Rockefeller's own career at Chase.

Three cheers for Lord Sterling of Plaistow. While the chairman of P&amp;O may be
a property developer at heart, when it comes to the national interest he can
be relied upon.
He wants to remove the restriction in the company's Royal Charter on the
amount of P&amp;O stock that may be owned by overseas interests, but he has
reassured Her Majesty's Government, formally, that 'the P&amp;O fleet will, as
always, be available for the defence of the Realm'.
Lord Sterling, who knows more history than most company chairmen, tells me
that it was Sir Thomas Sutherland (one of the founders of the Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Bank) who inserted the condition in 1903 that the company should
'remain a British concern in name and reality'. The Germans were playing up
a bit at the time.
Rather surprisingly, P&amp;O does not charge the government for having its fleet
permanently on call. Perhaps it should.

<TEXT>
Are Britain's big banks and insurance companies examples of good corporate
governance or class-ridden institutions run by gentlemen employing players?
The question is prompted by the sight of the orderly succession at Lloyds,
arguably Britain's most successful high street bank.
In any other business, Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, might have
been expected to be rewarded with the chairmanship given the sterling job he
has done.
However, Lloyds has never picked a chairman from its own management, and, as
at the other clearers, it is only relatively recently that its managers have
been given seats on the board. The cerebral Sir Jeremy Morse is handing over
to Sir Robin Ibbs, an older ex-ICI man, with the clear implication that if
Sir David Walker, the outgoing chairman of the SIB, does not blot his
copybook, he will eventually get the job.
Lloyds' behaviour is not unusual. Midland Bank tends to pick industrialists
as its chairmen and NatWest specialises in country land-owners. The Bank of
Scotland's Bruce Pattullo and Barclays' Sir John Quinton are rare examples
of career bankers who have made it into the officers' mess.
The big insurers are even more inbred. General Accident's chairman - the
Earl of Airlie - doubles up as the Queen's Lord Chamberlain, Sun Alliance is
headed by Henry Uvedale Antrobus Lambert, a scion of Barclays, Commercial
Union's boss is a Baring and Charles Hambro heads GRE.
The traditional arguments for employing such toffs is that their
institutions need statesmanlike figures who know their way around Whitehall
as well as the City. Creative tension is one thing but the danger of
promoting a strong chief executive like Pitman is that he might second-guess
his successor.
Separating the role of chairman and chief executive seems de rigueur these
days but the City's big financial institutions are hardly ideal role models.
NatWest's Lord Alexander and the TSB's Sir Nicholas Goodison are typical
bank chairmen, yet their institutions are struggling. The same is true of
most of the big composites. Lloyds Bank is one of the few big City firms to
have got the mix right. Given Sir Jeremy Morse's record, one must assume
that he and his board have made the right choice now.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Dynastic hopes fall flat in France: The Agnellis' failure in
the battle for Perrier reveals tactical errors in a changing business
climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely since the early days of oil wild-catting has the ownership of holes
in the ground excited as much high passion and low intrigue as during the
tortuous four-month-old battle for France's Source Perrier, the world's
largest mineral water company, which ended with an agreed settlement
yesterday.
Nor has any recent takeover struggle exposed more clearly the complex forces
at work in a Europe where long-established continental models of capitalism,
with their tribal loyalties and inter-locking networks of power, are forced
to confront the rude imperatives of international markets.
To the Agnellis, Italy's foremost business dynasty, whose efforts to win
control of Perrier have been defeated by a coalition between Nestle, the
Swiss food group, and powerful French backers, the message seems clear.
Though they have made a handsome capital gain, it cannot compensate for
their belief that they were victims of a French business establishment bent
on showing that it controls entry into its backyard.
There is some truth in that view. However, it is far from the whole truth.
Indeed, one of the many paradoxes of the Perrier affair is that it seems
more likely to promote than to retard the modernisation of national capital
markets and the erosion of barriers designed solely to protect special
interests.
The affair is bound to be compared with the storm created by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti's raid on the large Societe Generale de Belgique four years ago.
That bid, too, was foiled after an anxious local business establishment
turned for salvation to a foreign white knight, France's Suez group - which
also happened to be a leading adversary of the Agnellis in the Perrier
battle.
However, there are important differences. One is that while Mr De Benedetti
unleashed a shock assault on SGB from outside Belgium, the Agnellis had
hoped to win Perrier by means of patient and friendly negotiation from the
inside.
That approach enabled them in the past five years to become France's largest
foreign investors and cement close ties there. None more influential than
with Lazard Freres, the investment bank and BSN, France's biggest food
group, in which Lazard helped the Agnellis acquire a 5.8 per cent stake.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of the Fiat motor group, sits on Lazard's
board, and his younger brother Umberto is a director of BSN, which the
Agnellis have helped to expand in Italy. Meanwhile, Mr Michel David-Weill
and Mr Antoine Riboud, chairmen respectively of Lazard and BSN, are
directors of several Agnelli-controlled companies, in some of which BSN is a
minority shareholder.
With friends like these, how could the Agnellis go wrong? The answer lies in
a succession of tactical errors, which led them to trample on traditional
French sensitivities while also ignoring important changes in the business
climate.
Initially, the Agnellis moved stealthily, acquiring control of 34 per cent
of Exor, the publicly quoted holding company which owns 35 per cent of
Perrier, the Chateau Margaux vineyard and some Paris property. But after
they launched a takeover bid for two-thirds of Exor in late November, things
started to unravel.
Partial bids are still legal in France: indeed, they were enshrined in stock
market legislation only three years ago at the insistence of French
industry, which argued that it could not otherwise match well-heeled
international acquirers in takeovers. However, the mood has changed
radically since, as evidenced by the French finance ministry's recent plans
to make 100 per cent bids mandatory.
An early clue was the protests by minority shareholders in the Au Printemps
department store chain that they were disadvantaged by a partial bid by the
Pinault conglomerate last year. The Agnellis stirred up a much more
troublesome dissident in Suez, which objected that their FFr1,320 bid
undervalued its 10 per cent stake in Exor.
Though they hastily raised the bid to 100 per cent, that was not enough to
mollify Suez. It approached Nestle, which began buying shares in Exor and
Perrier.
The Agnellis, meanwhile, compounded their error by alienating BSN and
Lazard, which has long used its formidable network of government and
business contacts to dominate the French merger scene. Mr Riboud was uneasy
that the Exor bid would prompt the Agnellis to challenge BSN's position in
mineral water. He grew still more alarmed when the Agnellis hinted that
their longer-term target was BSN itself, where the 73-year-old Mr Riboud has
no clear successor.
That prompted Mr Riboud to co-operate closely with Nestle and Lazard to
thwart the Agnellis' designs on Perrier. After efforts to persuade the
Italians to surrender their claims on the mineral water company failed,
Nestle and Suez launched a bid for it.
Though Lazard had advised the Agnellis on earlier French investments, they
did not involve it in their overtures to Exor, apparently believing that
they were well-enough established not to need help. Spurned by the Agnellis
and confronted with a threat to the interests of BSN, with which Lazard has
intimate ties, the bank aligned itself with the Nestle-Suez camp.
In spite of these setbacks, the Agnellis might still have hoped to soldier
on. With French allies, notably the Saint Louis paper and sugar group and
Worms, a family-run holding company, they controlled 48.8 per cent of
Perrier shares and 49.5 per cent of the voting rights. However, three other
factors were working against them.
One was the high-powered public relations campaign mounted by the BSN/Lazard
camp, which effectively branded the Agnellis as menacing interlopers and
Nestle as the acceptable face of French capitalism. That was despite the
fact that the management of Exor and Perrier regarded the Agnellis'
approaches as friendly and the Nestle-Suez bid as hostile.
Just as remarkably, the campaign succeeded in portraying Nestle, a company
from a non-EC country not renowned for respecting minority investors, as a
shining champion of disfranchised French shareholders. Furthermore, Nestle's
explicit proposal to break up Perrier was magically transformed into a
virtue, while the same intent was imputed to the Agnellis - on the basis of
dubious evidence - and used to discredit their bona fides.
The second element was the Agnellis' misplaced confidence in Mr Jacques
Vincent, president of Exor and Perrier. Not only is Mr Vincent poorly
regarded by France's business establishment, but his illicit transfer of
13.8 per cent of Perrier shares from the company's treasury to Saint Louis
inadvertently led to his allies' nemesis. Challenged by Nestle, the transfer
was annulled by a Paris commercial court last week, depriving the Agnellis
of almost a third of their Perrier votes.
That crucial defeat highlights the central importance of the third element -
the role played by France's takeover rules, which were repeatedly put to the
test during the battle. Dating only from 1989, the rules are still immature,
while the organisations charged with implementing them - notably the
Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) and the Conseil des Bourses de
Valeurs (CBV), have yet to achieve the standing acquired over many years by
Britain's Takeover Panel.
None the less, the regulations provided a framework of a kind completely
absent in Belgium at the time of the SGB battle. Not only were they enforced
throughout the Perrier battle; they were invoked energetically by Nestle's
allies in the French business establishment, who strove to present
themselves as the upholders of transparency and the rule of law, while
stigmatising the Agnelli camp as exponents of dubious double-dealing.
Intentionally or not, support from such influential market operators can
only serve to entrench the legitimacy of regulatory reform. At the very
least, the Perrier affair seems likely to become a benchmark against which
the conduct of future takeover battles will be judged.
That said, the French market for corporate control is still a long way from
the standards of openness of the Anglo-Saxon world. Not only does state
ownership envelop a wide swathe of the productive economy, but
publicly-quoted companies remain better protected against takeover than
their Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Extensive cross-shareholdings encourage
corporate solidarity against external attack, while regulatory reform has
yet to eliminate a number of poison pill devices.
More than in any other European country, the system is bound together by the
cultural affinities of a powerful technocratic elite. Straddling the
commanding heights of the public and private sectors, its members still
possess a formidable capacity to coalesce in support of the perceived
national interest - above all, when 'strategic' industries are at stake.
That the government did not seek to intervene directly to keep Perrier in
French hands owes much to the fact that powerful members of the elite
favoured its acquisition by Nestle. Significantly, when the Agnellis'
opponents were casting around for white knights, they specifically excluded
US soft drinks companies including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo on the grounds that
they would not be considered 'legitimate' bidders in France.
Equally, few knowledgeable observers in Paris doubt that if an external
threat were posed to the independence of a blue-chip company with an
influential chairman - such as BSN - strenuous efforts would be made to
arrange a 'French solution'.
How far they would succeed, however, is an open question. The efficacy of
such defences is being gradually eroded by time and the logic of the
government's own policies. It can no longer legally block takeovers by
bidders from other EC countries, while its ability to influence state-owned
companies will diminish, as their need for fresh capital forces
privatisation.
Perhaps the most important agent of change, however, is the government's
declared ambition to transform Paris into a truly international capital
market and a more important source of finance for French industry. That will
depend heavily on attracting foreign investors, who are unlikely to
participate enthusiastically if they suspect that protection of local vested
interests remains a priority.
These divergent impulses are bound to create tensions and unpredictability.
The many peculiar features of the Perrier battle make it an imperfect test
of current French attitudes. Perhaps the safest verdict is that France is a
less open country than the Agnellis hoped when the affair began, but less
closed than they believed when it ended.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PERRIER'S SPARKLING SETTLEMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nestle and Suez to increase offer for Perrier from FFr1,475 to FFR1,700
per shar.
Exor and Societe Gererale agree to sell their Perrier holdings to
Nestle-Suez at the new bid price.
Ifint, an Agnelli investment company which holds 39.8% of Exor, agrees
to bid jointly with BSN for Exor at FFr1,450 per share. Ifint to pay for
first 51% of shares tendered, with the rest divided between Ifint and
BSN in ratio of nine to one.
Exor and Societe Generale to pay Saint Louis, an Agnelli ally, FFR153bn
plus interest for its Perrier stake and FFr210m for agreeing not to
pursue court appeal.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Arts: Digging for Fire - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rough Magic is a youngish Irish company, attractive and evidently very
close-knit. The play they have brought from the Dublin Theatre Festival to
the Bush is by one of their artistic directors, Declan Hughes, and directed
by the other, Lynne Parker, and two of the actors here are founder-members.
It would be easy to believe that each of the other five roles was written
with its performer specifically in mind. They all play to one another with
the beady-eyed easiness of old friends, which forbids social show-offery but
does not preclude moments of asperity - just what Digging for Fire requires.
The play is two familiar plays at once: the Reunion of College Chums that
goes sour with home truths (sourer as the night wears on and they get
drunker), and the Deflating of Heroic Pretensions (an Irish favourite since
Playboy of the Western World, though there are many European versions of
it). The fluent naturalism of the writing and playing almost disguises the
schematic character-list - the host couple, doctor and teacher, whose
professional security has not extinguished old yearnings for something less
trammelled; a brittle media pair, he in advertising and she a TV presenter;
a vine-leaves-in-his-hair loose cannon, the statutory gay, and a fey but
sensible young woman (Pom Boyd, greatly appealing) whose HIV-positivity is
declared early but never explained.
We should have heard more about that, for the revelations we did get were
dull stuff - conventional adulteries, and the falsity of a claim to literary
fame. Various characters became convincingly cross, disabused or bitter as
circumstances dictated, even with some vehemence, but no real blood was
spilt; they were all too tame and nice for that. Hughes's writing for the
detached gay (Peter Hanly) and the snuffed-out Dionysus (Darragh Kelly) left
them bloodless too, visually well-cast but denied any interesting griefs to
test them.
How Arthur Riordan's advertising-chap could be (as advertised) so
successfully randy remained a mystery; but Gina Moxley captures her
telly-type with prickly assurance, and Sean Kearns makes a decent, solid
blunderer of the doctor-host. For his dispiritedly romantic wife Jane
Brennan provides continual subtleties, wry and engagingly honest: this is an
actress who could shoulder a whole TV series with aplomb.
The glum unspoken message of this Irish play seems to be that there's
nothing Irish left among the trendy middle-class in Dublin. Many a Londoner
might know every one of these people and the reunion-hosts' highly visible
books - mostly paperbacks - emphasise the cosmopolitan point: Kundera of
course, both the latest Martin Amises (a bit excessive?), the complete
Nathanael West, drugs-and-pathology studies, Christopher Hitchens - instead
of Conor Cruise O'Brien - and a token, glossily-illustrated The Irish
Village. In Dublin, the shock of painful recognition was probably sharper
than anything we can feel.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Management: Time for action in affairs of the heart - How to
arrest potential cardiac problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is killing us these days? As nations become more developed and people
more sedentary and dependent on technology, they become more prone to the
diseases of affluence.
Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the developed world.
Heart attacks and sudden death often occur without warning in people with no
previous history of heart trouble. According to the World Health
Organisation, of the 11m deaths a year in the west, a third are due to heart
disease and strokes.
Business people may be at high risk without realising it. Indeed, many might
appear to be deliberately courting heart disease.
When you set your long-term business plan, is your main aim simply to avoid
going bankrupt? Obviously not. As business leaders, you set many goals for
the company and keep a constant watch on the profit margin. Your health
demands a similar approach.
The four factors over which you can have some control and which affect your
chances of heart disease are smoking, high blood pressure, high blood
cholesterol and excess weight. Each will be discussed in future Health
Checks
The heart is a small muscular organ, about the size of your fist weighing
between 10 and 16 ounces. While you are reading this column, at rest, it is
pumping five litres of blood a minute (200m litres of blood in a 75-year
lifetime) to all organs of your body, carrying with it, among other critical
substances, oxygen, glucose and cholesterol.
While you are running for an aircraft at Heathrow or are stressed at a board
meeting, the heart responds by increasing the rate and pumping capacity up
to 22 litres a minute. Attempts to duplicate this natural miracle by
man-made means and artificial hearts have defied the best minds in medicine.
To perform its daunting tasks, your heart needs attention now, before it
starts telling you that things are going wrong.
The coronary arteries - small calibre vessels that carry the heart's own
blood supply - will not develop symptoms until they are 75 per cent blocked.
But once the arteries are blocked and producing symptoms - such as angina -
your options are already severely limited.
Most businessmen depend on three myths to avoid taking action.
The first is that to get the benefits of health and fitness, you need to
become fanatical - jogging at lunchtime and so on. In fact, becoming
obsessed with anything (including exercise) is unhealthy. Go for balance
that lasts.
The second great myth is that optimistic feeling that disease always happens
to the other guy. We are all susceptible.
Finally, there is a common complaint that taking care of yourself is pure
drudgery: eating rabbit food, cutting out all alcohol, sweets, coffee and
rice food. Contrary to popular myth, you can have your cake and eat it too.
But you will need to have enough information to make intelligent decisions
regarding your health.
However, there are no magic wands, pills, special weekends, or vacations
when you will be able to 'clean it all up'. Building up a health and fitness
reserve will take time and energy, but is your best investment.
The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Total of overseas voters falls 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of overseas electors has fallen by more than 10 per cent since
last year in spite of a Pounds 750,000 government campaign encouraging
Britons abroad to vote.
Labour said the figures, down from 34,454 to 30,899, were a failure for the
Conservatives, the main beneficiaries of the overseas vote. About 2.5m
Britons living overseas are eligible to vote.
Labour said: 'The Conservatives spent Pounds 750,000 of public money and
Pounds 60,000 of their own pursuing overseas voters and the result is still
a drop in the number registering.'
The Conservative party denied that the fall represented a failure, saying
that the government advertising campaign was to publicise changes in the law
which allowed more Britons abroad to register.
Mr David Smith, director of Conservatives Abroad, which was set up to
recruit financial and electoral support among overseas electors, said: 'We
think 70 to 80 per cent of those who have registered will vote for us.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELFAST, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), yesterday
ruled out a formal post-election pact with any of the main UK parties in the
event of a hung parliament.
Speaking in Belfast at the launch of his party's manifesto, he welcomed Mr
John Major's recent statement that there would be no coalition government.
However, his comments did not rule out an informal arrangement between the
UUP and the Tories.
If there was a hung parliament, Mr Molyneaux said, the UUP would take into
account what was said in the Queen's Speech by the new government on policy
issues regarding Northern Ireland, the economy and the Maastricht Treaty.
Mr Molyneaux attacked the Liberal Democrats' ambition of participating in a
coalition government. 'It is unacceptable that a rump of a party could be
dictating the future of the UK,' he said, adding that his party was not
'making any demands.' But he warned that 'whoever forms the government knows
where we stand and will have to take care not to alienate us'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday ruled out taking part
in any coalition government which relied on the support of Ulster Unionists.
He said it would jeopardise progress the government had made towards peace
in the province.
Mr Jim Nicholson, UUP chairman, said his party wanted devolution for Ulster
and 'would not countenance a devolved structure in Scotland only'. He added:
'We would be happy to be the guinea-pigs for new regional devolution
arrangements - we, after all, have the most experience in this'. He said
that the UUP - which had nine MPs in the last parliament - would support a
Labour administration if its policies were acceptable.
Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said he may 'make public' a recent
letter he had received from Mr Major. He said it showed a 'much more
positive response' to Unionist demands for security in Ulster to be stepped
up.
The UUP manifesto calls for:
Restoration of the rule of law through the destruction of higher echelons
within terrorist organisations.
A clearly defined union, with the Queen in parliament remaining supreme.
Removal of the Irish Republic's claim to Northern Ireland and an end to the
Anglo-Irish agreement.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many candidates are fondly recalling the days of Mrs Thatcher when elections
were held in late spring or early summer. Today the cold is a factor.
Andrew Pearce, the former Euro-MP trying to hold Ellesmere Port and Neston
for the Tories, is struggling on in a dark blue suit without an overcoat to
try to project the right image. One pensioner recoiled two feet, startled as
he shook Pearce's frozen hand.
'It's like doctors examining patients. You shouldn't do it with cold hands
in case you make them jump,' Pearce said.
He is developing a technique of running between front doors to keep his
circulation going, with his right hand thrust inside his trouser pocket to
soften its impact on unsuspecting voters.
Then there is the dark. Lynda Chalker recalls that she was once dragged
inside a house by a man when canvassing alone in London in her youth. 'I
used my knee and nails and fought my way out.' Now she has a man with her
when canvassing at night. But many people will not open their front doors to
anyone much after 8pm.
Like most candidates, she is looking forward to summertime to begin at the
weekend. Then, of course, the weather could change for the worse. There has
not been much snow so far.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Mellor's gap - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives will have to be more careful with their arithmetic. David
Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, repeated again yesterday the
charge that John Smith's shadow Budget would represent 'the largest ever
increase in taxation' during peacetime. He was wrong.
The Treasury's own figures show that the Pounds 6.8bn which would be raised
in a full year by Mr Smith's plan to abolish the National Insurance ceiling
and introduce a new 50p top rate of income tax is comfortably below the
equivalent increase raised by Sir Geoffrey Howe in his 1981 Budget.
Sir Geoffrey's decision to respond to the 1980-81 recession with a swingeing
cut in public borrowing added Pounds 4.3bn (relative to an indexed tax base)
to revenues. In today's prices that would amount to Pounds 7.9bn. The
Conservatives might recall that Sir Geoffrey's package was judged
subsequently to have been the turning point for the economic success of the
1980s.

Paddy Ashdown's energetic election tour is in danger of becoming a trifle

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One man who could be much in demand should Labour form the next government
is Lord Richard of Ammanford QC. Still perhaps best known as Ivor Richard,
he is being mentioned as a possible Labour leader in the upper house should
the present incumbent, the 75-year-old Lord Cledwyn, wish to give way. He is
also well in the running for the Lord Chancellorship, where Lord Mackay of
Clashfern would not survive a change of regime. There is also talk of his
returning to Brussels as Britain's senior commissioner at the European
Community.
So what is Richard doing during the election? He says he is getting on with
his legal work and has written to Jack Cunningham, who is organising the
Labour campaign, offering his services. Nothing is yet fixed, but Richard is
likely to be seen helping Alf Dubs to fight the marginal seat of Battersea.
Richard was MP for nearby Barons Court from 1964 to 1974. Harold Wilson then
made him Britain's permanent representative at the United Nations, after
which he had what may turn out to be a first spell as commissioner in
Brussels. Now aged 60, he is clearly open to offers, but talk of Brussels
surprised him.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: No change on the bunometer - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
They take their politics seriously in the West Country. Not content to wait
for the outcome of the general election, voters in the Somerset seaside
resort of Minehead are expressing their political preferences daily through
purchases at the local baker's.
Steve Wells, proprietor of the Wheatsheaf Bakery in The Parade, is baking
and selling buns with icing to match the colours of the political parties
and recording purchasers' preferences through a bunometer in the shop
window.
The results of the political bun-fight are unequivocal. Of the 250 buns sold
since baking started on Saturday, 51 per cent have been blue, 37 per cent
yellow and 12 per cent red.
Psephologists might note that the bun breakdown exactly reflects the running
order in the constituency at the last general election. Minehead lies within
defence secretary Tom King's safe Conservative seat of Bridgewater: the
turnout for the blue buns is identical to the 51 per cent vote for King in
1987. The SDP Alliance polled 30 per cent that year, and Labour 18 per cent.
Flavour cannot be a factor since, apart from the colour of the icing, all
the buns are the same.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Campaign diplomacy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If foreign policy determined the outcome of elections, the Conservatives
would be assured of victory. You have merely to shut your eyes and think of
Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd working in tandem to protect our interests
against the predatory and insane collection of foreigners that populates the
globe. Comforting, is it not? No? Even if you cannot quite believe in Mr
Major as, shall we say, Palmerston or Disraeli, Mr Hurd must appear on any
list of first-rate foreign secretaries. It is at the very least reassuring.
It should be a strong election sell. The Labour party cannot match it. This
is not a comment on the diplomatic or personal qualities of Mr Neil Kinnock
or Mr Gerald Kaufman. For all we know of their behaviour, should they reach
office the former may be the Attlee and the latter the Bevin of the 1990s,
although I suspect that he himself would doubt that. Unfortunately for
Labour, neither looks the part. Neither has the necessary experience. On
this issue, their images are subsumed by those of the prime minister and Mr
Hurd. For the duration of the campaign, the government's control of foreign
affairs must be counted a Conservative asset.
The Tories have not always deserved such public confidence. Take just two
post-1945 examples. Africa and Europe have frequently divided the party, to
the detriment of the national interest. It is 30 years since Lord Salisbury
called the then colonial secretary, Mr Iain Macleod, 'too clever by half'
for his cunning constitutional ploys during the process of withdrawal from
Britain's African colonies. The phrase nearly destroyed the career of a man
who is often cited as a role model by Mr Major. In the 1960s the
Conservative right, which took first the Kenya settlers' side and later that
of the white South Africans, was bitterly critical of the Tory left's
de-colonisers. It derided the then Mr Harold Macmillan, whose 'wind of
change' speech filled the sails of the anti-apartheid movement.
Between 1983 and 1991 the Tories were nearly destroyed by squabbles over
Europe. Arguments about Britain's stance within the Community led to the
resignations of Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe. The long-running
schism - 'real Corn Law stuff', as one senior minister put it at the time -
eventually brought Mrs Margaret Thatcher down. This followed a challenge
from Mr Michael Heseltine, whose celebrated departure from Mrs Thatcher's
cabinet was precipitated by a European issue.
Mrs Thatcher aimed to keep Britain in what she hoped would be a special
relationship with the US. No harm in that. All her post-1945 predecessors,
Labour and Conservative alike, had done the same. But her perception of the
EC was distorted by suspicion of the motives of the Brussels administration.
She did not trust the Germans, and had little time for the French. She was
at heart an English nationalist. No doubt she still is.
Initially, she was also wrong about South Africa. She opposed sanctions at a
time when they were a necessary weapon against apartheid. She was lucky: her
support won the trust of the Afrikaners. That enabled her to be useful in
facilitating the end-game. But you could not honestly conclude that in the
period 1979-90 the principal strands of foreign policy were safe in the Tory
government's hands.
Nor is it possible to be sure that the Tories will get Europe right if they
stay in office. They still aspire to win the election, but on present form
they can only hope to do so as either the largest party in a hung parliament
or by a very slim overall majority. In that circumstance, the legislation
following the Maastricht treaty - a new 'Europe Act' - might be difficult to
get through the Commons. A small handful of Thatcherite Europhobes could
easily destabilise the proceedings. The never-ending post-war argument,
which first kept us out of the EC and then on the periphery of its affairs,
would be resumed.
Yesterday the Conservatives edged a little towards Mrs Thatcher's side of
this argument, partly to disadvantage Labour and partly in anticipation of a
renewed debate after April 9. 'Conservatives favour a free enterprise and
outward-looking Europe,' said Mr Hurd. 'Labour . . . embraces the Community
as a new source of regulation . . .' The Social Charter, which the
Conservatives refused to accept, would 'destroy British jobs'. He questioned
Labour's judgment on this and other issues, such as nuclear deterrence, EC
membership, South Africa and the single market.
It is fair political discourse, and it might do well in an election campaign
in another age. The greatness or otherwise of Britain is ever a saloon-bar
topic, although I suspect less so now than, say, in the aftermath of the
Falklands or Gulf wars. The contest due to be settled on April 9 is,
however, about domestic concerns, such as the recession, education, and
health. Turn away from that map of Europe: it is through the sickbeds of
England that Labour proposes to march to victory.

MRS Margaret Thatcher said in Scotland yesterday that she did not believe
Scots would abandon the union of the United Kingdom by choosing
independence. She said: 'The union has done wonderful things for us all over
the centuries. People may talk about breaking it but when it really comes to
the point they will realise that you don't jettison something that has
brought the world so much.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR and the Conservatives are collaborating in a 'tax is bad' campaign
which will hinder future social provision by the government, Mr Des Wilson,
the Liberal Democrats' campaign director, complained last night.
Liberal Democrats backed a one penny increase in the basic rate of income
tax to fund Pounds 2bn extra spending on education because 'it's the best
investment we can make', he said in a speech in Aylesbury.

BRITAIN'S economy was poised to come out of recession 'in the right way'
with low inflation, a stable exchange rate and a continuing flow of inward
investment, Mr John Major said last night, Ivor Owen writes.
The prime minister gave an upbeat assessment of prospects for the economy
and for the Conservatives' chances of securing a fourth successive general
election victory when interviewed on BBC's Newsnight programme.
Mr Major said most economists agreed with the government's judgment that
Britain's annual inflation rate would be less than 4 per cent next year, and
would continue to fall.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pollsters nervous over opinion fluctuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPREAD in opinion polls from a Labour lead of five percentage points to
a similar Conservative lead is worrying for pollsters nervous about their
reputations, and puzzling to politicians and public alike.
In fact, the apparently wide variation in results is not as big as it seems.
During the 1987 campaign, the Tory lead ranged from four to 18 points, but
as the lead itself did not change much less attention was paid to the
variation.
This time the range is 10 points, but because the lead has changed and the
two main parties are so evenly balanced, the differences in results are much
more obvious.
Most vulnerable to criticism is the Harris Research Centre, which gave the
Tories a five-point lead in yesterday's Daily Express - out of line with
most weekend polls - and Labour a four-point lead in a poll for ITN last
night.
Mr Robert Waller, Harris research director, said: 'We do not think there has
been a big shift of opinion. But most polls are based on interviews done
during the week and our Express interviews were over the weekend. This could
have made a difference.' The disparity between the two polls was not as
great as it first seemed, given the accepted error range of three to four
percentage points, he said.
Weekend polling, especially in the home, is more likely to find commuters
and professional people, and could therefore favour the Tories. Another
factor in the disparity might be that the poll for ITN was based on more
than 2,000 interviews - about twice the number for the Express poll.
Most published polls assess the state of the parties across the whole of
Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, which has a different party structure.
Five companies - Gallup, NOP, Mori, Harris and ICM - poll regularly using
face-to-face interviews. All are members of the Association of Professional
Opinion Polling Organisations, which lays down the ground rules.
Polls use the quota system, which ensures that interviewees are a
representative demographic sample of a constituency, with divisions by sex,
class and age. The results are weighted from experience to offset any
limitations.
National polls conducted by in-home interviews by Harris and others aim for
between 1,000 and 1,500 interviewees in 100 constituencies or sampling
points, selected to give an accurate political reflection of the country as
a whole.
ICM favours in-street interviewing in town and city centres and uses 54
sampling points. Some pollsters use both techniques and vary interviews
between day and evening, and some do two-day polling. Audience Selection
specialises in telephone polls.
What divides the pollsters is the order in which questions are put. Mr Bob
Worcester, chairman of Mori and the doyen of British pollsters, argues that
the main question of voting intention should be put first, whereas Gallup
has always put it after 'warm-up questions' on the government's record and
standing of party leaders.
National polls are regarded as much more reliable than regional or
constituency ones, as there is more information to assemble a national
profile. Regular interviewers are trained - none of the organisations is
employing extra election staff.
Except in 1970, when all but one of the final polls picked the wrong winner,
the record in recent general elections has been a good. There is already
nervousness that this time the pollsters could find themselves publishing an
accurate poll but still picking the wrong winner.
'It is a bit of a nightmare,' said Mr Bob Wybrow, Gallup's polling director.
'But if there is a hung parliament there could be another election by
November and we'd cry all the way to the bank.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Skilled workers bolster Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE shift to Labour by the skilled working classes has been the driving
force behind the rebound in its support since 1987, an opinion poll
suggested last night.
The Harris poll for ITN gave Labour a four-point overall lead, with its
support at 42 per cent, the Conservatives at 38 per cent and the Liberal
Democrats at 16 per cent. That represents a swing of 7.5 per cent since the
last general election.
But the survey found that among the skilled working classes - the so-called
C2s - the swing had been 10 per cent since 1987. Conservative support had
fallen from 42 to 33 per cent, while Labour's share had jumped from 35 to 47
per cent, the survey indicated.
The group, now the central target of the Conservatives' onslaught against
Labour's tax and spending plans, accounted for about 25 per cent of all
voters and is likely to be the most important 'swing' group on April 9.
But the Harris survey shows that the main preoccupations of the C2s are the
quality of public services such as health and education and rising
unemployment, rather than personal tax bills. This suggests that the careful
pitch of Mr John Smith's Budget in offering small gains to the group has
helped neutralise the Conservative attack.
But there was encouragement in the poll for those Conservative strategists
who argue that the election is far from decided. It indicated that at least
4m voters have yet to make up their minds on which way to vote.
The Conservatives have secured a 4 per cent increase in their support in
Scotland, according to an ICM/Scotsman poll.
The figures (with findings for a March 7 poll in brackets) were:
Conservatives 22 per cent (18 per cent), Labour 41 per cent (42 per cent),
SNP 27 per cent (28 per cent), Liberal Democrats 9 per cent (11 per cent),
Others 2 per cent (1 per cent).
ICM interviewed 1,052 adults in 52 constituencies throughout Scotland on
Sunday and Monday.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A third of electorate remains undecided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1992 general election is being fought amid a level of indecision by
voters not seen since at least the 1970s, according to opinion poll data
collected during the first two weeks of the campaign.
A third of voters are 'floating', according to figures compiled by the Mori
opinion polling organisation for The Sunday Times. That is a significantly
higher proportion than at the same period in either the 1983 or 1987
elections.
There are also exceptionally large numbers of 'switchers' in this campaign;
7m voters are thought to have changed allegiance during the first week of
the campaign; twice as many as during the same part of the 1987 campaign.
The size of the floating vote and the number of switchers are factors which
help to explain the volatility of headline opinion polls.
The figures underline how open the election contest remains, but there are
signs that the 'floating voters' offer better territory for Labour or for
the Liberal Democrats than for the Conservatives.
Mori polling for BBC TV's On the Record shows that the three issues chosen
by floating voters as most important are unemployment, health, and
education. All three are seen as safer territory for Labour.
The Tories' focus on taxation in the first week of the campaign appears to
have made little headway on floating voters.
A third said that Labour's Budget was the best for Britain, compared with 29
per cent who favoured the government's March 10 Budget.
'The Tories are being judged on their record, rather than their promises,'
said Mr Brian Gosschalk, director of political research at Mori.
The high number of floating voters reflects the long-running decline in the
numbers of voters with fixed loyalties; a trend which explains ever-larger
swings in by-election results since the 1970s.
There is no one definition of a floating voter. Mori uses those saying they
may change their minds plus the numbers of undecideds.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock switches focus to industrial policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK switched his focus from Labour's recovery package yesterday
to a broader exposition of the party's longer-term prospectus for building
stable industrial growth.
In a speech to business people in Manchester, the Labour leader stressed
that a vibrant manufacturing sector was 'a sure foundation' for a prosperous
service sector and the 'lifeblood' of financial services.
Drawing on the experiences of the Japanese banking sector and of the City,
Mr Kinnock claimed that Britain's falling share of international lending,
from 27 per cent in 1980 to 18.4 per cent in 1990, was a direct consequence
of industrial decline. 'The manufacturing and service sectors share the same
destiny,' he said.
Mr Kinnock said the task of government was to create 'an economically secure
and socially responsible environment within which enterprise can thrive and
generate employment and wealth'. This involved two broad tasks: creating a
stable macroeconomic environment, and sustaining a 'strong and adaptable'
supply-side policy.
He argued that excessive deregulation of the financial sector had
jeopardised long-term growth by failing to establish sound credit
management. Labour's solution was to use credit controls, based on
reserve:asset ratios in the banking sector. The Labour leader also pledged:
Takeovers would require predator companies to prove their proposals are in
the public interest. Labour would use powers under the Industry Act to
ensure that short-term interests did not inhibit long-term investment
strategies.
Measures to ensure that British innovations are developed in the UK.
Strenuous efforts to build up the infrastructure and transport system,
drawing where necessary on privatesector finance.
Mr Kinnock said employers who dedicated less than 0.5 per cent of payroll to
training would be obliged to contribute to a national skills fund. Good
employers already spent more than that on training and would be unaffected
by the levy, he said. 'But the 20 per cent of employers who employ 50 per
cent of the labour force and who do no training . . . will have to pay their
fair share.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / County Hall deal is 'a gamble,' says buyer: Price agreed for
former home of GLC is Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHIRAYAMA Corporation, a Japanese property company, said yesterday that its
decision to pay Pounds 60m for County Hall, former headquarters of the
Greater London Council, was 'a gamble'. But the family-owned company said it
was confident that 'whatever happens, London will be the centre of Europe'.
The company said that Mr Takashi Shirayama, its 55-year-old president, was
fond of a Chinese saying advising that one should test one's luck at least
once in a lifetime.
Mr Shirayama has a taste for things European. He drives a Mercedes-Benz,
enjoys French wine and says he appreciates the respect with which his
little-known company has been treated in London.
The building next to Westminster Bridge was the seat of London local
government for more than 50 years until the GLC, by then the biggest local
authority in Europe, was abolished in 1986. The County Hall complex has been
virtually empty since the departure of the Inner London Education Authority
in 1990.
The London School of Economics was widely tipped to take over County Hall
until the Shirayama deal was signed in Osaka on Monday by the London
Residuary Body, the organisation set up by the government to dispose of GLC
assets. Labour has threatened to overturn the Shirayama deal if it comes to
power on the ground that the building should be reserved for public uses.
Shirayama intends to turn part of the building next to Westminster Bridge
into a hotel and part into luxury flats and conference facilities. The
Osaka-based company, whose wealth is derived from extensive landholdings
near the city, bought a hotel in Spain for Pounds 48m three years ago and
has decorated its health clubs in Japan with British bricks and Spanish
tiles.
Shirayama was founded in 1921 and has about 100 full-time employees and
1,200 part-timers working behind the counters at its fast-food restaurants
and health clubs. The company, which is small compared with many other
Japanese property enterprises, runs a MacDonald's burger franchise in Osaka
and a golf driving range.
Apart from the Madrid hotel, the only other overseas investment is a Dollars
70m (Pounds 40.4m) golf resort under construction on Rota Island, near Guam,
a popular Pacific holiday destination for Japanese families. The company
reported income of Y2.5bn (Pounds 10.9m) for the 12 months to the end of
March last year.
The company originated in a money-lending business dating back to the 1800s.
Under Mr Shirayama, who is a former employee of Dentsu, the Japanese
advertising agency, the company has gradually expanded its interests.
Shirayama joined 27 other Japanese companies, including property offshoots
of Mitsubishi Trust Bank, in a bid for County Hall in 1990. The consortium
collapsed after the Mitsubishi companies withdrew.

ISC TECHNOLOGIES LTD AND ANOTHER v GUERIN AND OTHERS
Chancery Division: Mr Justice Hoffmann:
March 17 1992
THE TIME for examining the appropriateness of an English forum on an
application to set aside leave for service of a writ abroad, is when leave
was granted, and not when the application to set aside is heard, unless
further evidence or subsequent events throw light on what should have been
relevant considerations at the time. And accordingly, irrespective of
whether judgment has been entered against most of the original defendants
and those remaining may not be worth pursuing, leave will be upheld if it
was properly granted in that at the time England was the appropriate forum
for trial of the action and the other requirements for service abroad were
satisfied.
Mr Justice Hoffmann so held when refusing an application by Mr Stuart
Pindell, the 10th defendant to an action by ISC Technologies Ltd and ISC
London Ltd against Mr James Howard Guerin and others, to set aside an order
by Master Barratt giving leave to serve proceedings on him in Pennsylvania.
HIS LORDSHIP said that the plaintiffs were English companies whose principal
business was selling arms to foreign countries. They were subsidiaries of
International Signal and Control Group plc (ISC) which in 1987 merged with
Ferranti plc. Mr Guerin was founder and executive chairman of ISC.
The plaintiffs claimed that between 1983 and 1989, Mr Guerin and other
persons in the ISC group conspired to commit a complex fraud. They created
fictitious contracts for the sale of arms to foreign countries, and
fictitious contacts for the purchase of stocks and services to enable them
to perform the sale contracts.
They represented to the companies' accountants, auditors, solicitors and
bankers that the contracts were genuine and thereby falsely inflated the
profits which ISC appeared to be earning.
That enabled Mr Guerin to deceive Ferranti into agreeing to a merger upon
advantageous terms.
They also made payments out of the companies' funds to Panamanian
corporations controlled by Mr Guerin on the pretext that they were payments
to suppliers. More than Dollars 180m of the companies' funds was diverted to
the use of Mr Guerin and his associates.
The action was originally commenced against nine defendants: Mr Guerin,
three of his associates and five Panamanian companies which Mr Guerin was
alleged to have controlled. By the end of June 1990, final judgment had been
entered against all except two.
On July 25 1990, Master Barratt gave leave under RSC Order 11 for service of
proceedings on Mr Pindell out of the jurisdiction. Mr Pindell now applied
under RSC Order 12 rule 8 to set the order aside.
Mr Pindell was an ISC director until 1986. He was responsible for securing
and negotiating major contracts for international arms sales.
The principal allegation against him was that he knowingly participated in a
fraudulent representation that a contract dated May 12 1984 had been
concluded for the sale of missiles to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when
there had been no such contract.
He was also alleged to have participated in the pretence that goods and
services were being ordered to enable the plaintiffs to perform the
contract, and to have given the auditors a false version of a genuine
contract between ISC and the UAE in 1986.
The relief sought against Mr Pindell was account and restitution, damages
and account of profits.
The requirements for leave under RSC Order 11 were that the plaintiff had a
'good arguable case'; the claim came within the 'letter and spirit' of the
sub-paragraph relied upon; and England was 'the forum in which the case can
most suitably be tried in the interests of all the parties and for the ends
of justice'.
As to whether the claims fell within the paragraphs of Order 11 rule 1(1),
the claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation fell within (f)
(action founded on tort within the jurisdiction); and the restitutionary
claims came within (c) (necessary or proper party to the action).
The next question was whether the plaintiffs had a sufficient case on the
merits.
Their case on the affidavits was that Mr Pindell was primarily responsible
for negotiation of contracts with the UAE. He represented that the 1984
contract had been signed when, in fact, it had not. He gave the auditors a
version of the 1986 contract appearing to contain clauses dealing with the
1984 contract and a payment which was said to have been made under it, when,
in fact, no such provisions appeared in the real contract. He also signed
amendments to two fictitious purchase contracts, and there was material to
suggest he was involved in pretended implementation of the 1984 contract.
Mr Pindell's affidavit covered in detail the whole history of his
association with the plaintiffs and the subtle intricacies of his
negotiation of the 1984 and 1986 arms contracts with the UAE. His
participation in many of the events which surrounded the production of those
now admittedly bogus documents was uncontradicted. All that remained in
issue was his degree of participation and state of knowledge.
Mr Crystal for Mr Pindell submitted that his affidavit, if believed, would
exonerate him.
That was correct. On the other hand, if he was disbelieved, he would be held
liable.
The plaintiff's case was sufficiently strong (assuming England to be the
appropriate forum) to justify subjecting Mr Pindell to proceedings within
the jurisdiction.
When the action was commenced, England was plainly the appropriate forum.
The fraud was committed here and the facts had no strong connection with any
other jurisdiction. The plaintiffs were English companies and the original
defendants resided in diverse jurisdictions, including three of the United
States.
Since then, proceedings against all but two of the original defendants had
been terminated by judgment. For the purposes of the application, when must
the appropriateness of an English forum be examined?
Mr Crystal said the court should look at the position today. He said an
application to set aside leave under RSC Order 12, rule 8 was a rehearing of
the application for leave and the exercise of a fresh discretion. It should
therefore take into account what had since happened.
That was not accepted. The present application was to discharge the master's
order. The question was therefore whether that order was rightly made when
it was made. The court could receive evidence not before the master, and
subsequent events might throw light on what should have been relevant
considerations at the time. But leave which was rightly given should be not
discharged simply because circumstances had changed.
The alleged fraud was committed in England on English companies. It had
little connection with any other jurisdiction.
In Cordoba Shipping (1984) 2 Lloyds Rep 91, 96 Lord Justice Robert Goff
said: 'If the substance of the alleged tort is committed within a certain
jurisdiction, it is not easy to imagine what other facts would displace the
conclusion that the courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forum.'
What was there in this case to displace such a conclusion?
It was said Mr Pindell resided in Pennsylvania and that it would be hard for
him to have to bear the expense of litigation in England. But that would
almost invariably be the case when leave was given and was not sufficient
answer.
If Mr Pindell came to the UK and participated in a fraud on English
companies, it could not be unfair for him to have to defend his actions
here. If the claim turned out to be ill-founded, he would be able to recover
his costs, and in that respect was better off than in his home jurisdiction.
The prima facie conclusion to which Lord Justice Robert Goff referred was
not displaced. England was the appropriate forum. The master was right to
grant leave. The summons was dismissed.
For Mr Pindell: Michael Crystal QC and Charles Hollander (Clyde &amp; Co).
For the plaintiffs: David Oliver QC and John Nicholls (Herbert Smith).

FT  25 MAR 92 / Working mothers seek role as main breadwinner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of working mothers would welcome the chance to become the
main breadwinner of the family while their partners stayed at home to look
after the children, according to a Mori poll published yesterday.
The mothers surveyed were almost equally split on whether women or men were
better at looking after children. As for housework, 67 per cent thought
chores would not be done if men were in charge.
The survey, carried out for BHS, the retailing chain, and the Working
Mothers Association, a charity, also found the women evenly split on whether
they thought men would be likely to agree to stay at home.
Women wanted their partners to work shorter hours so they could help with
the family. Women would not want to relinquish all domestic responsibilities
even if they were the main breadwinner, the survey found.
The commonest troubles listed by the sample of more than 400 working mothers
were: lack of time for self; still having to do the majority of housework;
high cost of childcare; guilt about leaving child; and difficulty of
attending school events. More than three in four of the sample worked
part-time.
More than four in five thought there should be tax relief on childcare.
The poll, conducted between February 25 and March 2, found that 25 per cent
of the women said they would vote Conservative and 30 per cent said they
would vote Labour.
Almost all respondents thought employers should have more flexible working
hours and provide more part-time work. Job-sharing was favoured by 88 per
cent, while 85 per cent thought employers should provide workplace
nurseries.
BHS employs 15,000 staff, 85 per cent of them women. It has flexible working
and maternity benefits above the standard required by law. It does not have
job-sharing or provide help with childcare, although BHS said the survey
results would be examined 'at board level'.

FT  25 MAR 92 / FT Conference: Packager seeks EC harmonisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HEATED discussion about the packaging industry's response to environmental
pressures took place at the Financial Times conference yesterday, with
several industry representatives claiming consumers misunderstand packaging.
Mr Gerard Pre, packaging development co-ordinator at Nestec, part of the
Swiss Nestle food group, said the industry could not ignore consumer
pressures, however ill informed. 'We have to deal with perceptions and
perceptions become reality,' he said. Mr Pre pleaded for a harmonisation of
environmental initiatives across Europe and said environmental solutions
adopted in one country were often rejected by others.
Mr Michael Samuel, environmental affairs manager at J. Sainsbury, the UK
grocery chain, argued that the proposed European Commission legislation on
packaging waste was 'largely illogical' because it sought to treat packaging
in isolation from the general issue of waste.
He also fiercely criticised the German industry's solution for recovering
and recycling packaging waste.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Insurance Ombudsman's Report: Compensation to complainants
totalled Pounds 5m last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY paid to people who complained to Mr Julian Farrand, the insurance
ombudsman, totalled Pounds 5m last year, he disclosed yesterday. The number
of cases dealt with by his staff rose 64 per cent to 4,334 in the year, and
he said he expected the total to rise to some 5,000 this year.
Cases dealt with were 'the tip of the iceberg,' he continued. There were
13,899 written inquiries last year and 26,048 by telephone.
He said the rise had been caused by the recession, which gave consumers more
incentive to complain, and the arrival of the Financial Services Act, which
has tightened regulation. Complainants were successful in only 32 per cent
of cases.
In the biggest award, of Pounds 500,000, an insurance company queried
whether its policyholder, a woman reported dead while on a visit to Kenya,
had indeed died. A private detective sent to Africa reported that she was
dead, but the company then claimed that she could not have been of
sufficient means to justify covering her life for such a large sum. Mr
Farrand said no question had been asked about her means when she took out
the policy, and called on the company to pay the full Pounds 500,000.
In another case, a salesman was asked to explain why he had sold a life
assurance policy, with no savings element, to an unmarried 18-year-old with
no children who wanted to save. 'The reason I did not attempt to sell a
capital accumulation plan (a 10-year savings plan) is because in February
1988 I was unaware the plan existed,' the salesman said. 'Perhaps if my
training had included the plan, I would have marketed it more often.' The
ombudsman decided the entire sale had been unsuitable.
In another case where the ombudsman found for the complainant, an
independent intermediary had forged his client's signature on a form
allowing him to surrender an endowment policy written in his client's name.
He took the proceeds and disappeared.
The insurance company involved refused to reinstate the endowment because it
said that the signatures were apparently genuine.
The rates by which the insurance company's original decision was revised
varied according to the type of insurance. Only 25 per cent of general
insurance complaints were upheld, while life assurance had a greater rate.
Mr Farrand pointed out that life policies were more complicated than general
insurance. He did not believe the complaints about life insurance indicated
any widespread scandal.
The Securities and Investments Board published the results of its review of
investment retail regulation two weeks ago, recommending that many details
should be made clearer at the point of sale. SIB hopes this will reduce
investor confusion and reduce the number of complaints.
In two thirds of cases, the insurance company's decision was upheld, and the
report includes several examples of dishonest claims.
A pensioner said a breakdown ruined 93lb of meat in his freezer. An
investigation showed that the freezer could hold only about 42lb.
The Investors Compensation Scheme has paid out Pounds 10.8m so far in the
present financial year compared with only Pounds 1.7m in 1990-91, SIB said
yesterday.
SIB believes pay-outs are being affected by the effects of new regulations
and by the recession, which is depriving intermediaries of the commissions
they earn when long-term policies are renewed.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Punch may face the chop next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURVIVAL of a unique remnant of the traditional British sense of humour
 -Punch magazine - depended last night on a last-minute infusion of American
money.
United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express and owner of Punch since
1963, decided yesterday that funding the magazine's losses of more than
Pounds 1m a year was no longer funny and set a closure date of April 8. The
brief stay of execution was designed to see whether anyone wanted to buy the
150-year-old magazine, which rejected all the submissions of Charles Dickens
but encouraged PG Wodehouse.
It was when Mr David Thomas, who is already perilously close to being the
last editor of Punch, was trying desperately to think of appropriately funny
last words from the block, that things became interesting.
'I feel like Fergie,' said Mr Thomas in a reference to the Duchess of York,
who last week announced her separation from the Duke of York. 'Everyone,
including us, criticised everything she did, but we'll all miss her when
she's gone.'
The almost unemployed humorist suddenly had an important message shoved
under his nose.
'An American publisher wants to buy Punch,' the message said.
The assets amount to considerably more than the title. They include Mr Punch
 -the magazine's symbol - a talented team of writers and cartoonists and a
circulation that last year averaged 33,000. The Punch library holds bound
volumes of every issue of the magazine and more than 2,000 original
drawings.
In addition to the American interest, two of the magazine's regular
columnists - Mr Richard Littlejohn and Mr Mitchel Symons - were last night
trying to raise venture capital to keep Punch alive and British, at least on
a monthly basis.
If Punch closed, the greatest losers would be cartoonists. 'It's a tragic
blow for cartoonists,' said Mr Mike Williams, a contributor for 25 years.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Australian Name granted court order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIST of countries in which Names are taking legal action against Lloyd's
of London, the international insurance market, has grown to include
Australia, as well as Canada, the US and the UK.
The Supreme Court of Victoria has granted an interim injunction to Mr Emlyn
Williams, a Melbourne anaesthetist, preventing the payment to Lloyd's of the
equivalent of Pounds 58,000 from a financial guarantee lodged with National
Australia Bank.
Names are the individuals whose assets provide the insurance market's
capital. More than 600 of the market's 22,400 Names are Australian nationals
with average commitments of ADollars 350,000 (Pounds 155,000).
Mr Geoff Rees, a solicitor acting for Mr Williams, said his client had
already paid the equivalent of Pounds 50,000 after an earlier demand to meet
losses.
Lloyd's claims that the Australian courts have no jurisdiction in the case
on the ground that, according to the terms of Mr Williams' agreement with
his agent, all disputes are to be settled in UK courts.
Mr Williams says the agreement is void because Lloyd's breached various
aspects of Australian law in its dealings with him.
There will be a preliminary hearing on this jurisdictional issue soon,
probably on Friday, and a full hearing in four to six weeks.
In the US, Lloyd's has already won two actions against US Names on the same
issue, although both cases are subject to appeal.
Earlier this month a Chicago court upheld Lloyd's contention that any
dispute must be heard in an English court. Last autumn a judge in Denver
found that US courts had no jurisdiction over similar claims.
The main issue in the Australian case turns on the way in which Mr Williams
was recruited as a Name in 1985.
Mr Williams claims his contract with Lloyd's is void because it breaches the
Australian Corporations Code, which requires that a prospectus should be
registered with the Australian Securities Commission for any 'prescribed
interest'.
No prospectus has ever been lodged by Lloyd's but there have been several
changes of corporate law over recent years in Australia. It is not clear
whether Lloyd's was required to lodge a prospectus at the relevant time.
Mr Williams also says that the members' agents made representations that
were misleading and deceptive under the Australian Trade Practices Act. Mr
Rees emphasised that there was no allegation of fraud against Lloyd's.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Pay rises in sector lowest for eight years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY RISES among engineer-ing companies were at their lowest level for at
least eight years in the quarter to the beginning of March, the Engineering
Employers' Federation reported yesterday.
Its latest survey also showed a resurgence in pay freezes and delayed
settlements.
The median settlement between December and the beginning of this month was
4.3 per cent against 4.5 per cent in the three months to the beginning of
last month and 5 per cent between August and October last year.
The lower quartile fell from 4 per cent to 3.4 per cent and the upper
quartile from 5.1 per cent to 5 per cent.
The figures are the lowest since the federation began collating the present
series in 1984.
Postponements reached a record in January of 13 per cent of all settlements.
Their incidence had been declining from the previous record of just over 12
per cent - reached in June last year - until they reached a low of 8 per
cent in November.
Freezes had also been falling as a proportion of settlements before
November. They reached a peak of 13 per cent in July and fell to 7.5 per
cent in November. In January they approached 9 per cent.
The National Metal Trades Federation, representing foundry and appliance
employers, is today due to sign an agreement with unions for a six-month pay
freeze.
Earlier this month, Asda, the supermarket group, announced that it was
freezing pay for 65,000 employees for a year from June, the normal
settlement date.
Footwear manufacturers are seeking a three-month postponement, although
their proposal has been rejected by employees.
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder privatised in a management buy-out six
years ago, announced 95 white-collar redundancies yesterday.
The cuts, affecting management, technical and clerical staff, arise from a
gap in the order book at the company, which won its last ship-building
contract - for three Type 23 frigates for the Ministry of Defence - in
December 1989.
Unions predicted yesterday that a further 121 jobs would be lost in the
BBC's design and engineering division, which now employs 303 people.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Widespread accounting changes are proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREATMENT in accounts of pensions and leasing require substantial
revision, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales told
the Accounting Standards Board yesterday. It also called for a review of
existing standards on depreciation and consolidated accounts.
The institute said SSAP 24, the standard dealing with pensions, neglected
the balance sheet by concentrating on the profit-and-loss account. It called
for a schedule in the accounts reconciling the balance-sheet figure to the
surplus or deficit of the pension scheme. The institute said SSAP 12, which
covers depreciation, was being misinterpreted. Depreciation should be
treated as the decline in the value of an asset allocated over its period of
use, the institute explained. The idea in the present definition of the
'wearing out' of an asset should be dropped.
It says of SSAPs 1 and 14, which deal with consolidated accounts, that there
may be contradictions between accounting practice and legislation. It calls
for legal changes, especially to deal with associated undertakings.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Societies' mortgage lending falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET MORTGAGE lending by building societies in February was the lowest for
any month since February 1987, according to figures published by the
Building Societies Association yesterday.
The societies lent Pounds 1.02bn net, down from Pounds 1.35bn in January. In
February last year the societies lent Pounds 1.3bn in net advances.
The month is usually the slowest in the year for the housing finance
industry, but the association figures suggest that there were also some
signs of a modest revival in lending activity by the societies in February.
The volume of new loans - those pledged by societies but not yet completed -
rose to Pounds 2.70bn from Pounds 2.26bn in January. That follows a
half-percentage-point cut in the prevailing building society mortgage
interest rate in January.
The association believes, however, that the February figures come too soon
for the effects of the cut to show through in the lending figures.
Societies also fared badly on their savings business. The net monthly inflow
of savings fell from Pounds 293m in January to Pounds 145m last month.

FT  25 MAR 92 / FT Survey of TEC Board Members: Concern over accountability
and freedom to spend funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE URGENT need for the next government to examine its relationship with
Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) is highlighted today in a survey by
the Financial Times.
The survey shows some satisfaction with the progress of Tecs, set up under
the Tories to bring a new impetus to training and enterprise initiatives,
but there is widespread dissatisfaction over the levels of government
funding and the freedom enjoyed by business executives in how they spend
Tecs' money.
The findings call into question how a future government could achieve a
better balance between preserving the public accountability of Tecs, which
spend more than Pounds 2bn of government funds, and giving them the freedom
they believe they need to operate effectively.
The survey of senior managers, union representatives and public-sector
executives is the first to bring together such a wide range of opinion among
men and women appointed to bring a new impetus to training initiatives in
Britain.
There are 82 Tecs in England and Wales and they represent one of the
government's most radical experiments in public-private partnerships.
About 433 of the 882 Tec board members responded to the survey. Sixty-nine
per cent were private-sector executives, who make up the majority on boards,
6 per cent were union representatives and 24 per cent were public-sector
executives. About 3 per cent did not define their status. (Sets of
percentages in the article do not add up to 100 due to rounding up.)
The majority, 88 per cent, had been with their Tec for more than a year, and
85 per cent attended all regular board meetings. More than half devoted up
to three hours a week to Tec work. Over 20 per cent of private-sector
members devoted more than six hours a week.
Tec boards are voluntary and the boards must be made up of senior
individuals from the public and private sectors.
Many Tecs have had difficulty in recruiting personnel of the right calibre,
and the survey finds that about 41 per cent of private-sector members have
limited their commitment to a further two years or less. This might cause
the movement difficulties with a diminished pool of executives to draw on.
Some board members surveyed suggest recruitment to boards from lower
management levels.
On overall satisfaction with the progress of Tecs - most of which have been
operating for little over a year - 26 per cent were very satisfied, 67 per
cent were satisfied and 7 per cent were very dissatisfied. Union
representatives, who would lobby a future Labour government for greater
representation on Tec boards, had a greater proportion of those who were
very dissatisfied.
Nearly 80 per cent said Tecs should be the subject of minor evolutionary
reform, 15 per cent drastic reform and 2 per cent said they should be
abolished. Again union representatives were the most critical.
Tecs have been engaged in tough negotiations over the past two years, since
the first 10 were established, over their desire for greater flexibility in
how they spend the money the government allocates to them to administer and
deliver Youth Training (YT), Employment Training (ET), the scheme for
unemployed adults, and local initiatives including promoting the training of
people in work.
About 95 per cent in the survey said they wanted more flexibility with no
great variation among the three constituencies of board members. One Tec
board member wrote: 'I do not see how businessmen of any calibre will
continue to tolerate the suffocating and un-necessary bureaucracy.'
While 72 per cent said that in principle employers should shoulder more of
the cost of training young people, 82 per cent said the government's
spending was too low, with that view shared by 77 per cent of private-sector
representatives. Spending on YT in England was Pounds 711m in 1991-92 and
for 1992-93 is planned at Pounds 707m. For ET it was Pounds 668m in 1991-92
and is planned at Pounds 659m for 1992-93.
Tecs, asked to comment on the consequences of the cuts in expenditure for
1992-93, gave grave forecasts. Answers included:
The business community will lose confidence in Tecs' ability to deliver.
There will be a crisis of confidence among training providers.
It will endanger our plans to improve quality and deliver more
qualifications.
There will be a severe impact on specialist needs training and our ability
to 'up-skill the workforce'.
Government will only have one more year left before sufficient
disillusionment sets in to produce mass resignations of directors.
Asked about the importance of the two main training programmes a greater
percentage of directors believed YT was 'very important' than said the same
of ET - 64 per cent and 39 per cent respectively. However, 80 per cent said
the promotion of in-company training was very important. Many Tec directors
wrote that one of the main weaknesses of Tecs was the emphasis on YT and ET
and not on people in work, and that Tecs lacked effective communications
with employers.
Tec directors also wanted more government funding for promoting enterprise
activities, which many said was a priority for them. About 73 per cent
wanted to assume all the small business responsibilities of the Department
of Trade and Industry.
Tecs and Chambers of Commerce, which deliver some DTI business
advice-services, have had an uneasy relationship, although some Tecs are
establishing working relationships with chambers. Boards were lukewarm over
whether Tecs should merge with chambers.
Tecs were wary of any moves to introduce greater centralisation into a
movement which they describe as 'bottom-up'. About 69 per cent objected to
any increase in the powers of the National Training Task Force, a voluntary
group of top businessmen which advises government on training issues.
Boards also opposed one of the centrepieces of Labour's proposals for Tecs:
the establishment of a central tripartite body, probably on the lines of the
old Manpower Services Commission which brought together employers, unions
and the public sector to decide on training policy. About 62 per cent of
board members opposed such a move with the private sector most strongly
opposed.
The introduction of a training levy on companies that do not train is
another central plank of Labour's policies. Business is generally perceived
as being opposed to such a move but 37 per cent of business executives were
in favour.
More than 70 per cent of business executives said that if Labour formed the
next government the effect would be either positive (20 per cent) or neutral
(52 per cent) suggesting that they like Labour's promises of restoring cuts
to training budgets, but are not so keen about new statutory controls.
Government wants Tecs to forge close links with education. About 31 per cent
of respondents to the survey said relationships with schools were very
satisfactory, 53 per cent said satisfactory and 15 per cent were
dissatisfied. Public-sector officers were the least unsatisfied.
Tecs are operating a new programme called Investors in People which is a
kitemark awarded to companies assessed to have the right mechanisms in place
to be good training organisations and investors in their workforces. The
number of awards is low at present but 39 per cent of respondents were very
satisfied with progress to date, 51 per cent were satisfied and 36 per cent
were unsatisfied.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Insurers fear spate of air crash claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT spate of air crashes may lead to multi-million-dollar claims to be
paid by aviation insurers, adding to pressure for rate increases.
News of the losses emerged yesterday as aviation insurers gave warnings that
premium rates were still not high enough in spite of recent rate increases.
Rates for aircraft hulls have been increased by between 200 per cent and 300
per cent. Rises of up to 100 per cent for liability risks were imposed last
October and November. Those are the months in which 60 per cent to 75 per
cent of airlines renew their policies.
One aviation insurance broker said that, with losses from 14 serious
accidents so far this year producing claims of about Dollars 170m, this has
been the worst first quarter for aviation insurers for some time. 'It is
looking like a very bad year,' one broker said.
The crash on Sunday night at La Guardia airport, New York, of a USAir Fokker
F28 airliner may leave insurers with losses of more than Dollars 50m.
The aircraft's hull was insured for Dollars 13m, with about a quarter of the
exposure in the London market.
Compensation claims from relatives of the 27 people killed in the accident
might be as much as Dollars 1m per head.
Aviation insurers also expect to pay out more than Dollars 7m as a result of
the crash of a Sudanese cargo aircraft near Athens yesterday. Insurers at
Lloyd's of London may be affected by the claim from Golden Air, which
operated the 27-year-old Boeing 707 aircraft.
Mr Graham Nichols, chairman of the Aviation Insurance Offices Association,
warned yesterday that claims from airline accidents amounted to Pounds 596m
in 1991, well ahead of premium income.
Mr Nichols said that poor underwriting results over the past few years have
led to a reduction in the number of companies underwriting aviation
insurance. Membership of the association has fallen from 25 to 17.

BOSSES waste an average of six working weeks a year doing tasks they should
delegate to secretaries, the Industrial Society, an independent body that
promotes good industrial relations, said yesterday.
Ms Juliet Hepburn, the society's head of secretarial development, said time
wasted cost companies about Pounds 5,700 a year for each senior executive.
Every week, the society said, the average senior executive wastes 150
minutes sifting post, 80 minutes making diary arrangements, 30 minutes
arranging meetings and 15 minutes on travel arrangements.

THE Semiconductor Manufacturers Association said yesterday that whoever won
the election needed to understand the importance of encouraging industry to
invest in training and research and development.
Mr Ken Sanders, managing director of Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor
manufacturer, said that a Conservative plan requiring employers who poached
a worker to compensate the other company for its investment in training did
not address the lack of training in the UK.
He said the government should also encourage wider adoption of common
standards to raise the effectiveness of industry.
The association also noted that it had started to see the first signs of
recovery in the past three to four months, with some members reporting
business levels exceeding those of any period since 1988.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Japan to increase share of car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE carmakers are forecast to increase their share of the UK new car
market to 18 per cent by the end of the decade from 11.8 per cent in 1990,
Kevin Done writes.
According to a report published by Euromotor, part of the the UK-based
Ludvigsen automotive analysts, Ford - the present market leader - will be
the main loser in the UK during the 1990s. The study forecasts that Ford's
share of the UK new car market, which is already under heavy pressure, will
decline to only 21 per cent by 1999 from 25.8 per cent in 1990.
In an overall UK market which is expected to grow to some 2.5m in 1999 from
2.0m in 1990 and 1.6m in 1991, the report suggests that Japanese new car
sales will jump to 450,000 in 1999 from 236,000 in 1990. The report suggests
that Japanese carmakers will have established a total production capacity in
west Europe for 1.19m cars by 1999, most of which will be located in the UK.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Supermarket chains ponder running goods trains on BR tracks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERMARKET giants such as J. Sainsbury and Safeway are among 12 companies
considering running their own rail services under plans to open up British
Rail lines to the private sector.
Speaking in West Bromwich yesterday, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport
secretary, predicted a strong response from the private sector if the
government's planned deregulation of BR went ahead. He warned that Labour's
insistence on maintaining BR's monopoly would jeopardise such innovations.
With the opening of the Channel tunnel, Safeway, the UK's third-largest
supermarket chain, is looking at ways of using the rail network to transport
goods from the Continent to its huge food depot at Bellshill, near Glasgow,
two miles from a proposed Channel tunnel terminal.
Safeway is also considering using the rail network to shift goods from UK
suppliers to their depots and from the depots to the shops. Sir Alistair
Grant, chairman of the Argyle Group, which owns Safeway, has said he wants
his company to be the first big food retailer to make a shift from road to
rail.
Sainsbury, Britain's biggest grocery retailer, is also researching
opportunities to shift parts of its distribution system to rail.
'These are more likely to be in the primary distribution from producers to
the centralised depots than in the secondary distribution from the depots to
our thousands of stores,' the company said.
Last week Stagecoach Holdings, Britain's biggest private bus company,
announced that it would charter BR rolling stock to run an overnight service
from Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh to London.
National Power, the electricity generator, has said it wants to operate coal
trains that run from pits to its power stations.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group wants to operate trains between London and
Edinburgh, using its own staff and trains to offer a standard of service
that would compete with airline shuttles.
Virgin has already expressed an interest in attaching carriages to airport
expresses for its business-class airline passengers.
Other companies that have expressed an interest in operating services on the
BR network include Mr James Sherwood's Orient-Express Hotels, which operates
the luxury Venice-Simplon-Orient Express.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Bank moves to calm nervous money markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has acted to calm nervousness in the money markets about
the possibility of a rise in base rates after the general election.
Its efforts were rewarded yesterday when the three-month interbank rate,
which shadows base rates, closed a fraction lower, indicating the market's
view that the likelihood of an early rise in base rates had diminished.
Nevertheless fears remain in the markets that the new government may be
forced to increase base rates to stop sterling slipping beneath its limit in
the European exchange rate mechanism. The worry has been driven by market
speculation that Labour has a good chance of forming the next government.
Another possibility is a coalition of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
One theory in the markets is that either development would lead to nervous
international investors switching funds out of sterling. As a result, the
new administration might have to increase base rates.
In its routine activities in distributing money to the banking system, the
Bank has attempted to damp speculation about a possible rate rise by handing
out relatively large amounts of money early in the working day. Such
measures have the effect of steering the market to lower rates.
Yesterday, the Bank offered Pounds 709m to the banking system in exchange
for bills in the morning out of a total shortage predicted for the day of
Pounds 750m. Partly because of this, the three-month rate eased by a
sixteenth of a percentage point to close at about 10 3/4 per cent.
Before yesterday's operations, the three-month rate had risen by about three
eighths of a percentage point in three weeks.
The market's anxieties about a rate rise have been focused on the period
after the election, since an increase before that is considered highly
unlikely. Should sterling come under strain in the ERM ahead of the poll,
the Treasury would probably authorise the Bank to intervene on currency
markets to increase its value.
LARGE British companies improved their liquidity in the fourth quarter of
last year, pointing towards modest growth in the second half of this year.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that the
liquidity ratio of big industrial and commercial companies improved to 124
per cent in the fourth quarter of last year from 118 per cent in the third
quarter. The recent figures were well above a low of 61 per cent in the
third quarter of 1990.
The ratio measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of
liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year. It gives an
indication of the ability of businesses to find short-term funds.

FT  25 MAR 92 / US investigators look at BCCI-BNL transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INVESTIGATORS of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)
affair have launched a related inquiry into a series of financial
transactions between BCCI and the branch in Atlanta, Georgia, of Italy's
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
The BNL Atlanta branch made more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of improper
loans to Iraq, nearly half of which were used by President Saddam Hussein to
help finance his development of nuclear missile and chemical weapons
projects. Indictments of former BNL employees and a senior Iraqi central
bank official were lodged last year.
Both BCCI prosecutors and US Congressional investigators are now looking
into a series of money market transactions between BCCI and BNL, which
totalled nearly Dollars 2.5bn between 1986 and 1989.
Documents obtained by the Financial Times show dozens of short-term
transfers to BNL Atlanta from BCCI branches in London, Abu Dhabi and Hong
Kong. The funds, which were handled by London and New York money brokers,
would generally be sent by BNL back to BCCI, with interest, after 48 or 72
hours.
A senior executive at BNL in Rome said the transfers appeared to be nothing
more than 'normal, overnight transactions' but was at a loss to explain why
BCCI should have chosen to make the overnight deposits at BNL's Atlanta
branch which, until the huge Iraqi loans were discovered in August 1989, had
been thought of as a minor office.
The BNL executive also noted that Dollars 2.5bn was a relatively small
amount in the context of the Atlanta branch's overall funding operations.
US investigators say BNL Rome is not a target of inquiry.
Until now, the only BCCI-BNL fund transfer known was some Dollars 22m in
July 1989, discovered by inspectors from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York when they were analysing BNL's clearing account at the New York offices
of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Morgan, which cleared a total of
Dollars 1.7bn of BNL Atlanta funds, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
US investigators are also examining deposits at BNL Atlanta, held by an
individual suspected as a front for other interests. At least part of these
funds was transferred to a BCCI Nassau branch in the Bahamas, and the
Atlanta account was closed on July 31 1989, four days before the FBI raided
BNL Atlanta.

SENATOR Warren Rudman (left), a Republican from New Hampshire, said
yesterday he would not seek re-election this year for a third term, writes
Jurek Martin in Washington. Unlike others, he is not leaving the Senate
because he is an incumbent under threat, but because he does not like
Washington.
He repeated that he has found life and work there 'terribly frustrating'.
Though considered an effective senator, usually but not reflexively
conservative, he said Congress had failed to address great issues, such as
rising costs of social security and Medicare.
Mr Rudman is probably best known as co-author of the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction act of 1985. New Hampshire is a conservative state and his seat is
unlikely to go Democratic.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Peru's 'Babyface' holds up better than economy: Economy
minister thought 1992 would be a hard year - and it is
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 13 months in one of the world's least enviable jobs, Mr Carlos Bolona
 -'Babyface' to friend and foe - is showing fewer signs of strain than the
Peruvian economic programme he administers.
Fiscal measures in the past month, partly modified under pressure of public
opinion, have brought renewed calls for his immediate departure, from
outraged businessmen and union leaders alike.
'We always knew 1992 was going to be a hard year,' smiles Mr Bolona, economy
and finance minister. 'And every month there are demands for my
resignation.'
The tax-raising measures which aroused national fury were primarily intended
to combat the minister's principal preoccupation - a troublesome fiscal
deficit amounting to more than Dollars 2bn for 1992. Congressional decisions
plus various miscalculations have meant that planned expenditure this year
is equivalent to 12 per cent of gross domestic product while tax collections
hover around 8.3 per cent.
'We are still in time to correct this,' says Mr Bolona, 'but it means
collecting at least 1 per cent more in taxes as well as cutting costs.'
The measures proposed a raising of the general sales tax from 16 to 18 per
cent, a 20 per cent tax on dollar savings deposits and 50 per cent tax on
insurance premiums. They would have eliminated long-standing tax exemptions
on certain basic foodstuffs and products from Peru's economically depressed
frontier and jungle zones.
However, the government was forced to drop plans to tax basic foodstuffs,
although it has levied a 5 per cent tax on some basic foods and applied the
18 per cent tax for imported foods. It halved the insurance tax and dropped
the plan to tax savings.
The tax on savings, advocated by Mr Victor Joy Way, industry minister, and
opposed by Mr Bolona, had been intended not to raise revenues, but to
discourage speculative short-term capital. This has been flooding into the
country to the tune of Dollars 120m (Pounds 69.3m) a month, attracted by
interest rates double international averages. Oversupply of dollars, added
to an unquenched flow of greenbacks from the illegal drugs trade, has kept
the local currency stubbornly strong - to exporters' despair.
Mr Michel Camdessus, International Monetary Fund chief, on a visit to Lima
in mid-February, underlined the importance of boosting government revenues
in calling for 'battlefield surgery' to stop a 'haemorrhaging' budget. But
it will take time to convince Peruvians, accustomed to low taxation and high
evasion, of the importance of paying taxes.
It is not just the deficit that is causing concern. After several months of
improvement, economic indicators are troubling. Inflation in February rose
again to near 5 per cent after seven months' decline. With steep food price
rises this month as a result of the lifting of sales tax exemptions,
accumulated inflation for first-quarter 1992 is now certain to top 15 per
cent, making the budget target of 37 per cent for the year look
unattainable.
Worrying, too, is January's dip in output, admittedly by a small 0.7 per
cent over January 1991, but still a hefty 8 per cent down on January 1990,
which was at the end of the economically chaotic and recessionary Alan Garca
administration.
Both exporters and domestic manufacturers are continuing to suffer the
effects of a damagingly overvalued local currency. The sol remains at a
stubborn 0.95 to the US dollar while manufacturers and exporters calculate
parity at about 1.60 to the dollar at current cost levels. Central bank
attempts to weaken the local currency by buying dollars - Dollars 40m last
month alone - have failed to produce any improvement. In another attempt to
stem the flow, the government has agreed with leading banks to lower bank
deposit rates. Most exporters claim to be losing money hand over fist; only
two mining concerns, for example, announced profits for last year.
Since January, manufacturers have had to face competition from newly
tariff-free imports from Andean Pact neighbours Colombia and Venezuela.
'At this rate, the entire productive apparatus of Peru will go bust,' says
Mr Carlos Meneses, managing director of one of the country's oldest and
largest metal-working concerns. Not so, counters the government. It points
to a small, but measurable 2.6 per cent growth in output last year, though
over a heavy recession in 1990. Falling interest rates are starting to
reduce heavy financing costs.
According to Mr Bolona, businesses are experiencing a sharp fall in
traditionally generous profit margins. 'But they are learning to adjust and
become more competitive,' he claims. 'Let us not deceive ourselves: despite
all the clamour, Peruvian businesses never actually go bust.'
Long-promised privatisation looks at last to be getting under way. Fourteen
state-owned companies are scheduled to go under the hammer within the next
two months and Mr Bolona is determined to speed the process. Revenue from
privatisation is hard to predict but getting rid of loss-makers will close a
deficit which even last year reached between Dollars 500m and Dollars 700m.
Despite the modifications to his proposals, Mr Bolona says he is not
dissatisfied. Relations with Congress are more conciliatory, and his
ministry is at last able to fulfil its financial commitments to the social
emergency programme for the poor.
'You win no applause doing my job,' he says, 'but that doesn't bother me.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Nunn urges further cuts in US troops: Military presence
overseas should be 'more realistic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration's efforts to hold off pressure for further cuts in
US troop levels received a blow yesterday when an influential senator called
for 'more realistic levels' of military presence overseas.
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate armed services committee
and a crucial advocate of a strong defence in congressional debates, said
that he believed it was possible to cut below the 'base force' level which
the Pentagon has argued is an irreducible minimum.
He warned, however, that it would be very difficult to reduce military
spending and force structures in 1993, and that any savings would have to be
achieved in subsequent years.
The base force envisaged by the Pentagon already involves cutting US active
duty military personnel from a peak of 2.17m in 1987 to 1.6m in 1997, with a
reduction in force structure to 12 active army divisions, 12 navy carrier
battle groups, and 15 active air force fighter wings.
President George Bush in January announced plans to cut the defence budget
by a total of Dollars 50bn (Pounds 28.9bn) over the next five years from the
levels planned a year earlier, but said that he could cut no further.
'This deep and no deeper,' he said.
But Senator Nunn said the base force contained 'redundancy and duplication
among the military services in role and mission'.
The senator advocated another Dollars 30bn to Dollars 35bn of cuts over the
next five years, above those already proposed by the president.
Senator Nunn argued, in particular, that the US military presence in Europe
could be cut well below the level of 150,000 currently proposed.
US military commanders have said that they must maintain at least a full
army corps of around 70,000 in order to have a coherent force able to defend
itself.
With three fighter wings and adequate naval and logistical support, they
have claimed that a total of 150,000 is a bare minimum.
Following the recent decision by Canada to pull its troops out of Europe,
some European nations have been worried that the US might succumb to
domestic pressure to withdraw its European presence.
They have lobbied hard to try to persuade Congress to sustain the US's
commitment to Nato.

FT  25 MAR 92 / The louder the row, the closer the deal: Talks S
Africa-style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN politics operate according to an inverse principle: when
opposing parties broadcast their disagreement most vocally and vehemently,
you can bet there is a deal in the making.
Negotiations are like that - no less so in South Africa where, over the next
few months, black, white, Indian and coloured will try to thrash out a
post-apartheid constitution. When the African National Congress (ANC) hits
new heights of bluster and the white government wields a heavy rhetorical
bludgeon, it is the sub-text that is important, not the superficial message.
The mock-clash on Monday between them - which involved Pretoria tabling
proposals for a multi-racial interim government and the ANC rejecting them
out of hand - was a classic example.
In public, ministers were keen to stress that they were not handing over
power to the ANC (the charge levelled against them by the right wing in the
referendum last week), despite their plans for multi-racial 'transitional
councils' to oversee key areas of government policy.
In private, they made clear that these councils (which would be dominated by
the ANC and the ruling National Party, though they would include lesser
parties) would be able to give orders to the white cabinet, and that the
cabinet would carry them out.
In public, the ANC condemned the councils as mere 'toy telephones' to power,
and dismissed the concept as 'outrageous'.
In private, ANC officials let it be known that they thought a deal could be
reached on the issue, along with the much more contentious question of
dismantling the ANC military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation),
and abandoning armed struggle.
It is not surprising that neither side wants to broadcast the large number
of compromises already made - and still to be made - before a new
constitution is agreed.
If they did, the government would not have won the white referendum by such
a large margin, and the ANC would risk a backlash in the townships. When
they have met privately - in the bilateral talks where the real tough
talking is done - neither side has proved reluctant to compromise.
That is not to say that agreement will be reached exactly along the lines
set out by Pretoria. There are arguments to settle over the exact powers of
the councils, who will appoint them, who will sit on them, and how many of
them there will be. What is certain is that there will be a deal, and soon -
perhaps as early as next month, as Pretoria predicted yesterday.
The battle to watch for is not that between the ANC and the government
(which work so closely together that they are often accused of collusion),
but rather between the two of them and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and his
mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party.
Bilateral agreement between Pretoria and the ANC will not be enough on its
own; the 19 parties of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa)
must agree before an interim government can be formed. The government and
the ANC will want broad support for something as important as an interim
government, and they will not risk the ire of Chief Buthelezi by forcing it
down his throat.
He is the real wild card in South African politics, to be ignored at great
peril. Progress towards interim government could depend, in the end, on
whether his injured pride can be assuaged - he alleges an insult to the Zulu
people because their King, Goodwill Zwelethini, has no seat at Codesa - and
whether the new government structure can accommodate his ambitions for
power.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom party,
yesterday attacked government proposals for interim rule with blacks, and
accused Pretoria of aiming to destroy the political power of South Africa's
biggest tribe, the Zulus, Patti Waldmeir reports. Chief Buthelezi, chief
minister of the KwaZulu tribal homeland and a member of the Zulu royal
family, said he was not consulted in the drafting of the proposals which
failed to take into account KwaZulu's existence.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Call for radical reforms for China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA should float its currency and open retail, transport, banking and
insurance industries to foreigners, the cabinet's top economist said in the
clearest explanation of Beijing's new reform effort so far, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
Ma Hong, research director for the state council (cabinet), was quoted by
the official press yesterday as saying the economy must be made 'more
international'.
Reforms enacted so far, which have concentrated on attracting foreign
investment to the manufacturing sector, were not allowing enough scope for
potential growth, he said, calling for bold opening of the service sector.
Ma, in charge of cabinet economic policy planning, said China should open
its doors wider, and criticised leaders who were afraid of using capitalist
methods to achieve China's goals. 'There are still people who equate reform
and opening up with the introduction of capitalism,' Shanghai's Wen Hui Bao
quoted him as saying. 'To put economic questions in overly ideological terms
has caused great losses for socialism.'
Ma said capitalist-style policies such as the introduction of securities
trading should be promoted, and suggested even more radical reform: 'Foreign
exchange rates should be adjusted so as to institute a free-exchange
system.'
Although China has allowed the yuan to depreciate slowly in a 'managed
float', as part of its efforts to re-join the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt), the currency remains tightly controlled.

China has called for talks with Britain on Hong Kong's legislature, to be

Analysts saw the call by Zhou Nan, head of China's de facto embassy in Hong
Kong, as another attempt by Beijing to shape the colony's affairs before
1997.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Virgin Atlantic wins right to begin Johannesburg flights

VIRGIN Atlantic, the airline owned by Mr Richard Branson, plans to start
flying from London to Johannesburg before the end of this year, in a move
signalling South Africa's intentions to adopt an 'open skies' airline
policy.
The route has been the sole preserve of British Airways, Virgin's bigger UK
rival, and South African Airways (SAA) since 1945. It has long been one of
the most lucrative long-distance services for both airlines.
Mr Branson said yesterday, after meeting Mr Peter Welgemoed, the South
African transport minister, that he had been told Virgin 'can gear up and
start flying later this year'.
Virgin officials said the airline planned to start its London to
Johannesburg services in October or November with five flights a week. The
airline hopes eventually to operate daily services and has applied to extend
its Johannesburg flights to Cape Town and Durban.
The new services are expected to intensify the fierce competition between
Virgin and BA on international routes out of London's Heathrow and Gatwick
airports.
They are also expected to bring down fares on what has traditionally been
one of the most expensive long-haul routes. Virgin said economy fares could
be reduced by 35-40 per cent.
Mr Branson said Mr Welgemoed pledged to free up the current airline fare
structure entirely by October and develop an 'open skies' policy over the
next few years.
The new Virgin flights still have to be ratified by the South African
cabinet.
Under the new bilateral air service agreement negotiated last year between
the UK and South Africa, the two UK carriers will be entitled to a 60 per
cent share of frequencies on the London to South Africa route, and SAA to 40
per cent. However, this could change to 50-50 if a second South African
carrier decides to compete on the route.
Virgin also confirmed Mr Branson had been approached by a South African
investor interested in acquiring a stake in Voyager Travel, the holding
company which controls his airline. Mr Branson is considering selling a 20
per cent stake for about Pounds 50m and has also been holding discussions
with potential UK investors.
Virgin is expected to acquire two more Boeing 747s to operate its new
services.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UN seeks written Libyan pledge

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday gave Libya 24
hours to supply a written commitment to surrender the alleged Lockerbie
bombers to Britain or the US, his spokesman said yesterday.
The request was put to Dr Ali Elhouderi, Libyan ambassador to the UN, who,
according to the spokesman, had informed Mr Ghali of 'his government's
willingness to hand over the accused persons'.
In response, the UN chief sought written confirmation that handing the men
over to the Arab League 'would be a first step in complying fully and
unconditionally' with Security Council Resolution 731. This called for their
surrender to British or US authorities seeking their extradition.
An Arab League delegation, led by its secretary-general Mr Esmat
Abdel-Maguid, flew to Tripoli yesterday to discuss with Libya the proposed
handover to the 21-nation league.
Libya made the offer after Arab League foreign ministers had offered only
limited support for Libya in its confrontation with Britain, the US and
France over its alleged role in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
in Scotland, in 1988 and a UTA jet over Niger in 1989.
However, details of any handover were unclear yesterday and earlier optimism
at the United Nations gave way to a suspicion that, as one senior official
put it, 'we're getting a runaround'.
Sir David Hannay, British ambassador to the UN, said last night there was a
high degree of uncertainty on the issue. 'The jury's out as far as I'm
concerned,' he said. If there was no positive outcome, then 'we will want to
move ahead rather quickly' on action in the Security Council. If outcome was
negative, 'I don't think there will much further delay' on sanctions.

SOUTH KOREA'S ruling Democratic Liberal Party appeared to have lost control
of parliament in a humilating general election defeat for President Roh
Tae-woo, state television projections said, Reuter reports from Seoul.
With about 94 per cent of votes in yesterday's poll counted, the DLP, which
holds a two-thirds majority in the outgoing single-chamber National
Assembly, looked set to win 114 of 237 constituencies, with the opposition
and various independents taking the rest, the Korea Broadcasting System
said.
More than 1,000 candidates stood in 237 constituencies. Another 62 seats, to
make a total of 299, will be filled from party lists in proportion to the
overall vote.
'Voters have rebelled against President Roh's government for its failure to
manage the economy properly,' said Mr Kim Yong-jin, a Seoul university
professor. 'The DLP failed to contain mounting concerns by voters about high
prices and sluggish exports, a main theme in the election campaign.'
KBS said the DLP was likely to receive 33 seats under proportional
representation, for a total of 147, three seats short of the 150 needed for
an overall majority.
The Democratic Party, headed by a veteran opposition leader, Mr Kim
Dae-jung, was expected to form the next biggest bloc with 100, followed by
30 for the Unification National Party of Mr Chung Ju-yung, retired chairman
of Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, KBS said.
'The voters supported our platform that a strong opposition is needed to
check the giant ruling party,' Mr Kim told reporters with a smile. His
party's candidates swept most of the seats in Kim's south-western stronghold
of Cholla and took more than 60 per cent of 44 seats at stake in Seoul.
Independents also did unexpectedly well and were projected to gain about 21
seats. One remaining seat went to a minority party candidate.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Saudis to pay 37% less for petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA, already one of the world's cheapest places to fill up a car,
has slashed domestic petrol prices by 37 per cent to the equivalent of 8.6
US cents a litre.
The cut is one of several in services and utilities prices made in a
surprise announcement by King Fahd to 'ease the burden of the cost of living
on the citizens'.
The move appears in part designed to soften the effects of inflation in the
kingdom since the Gulf war, which has risen substantially in the past year
in tandem with the general buoyancy of the economy.
The price cuts certainly run counter to the government's general need to
reduce expenditure, given that it is already slated to run an Dollars 8bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) budget deficit for 1992 - its 10th successive budget
shortfall. 'From the purely financial standpoint, it makes little sense,'
said a Riyadh banker.
Registration fees for businessmen and traders will be cut by up to 87 per
cent and cuts will also be made on port tariffs and exit visas.

AN ECONOMIC plan calling for the rapid introduction of a separate Ukrainian
currency, as a means to break economic ties with Russia, was approved in
principle by a wide majority of the Ukrainian parliament yesterday.
However, deputies refused to endorse details of the plan, which they said
were poorly thought out.
The decision ended a day of fierce debate in a closed session of parliament,
which pitted nationalists and ex-communists against reformers.
Mr Oleksandr Iemelianov, author of the plan, ex-communist and a leading
economic policy-maker, told parliament Ukraine could introduce a separate
currency at three days' notice and must be prepared to leave the rouble zone
the moment Russia liberalised prices for its oil.
Mr Oleksandr Sharov, a government economist and among the reformers,
described Mr Iemelianov's claim as 'fantastical'. A deputy from the New
Ukraine liberal pro-reform group described the plan as 'national communism'
and Mr Volodymyr Hryniov, parliamentary deputy chairman and a reformer,
called the compromise decision 'very dangerous because it is not now clear
what the president will do or who will implement the programme. 'If this
programme is realised, it will be the equivalent of leaving the Commonwealth
of Independent States,' Mr Hryniov said.
Mr Viacheslav Chornovil, nationalist western Ukrainian leader, backed the
programme because to remain in the Russian monetary system would mean
'Russia suffocating us.'
Meanwhile, Mr Vadim Hetman was appointed as head of the Ukrainian National
Bank. His predecessor, Mr Volodymyr Matvienko, had been criticised for
dragging his feet in the introduction of a separate currency.
Mr Hetman emphasised that a separate currency could only be introduced in
co-operation with Russia. and called for 'constructive dialogue'.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Closure of Soviet reactors urged: Leak reawakens debate -
improve old plants or scrap them?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADIATION leak at Sosnovy Bor nuclear station near St Petersburg
yesterday has brought fresh calls for the urgent closure of the former
Soviet Union's ageing nuclear power stations.
But it will also re-ignite the row between the nuclear industry, which wants
to spend more on upgrading the stations, and environmentalists, who want to
see them close.
'Western aid is being directed to patching up and bolting on gismos, rather
than developing alternative systems,' said Mr Simon Roberts of the
environmental group Friends of the Earth.
But Dr John Gittus, of the British Nuclear Forum, said thousands would die
of hypothermia if the former Soviet Union's nuclear stations, which supply
around 15 per cent of the region's energy, closed.
However, both sides agreed that, six years after the international nuclear
accident at Chernobyl, not enough has been done to prevent a repeat of the
disaster.
There are conflicting reports as to how much radioactive material has leaked
from Sosnovy Bor. At first, the state nuclear inspectorate Gosatomnadzor
said the leak was 'minor'. Later it described it as 'serious'. By last
night, officials at the plant said the leak was giving 'no grounds for
concern' and radiation readings had returned to normal, indicating the leak
had been contained.
One encouraging factor was that the safety systems were effectively
activated, shutting down the plant before further damage could be done.
The incident was yesterday rated three points on an international scale for
grading the seriousness of nuclear accidents. Chernobyl was rated the
maximum of seven.
The reactors at Chernobyl and Sosnovy Bor were built to the same design.
Both are light-water, gas-cooled reactors of an old style, known as RBMKs.
The incident will fuel international fears of future accidents at RBMKs or
other old-style Soviet reactors.
In particular, it will not silence those who believe the 16 RBMKs in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), together with the elderly
pressurised water reactors known as VVER 230s, should be shut down.
Germany's environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, said yesterday there was no
alternative to switching off all the RBMK reactors. His views were supported
by environmental groups in the UK, which have long called for the closure of
the plants.
But the price of closure will be high. The republic of Armenia recently
closed its one nuclear power station supplying 40 per cent of its energy
needs. Now it faces a crippling shortage of electricity for heating and
industrial needs.
For such reasons, former members of the Soviet Union have avoided closing
plants and have invited western nuclear industry experts to help improve
safety standards and efficiency.
The international nuclear industry, for its part, has put considerable
effort into establishing links with the CIS. Yesterday, by coincidence,
western nuclear industry executives from seven countries met in London to
plan a nine-month review of RBMK safety.
The meeting - attended by the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Sweden
and Canada - planned to seek funding from the EC, which confirmed late last
year it would set aside about Ecu50m (Pounds 35.8m) to improve nuclear
safety in the former Soviet Union.
About Ecu8m of this is expected to be allocated to the RBMKs; the rest will
focus on a programme to improve the VVER-230 reactors.
So far, no other western money has been dedicated for the reactors. 'There
is a real worry that the west has been nibbling around the edges of the RBMK
problem ever since Chernobyl,' says Mr George Tyror, of the UK Atomic Energy
Authority, who chaired yesterday's meeting and would head the RBMK
initiative.
'The west ought to be ashamed of itself,' agreed Lord Marshall, former
chairman of the UK Central Electricity Generating Board and now chairman of
the World Association of Nuclear Operators.
Cynical observers say the nuclear industry's emphasis on improving rather
than closing eastern European stations reflects its ambition to revive its
flagging fortunes in the west through construction and maintenance work in
the east.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government looks as though it will fail to meet nearly all its
budgetary targets for the first quarter.
Reports yesterday pointed to a budget deficit in the first quarter of this
year of Rbs84bn, or around 25 per cent of the total planned budget
expenditure of Rbs420.5bn for the period.
The government had originally planned a balanced budget, but in January
revised this to a deficit of about 2.5 per cent of planned expenditure.
The targets have fallen victim to the spiralling decline in production, the
inability or refusal to pay taxes on the part of enterprises and regions,
and the government's own tendency to exempt autonomous areas in Russia from
legislation and regulations governing payment to the centre.
According to figures supplied by the finance ministry and printed in the
daily Izvestia, the government received Rbs190bn, a shortfall of Rbs230.5bn
on the revenue expected for the first quarter. Taxes have been widely
evaded, with value added tax, which was introduced at the start of the year
and expected to raise more than Rbs130bn, yielding only a third of this at
Rbs44bn.
At the same time, a confidential memorandum prepared for President Boris
Yeltsin, and leaked to the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper, claimed that many
of the regions and autonomous republics had negotiated special arrangements
to avoid paying tax and other duties, with the result that 'a hundred
billion roubles' were being lost in state revenues.
The leaked report says huge pressure has been brought to bear on the
government by regional authorities to grant them ad hoc exemptions in order
to quieten their fears that enterprises will collapse.
The government is having to endure increasing attacks on its programme in
the run-up to the crucial Congress of Russian Peoples' deputies on April 6.
A new opinion poll in Izvestia shows trust in the government and its reforms
falling rapidly, with only one third of Muscovites questioned believing that
Mr Yeltsin would pursue reforms which would improve living standards. Only
25 per cent of industrial workers believe that reforms would benefit them.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, and
some of his ministers yesterday had to listen to two hours of savage
battering at a meeting in the Russian parliament from a galaxy of former
presidential advisers, led by Mr Nikolai Petrakov, economic adviser to
President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990. All showed a sharp hostility to the
International Monetary Fund, now completing negotiations with the Russian
government on its membership and its economic programme. Mr Petrakov said
that the IMF advice was designed principally for the benefit of westerners
who were able to pick up bargains of all kinds because of the low rouble
exchange rate.

<TEXT>
THE 51-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will
organise a special conference 'as soon as possible' to sponsor a peace
settlement in the war-torn Trans-Caucasian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, the
subject of a bitter dispute between the former Soviet republics of Armenia
and Azerbaijan.
Foreign Ministers from the member countries, meeting to decide on the future
role of the CSCE following the end of the cold war in Europe, mandated Mr
Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovakian foreign minister, to visit the region
at the end of this month to try to establish a ceasefire between the two
warring parties.
The chairman of the conference, which is to be held in Minsk, the Belarus
capital, will be chosen by Mr Dienstbier, the current president of the CSCE.
Several names have been mentioned so far, including that of Sir Geoffrey
Howe, the former British foreign secretary. The 10 CSCE member nations who
will participate in the conference include the US, Russia and Turkey.
A dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over what status Nagorno-Karabakh
should have in the conference was finally resolved by an agreement that Mr
Dienstbier would have the last word on the subject. Azerbaijan originally
wanted representatives of the enclave to be part of its own delegation;
Armenia wanted them to report to the conference in their own right. The
ministers said after yesterday's meeting they were convinced a conference on
Nagorno-Karabakh under the auspices of the CSCE would provide an ongoing
forum for negotiations towards a peaceful settlement of the crisis on the
basis of the principles, commitments and provisions of the CSCE.
The membership of the CSCE, which opened its fourth 'Helsinki Follow-up
Conference' at ministerial level, was increased from 48 to 51 by the formal
admission of Croatia, Slovenia and Georgia. Croatia and Slovenia previously
had only observer status, while the recent civil war in Georgia prevented it
from becoming a member when the other former Soviet republics were admitted
as independent states.
However, the decision last Monday by the EC to clear the way for its members
to recognise Georgia, and the appointment of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, former
Soviet foreign minister, as head of Georgia's State Council, has opened the
republic's path into the CSCE.
The need to strengthen the CSCE's capacity to deal with the regional and
ethnic conflicts which are likely to be a feature of the European landscape
was underlined by all participants. Some, like Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
German foreign minister, want the CSCE to have more extensive conflict
management and peace-keeping powers.
Mr Genscher, however, proposed institutional changes, such as setting up a
six- or seven-member steering committee to render decision-making less
unwieldy in dealing with specific conflicts, and the creation of special
CSCE peace-keeping forces.
His suggestions went considerably further than those of other members -
including notably the US, UK, Russia and the Netherlands - which do not want
to give the CSCE a specifically military role but favour the use, at the
request of the CSCE, of peace-keeping troops from organisations such as Nato
and the nine-country Western European Union.
The former Cold War enemies yesterday signed a treaty allowing flights over
each other's territories to gather information, Reuter reports from
Helsinki.
The 'open skies' treaty, signed by the US, Russia and other members of Nato
and the defunct Warsaw Pact, allows signatories to make surveillance
flights. Theforeign ministers of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the pact
in place of the former Soviet Union.  Georgia brought the total of
signatories to 25.
Nato, worried about strains on its vital transatlantic ties, will ask Canada
to drop plans to withdraw all its troops from Europe, alliance sources say,
Reuter reports from Brussels.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN nations are close to agreement on a formula that would open the door
for Russia and the other former Soviet republics to join the International
Monetary Fund this summer.
IMF members still have to decide details of how to calculate the republics'
share of the fund's capital, which in turn would determine the size of their
access to IMF financing, but they are expected to reach an agreement in the
next fortnight on a Russian quota of slightly more than 3 per cent.
This could allow the republic to borrow as much as Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.3bn) a year from the IMF.
But Russian economists estimate that their country will need a total of
Dollars 12bn in foreign capital this year. Even if Russia's IMF membership
is completed by the summer, an IMF facility might not be in place before the
autumn, and in 1992 would be unlikely to amount to anything like the full
annual entitlement of around Dollars 4bn.
IMF members have not, however, fully resolved the question of whether to
calculate one global quota for the Commonwealth of Independent States, to be
divided up later among the republics, or to calculate each quota
individually.
This could affect the size of the quota, because it would determine whether
trade between the republics should be counted as international trade. Trade,
along with gross national product and international reserves, is a
significant component of the formulas the IMF uses to calculate membership
quotas.
Russian negotiators argued for separate quotas to be calculated for each
republic, and sought a quota of over 4 per cent for their own country. This
would have put them roughly on a par with Japan, whose quota is 4.2 per
cent, whereas the quota likely to be agreed would be closer to Saudi
Arabia's 3.4 per cent.
In the US, the administration has come under pressure in recent days to step
up its efforts to help Russia and the other republics, and President George
Bush has begun to show more enthusiasm for a bigger aid commitment.
The debate on an aid package was spurred by former President Richard Nixon,
who two weeks ago criticised the US response to the collapse of the Soviet
Union as 'pathetically inadequate'.
Mr Nixon's urgings have been echoed senior senators from both parties, led
by Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Republican Senator Richard
Lugar of Indiana.
The two men met President Bush and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state,
at the White House this week to encourage the administration to produce
substantial measures to help the emerging democracies of the former Soviet
Union.
Among the measures proposed is a large US contribution to a rouble
stabilisation fund, increased humanitarian aid and the repeal of a number of
Cold War curbs on trade with the Soviet Union.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Lloyds and Midland merger was blocked by threat to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MERGER between Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank was scuppered when Midland's
chief executive, Mr Brian Pearse, threatened to resign only hours before the
announcement of the merger talks was to be made to the Stock Exchange, it
emerged yesterday.
This brinkmanship at the highest level of Britain's clearing banks took
place while Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was deciding whether to make a bid
for Midland, which it said it would do last week.
According to an authoritative account of the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring
leading up to the Hongkong bid, an announcement that Lloyds and Midland
planned to merge was scheduled to be made at 8.30am on March 3.
The banks' brokers - Cazenove for Midland and Hoare Govett for Lloyds - had
been alerted and a press conference planned. However, late on March 2, Mr
Pearse told Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, that he could not play
a role in the merged organisation.
As a result, Lloyds could not proceed with the announcement. Lloyds had
planned to say that Mr Pearse would play an important role in the bank
formed by the merger.
Bankers said that Mr Pearse took his stand because he believed Midland was
being 'bounced' into a deal likely to be blocked by competition authorities
in the UK and Brussels.
'A merger of the two banks would have entailed massive job losses and branch
closures at Midland,' said a banker with a close knowledge of the talks.
'Morale among Midland's staff would have been devastated. It would have been
almost impossible to rebuild that morale if the merger had been blocked.'
Lloyds began analysing the likely benefits of a deal just over a year ago.
Work began seriously in December when it appointed Mr Andrew Tuckey,
chairman of merchant bank Baring Brothers, to advise on the deal. Despite
the March 2 rebuff, Lloyds was invited to make a presentation on the
benefits of the merger to Midland's board on March 13. That morning, Sir
Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, and Mr Pitman put their case to Midland's
directors.
That afternoon, however, Mr William Purves, Hongkong chairman, also made a
presentation to the Midland board about why Midland should be taken over by
his bank. In the evening, Mr Pitman was told he had lost the competition.
On March 17 Midland made a Stock Exchange announcement that it had agreed to
be taken over by Hongkong Bank.
Lloyds, the UK's most profitable clearing bank, yesterday announced that Sir
Robin Ibbs, former head of a government 'think tank', would be its next
chairman. Mr Pitman, 60, will stay as chief executive until 1995.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York shake-up ahead of Dollars 20bn talks: Jubilee
Line extension in doubt as banks assess Canary Wharf developer's funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the world's biggest property developer, last night announced
a management shake-up and the appointment of financial advisers to guide it
through the reorganisation of its borrowings. An executive close to the
group said these were 'in excess of Dollars 20bn'.
The disclosures came as it emerged that the future of the Pounds 1.3bn
Jubilee Line underground extension to London's Docklands has been thrown
into doubt by O&amp;Y's financial difficulties.
Mr Paul Reichmann, chief executive officer of Olympia &amp; York, said that Mr
Tom Johnson, the former president of Manufacturers Hanover, the US bank, had
been appointed as the new president of Olympia and York Developments, O&amp;Y's
main property subsidiary.
Mr Johnson is replacing Mr Reichmann in that post, allowing Mr Reichmann
more time to 'focus on Canary Wharf', according to an O&amp;Y adviser. Canary
Wharf in Docklands is Europe's biggest new development of office blocks and
is at the heart of O&amp;Y problems because of its huge construction costs.
Mr Reichmann said that O&amp;Y 'remains fully committed to the completion of its
Canary Wharf project'. O&amp;Y also said that JP Morgan, the US bank, James D
Wolfensohn, the corporate finance advisory firm, and Burns Fry, the Canadian
investment bank, had been appointed to advise O&amp;Y on its negotiations with
banks.
Two senior bankers who will be involved in the forthcoming debt talks said
yesterday they expected the banks would have to convert part of their loans
to O&amp;Y into equity, as part of the reorganisation of the property
developer's borrowings. They said repayments on some of the debt would
probably be rescheduled and there was also likely to be a need for new cash
injections into O&amp;Y from the banks.
The banks are forming a steering committee to handle negotiations with O&amp;Y.
Bankers said that Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce would head the steering
committee.
O&amp;Y has formed a planning committee to manage negotiations with the banks.
This will be chaired by Mr Johnson rather than by either of the Reichmann
brothers, who own O&amp;Y.
'The problem for Mr Reichmann is that he is asset-rich and cash-poor. The
real estate crunch has caused him to suffer gargantuan losses on paper and
his assets are not as liquid as he thought they were,' said one banker.
Mr Reichmann said yesterday that when the debt restructuring was completed
'it will take us through the current period of global recession in the real
estate industry'. Mr Steven Miller of Wolfensohn will be vice-chairman of
O&amp;Y's planning committee. Mr Miller was a vice-chairman of Chrysler and a
decade ago restructured the US automotive manufacturer.
However, bankers said the reconstruction of O&amp;Y's balance sheet had less in
common with Chrysler reorganisation than with negotiations held in the 1980s
with Latin American countries on the rescheduling of their debt.
Other members of the planning committee include Mr John Zuccotti, president
of O&amp;Y's US operations.
Separately it emerged yesterday that O&amp;Y has not yet signed the agreement to
contribute
Pounds 400m to the project to extend the Jubilee Line to east London, which
was agreed in principle with Mr Cecil Parkinson, then secretary of state for
transport, in 1989. This contribution is be-ing looked at by banks as part
of O&amp;Y's debt reorganisation.
'You won't find the banks building the Jubilee Line,' said a banker closely
related to O&amp;Y. 'O&amp;Y made a commitment to the government that it would fund
the construction. But that had nothing to do with the banks.'
However, he said there would be detailed discussions between the banks, O&amp;Y
and the government about how to finance the underground railway line.
O&amp;Y is due to make its first contribution to the Jubilee Line extension, of
Pounds 40m, at the end of this month with another Pounds 60m due at the end
of March next year. The balance of Pounds 300m is not due until construction
of the extension is complete in 1996.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Labour shifts debate to health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK last night moved the Labour party's election campaign on to
its strongest territory - the National Health Service - as three opinion
polls gave his party a lead over the Conservatives.
Amid Tory claims that Labour was in disarray over its economic policy, Mr
Kinnock challenged Mr John Major to a televised debate on the Conservatives'
plans for the health service.
Mr Major used an interview on BBC's Newsnight programme to brush aside the
challenge, and urged Mr Kinnock to respond to questions on Labour policy put
to him by the Conservative party.
The latest opinion polls upset Mr Major's hopes that a five-point
Conservative lead in a Harris poll yesterday marked a turning point.
Labour's lead ranges from one point in an ICM poll for today's Guardian to
four points in a Harris poll for ITN.
This highlights the apparent failure of the Conservatives' aggressive
taxation campaign to swing voters. The latest Financial Times 'poll of
polls' puts Labour two points ahead.
Senior ministers said last night the Conservatives would 'keep their nerve'
and continue to focus on the impact of Labour's tax and spending policies on
those on average, below-average, and middle incomes.
But there was an acknowledgement that the party must begin to turn the
campaign around by the weekend if Mr Major is to have a real chance of
returning to office with an overall majority.
In his first major speech of the campaign, Mr Norman Tebbit, the former
party chairman, signalled the beginning of an intense effort to win back
Conservative 'waverers' from the Liberal Democrats. The senior ministers
said the aim was to send a clear message to disgruntled supporters that a
vote for Mr Paddy Ashdown would let Mr Kinnock into Downing Street.
As Labour strategists seek to fix attention in the next few days on the NHS,
a politically provocative Labour election television broadcast last night
portrayed a tiered NHS in which the mother of one girl was able to pay for
private treatment while another girl suffered long NHS waiting lists. Labour
party officials said the film was based on a real case.
Mr Kinnock claimed the government had created a 'two-tier' system as part of
a scheme to break up and privatise health care. He pledged that he would
'get into every nook and cranny of the Tory plan so that they can't fool the
people this time'.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, promised a Labour government would
seek, within three years, to increase the proportion of patients who are
treated within three months of going on waiting lists.
Mr Kinnock's challenge, billed by party strategists as 'a critical juncture'
in Labour's campaign, foreshadowed the launch of the party's health
'manifesto' in London today.
But Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman, challenged Mr Cook on how
he would pay for Labour's plans to make up alleged underfunding in the NHS.
Claiming Mr Cook had made a gaffe on a BBC phone-in programme by pledging to
resolve NHS underfunding within a single parliament, Mr Patten said the
issue of spending commitments went to the heart of the debate over Labour's
tax plans.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health minister, said spending on NHS patient
care had increased by 5.6 per cent this year and that Labour's commitments
were 'uncosted and undeliverable'.
The Conservatives continued broader attacks on Labour's proposals for credit
controls in the event of a consumer boom, focusing on reported comments by
Mr Kinnock that it would mean 'that we never again move into an era of 10,
11, 12, 15 and 17 per cent interest rates'.
The start of the NHS debate will trigger concerted efforts to prove that
Labour will not have the financial resources to meet its manifesto pledges.
Senior ministers are expected to argue that the impact of Labour's national
minimum wage will absorb up to half the Pounds 1bn in additional health
funding promised under Labour's 'shadow Budget' last week.
Labour officials dismiss this charge, saying the entire Pounds 1bn would go
directly to patient care. Increased wage costs of about Pounds 500m would be
met by the rise in Exchequer tax and National Insurance revenues arising
from the minimum wage proposal. The Liberal Democrats will be encouraged by
today's opinion polls as they suggest a small rise in their support.
The Mori poll for The Times puts Labour on 41 per cent, the Tories on 38 per
cent and the Liberal Democrats on 17 per cent. The ICM/Guardian poll has
Labour 40 per cent, Tories 39 per cent and Liberal Democrats 17 per cent.
The Harris poll for ITN has figures of 42 per cent, 38 per cent and 16 per
cent.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Survey of North Wales (6): A rare survivor - All-Welsh
television station spreads its wings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest independent television production facility outside London is
based not in one of Britain's main regional centres but in the small north
Wales town of Caernarfon. Its working language is not English, the lingua
franca of the media world, but Welsh.
Barcud was founded 10 years ago by a group of independent producers to
provide programmes and facilities for the Welsh Fourth Channel, S4C, and has
grown to employ 60 people, based in a modern factory unit equipped with the
latest in television editing, studio and outside broadcast technology.
Apart from producing a range of light entertainment and other programmes,
Barcud also makes its facilities available to other Welsh-based companies
serving S4C, and to television companies elsewhere in the UK and abroad. CBS
of the US, Yorkshire Television and Channel 10 Australia are numbered among
its clients.
Barcud (pronounced ba'rr kheed) is the Welsh name of the rare Red Kite found
only in mid-Wales. It is a symbol of the growing use of Welsh in business
situations. Though spoken at the last published count by around 500,000
people, Welsh has suffered from the decline in industries, such as mining
and quarrying in north and south Wales, in which it was once the language of
work.
At Barcud the policy of using Welsh across all the company's range of
activities flowed naturally from its work with Welsh-speaking clients.
'We have a belief that the language could and should be used in work
situations, otherwise it cannot be considered as fully-functioning. We have
always used it as the natural medium for communication internally, and with
our Welsh customers,' the company's chairman, Huw Jones, points out.
Welsh-speaking staff have been recruited for technical jobs within the
company and its audit is dealt with in Welsh by Welsh-speaking partners at
the Swansea offices of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
The emergence of companies such as Barcud is part of a significant change in
attitudes towards the language over the past 25 years, brought about at
least in part by the campaigning of activists, and especially the Welsh
Language Society, who were reluctant to see one of Europe's oldest tongues
die out.
A policy of bilingualism in road and other signs has been adopted,
significant growth has occurred in the numbers of children being educated at
primary and secondary school level through the medium of Welsh, a separate
Welsh television channel (S4C) broadcasting about 30 hours a week of Welsh
has been established, and Welsh has been given a place alongside other core
subjects on the national curriculum in Wales.
All of this has raised the status of the language, making its speakers less
reluctant to use Welsh in situations where perhaps they would have switched
previously into English.
Yet, in spite of examples like Barcud, Welsh-speakers remain somewhat
reluctant to move into business and are failing to make the most of the
opportunities available to them. Among young Welsh speakers the broadcast
media is still very often regarded as the career pinnacle.
Menter a Busnes, based in Aberystwyth and backed by a number of public and
private sector bodies, aims to encourage Welsh-speakers to become more
involved in business by encouraging them to invest money in ventures, start
up on their own or simply enter the business world.
'We aim to get more Welsh speakers to the starting-point. Once they have
reached this, a network of development agencies exists to offer support,'
its director Hywel Evans says.
The agency's activities so far have included television advertising,
business awards, television and radio shows, business games, educational
material for schools, careers guidance aimed at broadening the range of
occupations which Welsh speakers enter, networking arrangements for
Welsh-speaking businesses, and other forms of practical advice and
assistance.
For those who take the plunge, more specific guidance and advice on how to
attract funds is provided by a range of enterprise agencies, such as Antur
Dwyryd (Venture Dwyryd) based in Penrhyndeudraeth, near Porthmadog in
Gwynedd.
Antur Dwyryd has its origins in an inquiry set up by Nicholas Edwards, the
then Welsh Secretary, to look into areas where entrepreneurial activity had
become limited. In this part of south Gwynedd a flourishing slate-mining
industry, with a range of ancillary businesses serving it, had largely
petered out, and the proportion of people working in manufacturing had
fallen to only 12 per cent, half the rate for Wales as a whole.
The agency has, according to its director, Dafydd Wyn Jones, seen a
transformation in attitudes since it began work four years ago. With a
current income of around Pounds 60,000-Pounds 70,000 a year derived from the
private sector (mainly lCl which used to employ 800 people locally making
quarry explosives) and from UK public sector and EC sources, it has embarked
on a series of initiatives aiming at building entrepreneurial awareness.
Roadshows are taken to outlying towns and villages, a news sheet detailing
local busines success stories is distributed to 10,000 households twice a
year, and a total of 850-900 serious inquiries resulting in 90 new
businesses have been dealt with. Roughly two thirds of inquiries have come
from longstanding locals, and one third from the many newcomers who have
settled in the area.
Yet, while new emphasis has been placed in recent years on stimulating
indigenous growth, very many more jobs than are likely to be provided from
this source will be needed if the employment aspirations of Welsh and
non-Welsh speakers in the area are to be satisfied. Otherwise, the young and
active members of the population will inevitably be forced to move away to
find work, resulting in a further rundown of rural communities, which will
be left to the retired.
The county remains very much in the market for inward investment, therefore,
which far from damaging the language, as some believe, is essential to its
salvation, according to Huw Thomas, Gwynedd's chief executive. 'The future
of the language is bound up with the prosperity of the region. Ours is a
policy of expansion for Gwynedd not protectionism,' he argues.
The urgency of winning new investment to supplement jobs won through
stimulating local entrepreneurial activity has been emphasised by a downturn
this year in the local economy. Gwynedd rode out the recession relatively
well until the end of last year but has since been hit by a number of plant
closures, as companies retrench nearer their markets. Unemployment has as a
result begun to rise again.
Companies which have moved to the area have in general not found it hard to
come to terms with its still predominantly Welsh nature or with the
bilingual policies of the council and other public bodies in the area, Huw
Thomas states.
Any initial apprehensions about moving into a bilingual community have
tended to be quickly dispelled by subsequent experience, and for companies
relocating from outside the UK such worries tend not to arise in the first
place, perhaps because German, Japanese or American companies are more used
to operating with the speakers of other languages.
As in relocations everywhere the most important consideration is to be
responsive to the local community, he observes.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Survey of North Wales (7): Old towns in search of a future -
The progress of urban regeneration across the area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Deeside towns of Queensferry, Shotton and Connah's Quay on the Welsh
bank of the River Dee offer an illuminating cameo of 1980s industrial
Britain.
The economy of the area - population 35,000 - was shattered in the early
part of the decade when steelmaking at Shotton was shut down with the loss
of 8,000 jobs, still the biggest ever plant closure in Britain.
In the mid-1980s boom years, new jobs were quickly found. The 600 acre
Deeside Industrial Park, built on land adjoining the steelworks, now
provides employment for some 5,000-6,000 people.
Once on the short list for Nissan's plant which eventually went to
Sunderland, it has since won the Toyota engine works. Iceland Frozen Foods,
one of the very few Welsh companies in the FT UK Top 500, started there in
1979, and one of the biggest employers, Shotton Paper, has now spent Pounds
250m on its plant.
Yet, having fallen back from 19 per cent at the start to only 4.5 per cent
in the late 1980s, unemployment has since risen with recession, and is now
again around 10 per cent and climbing in the local travel to work area.
The area has many assets which will enable it to bounce back as before. It
has large quantities of high quality industrial land reclaimed from the Dee
estuary, it is close to the population centres of north west England, and
has excellent road, rail, air and port communications. In good times, it
acts as a release valve for pressure within the nearby Chester economy,
taking in businesses forced to leapfrog over the city's green belt.
Its town centres - Shotton, Connah's Quay, and, further inland, Buckley -
also have severe weaknesses, however, as places to live or shop, as well as
work, making it difficult for the area to capitalise on its natural
advantages. Shotton and Connah's Quay straggle and merge together along the
heavily congested A548, and present a depressing, poor quality urban
environment which has seen little modern good quality investment. With one
or two exceptions, multiple retailers have been reluctant to move in, and
service industries are seriously under-represented.
A similar problem exists at Buckley, a former brickmaking centre, where the
somewhat non-descript town centre is both congested and lacking in car
parking. Most of the income earned in the area is as a result spent outside
it, mainly in Chester.
Hopes that this situation can be changed rest with plans being set in motion
in conjunction with the Welsh Development Agency, which was invited last
year by the local council to advise the area on a comprehensive approach
which could revitalise both the economy and the environment.
The WDA's answer, which has been successfully tried out in parts of south
Wales, has been to borrow the joint venture approach from the private
sector. 'We are looking at a number of places in north Wales which share two
characteristics. They are all economically stressed but they all have strong
potential', Mr David Farnsworth, executive director, development projects,
at the WDA points out.
In the rest of the 1990s, Mr Farnsworth points out, a policy based, as in
the past, simply on seeking to attract new investment will not suffice. A
quality dimension has to be added so that the lifestyle as well as the
industrial benefits of relocating can be sold to potential investors. This
is what the WDA hopes can be achieved on Deeside and in other locations in
Wales, including, in the north, the towns of Rhyl and Holyhead, both of
which are also seen as having both potential and problems.
The joint venture approach, which was brought by Mr Farnsworth to the WDA
from property and leisure group, Ladbroke, where he previously worked,
involves analysing with the local authority and other advisers the action
needed to re-position the local economy so that it can take advantage of
opportunities. Once these have been decided, other bodies, such as prominent
local companies and professional firms, are invited to join, and an
agreement is drawn up.
Each party is expected to make a contribution whether in terms of resources,
land or expertise, and a professional team, usually headed for the first
year at least by a WDA officer, is set up to oversee the plans.
Essentially, whatever is decided upon has to make sense to the private
sector, as the aim of the exercise is to rekindle its interest in the
opportunities which will become available. When the objectives set for the
joint venture have been met, and the various parties have derived the
benefits they were seeking, it will be disbanded.
On Deeside, following a series of meetings with the local authorities,
outside partners are now being sought, and over a period of several years a
total of roughly Pounds 15m will be committed by the agency, which, it is
hoped, will attract an even greater response from the private sector.
Though concrete proposals remain to be worked out, the scheme will involve
efforts to concentrate and upgrade retail activities and to attract other
new commercial opportunities to the town centres, accompanied by a range of
environmental initiatives.
Road schemes due to take place during the next few years around both
Connah's Quay and Shotton, and near Buckley, will also play a major part,
taking traffic away from the town centres. Larger scale shopping facilities
are also planned, for the Alyn and Deeside district as a whole, inland at
Broughton, where a private developer is proposing a 296,000 sq. ft. retail
scheme, incorporating 41 shops, and parking for 2,400 vehicles.
Further along the coast in the seaside resort of Rhyl, the problems are
those affecting most traditional British holiday towns, though the council
made an early attempt to stave these off with the development of an
all-weather wave pool complex, the Suncentre. In recognition that more
needed to be done, however, a joint venture partnership was created last
year bringing together the WDA, the Wales Tourist Board, the local authority
and other interests. Its objective is to secure developments which will help
to move the resort upmarket and thereby increase its income from visitors.
So far, investment has been mainly by the public sector in pedestrianisation
and the provision of parking, and improved facilities for entertainment.
Private sector investment is following, however, in the form of a Pounds
2.5m. scheme by Sealife Centres on the main promenade, and several proposed
new retail developments, including a 50,000sq ft Sainsbury store, for which
a planning application has been submitted.
Hotel accommodation, too, has been upgraded. Over the next financial year
some Pounds 7m of public money will be spent in West Rhyl on environmental
improvement schemes, and on upgrading housing, tourist and other public
facilities.
It is probably in Holyhead, however, that the area's urban renewal problems
are at their most complex.
Stuck out on the northwesternmost tip of Wales, its raison d'etre is its
position as the nearest point in the centre of Britain to Ireland. The
decline in passenger numbers using the port as a result of cheaper airline
fares, competition from other ports for car and ro-ro traffic, British
Rail's withdrawal last year of its Railfreight operation, and the purchase
of Sealink by Stena Line have all contributed, however, to a prolonged
period of uncertainty in the town where unemployment currently stands at 18
per cent
The largest centre in Anglesey, but still with a population of only 15,000,
Holyhead has a poor urban environment with bleak housing, a small and
congested town centre, and undistinguished warehouses, bars and other port
buildings lining the harbour road.
Yet, Holyhead, too, has its saving grace. While it may be Britain's
backdoor, it is Ireland's front entrance, a fact of some significance as the
EC single market next year approaches.
It not only offers the shortest sea crossing to the Republic, but connects
directly with Dublin, in the region of which some 80 per cent of Ireland's
population lives. As a result the future of Holyhead, and the facilities it
can offer, are regarded as being of crucial importance by the Irish
authorities and the EC.
This new interest in the port has coincided, too, with a significant change
in transport technology. The market requirement is now for new much larger
ferries, such as are being introduced on cross channel routes to France.
Similar investment on the Irish Sea routes seems likely.
Thus, the various pieces in a new Holyhead jigsaw are starting to fall into
place, which another joint venture set up last year by the WDA, has helped
to arrange.
Though detailed plans have not yet been made public, one proposal would see
Sealink Stena creating new deep water berths to the east of its existing
harbour facilities, and linking its existing operational area by a new
causeway to Salt Island to the north. A cutting to the west would create a
new access channel to the present shallow draught harbour, originally built
in the middle of the last century for sailing vessels. This would then be
made available for leisure and pleasure craft use. Total cost of the scheme
is put at around Pounds 50-Pounds 55m, a substantial proportion of which the
company would expect to receive from Government or EC sources.
Independently, the Welsh Office is being pressed to bring forward the
promised upgrading of the A5 through Anglesey to dual carriageway standard.
Once completed this will connect with the already dualled A55, giving a high
standard road through to the UK motorway network, shortening hauliers'
travelling times to and from the port. British Rail is also being pressed to
electrify the line from to Chester.
Within the town the local authority, with Welsh Office and WDA help, is
working on improvements to the housing stock and to the environment,
including pedestrianisation of parts of the shopping centre. A new station
complex has already been provided.
Visitors staying on Anglesey and passing through to Ireland will also be
encouraged to spend more time in the Holyhead area. The former Marine Yard
complex which is no longer used for engineering is being considered as a
possible site for a museum focusing on Holyhead's and Anglesey's maritime
tradition.
Most excitingly, however, if the proposed re-siting of ferry services does
go ahead, traffic heading to and from Sealink Stena and B &amp; I vessels could
be diverted away from the harbour road, and the town could develop down the
hillside towards a revitalised marina in the old harbour.
If all these plans come to fruition, Holyhead could in the not too distant
future be attracting visitors for its own sake and not just because of its
position astride the route from Britain to Ireland.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Survey of North Wales (3): Money is not everything -
Attitudes to tourists are ambivalent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON

<TEXT>
EARLIER this month the actor, Anthony Hopkins, appealed to business for help
to save Snowdonia. Without further aid, he said, the landscape would be
'scarred beyond repair'.
The National Trust already has a Pounds 2m appeal to reverse the damage done
to one of Britain's most beautiful national parks. Farmland, hedgerows, dry
stone walls and moorland have all been lost as a result of increasing
economic and social pressures on the area.
The threat to Snowdonia, where some footpaths have become as popular and
well-trodden as many main roads in Gwynedd, is likely to become even more
acute as the improvements to the A55 expressway across the top of north
Wales make it easier to get into the national park.
There is a very real danger now that visitors could endanger Snowdon itself,
with the mountain going the way of so much of the Lake District in Cumbria,
which is being slowly destroyed in the summer months by the sheer weight of
visitors, their cars and their coaches.
The threat is not new. North Wales has for long been one of the major
holidaymaking areas in Britain. Although up-to-date figures are difficult to
obtain, it is thought tourism brought in around Pounds 430m in 1989-90, a
figure that probably rose to around Pounds 500m last year, sustaining around
35,000 jobs.
Without the earning power generated by holidaymakers, north Wales would be
immeasurably worse off. Farming is already under severe threat, small rural
industries are disappearing, incoming industry is difficult to obtain and,
in any case, barely replaces what has disappeared. Tourism is, therefore,
important. What it must not do is destroy what it seeks to enhance.
Tourism is not, of course, a single entity. The holidaymakers who pour into
the caravans and self-catering flats in Colwyn Bay, Rhyl, and Abergele
probably do not venture in large numbers up the mountain.
Probably two-thirds of the 15m-or-so day visitors who flood into Clwyd and
Gwynedd do head for Snowdon, Bettws-y-Coed and its falls, the rock-climbing
centres, Bodnant's gardens, the incomparable castles at Conwy, Caernarfon
and Harlech, Lloyd-George's grave outside Criccieth and the sailing at
Porthmadog, or Beaumaris on Anglesey.
Care needs to be taken, therefore, to ensure that too great a pressure is
not put on any one centre at any one time. The Wales Tourist Board and the
local tourist bodies are aware of the need to spread the load by lengthening
the season and investing in specific attractions. But if they are to
succeed, still more needs to be invested.
Progress has certainly been made. Rhyl, which for years slumbered and gently
slid downhill, is seeking to reverse the decline. It now has an attractive
all-weather Sun Centre and is building a large theatre next to it. A major
investment in a sea-life centre will open this summer. Skytower was brought
down from the Glasgow garden festival, and a Canadian company, Forrec, is
undertaking an Pounds 8m scheme on the front.
Elsewhere, too, there are, or have been, important investments. Another
theatre capable of seating at least 1,200 in the auditorium and able to
stage the Welsh National Opera Company is nearing fruition in the gracious
Edwardian town of Llandudno.
On Anglesey, the Sea Zoo has become a popular attraction. New hotels have
opened, especially in the higher-income country-house sector. Butlins
continues to invest at Pwllheli and marinas are springing up around the
coastline.
Despite the spending and the improvements, north Wales has suffered. Last
year, early bookings were severely affected by the Gulf War, and although
trade picked up well after mid-year, 1991 was probably no better than
average. This year's outlook is for little change.
The need to get income on a rising trend in real terms is emphasised by Mr
Dewi Davies, of the Wales Tourist Board. 'Many people under-estimate how
important tourism is to us,' he says. 'It probably accounts for between 8
and 10 per cent of our gross domestic product.
'That is at least the equal of, and probably rather higher than, that of
Greece or Austria, long thought to be among the most important centres of
tourism in Europe. In Austria tourism accounts for about 8 per cent of GDP
and in Greece the figure is around 6 per cent. Tourism in north Wales is
therefore just as vital to the economy as in these other countries.'
If a balance is to be achieved between protection of the environment and
sustaining the economy some action on limiting numbers in Snowdonia is
almost certainly inevitable. But how? In a free society it is not possible
to tell people they simply cannot go to an area on any particular day. There
are plenty of questions but few answers.
Activity holidays and other niche developments need to be encouraged. To
attract that section of the community that enjoys rising incomes and the
desire to spend part of it on second holidays, more 'gracious' country
hotels are needed. Plenty have opened; more are needed.
Sailors, walkers, golfers, riders, those just wanting to laze away a couple
of days, all bring valuable extra spending. They need to be encouraged
because they frequent other than the honeypot centres.
The mass market, though, needs to be very carefully managed if it is not
seriously to undermine the long-term viability and vitality of the economy
of north Wales.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Survey of North Wales (2): It's now or never - Profile,
shadow Welsh secretary Barry Jones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN two weeks, Barry Jones could be sitting in Gwydyr House, with its views
down London's Whitehall towards the cenotaph, as secretary of state for
Wales.
If it were left to votes within Wales alone, the post would be his for the
asking. His constituency, Alyn and Deeside, returns him to the House of
Commons with a comfortable, though not by Welsh standards large majority,
and at the last election Labour scooped most of the rest of the 38 Welsh
seats.
But Mr Jones's future will not be decided in Wales alone. And as he
canvasses his constituency and lends support as shadow spokesman on Wales to
his colleagues around the rest of the country he must wonder whether the
crown is going to slip once more from his grasp, possibly for the last time.
For nine years, ever since he was elected to the shadow cabinet, he has been
Welsh secretary-in-waiting. He has watched Mr Nicholas Edwards, now Lord
Crichowell, and two English implants, Mr Peter Walker and Mr David Hunt, sit
in the office that is so near his grasp.
Indeed, for most of his 22 years in parliament he has sat on one or other of
the two front benches. Within two years of reaching Westminster, as MP for
the then East Flint, he became parliamentary private secretary to Denis
Healey.
Two years on, in 1974, he was actually in Gwydyr House where he spent five
years as parliamentary secretary to John Morris, Welsh secretary in the last
Labour government. Although in opposition after 1979 he remained on the
frontbench, first as an employment spokesman during the early years of the
Thatcher government and then as senior Welsh spokesman, the disarray that
blighted the Labour party has since kept the door to Gwydyr House, and the
Welsh Office in Cardiff, firmly closed in his face.
He would be less than human if he did not think 13 years of waiting for the
big prize, a seat around the long table in No 10 Downing Street, was enough.
Mr Jones was born and brought up in Flintshire, where his father worked in
the local steelworks before becoming a full-time agent in Bexley Heath.
There he got to know an up-and-coming young man called Ted Heath. Mr Heath
was to remember Jones senior years later when, as prime minister, Barry
Jones led a deputation to No. 10 Downing St and was courteously greeted by a
man not noted for treating juniors with grace.
For Barry Jones the links with Clwyd have never been cut, and he continues
to keep his main base in the constituency. He went to school in Hawarden,
not far from Gladstone's home, and then on to college in Bangor, before
returning to teaching near home. After one abortive attempt at getting to
Westminster, across the border at Northwich in 1966, he succeeded former
Welsh Office minister, Eirene White, in East Flint.
The apprenticeship to Mr Healey points to his political philosophy. He is a
pragmatist, a doer rather than a thinker. 'I see my role as managing
change,' he says. 'We have to make society work properly and fairly.' He is,
in other words, like Healey, on the right of the Labour party.
He is as neat in his dress as in his politics, a slim man whose dark hair
belies his 54 years. In 15 years he has seemed not to change at all and it
is possible to believe he will not over the next 15 years.
The slim line may come from his addiction to walking. He and his wife Janet
spend as much time as they can watching cricket during the summer at
Eastbourne and walking along the South Downs. He finds the Downs softer,
perhaps unconsciously more in keeping with his character, than the harsh
outlines of Snowdonia in his native land.
Another clue to his character may lie in his affection for cricket, a game
redolent of old-fashioned British virtues. As he sits over the fissiparous
group that comprises the Welsh parliamentary party it is easier to see him
as umpire than a mercurial Botham.
His willingness to compromise, to draw strands together, and to negotiate,
has been construed as a weakness among those of his party who would rather
fall at the barricades than abandon an ounce of principle. Mr Jones is
dismissive of those who wear their hearts on their sleeves, believing it is
better to get things done and improve the lot of a lot of people than to
posture.
Labour has indicated it will not radically alter the economic approach to
Wales being pursued by the Conservatives. It will continue to support the
Welsh Development Agency, the Development Board for Rural Wales and the
Wales Tourist Board. There will almost certainly be changes, but probably a
change of emphasis rather than direction.
The big difference between the parties lies in the larger matter of
constitutional reform. Labour in Wales is being swept along on the tide of
Scottish nationalism, especially that advocated by the Scottish Labour
members. That demand for reform has infected many of Mr Jones's Welsh
colleagues, some of whom want to go faster along the road to an assembly
than he would prefer.
Labour has promised an assembly during its first parliament, though not
necessarily at the same time as the Scots get theirs. To achieve that Mr
Jones would have to work hard because little real thought has been given by
the party to just what an assembly would mean or involve.
If Mr Jones passes through that door in Whitehall after election day and
gets the question of an assembly right, however, he will in the fullness of
time be able to look back on the 20th century and tell himself that his
contribution to Wales was as great as that of any of his predecessors in
Gwydyr House.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Survey of North Wales (4): Green, lovely and poor - Rural
Wales is in steady decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the restaurant at the Portmeirion hotel in the world-famous Italianate
village created by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis, the world could not look a
finer place. The gentle hills, the small cottages, the wide river estuary,
and verdant farm land proclaim a prosperity that is all-too-clearly missing
the closer one gets to actuality.
Rural north Wales, away from the tourist spots and the industrial areas of
Clwyd, is green and beautiful and a repository of values that probably have
gone for good in much of the rest of Britain. But it is also a part of the
country in which wages are as low as emigration is high, and in which the
prosperity that has lifted so much of the rest of Wales over the past 20-30
years has passed by.
In Clwyd, despite the large number of big companies which have relocated,
paying good wages, four people in every 10 earn less than the Council of
Europe's decency threshold, which was Pounds 163 a week in 1989. In that
year, one worker in every five earned less than Pounds 120 a week.
It is not the area's remoteness from urban centres of wealth, nor is it the
lack of good roads that might attract inward investment. The low wages have
meant money cannot be ploughed back into enhancing investment. The area also
suffers from a lack of job skills, especially in those sectors that are
eminently suited to the countryside.
Above all, north Wales is suffering from a dangerous downturn in farming,
one of its important occupations, and there is serious concern about the
changes that might come out of Brussels following any review of the common
agricultural policy. The hill farmers, many still hit by the consequences of
Chernobyl, which has meant their produce cannot be marketed, face changes in
their whole way of life.
To inject new economic vigour and hope into the area both the Welsh
Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales have been
working in conjunction with the local authorities to strengthen the economic
base. They have been assisted by the government which has put increased
resources into a rural initiative.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, sees the rural project as a vital part
of the government's commitment to the economic life of Wales. He has made
Pounds 25m available this year to develop a rural programme and has promised
to boost that spending to Pounds 32.5m in the 12 months starting April 1.
For Mr Hunt the rural initiative is what the valleys programme for
industrial south Wales was for his predecessor, Mr Peter Walker.
'One of our main problems,' says Mr Alun Daniel, executive director of the
Welsh Development Agency, 'is to bring prosperity to the small town and its
surrounding areas the further west you go. It is much more difficult to
interest potential investors in places such as Bethesda, Penygroes or
Llanrwst in Gwynedd than in Denbigh, further east in Clwyd.'
The WDA has drawn up a rural prosperity programme which has identified 11
action-plan areas. The strategy is to get local communities to take the
initiative in spelling out their own needs and then suggest ways in which
these might be realised.
Such plans depend for their success on leadership within the designated
communities and the WDA has deliberately sought 'drivers', or
'entrepreneurs', as Mr Hunt would prefer to call them, who will take the
lead in developing programmes.
If they are to be successful all the projects have to be bottom-up schemes,
coming from the people affected, rather than imposed top-down from the
agency. It is therefore necessary to find someone in each community who will
be responsible for getting all those concerned together, drawing up a
strategy, and suggesting ways in which problems might be overcome.
'The merit of this approach,' Mr Daniel says, 'is that it fits in squarely
with European policy. Two years ago the European Commission produced a
document, The Future of Rural Society, which talked about the need not just
for co-ordination and integration of local plans, but for the communities to
be involved in planning their own future.
'We have been working on this approach for the last five years, and both the
European programme and the government initiative fit in with our philosophy
and with what we have actually been doing.'
Some progress has been made. Take Denbigh, a dozen miles south of the
holiday centre of Rhyl. Four years ago the town was the subject of any
number of independent studies concerning local matters such as the closure
of its mental hospital and the future of tourism. These have now all been
brought together in one action plan which has linked, for instance, traffic
needs, the environment, and business opportunities.
An old building has been pulled down to make way for a road scheme that the
local authority could not have afforded; the WDA has built advance factories
and encouraged the private sector to put up more; a traffic management
scheme has been introduced.
'If we can do that for Denbigh then there is no reason why we cannot also do
it for places like Bethesda,' Mr Daniel says. There is also need for income
levels to be raised and Coed Cymru, set up by the farming unions and the
Countryside Commission, and assisted by the WDA, is endeavouring to turn one
of the area's natural products, timber, into a more profitable end-product.

Property

IF IT were not for the local authorities and the Welsh Development Agency
the property scene in north Wales would, with one exception, look sick.
Developers have shied away from the area with the result that most new ideas
came from the public sector.
The one exception has been the Redrow group, a fast-expanding UK-wide
company, which has its headquarters on the St David's business park at
Ewloe, which it built itself, and where it also opened a year ago the only
four-star hotel in north Wales.
Redrow, with a Pounds 100m-plus turnover a year and building operations
throughout the UK, has already attracted prime names to its business park.
Barclays Bank, Allied Dunbar, Bank of Wales and Scottish Amicable have all
moved to the site.
Now the company is expanding nearby at Northop Hall, putting up a European
headquarters for Kimberly-Clark, the US paper concern, as part of a Pounds
40m development that will eventually include another hotel, a golf course
and housing.
'We aim to attract other international companies to the site,' says Mr
Jeremy Williams, Redrow's commercial development director.
'The importance of this development,' says Mr Glyn Pittendreigh, the WDA's
property manager for north Wales, 'is that it is in an end of the market we
are hoping to develop strongly. The need is to go upmarket and provide space
for slightly different users, the sort of people who have already arrived at
St David's or our own development outside Bangor, Parc Menai.'
The sort of user Mr Pittendreigh has in mind is Pearl Assurance or Targed,
the north Wales training and enterprise council, which are both to be found
on Parc Menai, a development at the point where the A55 expressway leaves
the mainland and crosses to Anglesey.
Parc Menai, which is being undertaken in conjunction with Gwynedd County
Council and Arfon borough council, is the agency's flagship at the moment.
A larger business park, covering 150 acres and being developed in
conjunction with Clwyd County Council and Rhuddlan borough council, is
planned for St. Asaph, however. A 50,000sq ft speculative building is being
put in, and the authorities hope the first tenants will be looking at the
site this time next year.
An even larger site, the Glyn Rhonwy research park, is being developed by
Arfon council on a former slate quarry at Llanberis in the shadow of
Snowdon.
One prestige tenant, Euro DPC, which makes medical diagnostic kits, has
already been attracted from Witney in Oxfordshire, and phase one of its
development is under way.
If Euro DPC meets its targets it could build up to a further eight phases on
the site.
The other growth area is Wrexham, where the technology park is benefiting
from its proximity to Chester, a town that has probably reached the limits
of its ability to absorb newcomers, and Deeside. A number of service
companies have found their way across the border into Wrexham and the town
is aiming to meet demand not just from financial services companies but also
to develop medical links.
Wrexham has one potential site of great importance in the former Brymbo
steelworks. Steelmaking ended almost two years ago but its parent, United
Engineering Steels, has still not made up its mind about what to do with the
400 acres site. About a quarter could be used for development.
Deeside, too, has made a successful start, with 90 factories providing work
for 5,000 people on a 1,000-acre site and with Toyota's engine plant the
flagship development.
An area such as north Wales must inevitably place considerable emphasis on
small units and small estates to provide jobs in largely rural towns such as
Denbigh, Porthmadog, Ruthin and Bethesda.
None of these will support large-scale investment: at Llangollen a
three-storey mill has been refurbished as being suitable for offices and
craft workshops, a small business park is about to be started at Porthmadog
and a marina with associated small industries is being developed at
Pwllheli. A private developer has put up nursery units at Ruthin.
The aim of the WDA is to involve as many outsiders in joint ventures as it
can. This approach, highly successful in south Wales, can help overcome the
low returns obtainable.
Private-sector developers are more noticeable by their absence, though one
or two locally-based companies, such as Macbryde in Colwyn Bay and Watkin
Jones &amp; Sons in Bangor, have prospered supplying tailor-made developments
for clients, and are now expanding outside their traditional areas. There
has been little rental growth on small units, and with the private developer
having to go for long leases it is left to the public sector to offer the
shorter leases that sometimes attract companies thinking of relocating.
Parc Menai has been able to let at rates of around Pounds 10 a sq ft, but
elsewhere about Pounds 4 is more normal for an office and between Pounds 3
and Pounds 4 for factories. 'For a developer,' says Mr Pittendreigh, 'this
is a good time to be in the market.
'Prices are low, and when the upturn in the economy comes there will be
considerable interest in the area. It could not be a better time to get into
property.'

TWO months ago Austin Taylor Communications, a manufacturer of
telecommunicaions equipment employing 145 people in Bethesda, Snowdonia, was
rescued from almost certain closure when Communications Systems of the US
bought the Welsh company.
The decline and rescue of Austin Taylor was a microcosm of the highs and
lows which face the economy of north Wales. Like the rest of the UK, north
Wales is now deeply depressed. Hotpoint and Brother are just two of several
companies that have had to lay off workers. Hotpoint has also given its
1,500 employees at Llandudno Junction and Bodelwyddan paid holidays as it
seeks to run down large stocks.
'The recession did not really arrive in north Wales until the end of last
year,' says Mr Huw Thomas, chief executive of Gwynedd county council, 'but
now it is here with a vengeance.'
Mr Thomas's timing is probably an optimistic reading of events. Further
east, in Clwyd, the recession arrived considerably earlier: in the past 18
months unemployment has jumped from 5.8 per cent to over 10 per cent. In
Gwynedd it has also been rising steadily in the past 12 months: from January
1991 it went up by almost a quarter to 12,200.
Nevertheless, north Wales, as Austin Taylor has shown, can still boast
success stories. The new American owners intend to use Austin Taylor not
just as a base to supply the British market, but also as a point from which
to attack the whole of Europe.
They will have fellow countrymen not far away. Euro DPC, the European arm of
Diagnostic Products Corporation, of Los Angeles, is to move its British
centre for the production of diagnostic kits from Witney, in Oxfordshire, to
Llanberis, this summer, employing 80 at first but 300 eventually.
The importance of Austin Taylor and Euro DPC is that they have shown it is
possible to trade in a largely rural area and also bring high-income
employees to a part of the country which has traditionally been around the
bottom of most pay leagues. A third of Euro DPC's employees are graduates on
salaries not often seen in north Wales in concentrated numbers.
North Wales has over the past 20 years won a considerable share of foreign
inward investment. Most of that, from companies like Brother, Shotton Paper,
Continental Can, Kimberly-Clark, Sharp, Kelloggs and most recently the
Pounds 140m Toyota engine plant, has gone to Clwyd. The rescue of Austin
Taylor and the arrival of Euro DPC shows that inward investment is slowly
being sucked further west.
The way in which industry is clearly looking further into Wales is welcomed
by all the development authorities. Less welcome is the appreciable decline
in the level of inquiries. 'There is a distinct lack of confidence among
potential incomers at the moment', says Mr Paul Roberts, head of economic
development at Clwyd County Council.
'There always seems to be another reason for decisions to be deferred. We
are still getting inquiries but the number is a fraction of what it once
was. And businesses are taking much longer to reach a decision.'
Like Gwynedd's Huw Thomas, he believes the serious investors will not return
in strength until they can see an end to the recession. In the middle of a
general election campaign they agree a further period of waiting is
inevitable.
They, and almost everyone else concerned with the economic health of the
region, are placing great faith in the ability of the A55 expressway across
the top of north Wales to generate new opportunities.
The almost-completed dual-carriageway road links the English motorway system
at Chester to the west of the region as far as Bangor. The government has
already announced plans to extend dual carriageways across Anglesey to
Holyhead, and the Welsh Development Agency, in conjunction with the local
authorities and the port authorities, is helping to upgrade Holyhead to make
it the main 'gateway' to Britain for Irish trade.
There are tangible signs that the improved A55, which makes most parts of
north Wales no further than an hour's drive from Manchester airport - an
important consideration for companies like Euro DPC - has already started to
attract investment.
A business park at Bangor, another to be built at St Asaph, motorway service
stations, and hotels by Forte and Rank, are springing up along its length.
With the opening of the Conwy tunnel by the Queen last October, a notorious
bottleneck has been removed - an hour to negotiate the river and get around
Henry III's magnificent castle was not uncommon at peak times - offering the
prospect of more visitors.
Caernarfon, with its equally magnificent castle and history, is to be given
a long-needed face-lift and other centres such as Porthmadog, Bettws-y-Coed,
and even Harlech hope to benefit from a combination of more businesses and
more visitors.
The main concern now, though, is to ensure that the ever-present conflict
between needs of the environment and of the economy does not lead to the one
destroying the other.
In Snowdonia, north Wales has one of the most magnificent areas of natural
beauty in Britain, a home to walkers, climbers, lonely farms, peace and
solitude. Enormous pressures already exist on Snowdon itself, the sort of
pressures that are threatening to destroy the Lake District in Cumbria.
Snowdon can barely handle more visitors without its very nature being
eroded.
Tourism cannot simply be turned off, like a tap, however. It contributes far
too much to the economy generally. But if more industry arrives as a result
of the opening of the expressway there is a potential danger that the area
will simply not be able to cope with the traffic, let alone the needs of the
newcomers.
On top of these economic pressures this part of north Wales faces a further
danger. It is the last real bastion of the Welsh language. Most people in
Gwynedd not only speak Welsh but also use it as their everyday language;
fewer do so in Clwyd but the number there is not inconsiderable. Monoglot
incomers not only put pressure on housing, forcing prices far beyond what
lowly-paid locals can afford, but threaten to undermine the culture not just
of the area but also of the wider Wales.
These fears have led extremists among the nationalists to pursue a vendetta
against incomers - and not solely English newcomers - by burning their
holiday homes. Some 200 have been destroyed over the last two decades and
the ability of the extremists to continue with acts of arson have been
considerably aided by the inability of the police to bring charges against
anyone.
Few Welshmen publicly defend the burnings. While they continue those
concerned with the economic health of the area will have an even harder job
convincing business of the attractions of the area.
The issue of jobs versus the environment is also surfacing further east
between Prestatyn and Holywell where Hamilton Brothers Oil and Gas wants to
build a gas-oil terminal next to the Point of Ayr colliery, the only one
left in north Wales. National Power also has plans for a Pounds 1bn
gas-fired power station.
The project, which is to go to public inquiry, would not generate a large
number of jobs, perhaps 50 in the terminal and 50 in the power station, with
another 200 in associated industries, but Clwyd's Mr Roberts says 'it would
help to bring in new industry to the area and give the economy a boost'.
North Wales has been remarkably successful in attracting new industries, as
the old staples of farming, steel, slate and tourism have taken heavy
knocks. Medicare, optoelectronics, motor components, electronics and
financial services have all found a home in Clwyd.
In Gwynedd telecommunications and television have grown strongly; Caernarfon
and the surrounding area have become one of the most important centres in
Britain outside London for television production, and the county is about to
launch a drive to attract more production companies to use its unrivalled
scenery for shooting film.
The area already has a strong arts base, with Oriel Eryri, an outstation of
the National Museum of Wales, in Snowdonia, and Llangollen, home of the
world-famous folk festival, in Clwyd. This is being complemented by new
theatre building: one in Llandudno seating up to 1,500 that could act as
north Wales's home for the equally world-famous Welsh National Opera Company
and a permanent setting, incorporating a theatre and conference facilities,
on the Llangollen site.
There remain gaps. 'The most important is to upgrade skills,' according to
Ms Enid Rowlands, chief executive of Targed, the training and enterprise
council in Gwynedd. 'We have the people, we have the motivation, we have the
initiative, but we must improve our skills.'
That initiative is exemplified by Clwyd which last Saturday led a team of
council officials and local businessmen to a technology-transfer conference
in Brastislava, Czechoslovakia. 'We have had a man in Russia several times
in the past year,' says Mr Roberts, 'and now we want to see what we can do
in Czechoslovakia. If inward investment is harder to get then perhaps we can
get into some form of joint ventures in eastern Europe.'
It's the sort of approach that does not admit of defeat.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Searching for a longer-term strategy -
Tokyo's need for a change of tactics to revitalise its market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE last week's fall of the Nikkei average to below the psychologically
important 20,000 level shook investor confidence, some short-term traders
and brokers still seem to be hoping old tactics will push up share prices.
A swirl of speculative activity during the past month has boosted shares of
bio-technology companies as Japanese brokers, eager to lift faltering
commission revenue, have turned to 'thematic trading' by promoting drug and
food companies which are developing new 'miracle' drugs. Amid a slowing
economy, brokers also hailed the drug sector's defensive qualities,
unaffected by the economic cycle or currency movements.
A recent announcement by the Tokyo Stock Exchange to put Okamoto Industries,
a leading condom maker, on its watch list due to the stock's volatility has
dampened the enthusiasm. Okamoto had been one of the leading stocks in the
Aids theme, and some brokers criticised the TSE's action as harming the
market. Okamoto rose to Y1,370 on March 12, 58.7 per cent above its 1992 low
of Y863 on January 27, but it has since retreated, closing at Y1,170
yesterday.
Last month the share price of Ono Pharmaceutical, a medium-sized drug
company based in Osaka, surged on reports that sales from its new diabetes
drug 'Kinedak', to be launched in April, would reach an annual Y25bn. Ono's
warrant bond expiring in August has given another reason for brokers to
promote the stock, on the back of speculation that its main underwriter will
try to lift the share price.
Thematic trading has been a driving force in the Tokyo market in the past.
Themes were frequently generated by the Big Four brokerages - Nomura
Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities -
trying to promote shares of companies of which they are the main
underwriters.
The themes provided a basis for brokers to recommend stocks. The
orchestrated move would prompt short-term trading by institutional
investors, and convince individuals to commit funds to the market. A
consensus would be made in the market as second and third-tier brokers
would, in turn, promote the theme stocks put forward by the Big Four.
For example, the news that Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, the American basketball
star, was infected by the HIV virus, triggered the 'Aids theme'.
Thematic trading briefly subsided after the revelation of last year's stock
scandals, where brokers allegedly manipulated share prices of Tokyu, a
leading department store.
Japanese brokers claim they have now changed their strategy to promotion of
middle to long-term investments and advising clients on their 'portfolios',
rather than trying to increase turnover by urging them to quickly take
profits.
Mr Yoshinobu Isokawa, managing director of Yamaichi Securities' market
planning department, says most branch managers, who had been used to
recommending stocks with prospects of rising within a month, were initially
shocked by such methods. 'Both client and sales people were too obsessed
with short-term gains. That has to change.'
However, analysts say that without trading themes brokers are at a loss
about how to do business. Now some brokers are complaining that the main
cause of the current slump is the Big Four not coming up with scenarios and
themes, says Mr Kiyoshi Nikami, senior economist at Japan Securities
Research Institute.
Daily average volume on the Tokyo market's first section dropped to 172m
shares in February, the lowest since June 1982. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, expressed his frustration about the trading
conditions by sending out letters urging brokerages to step up sales
activities. Mr Nagaoka said investors needed information to make investment
decisions.
Brokers, desperate for themes, have tried to revive old stories such as the
Aids theme. Along with Okamoto, Meiji Milk Products, a dairy company which
is developing an Aids cure, has seen volatile share price movements.
Mr Nikami says that unless brokers break off from thematic trading and learn
the basics of stock sales, the market will not recover from its current
slump. Until then, the Tokyo stock market will probably remain its obscure
self.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney falls 4% on
Goldman Sachs report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BOURSES recovered after a shaky start to the week, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS recouped some of Monday's losses but failed to break decisively above
1,900. The CAC-40 index touched 1,903.47 before closing 11.69 better at
1,896.26 in turnover of FFr2.2bn.
Euro Disney was the day's most active share, dropping FFr6.40 or 4 per cent
to FFr153.50 with a heavy 1.05m shares traded, on rumours that Goldman Sachs
had issued a negative report.
Goldman Sachs's analyst in New York, Mr Richard Simon, later confirmed that
he was telling clients to sell the stock because it was overvalued and that
earnings growth would be modest. His new EPS forecasts stand at 65 centimes
for 1992, FFr1.75 for 1993, and peaking at FFr3.65 in 1995.
News that the Italian media magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, had decided not
to rescue the troubled television station, La Cinq, hit the market five
minutes before the close. Hachette, which owns 25 per cent of La Cinq,
dropped FFr3.40 or 2 per cent to FFr170.10, while TF1 added FFr8.40 to
FFr393.30 on good volume of 88,441 shares on hopes that it will win
advertising revenue from La Cinq.
FRANKFURT recovered from an early fall, and dealers detected cautious buying
interest from domestic and foreign institutions. The DAX index fell to
1,703.56 in the first half-hour but support around 1,700 helped it to
rebound to close just 4.34 down at 1,713.11. The FAZ index, calculated at
midsession, fell 4.19 to 694.94 in steady turnover of DM5.7bn.
BMW built on recent gains with a rise of DM9.10 to DM571. Reluctance to sell
ahead of the dividend payments at the end of April kept chemicals steady,
with Hoeshst up 70 pfg to DM255.40 and Bayer off 30 pfg at DM295.70.
Financials were neglected on news that M3 money supply grew by 8.5 per cent
in February, well outside the Bundesbank's target and reducing the chance of
an early cut in interest rates. Deutsche Bank fell DM3.50 to DM713.
Hoesch rose DM7 or 2.8 per cent to DM255.50 in speculative buying. News that
Krupp, which has 51 per cent of Hoesch, has been changed into a joint stock
company revived speculation that it would buy in the outstanding shares in
Hoesch.
Asko added another DM15 to DM885 on rumours that its share price was being
lifted ahead of a capital increase, which could take place earlier rather
than later this year.
MILAN disappointed dealers who had expected a firmer market following
Credito Italiano's better-than-expected 1991 results on Monday and
widespread speculation that the Agnelli group would come out of the Perrier
battle unscathed. After a promising start, a lack of buying interest pushed
prices lower, Generali in particular, and open outcry trading finished
earlier than usual. The Comit index fell 5.11 to 505.50 in turnover
estimated at L60-80bn after L71.7bn.
Ifi, the holding company of the Agnelli group, rose L500 or 4 per cent to
L12,870 but Fiat only rose L19 to L4,868. Generali fell L490 or 1.7 per cent
to L28,990 but dealers said there were no reasons for the fall. Pirelli rose
L17 to L1,282 on news that its capital increase was almost fully subscribed.
ZURICH recovered from a disappointing morning session when higher interest
rates depressed sentiment, and the SMI index closed 5.9 higher at 1,824.1.
Nestle bearers advanced SFr40 to SFr9,480 following the successful
conclusion in its fight to win control of Perrier. But its registered shares
slipped SFr60 to SFr9,330.
Strong foreign interest was noted in Brown Boveri and its bearers rose SFr80
to SFr3,870. George Fischer, which reported a 47 per cent fall in 1991 group
profit on Monday, saw its bearers lose SFr27 to SFr993. However, its
certificates gained SFr5 to SFr193 after the company announced plans to swap
them for bearers.
AMSTERDAM saw the office supplies group Ahrend decline by more than 5 per
cent or Fl 7 at Fl 130 after announcing a 40 per cent fall in 1991 net
profit after the close of Monday. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.1 to 124.9
in turnover of Fl 478m.
Hunter Douglas improved Fl 2.40 or 3.6 per cent to Fl 68.80 after analysts
said that the outlook for the building materials group remains good.
STOCKHOLM featured Volvo, its B shares adding SKr3 to Skr415 on renewed
speculation that it will merge with Renault of France. The Affarsvarlden
General Index closed 0.2 lower at 1,001.4.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei below 20,000 as
Bank fails to act

SHARE PRICES turned down on broad-based selling yesterday, and the Nikkei
average once again fell below the 20,000 level on disappointment that the
Bank of Japan had failed to cut the official discount rate, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally 348.03 down at 19,891.57 after opening at
the day's high of 20,199.52 and moving to the session's low of 19,866.32 in
the afternoon.
Volume increased slightly to 300m shares from 280m. Falls overwhelmed rises
by 800 to 198, with 149 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks ended 20.33 weaker at 1,439.55, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index dipped 4.09 to 1,119.53.
Heavy selling by companies ahead of the last trading session for March
accounts today pulled down share prices. Index-linked sales by arbitrageurs
also depressed the index, as low-liquidity component stocks of the Nikkei
lost ground.
Rumours that financial troubles at a Canadian real estate company would hit
Japanese banks added to the pessimism. Most market participants are now
hoping for an easing in monetary policy after Friday's announcement of the
government's economic stimulus package and industrial production figures for
February.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for market sentiment, dropped
Y19,000 to set an all-time low of Y640,000. Other leading high-technology
issues also declined, with Sony shedding Y20 to Y4,080.
Small-capital component stocks of the Nikkei average fell sharply on concern
that the index may be restructured later this year, after financial
authorities complete their review. Daito Woollen Spinning and Weaving lost
Y210 to Y1,350 and Shinagawa Refractories Y120 to Y1,110.
Financial shares ran into selling by companies ahead of the March
book-closing, while banks were affected by market rumours. Industrial Bank
of Japan finished Y80 cheaper at Y2,360 and Nomura Securities Y30 off at
Y1,220.
Bio-technology issues were lower on profit-taking. Meiji Milk Products fell
Y25 to Y891 and Mochida Pharmaceutical Y90 to Y3,690. However, Nagase, a
chemical product trader, jumped Y38 to Y815 on rumours of a new Aids cure.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 266.46 to 21,429.62 in volume of 613.9m
shares. The index fell on liquidation by tokkin - specified money trusts -
and investment trusts. Active cross-trading by companies ahead of book
closings for the current year to March pushed up activity.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday. Seoul, closed for the
parliamentary election, reopens today.
HONG KONG made up for early declines with some afternoon bargain hunting.
The Hang Seng index lost only 8.82 at 5,052.32. Turnover eased to HKDollars
2.47bn from HKDollars 2.57bn.
In the strong utilities sector, Hong Kong and China Gas added 60 cents at
HKDollars 15.80 as investors switched out of China Light, which slipped 75
cents to HKDollars 32.00.
TAIWAN was pulled higher by late buying of financial shares ahead of their
issue of stock dividends on April 1. The weighted index rose 104.94, or 2.2
per cent, to 4,790.10. Turnover was TDollars 20.6bn (TDollars 17.26bn).
MANILA fell below the 1,100 support level as investors stayed on the
sidelines, fearing that May's national elections might be marred by
violence. The composite index shed 7.16 to 1,094.63 in turnover of 87m
pesos, down from 91m.
The market was also weighed down by the 3bn-peso share offering by
Philippine National Bank, which ends on Friday, and the overnight decline of
Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New York.
AUSTRALIA eased slightly, the All Ordinaries index losing 3.3 to 1,583.4 in
turnover of ADollars 156m. BTR Nylex gained 2 cents to ADollars 2.48 on
reports that it planned to proceed with a takeover bid for Westinghouse
Brake and Signal.
TNT, up 9 cents the previous day, relinquished 4 cents to ADollars 1.91: it
said on Monday that it expects its European distribution network to move
into profit in 1992/93. News Corp declined 4 cents to ADollars 17.96 on
profit-taking.
BOMBAY, closed on Monday, reached a record high yesterday, the BSE index
ending 426.05 ahead at 3,669.58, after touching 3,688.53.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index put on 4.04 to 1,439.78 in volume
of 33.5m shares, against 35.1m.
KUALA LUMPUR rose in early trading before profit-taking pulled the market
back. The composite index finished a marginal 0.57 up at 609.90 in turnover
of MDollars 146m.
NEW ZEALAND moved ahead slightly and the NZSE-40 index ended 1.89 firmer at
1,438.18 in turnover of NZDollars 11.5m. Lion Nathan appreciated 4 cents to
NZDollars 3.86, with foreign buying noted.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US soyabean growers' patience
runs out - Producers say they will wait no longer for EC action on subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'OUR NEIGHBOURS had a little dog that yapped all day until 8 o'clock at
night,' said Mr Ken Bader, a spokesman for the American Soybean Association.
'It kinda annoyed us, but we didn't say anything. Then they got a Great Dane
and the two dogs barked until 10 at night. When we complained they said,
'Why didn't you ever say anything before?' It's the same with the EC and its
oilseeds regime.'
The soyabean producers had waited until 1987 to go to the General Agreement
Tariffs and Trade with their complaint against oilseeds, but the annoyances
had been building up for years. In 1962, US negotiators had won them a zero
binding (duty free status) on soyabeans in the Kennedy Round, and for years
they had made full use of the advantage. In 1970s there was 'a little spike'
in the European Community's subsidies programme. In the early 1980s there
was a 'tremendous spike' and then the subsidisation began 'in spades', said
Mr Bader.
'They kept telling us, they'd keep importing American beans, and we kept
waiting for things to get better.' Ultimately, the sector's sales fell by an
estimated Dollars 2.3bn a year.
US soyabean exports to the EC fell from 9.97m tonnes in 1987-88 to 5.42m
tonnes in 1990-91. Soyabean meal sales went from 3.09m tones in 1986-87 to
160,000 in 1990-91.
In December 1987, the ASA filed a Section 301 Unfair Trade Petition in the
Gatt, charging that the EC had 'nullified and impaired' their duty-free
commitment for soyabeans and soyabean meal by offering lucrative subsidies
to growers and processors of EC oilseeds.
Two years later the Gatt dispute panel ruled the EC programme illegal. The
ruling was formally adopted by the Gatt Council in January 1990, and EC
authorities promised to implement the report starting with crops harvested
in 1991. The EC failed to act until late last year, however, and, according
to the US government, the new plan it proposed continued to violate previous
trade agreements.
The original Gatt panel was reconvened to rule if the new EC oilseeds
programme complied with the original panel finding. It ruled last week that
it did not.
Now the soyabean producers say their patience is exhausted and they will no
longer wait for the EC to take action. Although rapeseed has already been
planted, they are insisting that a real reform programme be addressed to
1992 crops. There is still spring rape to be seeded as well as some
sunflower seeds, Mr Bader said.
Either the US and the EC would reach an agreement before the next Gatt
Council meeting on April 21 or the US would begin to draw up lists for
sanctions.
However, said Mr Bader, the ASA wanted market access, not retaliation.
'The EC must realise that this issue is not going to go away,' said Mr Gary
Riedel, president of the ASA. 'If the US cannot depend on trade agreements
already in effect, what is the point of pursuing additional agreements? The
integrity of existing and future trade agreements is on the line.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels denies blame for
American woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is losing market share for oilseeds in the European Community to low
cost producers like Argentina and Brazil, and this has nothing to do with
the new EC subsidy regime just rejected by a General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade panel, according to EC officials, writes David Gardner in
Brussels.
Brussels has not yet formally reacted to last week's Gatt ruling, but
officials privately dispute the premises of the panel's reasoning, and
question the tactics of the American Soybean Association, the powerful lobby
which induced the US administration to refile the complaint.
EC figures show that between 1985 and 1990, soyabean imports from the US
fell from 7.5m tonnes to 6.3m tonnes, or from 58 per cent to 48 per cent of
total imports. During the same period Brazil increased its market share for
soyabeans in the EC from 23 to 31 per cent, and Argentina improved its share
from 15 to 18 per cent. Total EC imports remained stable - 13m tonnes in
1985 and 13.2m tonnes in 1990 - but the players in the market changed.
Officials argue that US expectations have not been met in a market to which
they have highly prized duty-free entry through a deal struck during Gatt's
Kennedy Round in 1962. The US objective, they conclude, is to dismantle all
oilseed subsidies in the EC, 'but even if they did, it doesn't mean the US
is going to pick up the EC market,' one official remarked.
Though the EC produces significant quantities of rapeseed and sunflower
seed, its output of more sensitive soyabeans is relatively modest - rising
from 347,000 tonnes in 1985 to 1.96m tonnes in 1990, in part because of
Spain's entry into the community in 1986.
Agriculture officials from member states also underline that the US
irrevocably weakened its own position in the EC by slapping an embargo on
its soya exports in the mid-70s during a domestic shortage. This created
security of supply concerns in Europe and opened the gate to Latin American
producers.
The EC had hoped to settle the long-standing row over soya - which along
with wheat is at the heart of the transatlantic farm dispute. To comply with
Gatt's 1990 ruling against its oilseeds regime, from June it proposes to end
discrimination against non-EC producers, pay direct income support to
farmers based on past yield rather than current production, and make this
production more sensitive to market prices.
Brussels wanted an Ecu163 a tonne reference price, based on world market
average of the past four years. It planned Ecu384 per hectare compensation
for the cut, giving farmers an average Ecu768 per hectare based on average
EC yield of 2.36 tonnes per hectare. Payments would alter once world prices
fluctuated up or down by more than 8 per cent. Neither the US soya lobby,
nor the Gatt, are impressed.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium jump 'reporting
error'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS ABOUT a sudden aluminium production surge were allayed yesterday. The
International Primary Aluminium Institute admitted a reporting error had
caused it to report last Friday that daily average output in February had
jumped by 900 tonnes when, in fact, it was unchanged from the January level,
writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent.
Aluminium for delivery in three months had fallen to Dollars 1,290 a tonne
on the London Metal Exchange and seemed set to go lower before the IPAI
statement. Then it recovered to Dollars 1,307.50, unchanged from Monday's
close.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, commented: 'This shakes confidence in
the IPAI. We will be wary until we know the full story'.
Hoogovens, the Netherlands metals group, said it was shelving a Fl 525m
(Pounds 163m) plan to modernise and expand annual capacity at its Delfzijl
smelter from 97,000 to 120,000 tonnes.

<TEXT>
GERMANY WILL support new Portuguese proposals aimed at breaking the impasse
over reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy, Mr Ignaz
Kiechle, German agriculture minister said in Lisbon yesterday.
Portugal currently holds the six-month rotating EC presidency and Mr Kiechle
held bilateral talks with Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese minister of
agriculture, over ways of speeding up agricultural reform.
'We wanted to study and seek jointly (with Portugal) the possibility of
common action at the European level. We want to do everything possible to
complete agricultural reform rapidly. Without doubt, these talks represented
progress. Our Portuguese partners have our full confidence and will have our
full support at the European level,' Mr Kiechle said.
The talks covered all the main aspects of agricultural reform put forward by
the European Commission, and were designed to prepare for the next meeting
of EC agriculture ministers at the end of this month. Many of the proposals
have met opposition from member states, particularly those dealing with
production controls for cereals and cattle, with the system of 'set aside'
whose opponents say discriminates against large farms, and over future
prices for cereals, Mr Cunha said. Portugal as EC president had to try to
find flexible and more acceptable alternatives 'that did not prejudice
production controls and the budget", he said.
The two ministers agreed that reform could not be achieved without taking
into account the lives of the community's farmers. 'We agree on the need for
a policy with a human face,' Mr Kiechle said.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC legislation planned on oil
and gas licensing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is today set to approve draft legislation that would
guarantee free and open competition between companies applying for oil and
gas exploration and drilling licences in the European Community.
It is the first EC directive aimed directly at ensuring that oil producers
enjoy the benefits of the single European market from January 1, 1993.
Controversial measures to guarantee a free market in other energy sectors -
electricity and gas - have already been approved by the commission.
Under the new directive, governments would be required to publish the
criteria on which they grant licences to oil and gas companies and would be
unable to discriminate against applicants - for example, on grounds of
nationality.
According to EC officials, some member states allow only their national
natural resources companies to drill for oil and gas. Others attach
unacceptable conditions on price and the location of production plants, or
insist applicants work with particular partners or supply specified
customers.
The draft directive would not force national governments to accept the
lowest bid for exploration and drilling contracts, and member states could
continue to impose restrictions on the grounds of national security, or to
prevent the depletion of natural resources. But they would have to eliminate
other discriminatory conditions.
Britain, which controls licensing in much of the North Sea oil and gas
fields, will back the broad thrust of the proposal, which it believes will
help open up new EC markets to its oil and gas producers. 'We already
operate a transparent and non-discriminatory regime in the North Sea,' said
one British official yesterday.
Meanwhile, controversial proposals to build up Community oil stocks have
been dropped from today's commission agenda. The plan - a brainchild of Mr
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner - is still likely to
come before the commission in the coming weeks and will incense many EC oil
producers. They believe the industry is already sufficiently well-prepared
to cope with an oil crisis without Brussels' interference.

<TEXT>
THE US has withdrawn from membership of the International Sugar
Organisation, a body it once 'reformed' in accordance with free market
principles as a 'study group' with little influence over prices.
Launched in the 1960s to stabilise prices, the group has been reformed
several times at the urging of the US. It is now described as 'a forum for
discussing trade and statistics'.
However, US trade officials say this year's 'deal breaker' was over the
issue the contribution formulation. The US said it had to be made more
transparent and based on the relationship between the members and the sugar
market. The US was paying 9 per cent of the budget - about Dollars 160,000.
'The argument was that the poor countries should pay less,' a US trade
official said. 'We said everyone should have a stake in it.'

NICKEL was under pressure on the LME, although the market closed off a 2 1/2
 month low of Dollars 7,320 a tonne for three-month metal. Dealers said the
decline below Dollars 7,400 in the morning prompted technical and stop-loss
selling, with short covering rallies soon losing steam. European end-user
demand is light and fresh Russian metal is arriving in Europe, but 1992
tonnages are lagging behind last year's levels. Three-month TIN was quietly
steadier at the close and looking to move above resistance around Dollars
5,670. Despite slack end-user interest the market remains underpinned by
premiums for quality brands. London COCOA prices moved higher, supported by
a stronger dollar against sterling. Dealers, noting an absence of fresh
fundamental news, said there was little expectation that much progress would
be made at this week's ICCO talks in London. Some said the expectation of
Ivory Coast sales was still hanging over the market, but others said concern
had weakened. GOLD appeared to be finding support on the London bullion
market in the Dollars 336 to Dollars 337 area from consumer buying, but is
being capped on the upside by producer selling at about Dollars 340 a troy
ounce.

MR ROBERT NOTTLE, the future chairman of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC), said the regulatory watchdog wanted to see Chinese 'B'
shares listed on the Hong Kong stock market, but only when several big
issues had been resolved. These include levels of disclosure and investor
protection in China.
Mr Nottle was speaking after the Hong Kong government officially announced
the departure from the SFC of the current chairman, Mr Robert Owen,
following the completion of his three years of office. Mr Nottle will take
over on May 1.
Mr Nottle said the main areas he intended to pursue were market development,
including the gradual integration of the Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese
capital markets, and investor protection.
He said discussions were already taking place with Hong Kong's Monetary
Affairs Branch over the possibility of broadening the commission's powers of
investigation to help stamp out abuse of minority shareholders.
Mr Owen has in the past called for the government to set up its own
investigative team to utilise existing statutory powers, or to expand the
remit of the commission to cover investigations into fraud and abuse of
minorities.
It is clear, that this is a theme that Mr Nottle intends to continue.

teething difficulties
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITY options trading on the London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (Liffe) is undergoing some teething problems after last
weekend's merger of London's futures and options markets.
The merger involved a change of clearing and trading systems for equity
option traders from the London Traded Options Market (LTOM). The shift to
the new systems was described by one trader as 'smooth, considering the
number of adjustments which had to be made'.
The largest hiccup was that the notification to traders of the exercise of
FT-SE index options was not delivered in sufficient time on Monday evening
to ensure traders were aware of any changes to their positions. As a result,
the opening of trading in the index option contract was delayed for 15
minutes. The information should have been delivered by Liffe's Trade
Registration System (TRS), which option traders moved to as a result of the
merger. On LTOM, the system of notification was completed manually.
Liffe said the problem was not expected to recur.
The initial difficulties of adapting to new trading systems are expected to
be overcome shortly. But the future of the equity options market hangs in
the balance. Liffe is working on a business plan for the equity options
market. The success of the implementation of the plan may be the determining
factor.

<TEXT>
BSN, a leading company in the French food industry which has played a
pivotal part in the bitter battle for Perrier mineral water, yesterday
announced a 26 per cent increase in net profits to FFr3.91bn (Dollars
690.8m) in 1991 from FFr3.09bn in 1990.
BSN, which already owns well-known European food brands such as Evian
mineral water and Danone yoghurt, has added the Volvic mineral water brand
to its drinks interests as a result of its role in the Perrier affair.
The group, chaired by Mr Antoine Riboud, dramatically switched sides during
the bid by backing Nestle, the Swiss food group which is its arch-rival in
the European food market, against its traditional allies, the Agnelli family
of Italy.
Its decision to fight the Agnellis by staging a FFr6bn counter-bid for the
Exor property company was a critical component of Nestle's battle plan. Mr
Riboud maintained throughout that the bid would not affect BSN's
cross-interests with the Agnellis in Italy, such as the Galbani food
business.
The acquisition of Volvic forms part of the long-term restructuring of BSN's
activities. Last year, it sold its interests in champagne and also part of
its biscuit business. The impact of these disposals boosted net profits
which would otherwise have risen by a more modest 11.4 per cent, according
to the group.
Earnings per share increased to FFr66.1, against FFr53.4, or to FFr59
without the exceptional profits from the disposals. The board proposed
raising the dividend for 1991 to FFr14.5 from FFr13. Group turnover rose by
25 per cent to FFr66bn, compared with FFr52.9bn.

AMERICAN Express and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), two corporate
giants under pressure from nimble rivals, have joined forces in an attempt
to woo the US small business community.
They have announced that AT&amp;T's corporate calling card and the American
Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses
as a single entity.
The system will allow small businesses that are American Express corporate
card members to charge AT&amp;T telecommunications expenses along with other
out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement.
American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card
operations. American Express still dominates this sector, but over the past
year some key US corporate customers have switched to its rivals.
AT&amp;T, which has also had great success with a Visa card aimed at the
consumer market, faces intense competition in the long-distance business
communications market from rivals such as MCI and Sprint.

BANKAMERICA and Security Pacific have been given a green light by the US
Federal Reserve Bank to complete their Dollars 4bn merger - the biggest

The two banks, both based on the west coast, said they expected to be able

combining the banks is expected to take about a year.
The deal will create the second biggest banking group in the US, with assets

with assets of Dollars 215bn.
The two banks have agreed to sell more than 200 branches to meet anti-trust

NationsBank's loan loss provision goal for 1992 stands at Dollars 750m to
Dollars 900m, sharply down from 1991 levels, said Mr Fred Figge, chairman of
credit policy said, Reuter reports. The provision was Dollars 1.6bn in 1991.

LA ELECTRICIDAD de Caracas, Venezuela's largest publicly-held utility,
reported net earnings of USDollars 97.4m for 1991, up 11 per cent from the
1990 figure.
La Electricidad, founded in 1895, recorded total revenues last year of
Dollars 391.3m, compared with Dollars 306.1m in 1990. The dollar figures
were calculated using exchange rates in effect at the end of each year.
One of the most widely-held and actively-traded shares on the Caracas Stock
Exchange, the company supplies electricity to the Caracas metropolitan area.
Last year, it participated in the international consortium which paid
Dollars 1.89bn for a 40 per cent equity holding in Venezuela's national
telephone company, CANTV, now privatised. La Electricidad's shares ranked
among the biggest gainers on the Venezuelan market last year.
The company, widely respected for its professional management, may face new
problems since the government recently ordered a halt to planned price
increases in response to widespread discontent with increasing rates for
utilities and public services.
The government, in the middle of a political and military crisis, has
suggested that the rate freeze - which also affects state-owned power
companies - will be only temporary.
The current administration is scheduled to complete its five-year term in
February 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCA Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, the two big public-sector
banks owned by Italy's IRI state holding company, both reported sharp falls
in profits last year due to heavy investments, higher taxation and the
non-recurrence of extraordinary items.
Net earnings at BCI slumped to L317.5bn (Dollars 215.6m) from L475.4bn in
1990, while Credito Italiano reported a marked decline in group net profits
after minority interests to L297bn from L337.6bn in 1990.
The drop in earnings at BCI stemmed partly from the lack of significant
extraordinary items, which boosted profits by L120bn in 1990. It also
reflected sharply increased spending on acquisitions and investments in the
branch network.
BCI opened 75 new branches last year and ploughed in around L300bn to buy
into or raise its existing stakes in a number of domestic and foreign
financial institutions. The most significant was the purchase of a majority
holding in the Sicily-based Banca Sicula.
The company estimated that its growth strategy trimmed earnings by L150bn
last year.
Gross operating profits climbed by 7.7 per cent to L1,138.9bn, and total
assets rose by 11.8 per cent to L117,000bn.
The dividend remains unchanged at L200 for ordinary shares and L230 for
savings stock.
The fall in net profits at Credito Italiano stemmed from a L155bn leap in
taxes to L266.4bn last year and a L15bn decline in extraordinary items to
L74bn.
The tax increase was even more marked at parent company level, with a
L182.2bn increase to L250.8bn. The bank failed to provide any explanation
for the surge.
Group operating profits rose by 18.3 per cent to L640.4bn, and the bank is
maintaining its dividend of L85 for ordinary shares and L100 for savings
stock.
Group net interest income rose by almost 16 per cent to L1,760.3bn, while
other operating income increased by 15 per cent to L1,234.4bn. Total assets
increased by 3.6 per cent to L94,347bn.
Group net profits at Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest
private-sector bank, jumped by 20 per cent to L233bn last year, boosted by
strong growth in loans and deposits.
Group lending increased by 25 per cent to L18,518bn, while customer deposits
jumped by 22 per cent to L20,374bn.
The figures for Ambroveneto, which has joined other Italian banks in rapidly
expanding its branch network, were also boosted by the consolidation of
Ambroveneto Sud, the former Citibank Italia, acquired last year.

SUN Microsystems Computer, the leading US computer workstation manufacturer,
yesterday cut the prices of its high-end workstations for three-dimensional
imaging by nearly 30 per cent.
The move is expected to pressure competitors, including Hewlett-Packard,
Digital Equipment, International Business Machines, and Silicon Graphics -
which specialises in 3-D workstations - into making similar price
adjustments. Sun claimed that fully-configured models of its SPARCstation
2GS and SPARCstation 2GT were now among the cheapest 3-D solids workstations
in their class.
'We believe that lower prices will help us in an important quest: broadening
the market for 3-D graphics,' said Mr Larry Hambly, vice-president of
marketing.
Sun also cut prices on 19-inch monitors for all its workstations. Prices of
add-on memory were also cut.
The company also announced price reductions on its server products. These
are computers used to provide additional computer power to networks of
workstations.
Intel, the US semiconductor group, has named Mr Ed Masi to the new post of
president of its supercomputer systems division. He is also being
recommended for election as an Intel corporate vice-president at the next
board meeting.
Mr Masi had been executive vice-president of sales, service and marketing

MARUI, the Japanese department store chain, reported an 8.7 per cent fall in
pre-tax profit to Y57.3bn (Dollars 428m) for the year to the end of January,
the company's first profit drop since its stock was listed in 1963, writes
Robert Thomson.
The company blamed a slim 0.6 per cent increase in sales to Y569bn on the
slowdown in the economy, which has eroded business confidence and been
accompanied by meagre growth in consumer spending.
Marui is best known for its fashionable, youth-oriented department stores,
and has been hit, along with other retailers, by sluggish sales of luxury
items and higher priced clothing lines.
For the current year, the company, which has expanded aggressively in recent
years, is expecting a 12.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y50bn, though
sales are expected to rise 5.4 per cent to Y600bn.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sekisui House under pressure
despite rise

SEKISUI HOUSE, Japan's largest builder of houses, reported a 1.6 per cent
increase in pre-tax profit to Y89.5bn (Dollars 640m) for the year to the end
of January, but admitted that the property market slump has put the company
under extreme pressure.
Sales rose by only 4.4 per cent to Y1,077.4bn after a 22.7 per cent increase
in the year-earlier period, while cash deposits plunged by 43.6 per cent and
payments receivable jumped by 55 per cent, reflecting clients' payments
difficulties.
Prices for apartments on the fringe of Tokyo have fallen by as much as 30
per cent, and the fall has been even larger in some parts of Osaka. The
average decline in land prices nationally is generally reckoned at 30 per
cent over the past two years.
The housing industry is suffering from a build-up of inventory, and
complains that uncertainty over the next cut in official interest rates is
prompting buyers to delay planned investment.
Sekisui said that its stock of saleable land rose from Y227bn a year ago to
Y353bn at the end of January, following a 22 per cent fall in real estate
sales. Home construction revenue rose by 12.8 per cent, though the company
expects difficulty in moving unsold properties during the current period,
for which total sales are forecast to rise only marginally to Y1,120bn.
Property companies were bruised last year by a Ministry of Finance order to
Japanese banks to limit their property-related lending. That order, intended
to reduce banks' exposure to the market and to clamp down on speculators,
was lifted at the end of last year, and some pressure on builders will be
eased.
Sekisui said the property market was hurt by high interest rates, the
weakness in the Tokyo stock market, and reductions in capital investment.
One result was a 330,000 fall to 1.37m in new housing starts reported last
year by all Japanese builders.
The company said the 'overall environment has become particularly
difficult', and cited a fall in second-hand prices as a cause for concern
for new home builders. For the current year, Sekisui is forecasting a 10.6
per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y80bn.
Marubeni, one of the leading Japanese trading companies, is negotiating the
acquisition of around 10 per cent of California-based EO, a company
affiliated to AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications concern, for an undisclosed
sum, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Meanwhile, Matsushita Electric Industrial, of Japan and the world's largest
consumer electronics group, is considering acquiring capital in EO.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Takeover drive puts TNT on road
to profit - The Australian transport group is winning back investors'
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Abeles, chief executive of TNT, the Australian transport and
express mail group, has a message to the markets: after a year of hectic
deal-making, the group has sorted out its problems and is on track for a
return to profit.
Sir Peter, 68, flew back to TNT's Sydney headquarters from Europe this week
with three deals in his pocket. He believes these will put an end to
investors' concerns about the group's profitability and liquidity.
He also made clear his intention to go on managing the company, which he
transformed during the 1970s and 1980s from a small haulier into an
international shipping, aviation and trucking conglomerate.
'I have no plans to retire; I have not got time for it,' he said in response
to rumours that he intended to hand over management to one of TNT's younger
executives.
Under Sir Peter's guidance, TNT expanded rapidly through the 1980s, from
revenues of ADollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.29bn) in 1984 to ADollars 4.5bn in
1990. At their peak, the shares were worth well over ADollars 4 on the
Australian Stock Exchange.
However, the group ran into trouble early last year when institutional
investors began to worry about the high level of debt incurred to finance
growth.
With bank debt and subordinated loans totalling ADollars 2.2bn, compared
with shareholders' funds of ADollars 1.1bn, TNT looked vulnerable to the
growing recession in its main markets in Australia, the US and the UK.
There were also worries about the group's entrepreneurial nature and its
close relationship with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which was then
struggling to cope with severe financial problems.
Like Mr Murdoch, Sir Peter had shown himself willing to take big risks. In
the UK, for example, TNT's big breakthrough came when its trucks carried Mr
Murdoch's newspapers through the picket lines at News Corp's non-union
printing plant in London's Docklands.
Sir Peter has also been noted for dramatic moves into new markets, usually
in an attempt to establish domination as a precursor to improving margins
through economies of scale.
In one spectacular deal, he bought five years' production of the British
Aerospace 146 Quiet Trader, amounting to 72 aircraft at about ADollars 30m
each. Only 24 were destined for TNT's own transport activities - the rest
were to be leased to other users.
Investors were also specifically concerned about Ansett Transport
Industries, which runs Australia's biggest domestic airline, and Ansett
Worldwide Aviation Services, an aircraft leasing company.
The Ansett companies are jointly owned by TNT and News Corp, and both looked
likely to suffer falling revenue as the recession and an over-supply of
aircraft reduced demand.
Concern about the group was triggered by declining profits in 1989 and 1990
as European losses and the onset of recession squeezed margins. But it was
not until the shares fell to a low of 75 cents in January last year that the
board reassesed its growth strategy.
Since then, TNT has simplified its structure by refocusing on its three core
areas of international express, domestic express, and commercial
distribution.
It has sold holdings in non-core businesses such as Foster's Brewing Group
and Normandy Poseidon, the Australian resources group, and substantially
allayed fears about the exposure of the Ansett companies.
The group made a net loss of ADollars 197m in the 12 months to June 1991 and
a further ADollars 51m loss in the six months to appears to be over, and
investors have begun buying the stock again, propelling it to nearly
ADollars 2 in recent trading.
The key to TNT's revived confidence is four big deals, three of which were
concluded last week. The deals are:
The flotation of 70 per cent of TNT Freightways, the group's US trucking
business, to raise ADollars 400m;
The acquisition of Chronoservice, a leading French express carrier, which
fills a gap in TNT's network of domestic express businesses in Europe;
A sub-contracting agreement with Federal Express, the US carrier, for the
delivery of inbound packages to 10 European countries;
The setting up of GD Net, a Dutch-based joint venture which will merge the
express mail and parcel activities of TNT and the post offices of Sweden,
the Netherlands, France, Germany and Canada.
The FedEx deal, which cost less than USDollars 18m, removes a big competitor
from the European market and gives TNT access to additional revenues of up
to USDollars 100m, although the group says it does not expect to retain the
whole of FedEx's business.
However, the most significant deal is the formation of GD Net, which is
expected to generate additional revenue of USDollars 120m in the first year.
That will, in 1992-1993, help propel the European business into profits for
the first time.
In addition, the deal allows TNT to remove ADollars 600m in long-term debt
from its balance sheet, helping reduce the ratio of long-term debt to
shareholders' equity to about 1.3 or 1.4 to 1 from from 2.2:1 in 1990.
'We are on the way to a 1:1 debt to equity ratio by 1993. The majority of it
has been done, and there is no question but that we will meet that target.
Our debt has come down tremendously,' Sir Peter said.
TNT puts much blame for the group's problems on the 'unsophisticated'
Australian market, which executives believe failed to understand the express
business.
'The way we were perceived in Australia had a major impact on us overseas -
the post office deal nearly collapsed three times because of the perception
which built up, and other deals were also affected,' Sir Peter said. 'It did
not matter how many times we said we could pay our bills, people just did
not believe it.'
TNT says it sees no indications that the recession in its main markets is
easing, but hopes for a rapid return to profitability once the European
international activities move out of losses. 'That will remove the biggest
drag on our profits,' Sir Peter said.
He refused to say when profits might return to the record level of ADollars
274m, achieved in 1988. But he suggested the improvement might be more rapid
than expected. 'We don't want to wait five years. We want to do it fast,' he
said.

<TEXT>
JARDINE Fleming, the Hong Kong merchant banking joint venture between the
colony's Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank,
announced a 13 per cent increase in 1991 net profits to USDollars 84m, up
from USDollars 74m in 1991. This represented a 53 per cent return on
shareholders' funds.
The fund management operations had a good year, with funds under management
increasing by 36 per cent to USDollars 10bn. However, with Japan proving the
weakest leading world stock market for the second consecutive year, the
group has shifted its emphasis towards a wider range of Asian markets.
The broking operations performed strongly. Mr Alan Smith, managing director,
said that, even in the weak Japanese market, Jardine Fleming achieved
greater broking volumes, through substantially increasing its domestic
sales.
The broking operations also benefited from the opening up of the South
Korean and Taiwanese markets to overseas investors, since it had already
established offices in Taipei and Seoul.
Jardine Fleming profited from the issue of a number of covered warrants on
blue chip Hong Kong companies, while the wholesale banking business also saw
earnings growth from its foreign exchange and options operations.
The results, which were in line with expectations, showed a substantial
increase in operating profits, since the 1990 results had been boosted by
the exceptional profit from the sale of its stockbroking interests in
Taiwan.

25% float

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
yesterday announced plans to float 25 per cent of its shares. The move is
the last stage of a four-year recovery from a bungled takeover.
Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial
Review and other newspapers, said it would float 173.25m shares at ADollars
1.20, capitalising the group at about ADollars 830m (USDollars 633.50).
The flotation comprises 15m new shares and 158.25m clawed back from
institutions which subscribed to an earlier equity raising by Tourang, the
vehicle for Mr Black's acquisition of Fairfax.
Mr Black owns 15 per cent of Fairfax through his Daily Telegraph group in
the UK. Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank which co-owned Tourang,
owns 5 per cent of the stock.
The institutions which subscribed to the earlier float retain about 55 per
cent of Fairfax, which was put into receivership by its banks in 1990, two
years after Mr Warwick Fairfax bought out other family shareholders in a
highly leveraged takeover.
A prospectus released by Ord Minnett, the firm of stockbrokers, forecast a
net profit of ADollars 57m for the year to June 1993, on revenue of ADollars
782m. The prospectus said pre-tax profits would be ADollars 123m in the
current year, and ADollars 165m in 1992-1993.

BTR Nylex, the Australian manufacturing and packaging concern which is 64
per cent owned by BTR of the UK, is to bid for the minority shares in
Westinghouse Brake and Signal (Australia), Reuter reports from Melbourne.
The move follows a Pounds 1.5bn takeover by BTR of Hawker Siddeley, the UK
aerospace group, which held 85 per cent of Westinghouse.
BTR Nylex said it would offer ADollars 10 cash for each Westinghouse share,
with an alternative offer of BTR Nylex shares. But it did not elaborate on
the scrip offer.
BTR Nylex said the number of shares on issue was 7.8m. Westinghouse Brake
and Signal shares last traded on February 28 at ADollars 8.20.
BTR Nylex said: 'The acquisition of Westinghouse enables us to secure a
significant expansion of our existing rail businesses in the rapidly growing
Australian and Pacific Rim markets.'
It said Westinghouse had a strong technology manufacturing base in
Australia. 'Nylex has the management capability to ensure an enhancement of
its earnings from the development of these combined resources.'
BTR Nylex said it expected the formal offer document would be lodged no
later than March 30 and the formal offer to be made to Westinghouse
shareholders by no later than April 13.

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Commerce Commission, the monopolies watchdog, has been
ordered to pay Brierley Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and
trading group, NZDollars 20,000 (USDollars 11,000) in costs by the country's
High Court after it dropped an action over the control of shareholdings in
Air New Zealand.
This was the final round in a protracted 'war' which began early last year
when Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, said arrangements with other Air New
Zealand shareholders including Brierley Investments, American Airlines and
Japan Airlines, gave Qantas control of 50 per cent of voting rights on the
Air New Zealand board. BIL consistently denied the accusations, and
criticised the Commerce Commission for continuing with its inquiry.
Qantas owns 19.9 per cent of Air New Zealand and BIL 42.5 per cent.
In deciding to drop the action, Dr Susan Lojkine, the Commerce Commission
chairman, said the commission had effectively blocked Qantas from buying
more shares without its approval.
Mr Paul Collins, BIL chief executive, yesterday attacked the way the
commission conducted its inquiry 'by press release', and said the withdrawal
of court proceedings was a vindication of BIL's position. Statements made by
the commission had been damaging when they had been found to be untrue. He
accused the commission of being anti-business.
Last month. the commission reopened the matter by demanding firm assurances
from BIL that it was not involved in any secret arrangement to give Qantas
greater control of Air New Zealand.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Second-half turnround at Cathay
Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATHAY Pacific Airways, the international airline subsidiary of Hong Kong's
Swire Pacific group, announced a significant recovery in the second half of
1991, with net profit for the full year falling to HKDollars 2.95bn
(USDollars 380m), only 1.5 per cent below 1990's figure of HKDollars
2.995bn.
Cathay had posted a 21 per cent drop in earnings at the interim stage, and
the full-year results were above market expectations.
Earnings benefited from the weakening of the US dollar in the second half of
the year, due to the amount of non-US/HK dollar denominated revenues. The
airline also achieved improved productivity levels.
Mr David Gledhill, chairman, said: 'The year's results have been greatly
influenced by the Gulf war and the continuing worldwide recession.' There
was also an impact from the rising fuel price during the war and increased
price competition 'as airlines struggled to conserve or improve cash flow',
he said.
There was a marginal decrease in passenger load factors, falling from 75.9
per cent to 73.6 per cent during the year, reflecting the weak market during
the Gulf war.
Mr Gledhill was upbeat about the prospects for 1992, despite continuing
double-digit inflation and the uncertain economic outlook.
'We look forward to a more prosperous 1992, albeit with some caution in
respect of the progress of the world's major economies,' he said. However,
he emphasised the need to contain costs in an inflationary environment, in
order to benefit from the airline's higher capacity increase in 1992.
The company recommended a final dividend of 31.5 cents, bringing the full
year pay-out to 42 cents, the same as in 1990.

signal of recovery
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST, the German chemical giant, yesterday warned that there had been no
sign of an upturn during the first two months of 1992.
Group sales increased by 3 per cent during the first two months compared
with the same period last year, said Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman. However,
more than half of the increase was due to an improved dollar exchange rate,
while the rest was made up by pharmaceuticals, which continued to sell well.
Demand and production in Germany and Japan had declined, while the economic
recovery in the US was faltering, said Mr Hilger. During the second half of
the year, the company was hoping for a recovery led by the US. Any
improvement was likely to be weak and gradual. The German market would be
the last to recover, he said.
Demand for plastics and plastic film had so far been very weak. Mr Hilger
warned a good profit could not be earned when overall demand was at a low
level and prices were poor.
The situation called for determined action, he said. The company was
continuing its rationalisation programme, particularly in Germany, and
expected the number of job losses there to be at least equal to the 2,149
lost over the past 14 months.
A number of plants were also being closed, he said. Production of phosphorus
and detergent phosphates in Germany would cease.
Mr Hilger again attacked German environmental legislation that disadvantaged
German-based companies without producing any measurable environmental
benefit. He said the cost of further improvements was disproportionately
high and that the money could be better spent improving environmental
performance in eastern Germany.
During 1991 operating costs for the environment increased 10 per cent to
DM1.6bn (Dollars 960m) while capital expenditure increased DM18m to DM343m.
He also criticised the debate in Germany about genetic engineering, which he
described as absurd. He said pharmaceutical research in the future was
inconceivable without the technology. Hoechst could afford no more delays
and was transferring an anticoagulant project to France and a manufacturing
plant for Factor XIII, vital for haemophiliacs, to Japan.
Mr Hilger said Hoechst had stood the test of 1991, but not without wounds.
Pre-tax profits, already reported, fell 20 per cent to DM2.56bn while
turnover improved 5 per cent to DM47.2bn from DM44.8bn. Sales volume
increased by about 2 per cent while prices were only slightly above last
year's.

<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the world's largest maker of personal computer software, is to
acquire Fox Software, a private developer of database programs for desktop
computers, for 1.36m Microsoft shares. The deal is worth about Dollars 175m.
Fox, based in Perrysburg, Ohio, specialises in database software, used to
organise libraries of data and retrieve information.
The acquisition heralds Microsoft's entry into the database management
software field, one of the few categories of desktop computer software in
which it does not compete. It has been developing its own database programs,
but has yet to launch any products.
With its acquisition of Fox and entry into the database program market,
Microsoft will compete with Borland International, the leading maker of
database software for personal computers.
Borland's stock price fell sharply on news of the Microsoft deal. After a
Monday close of Dollars 70.25, it traded at Dollars 64 at midday yesterday.
Microsoft's stock remained relatively steady, fluctuating between Dollars
128.75 and Dollars 129.87
Microsoft will combine its own development team with the Fox group at
Microsoft's headquarters near Seattle, Washington.
'Our intention is to combine expertise and provide users with a family of
complementary products, ' said Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief
executive.
Among these offerings will be Microsoft's in-house developed database
program, code-named Cirrus, for personal computers that run Microsoft's
Windows operating system.
Mr Gates said: 'We soon will be able to offer customers a complete family of
superior scalable database applications and development environments.' Mr
David Fulton, Fox's president, will join Microsoft to head its
recently-created database software division.

ELECTROLUX, the Swedish household appliances multinational which has

'Top priority has been assigned to improving profitability through internal

The company's forecast was included in its final results statement for 1991,
which differs marginally from figures released on February 4.
Profits after financial items tumbled by 26.8 per cent to SKr1.03bn (Dollars
170m) from SKr1.40bn in 1990. Earnings per share after full tax fell to
SKr5.20 from SKr10.10, while the return on equity after full tax declined to
2.3 per cent from 4.3 per cent.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ciba-Geigy tests its formula -
The company's attempt to shed its secretive image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Dr Alex Krauer, Ciba-Geigy's chairman, stands up to present the group's
year-end results tomorrow, it will signal two significant steps in his
attempt to transform this conservative Swiss chemicals company.
By announcing the figures in London - the first time one of the three
Basle-based chemicals groups has unveiled results outside its home town  -
he will reinforce his efforts to end the company's Swiss secrecy. And he
expects to demonstrate the first benefits of a fundamental reorganisation he
launched two years ago.
Dr Krauer hopes the location of today's presentation will demonstrate his
commitment to foreign shareholders after a decision two years ago to make
the company's shares available to non-Swiss nationals. This was done, said
Dr Krauer, because the Swiss market was no longer large enough to sustain
the group's share price. More than 25 per cent of Ciba-Geigy's shares are
held outside Switzerland.
The requirements of foreign investors forced Ciba-Geigy to divulge
information previously considered secret. This coincided with restructuring
of the group by Dr Krauer.
When he took over in 1987 he compared the group to a supertanker, providing
synergies of scale, but difficult to manoeuvre. The group, which dates back
to 1758, had become complacent, said Dr Krauer.
'We were spoilt for far too long,' he said. 'Everything was too obvious and
easy, and this had to be changed.'
Dr Krauer launched his reorganisation, known as Vision 2000, in July 1990.
It aimed to cut bureaucracy, make the organisation more commercially
flexible - by giving the operations greater independence and encouraging
entrepreneurial behaviour from employees - and open the business to the
public.
Relations with the public had suffered after a fire at a neighbouring Sandoz
plant led to 30 tonnes of dangerous agricultural chemicals, including 200kg
of mercury, being washed into the Rhine.
Dr Krauer said Ciba-Geigy also needed to be more flexible in its response to
the increasingly competitive commercial environment. Bulk chemicals
producers, for example, were moving into the Swiss company's traditional
high-margin niche businesses and Dr Krauer said that every significant
chemical group, apart from Dow of the US, was entering its markets.
The need for change was also internally driven, said Dr Krauer. 'All big
companies have a tendency towards bureaucracy and fat. Ciba-Geigy was no
exception,' he said.
The organisation consisted of about 140 subsidiary companies, split into
business divisions, geographical operations and other functions with
expertise, for example, in finance and legal affairs.
'The functions had too much weight. Their motivation was to do a
professionally good job - a laudable ambition, but one that led to
perfectionism. The object of business is results, and if you are
over-perfect you don't achieve the best results,' said Dr Krauer.
He launched a programme to cut 10 per cent of the 24,000 staff in
Switzerland, where personnel costs had been rising.
He has also tried to make the organisation more flexible by persuading
senior managers to delegate under a system he described as 'directed
autonomy'.
Dr Krauer admitted implementation of Vision 2000 had not been completely
successful. 'You never reach your objective 100 per cent. Although
performance is dependent upon other elements, there is no doubt that we will
see the benefits of the changes on the bottom line when we announce our
results.'
Many managers resented losing power. However, Dr Krauer said, they
previously only had a form of 'pseudo-power' based on a hierarchical set-up.
He said their task was now more demanding because they were being asked to
influence people through personality and professional competence.
Dr Krauer said: 'Quite a lot of the people further down the organisation had
been asking loudly for greater responsibility, but when we gave it to them
they didn't use it. A number weren't willing to take risks and kept ringing
Basle to cover themselves. In 80 per cent of the cases, it was a question of
training and leadership. We must allow people to make mistakes - though not
too many.'
Dr Krauer has set up a reward system for about 1,000 managers world-wide
based on performance. Basle-based managers can increase their salaries by 20
per cent if they reach their targets, or lose 10 per cent if they fail. In
1990, when profits fell 30 per cent, most managers' salaries fell. 'This was
certainly the case of the executive committee of which I am a member,' said
Dr Krauer.
'I can't say we're perfect. But the momentum is building up and we are
moving in the right direction,' he added. How far in the right direction and
whether his own pay-packet increases, he will demonstrate on Thursday.

BARILLA, the privately-owned Italian foods group which has been expanding
rapidly in recent years, raised group sales by 15 per cent to L2,754bn
(Dollars 2.19bn) in 1991 and expects turnover to reach L3,400bn this year.
Net profits in 1991 surged by almost 60 per cent to L155bn, representing a
significant recovery after two years of heavy investments on acquisitions
and investments in existing facilities, which had depressed earnings.
Barilla is Italy's biggest pasta-maker, and also has a substantial presence
in the market for biscuits and cakes.
Much of this year's forecast sales growth will stem from the expected
purchase of full control of Pavesi, a state-owned foods group, in which
Barilla bought a 49 per cent holding last year.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: La Cinq rescue bid abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of La Cinq, the troubled French television channel, was last
night shrouded in doubt after Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial
Italian media mogul, abandoned his FFr1.5bn (Dollars 260m) rescue plan.
Mr Berlusconi, one of the original shareholders in La Cinq, has been trying
to raise capital to save the station, which filed for bankruptcy at the
beginning of this year, since early February when his rescue proposals were
passed to the Paris commercial court for further consideration.
When he presented his proposals, Mr Berlusconi claimed to be optimistic over
raising enough money to implement the package, which involved an initial
capital injection of FFr700m and a second of FFr800m.
Fininvest, the company through which he holds his 25 per cent stake in La
Cinq, said yesterday in Rome that Mr Berlusconi had also been deterred by
the discovery of accounting problems at La Cinq.
The collapse of the plan has dealt a heavy blow to La Cinq's chances of
survival. Mr Berlusconi emerged as the only serious contender to salvage the
station.
La Cinq, which is best known in France for its late night line-up of soft
pornography, has continued to broadcast since the bankruptcy filing. Mr
Berlusconi has paid the staff's salaries for the six weeks during which the
commercial court has been considering his proposals.
The channel was still broadcasting last night despite the news of the
withdrawal. Mr Michel Rouger, president of the Paris commercial court, will
deliver his decision on its eventual fate on April 3.
If La Cinq does goes off air, it could prove embarrassing for France's
socialist government, still bruised by its disastrous showing in last
Sunday's regional elections. So far the government has sought to distance
itself from the station's problems, claiming that it has no influence over
privately-owned TV companies.
Meanwhile, a number of companies, such as the French language news service
proposed by TF1, Canal-Plus and M6, are working on plans to replace La Cinq.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Invergordon exceeds forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERGORDON Distillers, the Scotch whisky group, reported a 42 per cent
increase in 1991 pre-tax profits, comfortably exceeding the forecast made
during its successful resistance to the Pounds 350m bid by Whyte &amp; Mackay,
the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands.
Profits rose from Pounds 22.7m to Pounds 32.2m. Earnings per share jumped to
16.8p (12.1p) and a proposed final dividend of 4p raises the total to 6.5p
(5p).
The takeover battle, which left Whyte &amp; Mackay with a 41.3 per cent stake,
cost Invergordon Pounds 4.2m, taken as an extraordinary item.
Operating profits increased by 18 per cent, from Pounds 31m to Pounds 36.7m,
on turnover ahead to Pounds 92.4m (Pounds 90.7m). Margins improved more than
5 percentage points to 39.7 per cent.
Mr Chris Greig, managing director, said there had been significant changes
in the mix of business.
Exports rose 6 per cent by volume and 4 per cent in value. Bulk shipments of
whisky declined 14 per cent but sales of higher margin bottled-in-Scotland
brands showed a commensurate rise.
In the UK, where whisky volumes declined overall by 7 per cent, sales of the
group's bottled own-label products increased by 14 per cent in volume and 24
per cent in value.
COMMENT
The results justified the judgment of majority shareholders who stuck with
the management. Maximum benefit has been extracted from a small rise in
turnover amid difficult trading conditions through tight cost controls,
increasing use of stocks of mature whiskies and continuing conversion of
bulk to bottled sales. Recession even proved helpful, polarising the market
between premium brands and Invergordon's own-label strength. Trading has got
off to a satisfactory start this year and new opportunities will be opened
by the white spirit distillery joint venture with Tate &amp; Lyle. Forecast
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 36.5m, put the group on a prospective p/e of
14.3. Altogether a great temptation for Whyte &amp; Mackay to return with a more
generous offer.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Epwin at Pounds 2.9m and makes cash call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EPWIN GROUP, the USM-quoted maker of uPVC windows and doors, sealed double
glazed units and glass products, yesterday reported annual profits ahead of
expectations at Pounds 2.91m.
The company also announced, that along with a 1-for-4 rights issue to fund
expansion, it was to apply for its shares to be admitted to the official
list.
Mr Jim Rawson, chairman and managing director, said the combination of a
rights issue and a move to the main market should increase the marketability
of the shares to a wider range of UK and European institutions.
He said that profits for the 12 months to end-December, although down by
Pounds 600,000 from last year, were satisfactory considering difficult
trading conditions.
The result came on turnover down from Pounds 47.8m to Pounds 40.3m. Earnings
per share emerged at 12.8p (15.5p). The final dividend is increased to 4.5p
for a total for the year up from 6.4p to 6.6p.
Mr Rawson said the rights issue would raise about Pounds 5.4m after
expenses, which would be used to expand production facilities, improve
efficiency and widen the customer base.
The rights issue is underwritten by County NatWest. Cazenove is broker to
the issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Worcester Group, the central heating specialist, lifted pre-tax profits by
27 per cent, from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 4.52m, in 1991.
The second half produced a particularly strong performance, with profits of
Pounds 3.44m compared with Pounds 1.54m.
The result came in spite of interest charges up from Pounds 670,000 to
Pounds 900,000 and included a loss of Pounds 480,000 (Pounds 960,000
profits) in the MCL construction subsidiary. Turnover rose by 48 per cent to
Pounds 65.2m (Pounds 44m).
Sales of combi and oil-fired boilers at Worcester Heat Systems rose by 17
per cent and margins improved.
Radson, the Belgium-based subsidiary acquired in December 1990, turned round
into profit during the year, and Grate Glow Fires, acquired in April 1990,
also made a contribution.
With improved earnings per share of 10.4p (9.4p) the proposed final dividend
is stepped up to 2.88p for a total of 4.21p (4.01p).

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Brake Bros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAKE BROS, which supplies frozen food to caterers, has bucked the recession
with increased profits and sales, helped by acquisitions.
Brake also outlined its strategy to move into chilled food distribution, an
area it has so far avoided. Mr Malcolm Champion, finance director, said
recent acquisitions gave the company a platform to move into chilled food
distribution.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 rose to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.9m) on turnover 14
per cent higher at Pounds 223m (Pounds 195.4m). The turnover rise would have
been 7.3 per cent without acquisitions.
Mr Champion said he was very pleased with the results, which were
overshadowed by a depressed catering market and a fire at the company's cold
storage facility in West Yorkshire. Losses were fully insured and the
facility is due to be operational in the next few weeks. Nevertheless,
delays associated with the fire held back growth elsewhere, Mr Champion
said.
During the year, Brake spent Pounds 3.4m acquiring four businesses in London
and the Midlands supplying fresh fish and chilled foods. Brake believes its
distribution and purchasing experience can improve these businesses. They
also provide an entry into the quality hotel and restaurant sector, which
usually avoids frozen foods.
Since the end of the year, Brake has bought a small frozen food distributor
in France and further acquisitions are being targeted in the UK and
continental Europe. Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 2m, for
gearing of 5 per cent.
Earnings per share increased 9 per cent to 23.8p (21.8p). A recommended
final dividend of 4.1p brings the total to 5.75p (5.25p), a 9.5 per cent
increase.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Colorgraphic falls Pounds 2.33m into the
red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colorgraphic, the printing group specialising in advertising and direct mail
literature, was hard hit by the advertising recession with a fall from a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.01m to losses of Pounds 2.33m for the year to
December 31.
Although the cost savings made in 1991 limited losses at the operating level
to Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 2.92m profit), the pre-tax figure was hit by
higher interest charges of Pounds 1.07m and an exceptional Pounds 1.1m to
cover reorganisation costs and a bad debt in the US.
Further annual cost savings of about Pounds 1m have been identified for the
first half of 1992.
Turnover was down from Pounds 54.7m to Pounds 46.4m, with sales falling by
about 10 per cent after adjusting for disposals. This fall was compounded by
an average 3.5 per cent price reduction.
The group is proposing a nominal final dividend of 0.01p after passing its
interim for the first time. Last year there was a total of 6.86p.
Losses per share came out at 12.45p (9.09p earnings).

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Interest reduction helps Wolseley meet
estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLSELEY, the heating and plumbing distributor which owns the Plumb Center
chain, yesterday announced an 11 per cent profits decline due to recession
in the UK and US.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, said there were some signs of improvement on
the US East Coast but conditions in California and the UK made predictions
for the year 'extremely difficult'.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 38m) for the six
months to January 31. The figure was helped by interest savings of more than
Pounds 2.5m, mainly due to lower inventory levels.
Although this helped reduce gearing to less than 20 per cent from 30 per
cent, Mr Lancaster said low borrowings also showed the depth of the
recession. 'I would rather have my money in lavatories than in the bank,' he
said.
Turnover increased to Pounds 876.2m (Pounds 854.5m) but would have fallen
slightly without exchange rate movements.
US sales improved to Pounds 478.8m (Pounds 426.4m) although operating
profits dropped to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 15.8m). Familian Corp incurred a
first half loss in California although Carolina Builders fared better. Group
profits were boosted by Pounds 1.3m from beneficial dollar exchange rate
movements.
In the UK, the 211-branch Plumb Center chain maintained sales but margins
came under pressure due to falling inflation and price competition.
Brossette, the leading French plumbing and heating distributor acquired in
February, made no contribution.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.1p, payable from earnings of 9.86p
(11.3p) per share.
COMMENT
These results were as anticipated, but only after lower than expected
interest payments. With no signs of recovery in the UK or California,
previous forecasts of unchanged full year profits of about Pounds 80m now
look optimistic, even accounting for a Pounds 5m second half contribution
from Brossette. Furthermore, should UK sales recover, margins will lag
pending clearance of stock bought before the slowdown in inflation.
Nevertheless, Wolseley is a quality company which has coped well with
recession before. Its dominance in the UK provides future stability, there
is further scope for growth in the US once recovery beckons and France has
interesting options in the medium term. Forecast full year profits of Pounds
77m to Pounds 78m put the shares on a p/e of more than 18 times. With
recovery still over the horizon, they are expensive.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day shows 29% improvement to Pounds
7.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBER DAY, the discount retail group, increased pre-tax profits by 29 per
cent to Pounds 7.1m in the half year to February 1, helped by a Pounds 1.1m
fall in the interest charge to Pounds 354,000 following last summer's Pounds
24.4m rights issue.
Earnings per share, however, rose a more modest 2.4 per cent to 3.81p. The
shares fell 3p to 80p.
In December the group, which bought the What Everyone Wants chain in June
1990, sold its two menswear chains, which it had acquired in 1988 and 1989.
The menswear side incurred trading losses in the half year of Pounds 591,000
(profit Pounds 454,000).
A Pounds 4.5m loss on the sale of that business was charged below the line,
as was a write-off of goodwill amounting to Pounds 8.1m which had previously
been written off against reserves. Consequently there was a retained loss of
Pounds 9.2m (profit Pounds 2.7m).
Group turnover was barely changed at Pounds 55.5m, though within that WEW
increased sales by 7.3 per cent to Pounds 47.7m. Operating profits from WEW
were up 18 per cent to Pounds 7.8m.
The interim dividend is raised from 0.9p to 1.1p.
In the 1991 year the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m,
earnings of 7.02p and a total dividend of 2.7p.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cost control behind 6% improvement at
Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender,
rose by 6 per cent in the year to January 31 1992 despite the recession. The
improvement was achieved largely by tight control of costs.
Profits after provisions were Pounds 628m, up from Pounds 593m.
Provisions against bad loans soared from Pounds 107m to Pounds 229m, of
which likely losses on house purchase were Pounds 191m (Pounds 56m). The
society gave no details of the number of homes it took into repossession
beyond saying that they were line with the rest of the industry, implying a
likely total of about 10,000 homes.
Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive, said that early in 1991, the society had
decided to cut its cost base and lend at reduced levels in response to the
problems of the mortgage market.
The society's mortgage business contracted during the year, with net lending
falling from Pounds 5.32bn to Pounds 3.92bn, a decline of 26 per cent. The
number of loans made in the year was down from 211,000 to 188,000.
Its share of the UK mortgage market declined from 16 per cent to 14 per
cent.
The society's total lending book grew from Pounds 44.8bn to Pounds 48.5bn.
Retail savings had a good year with a net inflow of Pounds 4.6bn; as a
result the society paid back about Pounds 400m of wholesale funding.
The cost-income ratio for the Halifax Group dropped from 48.5 per cent to
43.6 per cent, the lowest in over a decade. The cost-income ratio for
Halifax's core building society operations dropped to 38 per cent - well
below the industry average.
Mr Birrell said Halifax was pleased to have achieved the reduction without
cutting either staff or capital.
Operating losses on Halifax Estate Agencies were down from Pounds 18.3m to
Pounds 6.6m. Halifax also lost Pounds 3m on the Halifax Visa Card, a joint
venture with Bank of Scotland.
However, one sting in the tail of the results is that they are probably the
last in which the society's total asset size is greater than that of Abbey
National, its faster-growing rival.
Halifax's total assets of Pounds 58.7bn (Pounds 54.1bn) are now only a
whisker ahead of Abbey National's Pounds 57.4bn. On previous form, Abbey
National is now certain to overtake Halifax this year.

Castle Mill International, the clothing and gifts group, has warned there

The second half had been hit by a difficult trading climate and the run down

Force Sportive resulting in stock losses and closure costs.
The group swung from losses of Pounds 88,555 to profits of Pounds 313,861

announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.04m for 1991, a capital restructuring
and the Pounds 1.6m acquisition of a controlling interest in the leading
manufacturer of Laser sailing dinghies.
The purchase of a 63 per cent stake in the ordinary share capital of Gavel
Securities, and a further 72 per cent of the preference shares, will be
funded by a Pounds 1.8m placing and open offer to shareholders at 8p.
The deficit compared with losses last time of Pounds l81m.
Sunleigh also announced a capital restructuring to reduce the deficit on the
profit and loss account.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Associates boost Fairhaven to Dollars 14m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Substantial income from associates enabled Fairhaven International, the
specialist construction company which was granted a full listing in
September 1991, to report pre-tax profits of Dollars 14.1m (Pounds 8m) in
1991, an increase of 39 per cent on the comparable Dollars 10.1m, which
included an exceptional gain of Dollars 1.42m.
Turnover was Dollars 308.7m (Dollars 301.1m). After a higher tax charge of
Dollars 4.3m (Dollars 1.63m) earnings per share came out at 4.01 cents (3.55
cents). A doubled single final dividend of 0.4 cents is proposed.
The company said that it believed 1992 would continue to justify the
strategy of concentrating on its core construction-related businesses.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Northern boost for Cussins Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong northern housebuilding performance helped Cussins Property Group
cut annual losses from Pounds 4.04m to Pounds 365,000. The company said that
prospects had improved following the 'painful measures' taken during the
year.
The Newcastle-based company decided to concentrate on housebuilding and as a
result, turnover for 1991 fell from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 18.4m, all of
which related to housebuilding in the north-east of England.
The pre-tax line was helped by the elimination of losses from associates
which took Pounds 8.06m last time. Of the Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.7m)
interest charge, a significant part was for discontinued activities.

Mallett, the London antique dealer in which House of Fraser holds a 29.93
per cent interest, suffered a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
3.66m to Pounds 1.12m in 1991. Turnover dived 42 per cent to Pounds 8.39m,
against Pounds 14.6m.
Mr Rex Cooper, chairman, said the art market was suffering its worst
reversal since the Second World War and a deepening of the recession,
together with the increased overheads of the new building at 141 New Bond

Profits this time included an exceptional credit of Pounds 660,000. Earnings

AMID difficult trading conditions, Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold, the motor and fuel
distributor and leisure group, maintained second half profits at Pounds 3.2m
to finish 1991 some 4.5 per cent lower at Pounds 4.31m, against Pounds
4.51m.
Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, described the result as satisfactory, given the
effects of the recession on the motor division, which comprises about half
the group.
Motor profits on continuing businesses fell 20 per cent to Pounds 1.99m
(Pounds 2.49m), but new car sales dropped by only 12.6 per cent against a
national average of 20.7 per cent. Leisure and holidays achieved a slightly
better Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.63m) reflecting strong demand for inclusive UK
holidays which offset the Gulf war effect. Fuel distribution fell to Pounds
309,000 (Pounds 480,000).
Turnover dropped from Pounds 238.3m to Pounds 229.5m. Earnings per share
slipped to 20.7p (22.8p), but the dividend for the year is raised to 10p
(9.75p) with a recommended final of 7p.
Borrowings were reduced from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 9.1m and quality of
earnings improved by disposing of four loss-making businesses. Gearing was
cut to 32.4 per cent (55.3 per cent).

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 6.5m at Hambro
Countrywide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES AT Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency and insurance group, jumped
from Pounds 988,000 to Pounds 6.49m before tax in 1991 even though turnover
rose by 5 per cent.
Losses per share increased from 0.36p to 1.95p and no dividend is to be
paid.
Turnover rose from Pounds 88.4m to Pounds 93.2m.
Mr Christopher Sporborg, chairman, said losses had been at lower levels in
the second half of the year and the group still believed it was right to
pursue a strategy of increasing its market share and controlling costs
rather than shutting offices.
Nonetheless, he added: 'December 1991 was the worst month on record for most
of our estate agency business and we entered the new year with the level of
new business at historic lows. This will undoubtedly affect our results for
the first month or two of 1992.'
During the year Hambro Countrywide increased its branch network to 487 with
the purchase of the 22 branches of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester estate
agency.
The estate agencies sold more mortgages - 16,538 against 15,138 the previous
year - and more life assurance policies, with 19,685 against 18,832.
House sales also increased, to 40,407, 7.8 per cent more than in 1990.
However, the average value of each house sold dropped by 5 or 6 per cent.
During the year Hambro Guardian Assurance entered the permanent health
market with a disability income benefit policy and new products for long
term care assurance.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bridon cut down to Pounds 3.6m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIDON, the wire rope manufacturer, reported a slide into losses after
margins collapsed under extreme international competition.
Losses amounted to Pounds 3.6m, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m last
time. Sales fell to Pounds 319m (Pounds 336m). Losses per share were 6.4p
(earnings of 14.3p) but the company decided to pay a reduced final dividend
of 1.5p, giving a total for the year of 4p, half the 1990 level.
The share price slipped from 89p to 75p.
Mr David Allday, chief executive, said the recession had had a dramatic
impact on margins, which had fallen from 4.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The
group had also faced relocation costs and a large bad debt.
The group would now enjoy the benefit of a large contract with Shell, Mr
Allday said, and should return to profitability and a covered dividend. 'And
when the economy turns around we are not going to chase volume but margins.
Technically we are the most cost efficient in Europe.'
COMMENT
When a company swings from Pounds 10m pre-tax profits to losses of Pounds
3.6m, one might be forgiven for wondering how it can justify paying a
dividend. When that company is in the wire rope business, one of the most
cut-throat of European engineering industries, the question is all the more
pertinent. The simple answer is that if Bridon had not paid a dividend,
shareholders would have very little reason to stay with the company at all.
And there is a chink of light. The longer recession in Europe continues, the
more likely Bridon - as one of the most efficient producers - is likely to
emerge at the top of a battered pile. Nevertheless, recovery will be slow.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.5m are expected for 1992, giving 2.1p
earnings that would again not cover the dividend.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo will incur small loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the independent oil and gas exploration group, will today announce a
small operating loss after restating its results to embrace changes in
accounting practices. This could put additional pressure on the company's
shares in a sector already trading at a long-term low.
Lasmo, which took over Ultramar for Pounds 1.2bn last December, is being hit
hard by weak oil prices and is expected to announce cuts in its exploration
budget.
The overhaul of accounting practices will reduce earnings for the past eight
years, which will be restated. Mr Michael Pavia, finance director, argues
that it will make Lasmo easier to understand.
Mr Roger Aylard, oil analyst at SG Warburg, believes that Lasmo's restated
net profit for last year will be Pounds 31m, against an estimate under the
old accounting method of Pounds 70m.
The company's gearing is also expected to rise to about 80 per cent as a
result of the acquisition and the accounting changes. But Lasmo is confident
of reducing debt once it sells off Ultramar's downstream assets. The company
is inviting bids from other oil companies which it will evaluate in a month.
The alternative is to float off the Californian and Quebec refineries in one
North American company.
Lasmo had outgrown its previous accounting methods which are still widely
used by the UK's band of small, entrepreneurial oil exploration companies.
The biggest change is in the way the company accounts for the huge costs of
its exploration programme. It will now do this on a 'successful efforts
basis' in line with companies like British Petroleum and Shell, which means
that the costs of exploration are written off over the life of a producing
asset once a project has successfully found oil.
Costs of other projects, where millions of pounds are incurred only to find
a well is dry, are written off straight away - against the relevant year's
profits.
Lasmo had previously written off the costs of all developments - whether
successful or not - over the life of attributable reserves. This lengthened
the period over which costs were written off, boosting profits in the
short-term.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Change in product mix behind Iceland's 15%
rise to Pounds 46.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE in product mix at Iceland Frozen Foods Holdings enticed more
customers into the retailer's high street shops and helped to lift profits
by 15 per cent from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 46.3m in 1991.
Turnover rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 889.1m (Pounds 724.6m). Like-for-like
sales rose by 15 per cent. The number of customers through the door every
week had risen from 1.9m to 2.3m.
The increases were attributed to the higher proportion of chilled, as
opposed to frozen, foods in Iceland's stores. 'Times have changed and we are
not in the frozen food centre business any more,' said Mr Malcolm Walker,
chairman.
Growth would in future come mainly in chilled foods, he said, although he
added that frozen foods would remain integral to Iceland's strategy. The
company claims 15 per cent of the estimated Pounds 3.5bn UK market for
frozen foods, up from 12.5 per cent in 1990.
The increased proportion of chilled foods and dry groceries such as bread,
tea and coffee, had eroded operating margins from 7.1 per cent to 6.5 per
cent.
During the year the group opened 41 new stores, making a total of 532.
The group, which built up heavy borrowings following the Bejam purchase in
1989, cut gearing from 73 per cent to 54 per cent. A further fall to between
37 and 40 per cent is expected by the end of 1992.
Net debt was Pounds 73m, compared with Pounds 81m in 1990. Interest charges,
net of the Pounds 742,000 (Pounds 1.3m) capitalised on freehold
developments, fell a fraction to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 11.3m)
The appliance business, inherited from Bejam, contributed Pounds 39.8m to
sales, a rise of 22 per cent, while the insurance division rose 9 per cent
to Pounds 11.3m.
Fully-diluted earnings per share rose from 27.5p to 32.1p. A final dividend
of 5.85p (4.9p) gives a total 8.5p (7.2p).
The shares rose 7p to close at 474p.
COMMENT
Iceland has done well to get over the painful integration of Bejam, and
better still to draw back those customers alienated at the end of 1990 by
the company's move upmarket. Yet the very philosophy which has given such
success is Iceland's potential Achilles heel. Bejam's difficulties stemmed
from its move towards being a middle range supermarket. Mr Walker
emphatically denies that Iceland will forget its frozen food strength, but
the risk is there. Furthermore, by its own admission, the value-led Iceland
is a main beneficiary of recession. As conditions ease, the question of
whither Iceland is bound to rear its head. The shares have had a good run in
the past 12 months, outperforming the market by the best part of 50 per
cent. Forecasts for next year are pitched at Pounds 54m. The p/e of a little
less than 13 leaves the shares on a premium to others in the food retailing
sector where the upside might be greater.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Marketing costs check growth at Geest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEEST, the fresh produce and prepared foods group, reported a 6 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 26.2m, for the year to
December 28.
Mr David Sugden, chief executive, said the growth was less spectacular than
in previous years because of an additional Pounds 2m spending on new offices
in Miami and Brussels.
Profits were struck after an exceptional Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 90,000),
relating to the withdrawal from a wholesale business based in Brighton.
Turnover grew from Pounds 594.6m to Pounds 626.3m.
Trading profit from the fresh fruit business rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds
18.9m) on turnover of Pounds 508m (Pounds 478m).
The Central American operation, based in Miami and Costa Rica, is expected
to increase production by 60 per cent by the end of 1993.
Capital expenditure is set to rise from Pounds 17m to Pounds 40m by the end
of this year. About Pounds 25m is being invested in Costa Rica, plus Pounds
6m in a fresh pasta factory and Pounds 5m in a fresh bread factory, both
near Hull.
Trading profit from the food preparation businesses increased to Pounds 5.4m
(Pounds 3.9m).
The group has decided to withdraw from Macfish, the frozen fish business in
which it has a 50 per cent stake.
Mr Sugden said the move was 'timely' since it enabled the group to take the
Pounds 5.2m provisions below the line. A further Pounds 300,000 related to
an abortive acquisition. New financial reporting standards, which come into
effect later this year, stipulate that extraordinary items should be taken
above the line.
Associated Fisheries, which controls the other half of Macfish, said it
would also probably withdraw, incurring a Pounds 5.5m extraordinary charge.
Earnings rose to 26.3p (23.2p). A final dividend of 4.3p makes a total of
7.9p (7p).
COMMENT
By Geest's standards these were disappointing results. In spite of difficult
trading conditions the market has grown used to profit growth in double
figures. Most analysts downgraded their forecasts for 1992 from Pounds 30m
to Pounds 28m, giving earnings per share of 27.7p. This would put the
shares, down 4p at 340p, on a prospective multiple of 12.2. Yet investors
looking at the long-term should be pleased at the manner in which the
company has positioned itself to take advantage of changes that are likely
to come in the banana market in Europe. The present anomaly allowing most
European countries to restrict access to their markets to benefit their
former colonies is likely to end. Geest's Costa Rica production could
significantly increase 1993 earnings, suggesting that the shares may be
undervalued.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Laporte declines 5% to Pounds 97.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE, the specialist chemicals company, yesterday announced details of a
Dollars 60m acquisition and the unwinding of its 21-year-old joint venture
with Solvay of Belgium as it reported profits down only 5 per cent after a
recession hit year.
Pre-tax profits in the year to December 29 fell from Pounds 103m to Pounds
97.2m on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 615.5m. Earnings per share fell
from 44.4p to 40p and the company is to pay an increased final dividend of
12.1p, giving a total for the year of 33.9p, up 9.4 per cent.
Construction chemicals, organic specialities and the hygiene and process
chemicals division produced significant increases in operating profits.
Metals and electronic chemicals fell slightly while the absorbents division
saw profits more than halve after the loss of one big customer and
commissioning problems with a new plant in Widnes.
As part of the reorganisation of Interox, Laporte's joint venture with
Solvay, the Belgian company yesterday placed an 8.7 per cent stake in
Laporte with a variety of institutions. Laporte cancelled the shares
relating to the 16.3 per cent balance of Solvay's 25 per cent stake in
Laporte.
Solvay took the stake when the joint venture was formed in 1971 to see off a
hostile bid from Burmah Oil.
The reorganisation of Interox leaves Laporte with all the joint venture's
organic peroxides and persulphates business while ownership of the capital
intensive hydrogen peroxide and persalts business will pass to Solvay, the
group said.
Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said that while Laporte's share of Interox's
pre-tax profits had fallen from Pounds 34.4m to Pounds 30.8m in 1991, the
part of the joint venture it was retaining had actually seen pre-tax profits
rise. The reorganisation should be earnings neutral this year but would
enhance earnings in 1993.
The group said that the removal of Laporte's 25 per cent stake should
introduce a bid premium into Laporte's share price as previously it had been
seen to have been virtually immune from a hostile approach.
Laporte also said it has bought Rockwood, a privately-owned company making
iron oxide-based colouring systems for the US concrete construction and
coating industries.
The buy is being financed by an issue for cash of 7.5m new Laporte shares at
533p, which will raise Pounds 40m. Laporte's shares ended up 10p at 567p.
Rockwood made Dollars 10m pre-tax profits from sales of Dollars 55m in 1991
and Mr Minton said the deal will be earnings enhancing this year.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: P&amp;O chiefs buy Pounds 1.5m of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD STERLING, chairman of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, and Mr
Bruce MacPhail, managing director, between them bought shares worth Pounds
1.5m in the company yesterday after announcing results for 1991. Lord
Sterling said this was a mark of confidence in the group's future.
Group turnover was slightly lower at Pounds 4.9bn (Pounds 5.04bn) and
operating profits were Pounds 366.6m, down from Pounds 388.2m.
Despite the Pounds 604m rights issue launched in August last year the
interest charge rose to Pounds 125.4m (Pounds 122.4m). Mr MacPhail said the
group had the use of the rights money for only three months.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 217.4m (Pounds 261.3m). This showed an
improvement in the second half after interim pre-tax profits fell from
Pounds 132.1m to Pounds 73.1m, but Lord Sterling said this was largely a
seasonal bias towards the second half rather than any signs of recovery.
Earnings per share fell 23 per cent to 31p (40.4p adjusted for the rights)
but the dividend is maintained, as promised with the rights issue, at 30.5p.
Lord Sterling said the dividend policy was based on the group's medium and
long-term prospects, not the short term.
The divisional break down showed a fall in operating profits from the
service industries activities to Pounds 111.6m (Pounds 116.7m), but
passenger shipping profits rose 14 per cent to Pounds 149.8m, excluding a
Pounds 20.8m exceptional charge reflecting the effect on cruises of the Gulf
war.
Container and bulk shipping profits fell to Pounds 59.6m (Pounds 63.9m). Mr
MacPhail said the group does not disclose ship sale profits, which are a
normal part of the business, but they were lower than in 1990.
The housebuilding, construction and development division suffered a loss of
Pounds 20.3m (profit Pounds 15.8m) although this included a loss from the
Pall Mall Properties associate of Pounds 22.4m (loss Pounds 7m).
Investment property profits rose from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds 65.9m. There
was a Pounds 33m write down of investment property values which was charged
to reserves.
At the year end the group's balance sheet showed shareholders' funds of
Pounds 2.27bn (Pounds 1.74bn) and net debt of Pounds 1.07bn (Pounds 1.41bn).

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Sugar in venture talks with US
producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SUGAR, the sugar beet refining and marketing group, is in talks with
the Californian &amp; Hawaiian Sugar Company about a possible partnership.
C&amp;H is owned by the Hawaiian cane sugar growers on a co-operative basis. The
growers send their raw cane to C&amp;H's San Franciscan refinery for processing
and distribution. C&amp;H is the leading brand of sugar in the west of the US.
The refinery produces about 600,000 tonnes of sugar a year making it one of
the largest in the world. British Sugar, which Associated British Foods
acquired in January last year, is discussing a tie-up giving it a stake in
the refining and distribution business.
Mr Peter Jackson, managing director of British Sugar, said he could not
disclose any details of the discussions.
British Sugar has begun due diligence investigations and a deal was expected
by the summer. He said that British Sugar could bring both technical and
marketing expertise. C&amp;H might benefit from a change of control from a
co-operative to a company.
Analysts suggested that British Sugar would want at least a 50 per cent
stake in the joint venture, which might be worth Dollars 100m (Pounds 58m)
judging by recent acquisitions in the US sugar refining business.
C&amp;H's annual turnover is Dollars 405m. Profits are not disclosed, but
similar refineries can make Dollars 40m to Dollars 60m.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: TT on prowl after 40% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the acquisitive industrial holding company, yesterday unveiled a
40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 14.6m for the year to December
28.
The group, which has sparked speculation about its next takeover move
through purchasing stakes in Renold and ML Holdings, said it was 'in a
strong position to embark on a major acquisition at the appropriate time'.
Mr John Newman, a director, said the group's next purchase would be 'another
company which is well established in its market but which is not performing
as well as it should do'. Both Renold, which makes chains and gears for
power transmission equipment, and ML Holdings, the aerospace and electronic
components company, reported losses in their last set of results.
TT's profits growth was due to the inclusion for 12 months of Crystalate,
the electronic components maker acquired for Pounds 34m in cash and shares
in August 1990. Crystalate's Pounds 90m sales contribution also fuelled the
58 per cent rise in group turnover to Pounds 158m.
The industrial division, including Crystalate, increased its profit
contribution from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 7.8m, largely through improved
margins. In the first half of 1990, before joining TT, Crystalate had
reported a Pounds 900,000 loss.
Mr Newman said the group's profits growth in the current year would come
from an improvement in Crystalate's US division.
The packaging division returned Pounds 8.4m in profits compared with Pounds
7.9m, while building services fell slightly, from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds
1.67m.
Interest charges jumped from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 3.23m because of the debt
acquired through Crystalate and the Pounds 3m cost of buying a 40 per cent
stake in Magnetic Materials Group. Gearing fell by five points to 39 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose from 14p to 15.1p. The final dividend is increased
by 10 per cent to 3.3p, bringing the total for the year to 5.5p (5p).
COMMENT
TT is back on the prowl and whether it goes for ML or Renold first will
probably depend on which is the cheapest and least resistant. Either group
would fit into the TT philosophy, although ML has the edge with about 22 per
cent of its business in electronic components. What is not in doubt is that
TT needs another acquisition to show significant growth this year. Forecasts
are for a 9 per cent rise to Pounds 16m. At this level, the shares are
trading on a multiple of just over 12. Although the price could be capped in
the short-term by an acquisition for paper, the record at Crystalate bodes
well for the next acquisition and for the shares in the medium-term.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life sells Irish insurance arm

<TEXT>
Lloyds Abbey Life has sold Abbey Life (Ireland), its Irish insurance
subsidiary, to Canada Life Assurance Company of Great Britain, for its book
value of Pounds 20.6m.
Mr Chris Wiscarson, finance director of Lloyds Abbey Life, said the sale
reflected the company's view that without a bank distribution network in
Ireland, the subsidiary's growth potential was limited.
The new owners will merge their Irish operations with those of the Abbey
Life subsidiary to form the third largest Irish insurer. It will have total
assets of Pounds 557m, 135,000 policyholders and a market share of 5.3 per
cent. Before the merger, Abbey Life ranked 11th in Ireland with Canada Life
13th.

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Shandwick Pounds 1.4m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANDWICK, the public relations company, yesterday , reported a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 1.4m for the 15 months to October 31, slightly worse than
analysts' forecasts. For the 12 months to July 31 1990 there were pre-tax
profits of Pounds 21m
Turnover advanced to Pounds 198m (Pounds 163m) while operating profits
dropped to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 24.8m) and losses per share were 8.9p
(earnings 18p).
Shandwick also announced a number of board changes. Mr Peter Gummer remains
as chairman and additionally takes over as chief executive from Mr Antony
Stoddard, who has resigned. Mr Stoddard will act as consultant for 12
months.
Mr Gummer, together with Mr John Huckle, finance director, and Mr Dermot
McNulty, chief operating officer who is now appointed a director, will form
the executive committee of the board. Mr Gummer will relinquish the chief
executive post in due course while remaining executive chairman.
The City was forewarned of likely losses by Mr Gummer last December, when
Shandwick's share price collapsed from 125p to 52 1/2 p. Since then it has
fallen further, closing yesterday at 29p. Analysts had been forecasting
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 14m for 1992.
Mr Gummer pointed to the Gulf war and recession as the causes of Shandwick's
profits' collapse. He said action had been taken to cut overheads. Staff -
50 per cent of the company's costs - had been reduced from 2,150 to 1,950.
Exceptional provisions of Pounds 9.3m covered severance and closure costs,
delayed and cancelled contracts and abortive acquisitions and joint
ventures. In October, net debt stood at Pounds 50m and has since increased
to Pounds 56m.
Shandwick had delayed announcing the results to finalise new banking
arrangements. Mr Gummer said the company had achieved an additional Pounds
5m facility, making Pounds 65m in total.
A proposed final dividend of 1.18p makes a total of 3.54p for the 15-month
period (3.5p).

FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Prudential advances by 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Corporation, life insurance company, yesterday reported 1991
pre-tax profits of Pounds 267m, up 9 per cent, on the comparable Pounds 244m
in spite of continuing losses in its general insurance business.
The company raised its dividend by 7 per cent to 11p per share.
Prudential also announced it would no longer sell its commercial lines
general insurance through brokers, a move which resulted in a Pounds 53m
extraordinary charge.
Losses in general insurance slowed somewhat to Pounds 149m from Pounds 185m
in 1990, although within the broker sector, they rose sharply to Pounds 77m
from Pounds 48m in 1990.
However, general insurance sold through the home services division, the
sales network which distributes Prudential's life, pensions and savings
products, broke even. This reflected tighter underwriting standards which
caused a 9 per cent drop in policies written and an average 20 per cent
increase in premiums.
Profits from the sale of traditional long-term business rose by 5 per cent
to Pounds 385m, helped by sales of single-premium with-profits bonds, under
the brand name of Prudence Bonds.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said that since last May, the company had
sold more than Pounds 500m of these bonds and sales agents were at present
selling some Pounds 30m a week.
Advertising for the product, sold in similar form by several large life
insurers, is now the subject of a review by Lautro, the self-regulatory body
for the industry. Some companies may have to make refunds to customers who
were misled about the products.
Mr Newmarch believed Prudential's advertising was 'a paragon of clarity' and
clearly warned prospective customers about the risks.
Meanwhile, Mercantile and General, Prudential's reinsurance subsidiary,
produced a small trading profit which masked a significant improvement in
the underlying performance on the life side.
Nearly half of the Pounds 60m trading losses on the general reinsurance
business were due to prior years' charges, said Mr Newmarch.
He said Prudential expected to be able to raise reinsurance premiums this
year due to declining capacity in that market.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Downhill from the Maastricht summit: The outlook for
European bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Maastricht glow has well and truly faded from the European bond markets.
Four months ago, most investors thought that bond prices were heading only
one way - up.
Today, that view looks distinctly tattered. The strong rally in all European
bond markets that followed November's Maastricht summit on economic and
monetary union and continued to drive bond prices up early in the new year
has gone into reverse. In the UK and France, virtually all the
post-Maastricht gains have now been wiped out, largely during the past
fortnight (though yesterday brought some relief).
'The European bond markets can't really get going again until the third
quarter (of the year),' says Mr Andrew Burtenshaw, a fixed income fund
manager at Norwich Union, the UK insurer. In the meantime, he says, the
outlook in all markets is 'either bad or uncertain'.
Lower bond prices mean higher yields. As the charts show, yields in the main
European government bond markets, which fell after Maastricht, have been
heading up. That means higher borrowing rates, and a longer haul out of
recession in countries such as the UK.
What went wrong? Two factors accounted for the rally, and explain why the
market has now lost its shine. One was the widespread belief that German
interest rates would fall by the spring, as the Bundesbank succeeded in
re-exerting its normal vice-like grip on German money supply (a grip which
had loosened after reunification).
The other factor was the agreement in principle on economic and monetary
union reached at Maastricht, which led to a consensus among bond market
participants: that interest rates across the community were set on a path
which would bring them ever-closer.
Both hopes have faded. High wage settlements and rapid growth in the German
money supply mean that a relaxation in German interest rates has been put on
hold. This week, Bundesbank officials warned that it may be late summer
before German rates come down. Some investors say that, in the meantime,
they may well have to go up.
That view is not shared everywhere. DWS, the fund management arm of Deutsche
Bank, one of the biggest bond investors in Europe, says it is increasing its
weighting in German bonds. 'The growth rate is coming down a bit, but we are
not worried about inflation,' DWS said. 'We do not think inflation will rise
much more.'
Meanwhile, the fashionable view of convergence between EC bond markets has
faded a little as investors have realised that economic and monetary union
is still a long way off. Political uncertainties in France, which held
regional elections last weekend, and Italy and the UK, both of which hold
elections early in April, have added to the disquiet.
As a result, the gap between interest rates in Germany and some other
European countries, which had been narrowing, has started to widen again.
French bonds had recorded some of the best gains: the difference between
French and German yields fell from 69 basis points (hundredths of a
percentage point) at the end of November to 51 basis points at the start of
the year. Now, that gap has opened up to 70 basis points again.
Taking inflation into account, the move is even more marked. French
inflation levels moved below those in Germany last year: that means the gap
between 'real', after-inflation rates in France and Germany have opened up
even wider.
The sell-off in the bond markets may already have been overdone, many
investors say. Most still expect German interest rates, once they start to
fall, to decline sharply, pulling down interest rates across the community
in their wake. 'We have been buying into the weakness,' says Mr Burtenshaw.
'Looking over the next 12 months, yields look very attractive.'
Some markets look a better prospect than others. The decline in French
inflation and the feeling that last weekend's elections were not as bad as
they might have been has encouraged some, such as DWS, to increase their
investments. Others, such as the UK, seem set for a troubled ride, at least
until political uncertainties and devaluation fears are out of the way.
The general optimism about the outlook for the rest of the year is not
shared by all.
Legal and General, one of the UK's largest insurers, says it took a decision
to reduce its exposure to European bonds earlier this year, and sees no
reason yet to change its view. German commitment to the Maastricht proposals
is still uncertain, says Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income investment: a
rejection of the deal could yet lead to a nasty backlash in other European
bond markets. 'It's too early to get the flags out and wave goodbye to high
interest rates,' he said.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Nestle details FFr15bn payment for Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Europe's most tortuous corporate sagas ended yesterday when Nestle,
the Swiss foods group, disclosed details of its agreement with Italy's
Agnelli family to take control of Perrier, the French mineral water, in a
FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.6bn) deal.
'Reason has prevailed,' said Mr Reto Domeniconi who, as director-general of
Nestle, led the fight against the Agnellis for control of Perrier. 'We have
a clear, comprehensive agreement. Everyone has ended up with something.
There are no losers in this affair.'
Nestle has been pursuing Perrier on the Paris stock market and through the
French law courts since its original FFr13.42bn bid made with Indosuez, the
French bank belonging to the Suez industrial group.
Under the agreement, finalised early on Monday, Nestle and Indosuez will
increase their offer for Perrier from FFr1,475 to FFr1,700 a share. Exor,
the French property company that controls Perrier, has promised to support
the offer. Ifint, an Agnelli vehicle, is the biggest single shareholder in
Exor for which it has launched a FFr5.6bn bid.
The Agnellis will emerge with a substantial cash profit estimated at more
than FFr1bn on Exor's Perrier shares. They will also keep Exor's property
interests, worth around FFr3bn, and Chateau Margaux, the French vineyard.
Meanwhile BSN, the French food group which turned against its old allies,
the Agnellis, to side with Nestle, its chief competitor, will drop its
FFr6bn counter-bid for Exor. Instead it joins the Agnellis - as a 10 per
cent partner - in a higher FFr6.12bn bid for Exor. BSN will buy Volvic, one
of the Perrier waters, from Nestle under the terms of a prior agreement.
The stormy saga of Perrier might not yet be over. The European Commission is
approaching the end of its preliminary inquiry into Nestle's bid and has
until tomorrow to decide whether or not to mount an in-depth investigation.
'Such an investigation would involve freezing the bid for four months,' said
Mr Domeniconi. 'And given that this affair is so very complex we have to
assume that the commission may well decide to do that.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Prudential to stop selling general insurance by broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL, the UK's largest life insurer, announced that from yesterday, it
would no longer sell general insurance in the UK through brokers, after
losses of Pounds 77m in that business in 1991.
Prudential becomes the first of the large UK life companies to retreat from
the highly competitive and increasingly unprofitable commercial insurance
market where overcapacity has limited suppliers' ability to raise premiums.
Others, such as Legal and General, have said they were considering such a
move.
'Given our view of the market's prospects, we see no case to make the
investment of either our shareholders' resources or our management time to
attempt to improve our longer-term position,' said Mr Mick Newmarch, group
chief executive. He said the company had explored all options, including the
sale of the broker division, before deciding to close it completely.
The company has taken an extraordinary charge of Pounds 53m after tax from
the withdrawal, but will free up Pounds 100m in shareholders' funds to
expand more profitable parts of Prudential's business. Some 400 jobs will be
lost in the closure, but Prudential said it would try to redeploy the
individuals involved.
Prudential yesterday reported a 9 per cent rise in 1991 pre-tax profits to
Pounds 267m, in spite of losses in its overall general insurance operations
of Pounds 149m.
Mr Newmarch said the decision to withdraw from the general insurance broker
market was part of a wide-ranging review which began last September. The
broker market is the outlet for Prudential's sales of commercial insurance
to small businesses. It accounts for about 20 per cent of all Prudential's
general insurance business. On top of 1991 losses, the sector lost Pounds
48m in 1990 in spite of increases in premiums.
'We found that the problem with intermediaries (brokers) is that they are
keeping some of the increase in premiums,' said Mr Michael Lawrence, finance
director. Thus, the company was paying higher commissions for diminishing
business.
Mr Newmarch said that Prudential would retain some presence in home-related
general insurance because 'there is a natural synergy between that and our
life, pensions and savings products'.

FT  25 MAR 92 / P&amp;O shares rise as it holds fall to 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER-than-feared results and the untangling of a property joint venture
helped the share price of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company
jump 32p to 416p yesterday.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 were 17 per cent lower at Pounds 217.4m, but the
City had been expecting a figure of around Pounds 200m. There was also
relief over the ending of the uncertainty surrounding the future of Pall
Mall Properties, P&amp;O's joint venture with Chelsfield, Mr Elliott Bernerd's
private property company.
P&amp;O is to pay Pounds 50.2m for Chelsfield's half share in Pall Mall, which
was set up when the two companies bought Laing Properties in April 1990 for
Pounds 495m. However, Chelsfield is buying back a half share in Laing
Properties, the US business for Pounds 33m. Chelsfield is also buying 40 per
cent of Pall Mall's UK properties for Pounds 181m.
Chelsfield will finance the purchases through a private placement of shares
raising up to Pounds 80m. Of that Pounds 65m has already been tied up
including Pounds 10m from P&amp;O. It is also borrowing Pounds 162m, of which
Pounds 60m is a 10-year subordinated loan with equity warrants.
Mr Bernerd said that with Chelsfield's existing business this would give the
group gross assets of Pounds 340m, financed by Pounds 180m of debt and
Pounds 160m of equity. He said that Chelsfield was now in a position to take
advantage of opportunities in the property sector. He plans to get a quote
for the company either through a listing or a reverse takeover as soon as
practicable, he said.
The effect on P&amp;O will be to bring Pounds 525m of debt on to its balance
sheet, taking gearing from the December 31, 1991 level of 47 per cent to a
pro-forma 70 per cent. Lord Sterling, chairman, said this was 'eminently
comfortable' considering the cashflows from the group's property business.
P&amp;O, the only large UK company to have been set up by Royal Charter, also
announced that it would ask the Privy Council to approve a supplemental
charter allowing overseas investors to invest freely in its shares. Under a
previous supplement dated 1903 there is a 25 per cent limit on foreign
ownership of P&amp;O's shares. Lord Sterling said that at present about 9 per
cent of the shares, were held overseas.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Lloyds names new chairman: Top appointments at the clearing
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Bank, the UK's most profitable clearing bank, yesterday announced
that Sir Robin Ibbs, former head of the prime minister's think tank, will be
its next chairman and that Sir David Walker, the outgoing chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board, will become a deputy chairman.
Bankers said Sir David would be groomed to succeed Sir Robin, who is likely
to be chairman for a comparatively short period, possibly no longer than two
years.
Lloyds felt it could not appoint Sir David, a former director of the Bank of
England, to the top job immediately because he has no experience of
commercial banking. Sir Robin, who became a deputy chairman of Lloyds in
October 1988, will take over from current chairman, Sir Jeremy Morse, at the
beginning of next year.
Sir David will become a deputy chairman on July 1. Sir Robin said he
expected Sir David would work for Lloyds 'full time' but refused to say
whether Sir David would succeed him.
'It was necessary for me to do the job for a spell,' Sir Robin said.
A senior executive of Lloyds said Sir Robin was 'well-liked and
well-respected in the bank'. Sir Robin said he has been spending three days
a week in the bank, concentrating on 'strategic issues'.
Some bankers thought Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds chief executive, might be
disappointed not to get the chairmanship, but Lloyds has a tradition of
choosing outsiders for the chairman's post, so it is unlikely that Mr Pitman
considered himself a serious contender.
'Brian is a hands-on chief executive,' said a banker. 'I am sure he would
find it very difficult to play a non-executive chairman's role.'
However, Lloyds said that Mr Pitman, who at 60 is the normal normal retiring
age for Lloyds' executives, will stay as chief executive until 1995. It also
said that Mr John Davies, his deputy, will become deputy chief executive.
Sir Robin spent most of his career at Imperial Chemical Industries, one of
the UK's two biggest manufacturing companies, where he became an executive
director in 1976.
From 1980 to 1982 he was seconded to the Cabinet Office, where he was head

FT  25 MAR 92 / Complaints against insurers rise steeply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of dramas that insurance companies made out of crises increased
by 64 per cent last year, judging by the complaints heard by the insurance
ombudsman, Dr Julian Farrand.
His report, published yesterday, said that the 4,334 cases dealt with by his
watchdog bureau were just 'the tip of the iceberg'. There were 13,899
written inquiries and 26,048 telephone queries. Dr Farrand predicts that
around 5,000 cases will be handled this year.
He said the rise had been caused by the recession, which gave consumers more
incentive to complain, and the impact of the Financial Services Act, which
has tightened regulation.
Complainants were successful in only 32 per cent of cases, but the money
awarded as a result totalled Pounds 5m.
In the biggest award, of Pounds 500,000, an insurance company queried
whether its policyholder, a woman reported dead while on a visit to Kenya,
had indeed died. After sending a private detective to Africa it was
discovered that she was dead, but the company then claimed that she could
not have been of sufficient means to justify covering her life for such a
large sum.
The ombudsman pointed out that no question had been asked about her means
when she took out the policy, and called for the company to pay the full
Pounds 500,000 insured.
This case was exceptional, but the ombudsman also handled cases in which
independent intermediaries had forged surrender forms, and where salesmen
had sold wholly inappropriate policies because their training had not
covered more relevant products.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Letter: Aid needs a new deal, not either/or approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's interesting article, 'Refugees and wasted revenues'
(March 11), airs the view that refugees need more 'development' rather than
'relief' aid from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
non-governmental organisations (NGOs). I would like to take issue with this
either/or approach.
Oxfam believes that refugees and displaced people need a new deal
altogether. Not only should more and better aid be available for both
development and relief needs, but also greater political priority and more
resources should be devoted to finding the durable political solutions
necessary to tackle conflict, repression, hunger, and economic collapse -
the main causes of mass human displacement.
When enlightened self-help development programmes for uprooted people are
possible, they are clearly of great value, as Oxfam has learned from the
wide variety of initiatives it has supported. Certainly, governments should
be encouraged and helped to provide such opportunities.
The reality, however, is that very few governments are prepared to allow
large numbers of refugees to compete with the local labour force, to take
over land, or to have unrestricted movement. Agencies like Oxfam, which are
mandated to respond to acute human need, are often faced with little option
but to help provide basic needs while a durable political solution to the
cause of displacement is sought.
Surely, informed debate should also focus on the need for all concerned  -
NGOs, UN agencies, academics, and governments - to press for improved
conflict mediation and resolution, for real resources and clout to back the
new UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator, for systems of government which are able
to resolve societal conflict peacefully, and for effective food security
strategies. We agree that a civilised international attitude towards
refugees would be an excellent starting point.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Letter: Not much of a stimulus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAN BUNTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have noticed recently that governments in the English-speaking
economies, when increasing their borrowing requirements, are apt to refer to
the process as providing 'a net fiscal stimulus'.
There are three ways of running a public sector borrowing requirement and
during my career I have seen all of these in operation. Under the most
liberal regime, part or all is financed by borrowing from banks, or indeed
from the central bank, this process being referred to colloquially as
'printing it'.
I am able to recall long strategy meetings during the 1970s when gilt-edged
specialists engaged in heated debate regarding the exact extent to which the
government would fund its deficit or simply print the difference.
I think it is uncontroversial that financing by such means expands money
supply and hence economic activity or the price level. Indeed, if the US
economy should fail to respond to successive reductions in interest rates
('pushing on a piece of string') then it must surely be by this means that
the Federal Reserve will avert serious depression.
Now for the sake of clarity let us move to the opposite process. Under this
mode, the government runs a deficit; finances it more conservatively, by
means of bond issues; and in fact does more than this, and 'over-funds' the
deficit, by issuing more bonds than necessary.
I seem to recall this in operation during one of those phases when a
socialist government, in reaction to early excesses, embarked upon
exaggerated fiscal rectitude. I think it is uncontroversial that this
process, like any process of asset sale for the liquidation or avoidance of
borrowing, mops up liquidity and therefore reduces money supply and economic
activity or the price level.
We now turn to the present. It seems that the present vogue is for
governments neither to 'print' nor to over-fund, but to fund exactly, by
means of bond issues. This process neither stimulates nor depresses the
economy; the effect on credit creation is neutral. The only effect is to
transfer resources into government spending - in order to buy votes - at the
expense of other activities such as private sector investment or exports.
In short, we eat the seed corn at the expense of our children.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN R FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your paper's comment and assessments of the Labour party's budget
proposals are objective insofar as they are based on theoretical economics.
There is, however, from an industrial viewpoint, a choice to be made in
budget terms between the two main parties when the key facts are considered.
The UK and western economies are mature markets and, therefore, future rates
of economic growth are likely to be downwards from those of the last 30
years.
Any recovery in the UK will be consumer and not investment nor export led.
The rate of corporation tax and weakness of world markets prevent it being
otherwise.
The southern half of the country, through commitment to the housing market
and mortgages, has been hardest hit in recession. Potentially this is the
engine for recovery in the UK, but little or no comment is made on the
effect of the Labour party proposals on this.
The shadow chancellor's proposals for national insurance and income tax must
surely represent the largest proportional increase in taxation history.
They are, therefore, highly significant, as the proportional effect will
have as great an impact as the absolute numbers. At a stroke the proposals
reinstate an effective standard income tax rate of 34 per cent and put many
taxpayers back to where they were in 1979.
There is, therefore, a real choice for the electorate to vote either for a
redistribution of wealth now or long-term improvements through wealth
creation.
The impact of these choices needs to be spelt out and debated by
commentators and, one hopes, politicians.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
  .causes major damage, as many have no doubt already remarked. The prime
minister reacted to British Gas chairman Mr Robert Evans's 17.6 per cent
salary increase by saying that he expects senior executives to exercise
leadership in matters of pay.
This tight-lipped comment deserves an award for self-restraint, but it is
ambiguous: Mr Evans could claim that in a year of falling profits, this is
leadership. This claim would make as much sense as the routine defence
offered by British Gas - that it must pay enough to hold on to talent. The
bidding for 64-year-olds with a lifetime CV in a nationalised industry is
hardly hectic.
The rational explanations that suggest themselves are equally implausible -
for example, that Mr Evans wants a Labour victory, since it might remove the
Conservative threat to the BG monopoly; or that this is a subtle plot by Mr
Peter Walker, who sits on the BG remuneration committee, to re-enter the
Tory leadership race.
The only serious issue is not political: it is that contracts like his,
which are not subject to shareholder review or approval, are an anomaly in
any public company. Meanwhile, Mr Evans has placed an each-way bet: he wins
enough to pay his tax if Labour wins, or to sweeten political exile if it
loses.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Nuclear leaks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCIDENT at the Sosnovy Bor nuclear plant may have been a narrow escape
for the people of St Petersburg. The release of radioactive iodine showed
that the fuel in the RBMK reactor was damaged - and that means it could have
come close to a Chernobyl-type explosion.
The incident also reminds the west of the need to help the CIS - and the
other countries of eastern Europe - to make safe their huge legacy of
dangerous Soviet-designed nuclear power stations. It is a worthwhile
reminder because for the last few months nuclear specialists have been
preoccupied with the task of making safe the stockpile of Soviet warheads,
and they have neglected the civil nuclear sector.
Russia is too dependent on nuclear power to contemplate shutting down its
reactors for the time being, even though the Ukraine plans to close the two
remaining RBMK reactors at Chernobyl by the end of next year.
In the short run, therefore, the west needs to accelerate its programme of
helping the CIS to operate the reactors as safely as possible, by retraining
their demoralised staff and technicians and by installing modern control
systems. Funds and technical assistance can be channelled through the new EC
programme of technical aid to energy industries in the CIS. At the same
time, the International Atomic Energy Agency needs more resources to expand
its existing nuclear safety work.
Assistance should come not only from western governments but also from the
nuclear industry and equipment manufacturers. The order-starved companies
take a schizophrenic view of the former Soviet Union. On the one hand they
see a potential lifeline from contracts to rebuild or replace the dangerous
Soviet-designed reactors. But there is also the potential nightmare of
another accident like Chernobyl or worse, which would destroy any prospect
of nuclear power re-establishing its credibility in western public opinion.
Either way the industry has strong self-interest in adopting a generous
attitude now.
Looking beyond immediate safety measures, it is clear that the 14 RBMK
reactors in Russia and Lithuania must be shut down as soon as possible. The
IAEA regards their design as intrinsically dangerous - something that even
the most modern control system and the best bolt-on safety equipment cannot
put right. (The other Soviet-designed reactors, the VVER model based on the
western PWR, are relatively safe).
To enable the Russians to shut down the RBMKs, the west will have to provide
technology to build new generating capacity, for example clean coal-fired
power stations or even modern nuclear plants, and at the same time improve
the appalling inefficiency with which Russians consume energy. In other
words, western technical and financial assistance will have to encompass a
far wider field than the nuclear industry if it is to help prevent another
Chernobyl.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Leading Article: It's tough at the Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO JUDGE by the FT's survey, published today, the men and women who run
Britain's Training and Enterprise Councils are diligent, loyal and persuaded
that on the whole this extremely ambitious project is going well.
That is the good news. For the government, and its successor, the bad news
is that they want more money and greater flexibility to develop their
programmes.
These are important messages that the politicians would be ill-advised to
ignore. It was obvious to everyone but the government that its decision to
cut for two years in succession and at a time of rapidly rising unemployment
the funding of the two biggest programmes the Tecs run - the youth training
and employment training schemes - was an approach best suited to the Monster
Raving Loony Party.
One inevitable side-effect has been to pile pressure on the agencies which
deal with some of training industry's most demanding customers, such as
ex-offenders and the disabled. If Labour wins, the cuts will be more than
restored.
The issue of flexibility is more complicated, because it goes to the very
heart of the Tecs' main dilemma: what are they for?
Those who joined their boards from business, the public sector and trade
unions, did so in the belief that their job was to improve training inside
companies and to help nurture small business - hence the middle word in the
Tecs' titles. Some Tecs would rather not be in the business of training the
unemployed at all; others merely think the balance of their tasks is askew.
Remedial work
In this case, the government is right and its critics wrong. If the Tecs are
to deploy to maximum effect their mix of entrepreneurial and cross-agency
skills, it must be part of their role to deal with those who are most in
need of training, even where this involves heavy remedial work on reading,
writing and numeracy.
The main problem seems to be that in its desire to account for the very
large sums of money involved - approaching Pounds 2bn a year - the
Department of Employment has felt obliged to adopt accounting procedures
based on crude monitoring of place numbers, which the Tecs find excessively
bureaucratic.
Financial supervision is an increasingly familiar problem as government
contracts out services, but it is not one which outweighs the benefits of
managerial initiative, motivation and flexibility. So far the Tecs have not
been given auditing procedures suited to their style and mission.
Measures of quality
Tecs should instead be funded at least partly by results, in terms of the
qualifications their clients gain, or by other measures of quality achieved.
Also if Tecs were subject to the kind of oversight the Audit Commission
brings to public sector bodies, there would be other benefits. The data
gathered could form the basis of an annual report, subject to scrutiny by a
parliamentary select committee. At present Tecs operate far too secretively
for their own good. Audits would also provide useful comparative data for
Tecs to consider their own performance.
For Labour, the FT survey contains three specific messages: that Labour is
considered by most Tec directors to be either a neutral or a benign force in
training; that they do not want Labour's proposed tripartite supervisory
body; and that the directors are divided on the merits of Labour's plan to
charge a levy on companies which fall short of certain standards of training
provision.
Neither of these Labour ideas is wrong in principle. Although an
ill-designed levy scheme would be open to avoidance by the declaration of
bogus or valueless training activities, it is an idea worth pursuing,
especially at a time of constrained public expenditure.
As for a supervisory body, there is no doubt that Tecs need a clearer
overall strategy and a more transparent link with government. Labour,
however, must resist any temptation to play old-style tripartite politics
with the Tecs; that was the mentality which destroyed the Manpower Services
Commission, an earlier attempt at just such a body.
The Tecs remain fragile creatures attempting to blaze a trail in an area of
British public policy where few honours have been won. They will need
looking after by whoever wins the election.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Cost of Russia's Falklands - Stalemate over
Japan's northern territories must end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A British diplomat visiting Argentina recently was talking about Russia and
Japan. He explained that the main obstacle to better relations was Russia's
continued occupation of the Japanese 'northern territories', seized by the
Red Army in the last days of the Second World War. It was hard, he added, to
see why Russia was so determined to hang on to them: a handful of small,
windswept, almost uninhabited islands, of no economic importance except as a
means of claiming an enlarged fishing zone.
For some reason, his audience began to giggle.
The cost of retaining the Falkland Islands is not an issue in the British
election campaign, though perhaps it should be. We are, after all, in the
middle of commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Argentine seizure of the
islands and the war to win them back. Memories of that struggle and of those
who died in it are too fresh for any political party to risk reopening the
subject.
The cost of hanging on to the Japanese islands certainly should be an issue
in Russian politics. Japan has made no attempt to recover them by force, and
is most unlikely to do so, but has been firm and consistent in refusing to
accept the fait accompli of 1945. It restored diplomatic relations with
Moscow in 1956, and by the late 1970s had become one of the Soviet Union's
leading trading partners in the west.
It has even been willing, in the current crisis, to provide humanitarian aid
for the Russian population. But there is still no peace treaty between it
and the Soviet Union (or Russia), and Japan has drawn the line at economic
aid. Economic and political issues, it says, cannot be separated.
Russia is desperate for economic aid. There seems to be something like a
consensus in the west that it should get it. Two weeks ago, when former US
President Richard Nixon's memo denouncing the US's 'pathetically inadequate
response' to the Russian crisis became public, President George Bush did not
reply that much more generous aid would be inappropriate, but said, in
substance, that the US was broke and the effort to help Russia must be a
multilateral one.
In any such effort, Japan would be expected to be a significant contributor.
The Japanese are well aware of this and talk unofficially of putting up
one-third of a putative multinational fund which could total as much as
Dollars 100bn. But, they say, there must be a solution to the islands
problem first.
So the islands may be the key to Russia's economic future. What is holding
President Boris Yeltsin back from a deal? A mixture of pride, principle and
politics. National pride makes it hard for any country to yield territory
just because it is strapped for cash.
The principle involved is that the territorial settlement at the end of the
Second World War should not be questioned, because there are too many cans
of worms to be opened - especially the borders of Poland, east and west. Yet
it is highly questionable whether the islands can be regarded as part of
that settlement. The Soviet Union only declared war on Japan on August 8,
1945 - two days after the bombing of Hiroshima - apparently with the sole
object of helping itself to Japanese territory.
Japan did, in the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 (which the Soviet Union
refused to sign), 'renounce all right, title and claim to the Kurile
islands'. But the treaty did not define the limits of the islands.
It is reasonably clear that Japan understood the phrase to refer to the
islands it acquired by an exchange of territory with Russia in 1875, and not
to the islands of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomais, none of
which had ever belonged to any country other than Japan before 1945. It is
these latter islands which Japan still regards as its own 'northern
territories'.
Politically, Mr Yeltsin is constrained by the vested interests of some
15,000 Russian civilians who now live in the islands - many of them
providing services to the military garrison - and by the views of the armed
forces, who regard the islands as strategically important.
The rest of the world has so far taken little interest in the dispute. It is
time for that to change. If Russia's economic salvation is indeed a matter
of global security (which, given the size of the country and the weapons it
contains, it surely is), and if this dispute is holding up a global effort
to help Russia, then there must be a global interest in finding a way round
it.
Japan, it seems, is not in a hurry to obtain physical possession of the
islands. It wants its sovereignty to be recognised. That leaves scope for
compromise on timing, and for mediation by a third party whom both sides
would trust. Another job for the US secretary of state, Mr James Baker,
perhaps?

FT  25 MAR 92 / Arts: Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This RSC production is so gloriously, relaxingly funny that it is especially
to be recommended during the British election campaign, from which it is so
different. It takes you through Shakespeare in two hours on the trot.
The RSC in question is not the Royal but the Reduced Shakespeare Company and
comes from California. Its abridged version of the complete works of the
bard has been around at the Edinburgh Festival and was seen briefly in
London at the Lilian Baylis Theatre in 1990. It looks better than ever at
the Arts.
The Complete Works (Abridged) is a pardonable title. Romeo and Juliet gets a
good 25 minutes: Hamlet occupies almost the whole of the second act. Between
them you have 16 comedies reduced to a five minute goulash and the history
plays treated as an American football match. As a famous historian wrote,
the crown of England in the pre-Tudor period had become a football, so the
analogy is apt: 'the quarterback passes to the hunchback'.
Antony and Cleopatra is set aside as one of Shakespeare's 'geopolitical'
plays. Troilus and Cressida is dismissed as obscure but, unlike Two Noble
Kinsmen, not bad. Titus Andronicus is cooked up as Titus Androgynous and
Coriolanus passed over because of dislike of the anus. There is a brief
reference to the 154 sonnets, a summary of which is threatened to be passed
round the entire audience. In one way or another, most of Shakespeare is
there.
Some of the jokes are not so much schoolboy ('Act 2' - 'Gesundheit') as
positively PhD - like the cutting of one of Hamlet's central soliloquies
'because it only shows the central weakness of the character'. Also, some
neat American playing with language - 'when the cock crew' (not crowed).
These clowns have erudition to their fingertips and can (and do) play Hamlet
backwards.
Apart from the wit, the triumph is in the exuberance of the playing. There
are only three performers: Jess Borgeson, Adam Long and Reed Martin.
Borgeson plays Hamlet and also the Shakespearean scholar whose ambition is
to see a copy of the complete works of the bard in every hotel room. Long
plays the girls' parts, like Juliet, with pantomime grace. Martin used to
work in a circus, does a genuine fire-eating act and plays a tune by tapping
his fingers on his jaw while the others are offstage.
The American ability to induce audience participation goes beyond the
English. Without the slightest hesitation, the right side of the stalls
agrees to incant 'Get thee to a nunnery', the left side 'Paint an inch
thick', while the people in the 'cheap seats' (ie the circle) let loose in
unison with 'Cut the crap, Hamlet. My biological clock is ticking and I want
babies now' as an answer to Ophelia's problems.
As one of the performers says on the second go of the audience joining in:
'That is much less than totally pathetic'. Typical Californian
understatement. I think it's terrific.

<TEXT>
Riccardo Muti's second contribution to the current Scala season is a new
production of Gluck's penultimate opera. Muti, revered by the Milanese,
could court even greater popularity in his home theatre by reserving for
himself the surefire popular favourites - but he does not. There is an
admirable high-mindedness about this, and also about the conductor's
determination to mastermind, as a key feature of his music-directorial
tenure, a steady Scala revival of the neo-Classical operatic repertory,
whether Mozartian (Idomeneo and Tito) or Gluckian (the original versions of
Alceste and Orfeo).
His conducting of such works proclaims a particular aesthetic - when
preparing Alceste, five years ago, Muti borrowed a phrase from the sculptor
Canova, 'estrarre la carne dal marmo' (extracting the meat from the marble),
to describe it. This approach to the most concentrated, intimate and exactly
proportioned of all Gluck's Paris masterpieces had both meat and marble.
Like all Muti's performances it was an outstandingly fine-chiselled,
smooth-polished piece of work. Intense care was taken over the drawing of
clean lines, vocal and instrumental, the limpid balance of parts, the
unimpeded flow of sections. Intense personal feeling was sensed in the
command of the work's dramatic peaks. 'O malheureuse Iphigenie]', begun by
both orchestra and protagonist as a half-voice meditation and developed only
later into a full-throated lament, provided a remarkable example.
A work which represents one of opera's most elevated reconciliations between
the dictates of action and contemplation, past memory and present emotion,
was grasped in one piece and delivered whole. And yet something was missing.
It was less the modern-instrumental forces and large chorus that seemed a
touch old-fashioned than the somewhat homogenised use of them. The shrieking
flutes and piccolos in the opening storm, the throbbing and whirling string
figures in Orestes's second-act psychological crisis, the C-major
trumpet-and-drum exaltation of Pylades's 'Divinites des grandes ames': all
lacked the piercing vitality of sound-colour that transforms Gluck's
purposefully bare scoring into white-hot music-drama.
But then, Muti could hardly have been urged in this direction by the
ponderously plodding production. The famous 1957 Scala Iphigenie en Tauride
staging by Visconti has left behind a store of indelible images  - notably
Maria Callas amid Benois's colonnades and staircases - even for those who
never saw it. Any images deposited in the memory bank by the current Scala
staging, by the veteran Giancarlo Cobelli in the designs of Paolo Tommasi,
will probably be of the negative kind: the heavy grey pseudo-granite panels
clumsily lit, the ugly grey priestess costumes, the feeble floor-level
writhings of Orestes's demons, the Classical-drama-by-numbers chorus
movement.
La Scala does not favour the 'engaged' grapplings with 18th-century
masterpieces that are now the rule in trans-alpine opera theatres; the best
one can say of Cobelli's production is that it left the principals free of
the dramatic impositions that sometimes go with those 'engaged' grapplings.
And as Iphigenia and Orestes were cast at the day's highest level, this
proved a virtue.
In her first attempt at the former, one of the most sublime but also most
taxing roles of the dramatic-soprano repertory, Carol Vaness surpassed even
the highest-pitched expectation. As one might have expected of a singer,
versed in Handel, who is the world's foremost current Donna Anna and
Idomeneo Electra, she compassed every facet of the music. The combination of
taut-drawn line, freely lustrous tone and chastely contained yet sometimes
fierily passionate expressivity was wonderfully apt.
Miss Vaness is at once a full-blooded and a grandly stylish Classicist; one
could believe in her both as Clytemnestra's daughter and as a high
priestess. Though her French delivery had evidently been studied with care,
some phrases of recitative emerged less clear in delivery than others. The
art of eloquent, emotionally affecting Gluck declamation is learnt through
long experience; she must be encouraged to pursue it, and to take on Gluck's
Alcestis and Armida as well - since the days of Crespin, Gorr and Callas
herself, no leading soprano has shown herself so well fitted for the task.
In this art she will no doubt profit from the example of her Orestes, of
which role it would be hard to imagine a nobler exponent than Thomas Allen.
Towards the end there were moments of slight pitch-slipping (tiredness?);
for the most part Mr Allen made his high-lying phrases ring out with awesome
force - not, of course, a matter of decibels but of focused vocal and
dramatic artistry - and, even more important, with the ability to etch every
syllable on the listener's consciousness. In two fearful cries of
'Agamemnon?' he seemed to sum up the opera's psychological profundity.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Arts: Perverse appetite for mumbo jumbo - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'New Age' with all its anti-rational fancies is upon us and there is a
growing tendency towards the credulous on television, which should be nipped
in the bud. It is less important in drama than in journalism. Moon And Son
has been a pretty silly series, yet it would be wrong to campaign for its
removal solely on the grounds that it encouraged belief in astrology,
psychokinesis and other supernatural mumbo jumbo. If that was our aim it
would be more important, as late in the day as 1992 in what we are
perpetually assured is a 'multicultural society', to oppose the way that the
BBC continues to cleave to just one of the world's many supernatural
religious faiths. Anyway, fiction has always been chock full of the occult,
from the witches in Macbeth to the ghosts in Truly, Madly, Deeply. We may
justifiably look to fiction to cater for what is obviously a huge appetite
for the mystical.
But it should play no part in journalism. It is embarrassing to find a
supposedly serious programme such as the BBC's QED, which bills itself as an
'investigative science series', chasing after a herbal cure-all in the
Arizona desert. For centuries there have been snake oil salesmen on the
roads of America, but it is not the job of serious journalists to encourage
belief in their products. The chap publicised by QED was a regular observer
of flying saucers who claimed to have got the formula for his nostrum from a
Red Indian medicine man. If anyone had started out genuinely believing his
was the ultimate wonder drug (it is said to cure baldness as well as cancer)
one researcher operating alone could have discovered the truth of the story
in 48 hours, without the huge expense of taking an entire film crew into the
desert. The BBC's Science And Features unit should be ashamed of itself.
Worse by a considerable degree is Channel 4's continuing encouragement of
the 'Satanic Ritual Abuse' industry. No doubt over the centuries there have
been people who dressed up as devils or witches prior to sexually abusing
children. It is hard to see that it makes much difference to the abused
child whether or not the abuser is wearing a pointed hat or pretending to be
Lucifer: it is the abuse that matters and which should be rooted out and
stopped. But the SRA merchants, among them Christian fundamentalists and
socialists who have seen their belief systems crumbling, are intent upon
convincing us that devil worship allied to sexual abuse is rife in Britain
today.
The lack of evidence is clearly a difficulty (though not in the US, origin
of this fad, where the SRA hunters say 'You see? That just proves how clever
they are]') but each programme contains one seemingly telling exhibit which
is tricked out with endless ooky-spooky footage of people looming out of the
mist on Hampstead Heath. In the most recent Dispatches programme the
'evidence' was a peculiarly nasty bit of 'satanic' video which we were told
was being investigated by Scotland Yard. Now it turns out (according to the
London listings magazine Time Out which has a pretty reliable line on these
things) that the video was created nine years ago for the Genesis P-Orridge
rock group. The trouble is that in allowing the hunters of Satanism to keep
on and on, Channel 4 eases the public towards dismissing the whole thing -
including genuine abuse of children.
BBC2's three-part adaptation of The Old Devils is proving quite splendid, as
of course it should, having been written by Kingsley Amis, adapted by Andrew
Davies (author in his own right of A Very Peculiar Practice, one of the
funniest drama serials this decade) and with a cast that will have future
generations marvelling: Sheila Allen, Anna Cropper, Bernard Hepton,
Elizabeth Spriggs, John Stride, and more. It is packed with typically wicked
Amis lines, right from the off when the home-going London Welshman, Alun,
tells the minicab driver 'We're going to Paddington, would you know that at
all? It's a railway station' - a line that was actually invented by Davies,
though you have to check the book to be sure, so good is the faking. But
however enjoyable the wit, however impressive the ensemble acting (very),
however scathing the view of professional Welshness, the true power of this
piece is in its observation of the shift from middle to old age.
There is a fearful honesty about Amis at his best, and this is the best
since Lucky Jim. Behind the surface humour you sense the baleful eye of a
weary Everyman, measuring the human race and finding it pathetic,
hypocritical, cowardly, unctuous, and pretty well unchanging. Of some
writers you could go on to say 'Nevertheless he loves them individually' but
with Amis the truth seems to be that he doesn't. Certainly he sees the
comedy of their lives, senses the absurd, but finds it in himself to like
them very little. Indeed, despite all the laughter he creates he seems to be
a pretty thoroughgoing misanthropist.
Comic misanthropy is a powerful brew, and one you do not find on American
television. Series such as The Golden Girls may get close to the bone
occasionally, but American network managers would be put off by anything
that was not consistently 'positive'. British television, on the other hand,
is rich in this area. As time passes Carla Lane's work becomes increasingly
misanthropic: her funniest series (it may be significant that other writers
contributed) was her first, The Liver Birds. Subsequent series have become
more and more like situation tragedies: Butterflies, Solo, The Mistress. In
Bread there seemed to be a deliberate policy to make the lines funnier, but
even then the view of life was often jaundiced.
With Screaming on BBC1 we are definitely back to melancholia in general and
animosity towards men in particular. Admittedly Carla Lane does not let
women off lightly: Jill Baker, Gwen Taylor and Penelope Wilton (another
superb collection of actresses, is there truly poor acting somewhere on
television which I miss?) share a house, are about to discover that they
have shared the same lover, and are keenly aware of one another's
shortcomings, from huge ugly feet to the inability to say 'No'. However, in
Lane's book women's 'faults' tend to be the gifts of the gods and thus
deserving of our sympathy whereas men's shortcomings are invariably their
own fault. That is not to deny that Screaming is subtle and funny and that I
want to see the rest.
In last week's 01, ITV's critical guide to what's on in London, Paula Yates
interviewed those coming out of the new musical, Moby Dick and suggested it
was 'tacky and sexist' and an excuse for showing 'girls in tassels'. Yet
Paula Yates posed for a famous picture spread in Penthouse using the Reform
Club as the setting. In one photograph her only accoutrements are black lace
gloves, patent leather stilettos and a copy of the FT. In other shots there
is not so much as a tassel to obscure the view. So why the high mindedness
on television?

FT  25 MAR 92 / Appointments: Goode returns from US for Rank Xerox
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rank Xerox, jointly owned by Xerox Corporation and the Rank Organisation, is
bringing back William Goode, who had spent a six year spell with Xerox in
the US, as its new director of finance and control.
He replaces Jack Milligan, 58, who in turn moves to the Xerox headquarters
in Stamford, Connecticut to advise Paul Allaire, the chairman of Xerox, on
the business relationship with the Japanese affiliate Fuji Xerox.
Goode, who is 44 and English, has spent the past three years as finance
director of the Americas operations of Xerox, which comprises the Americas
excluding the US, and the Middle East. In terms of revenue, he says that
area of responsibility amounted to just over half that of Rank Xerox. Before
joining Rank Xerox in 1977, Goode had worked at British Leyland, where for
the past five years he had been financial controller of the Cowley complex.
In the year to October 1991, Rank's profits dipped modestly, but still
delivered what managing director Bernard Fournier called 'an excellent
result', given the environment. Goode said yesterday that 'while we are
always concerned to achieve improvements in efficiency, we are also looking
for growth in market share, in both mature and emerging markets. We have a
very powerful array of new products.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Management: Now for something completely different
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers in Britain are making growing use of secondments to help train new
recruits, broaden the experience of managers in mid-career and encourage
those retiring early or made redundant to find new skills.
The Action Resource Centre (Arc), which organises secondments from the
public and private sector into community projects, handled 425 placements in
the past year.
Examples include seconding a British Gas manager to a Tower Hamlets
community project which helps unemployed young people to set up their own
businesses, and getting a British Rail customer relations officer to teach
English to Vietnamese refugees.
Hilary Stokes, who is organising the first Careers Research and Advisory
Centre (Crac) conference on secondment in Birmingham next week, says the
increase is in part due to recession.
Sometimes secondments form part of an 'outplacement package' for employees
who are made redundant, or are used as an opportunity to provide managers in
the middle of their careers with the opportunity to try something different.
Usually, young and mid-career managers return to their employer but
occasionally they decide to stay with their host organisation.
But Stokes says the growth in secondments also reflects a greater awareness
of what personnel managers call 'resource development' - training staff,
planning careers and broadening managerial skills.
There is also an expanding interchange between industry and the education
sector. Large- and medium-sized businesses take students on for short work
experience secondments, while according to Crac, 26,500 teachers spent some
time in industry last year and about 500 business and industrial managers
were seconded to educational establishments.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Appointments: Clarke fills first chair in corporate
governance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate governance, recently the bane of the British boardroom, has now
been elevated to the role of an academic discipline.
Leeds Polytechnic will offer the first chair in corporate governance, with
half the cost to be sponsored by Drake Beam Morin, an executive outplacement
consultancy.
The chair will be filled by Thomas Clarke (right), previously a senior
lecturer at Nottingham Business School, lecturer at St Andrews University
and a visiting professor at FGV Business School, Sao Paulo.
Clarke's doctorate focuses on control in several industries, including the
British newspaper industry. In 1975, he first met the late Robert Maxwell at
the Scottish Daily News in Glasgow and completed a detailed study of his
business practices.
This work is only now being published because of threat of litigation.
Clarke's role during his three-year appointment will, among other things,
involve studying the pressures of short-termism on corporate decision-making
and 'inquire into the competencies of directors'.
And why is an outplacement firm interested in promoting the study of such
things? 'We're interested in good management generally,' a spokeswoman
explains.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Management: Getting the chemistry wrong - Dow Corning's
response to the breast implant scare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No company is immune from crisis. Even the most solid companies, selling the
best established products, can get into trouble and all the fail-safe
management systems in the world may not be enough to get them out of it.
Silicone gel breast implants had been on the market for decades and Dow
Corning had sold them for almost 30 years. The company's reputation was
unsullied: it prided itself on having one of the best corporate ethics
programmes around.
Yet last winter, a San Francisco woman was awarded Dollars 7.3m (Pounds
4.2m) in damages and Dow Corning charged with knowingly selling a defective
product. Within months, Dow Corning's handling of the implant crisis was
being compared with Exxon and the Valdez oil spill or AH Robins and the
Dalkon Shield debacle as the furore over the devices grew.
In the face of mounting lawsuits, political controversy and congressional
investigations, the Michigan-based company last week said it would withdraw
from the silicone breast implant business altogether.
The combative way in which Dow Corning initially responded to the
controversy was a classic case of crisis mismanagement, and succeeded in
sabotaging the company's reputation. It failed to adhere to the the golden
rule: when things go wrong, accept responsibility and maintain good
relations with the public. That way, Johnson &amp; Johnson managed to limit the
damage from its tainted Tylenol pain killers.
Handled properly, the implant scare need not have attracted so much adverse
publicity to Dow Corning. Implants account for less than 1 per cent of the
company's Dollars 2bn annual sales. And the safety issue is far from
resolved - they have not been proven safe, but they have not been proven
unsafe either.
Before the controversy, Dow Corning was generally seen as whiter than white.
'If you had asked me six months ago, I would have used Dow Corning as an
example of how a company can put into place a process that prevents
something like this from happening,' said Kenneth Goodpaster, a former
Harvard business school professor now at the University of St Thomas in St
Paul, Minnesota.
On paper, the ethics system - started in 1976 - is thorough. The company
established a business conduct committee with six managers serving
three-year terms and devoting up to six weeks each year to committee work.
Each Dow Corning business operation is audited by the committee every three
years. Results of the audits are reported to a three-member audit and social
responsibility committee of the board of directors. Employees are also
encouraged to raise ethical issues.
Dow Corning says it is still trying to find out how, with all these
safeguards in place, serious questions of safety did not arise earlier,
although the silicone implant business had been audited four times in nine
years. Executives believe the process itself may be flawed, since safety was
seen as more of an operational than an ethical issue.
Corporate image and complacency may also have played a role. Dow Corning, a
50-50 venture between Dow Chemical and Corning Inc, is primarily an
industrial supplier and does not have the sense of corporate accountability
of most healthcare companies. Furthermore, the implants were regarded as
more of a cosmetic than a healthcare product. Silicone had been used for
many years with so few side-effects that its safety was never seriously
questioned.
Although there had been scattered reports of health problems for years, they
only recently started to gather momentum. 'It was a case of being too close
to the forest, so they missed the trend,' says Viren Mehta, an analyst at
Mehta &amp; Isaly a pharmaceutical investment researcher in New York.
He argues that 'it was the classic tale of management who had been in place
for a long time and were not sensitive enough to changing perceptions. They
did not see that the newer reports of side-effects carried more weight.'
The lack of corporate concern about safety was not for lack of information.
Memos and internal documents dating from 1976 outline safety concerns from
doctors, sales agents and Dow Corning employees.
Yet, when the San Francisco court awarded damages last winter and charged
Dow Corning with concealing evidence that linked ruptures in the implants
with autoimmune disorders, the company responded with cries of outrage. And
when the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) launched its own investigation,
the company resisted turning over its internal documents for several months.
By the time Dow Corning finally agreed to release those documents, and the
public learned that the company had known about safety problems for more
than a decade, Dow Corning was in deep trouble.
The company has belatedly adopted a more conciliatory stance. In January, it
hired Griffen Bell, Attorney-General under President Carter, to investigate.
Bell, with a panel of scientists and medical experts, will look at how the
implants were developed and marketed. Dow Corning says it is premature to
say what went wrong until Bell's findings are publicised.
Meanwhile, Lawrence Reed has been replaced as chief executive by Keith
McKennon, a former Dow Chemical executive with a reputation for diplomacy
who helped to steer Dow Chemical through the Agent Orange scandal in
Vietnam.
Although the company has denied all charges of wrongdoing, and is appealing
against the San Francisco judgment, it has offered to pay Dollars 1,200
towards implant removal for women who could not otherwise afford the
surgery. An estimated 750,000 women around the world have had Dow Corning
implants, bringing the theoretical cost to more than Dollars 900m.
Dow Corning has taken a Dollars 25m fourth quarter charge to cover legal and
other costs related to the controversy. It also has Dollars 250m of
insurance to cover potential legal costs and plans to invest Dollars 10m in
further research.
The very worst that could happen is that the weight of pending litigation
could force the Dow Corning into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. But even if
the company's finances escape unscathed, it has a long way to go to restore
its credibility.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings' search for a finance director to replace Kevin
O'Sullivan, who left after totting up the food processing group's recent
annual figures, has been concluded with the appointment of Simon Moffat.
Currently finance director at Kwik Save, the discount grocery retailer,
Moffat will finalise Kwik Save's interim results before moving to Hillsdown
in June.
Moffat, 39, spent 14 years with Unilever and two with Grand Metropolitan
before joining Kwik Save in 1990. He says that his experience of working for
a number of 'strong-minded chief executives' will be helpful for his job at
Hillsdown. And he is keen to work for an international food group again. He
vows that Hillsdown will use the proceeds of its recent, controversial
rights issue wisely.
Meanwhile Kwik Save has promoted John Murphy, head of its Coleman's
subsidiary, to take over the role of deputy managing director from Frederick
Mills who will be retiring next February. Kwik Save says it will announce a
replacement for Moffat as soon as possible.

Lowndes Lambert, the insurance broking group which was floated last year,
has reached into its past with the appointment of Sir Robert Clark to be its
non-executive director and deputy chairman. Roy Watts, non-executive
chairman, is retiring and Richard Shaw, currently chief executive, becomes
executive chairman.
Sir Robert, well known in the City, was chairman of Lowndes' former parent
company, Hill Samuel, at the time of the group's management buyout in 1987.
He was also a director and deputy chairman of TSB Group between 1989 and

stepping up to chairman next year. Astley Whittall, 68, the present
incumbent, is to retire. The new managing director will be Richard Marton,
currently running the consumer and special products division.
This orderly succession reflects the BSG policy of promoting from within.
Cannon, now 63, has worked his way through the group, starting as a cashier
in 1951. Whittall has been chairman for 11 years. Marton, who joined BSG as
the result of a takeover 19 years ago, has been with the group for a shorter

FT  25 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Erasing the black marks - A
controversial proposal to register contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government's recent decision to postpone the introduction of public
registers of contaminated land has given the property industry a breathing
space for the next few months.
Local authorities were due to start drawing up the registers on April 1
under the section 143 of the Environmental Protection Act. But the industry
protested that the scheme would severely blight much building land and knock
millions of pounds off the value of property already built on such sites.
Following strong opposition the Department of the Environment will have
further consultations with the construction and property industries and
bodies such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).
Friends of the Earth estimates there are 100,000 contaminated sites in the
UK including old chemical plants, disused mines, 6,000 former rubbish tips
and 5,000 old gas works. Herbert Smith, the law firm specialising in the
environment, says the clean up could cost between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds
1m per acre. Many sites contain chemicals and toxic metals that can pollute
water sources or methane gas that can cause underground fires and
explosions.
Developers are not opposed to the registers in principle but object to the
form proposed by the government. The DoE found it would be too expensive and
time consuming to draw up lists which would accurately assess the state of
contamination on each site. So it settled for a system which would include
all sites known to have been put to a contaminative use.
Contamination would have been negligible in many cases and some land might
have been rendered harmless by expensive de-contamination treatment.
Nevertheless they would have appeared on the registers and remained there
permanently. There was no right of appeal against the decision.
'The scale of the impact is vast,' the RICS complained to David Trippier,
minister for environment. 'We believe hundreds of thousands of sites could
be effectively sterilised for re-development - up to 30 per cent of the
Black country for example.'
The House Builders Federation told Trippier that unless the measure was
amended it would have 'a damaging and prolonged effect on the housing
market.' Many modern housing estates, business parks and out-of-town
shopping centres are built on previously polluted sites which have usually
been given de-contamination treatment.
The registers would affect many properties held by government departments
and block attempts to rejuvenate derelict inner city areas where much of the
contaminated land is located. Ironically, the building which houses the
Department of the Environment in Westminster would be on the list as it was
built on the site of a old gasworks.
The National Rivers Authority, the official watchdog for water quality, is
alarmed at the amount of pollution seeping into rivers from old sites. In
the Black Country it has identified 200 badly contaminated sites and is
drawing up a programme for tackling the worst of them.
Under the Water Resources Act it can clean up a site and reclaim the cost
from the person who 'caused or knowingly permitted' pollutants to get into
rivers. But it is difficult to identify the person guilty of old pollution
and current owners could be made bankrupt if they are forced to pay.
Attempts to solve the problem will continue whichever party is in power
after the general election. In a policy paper, Judith Denner of the DoE's
contaminated land branch says: 'Registers are only part of the government's
overall strategy. The next step is to establish the need for follow-up
action on registered sites.'

<TEXT>
When Pauline Tomkins joined Rockware Glass, the UK glass manufacturer,
little did she know that part of her training as product manager would
involve counting birds, butterflies and plants in the pouring rain in
Majorca.
At British Coal, Jason Parker, a management trainee, was similarly puzzled
when his company told him he was going to Wales to plant saplings.
Both were taking part in what could well be the 1990s' version of the
outward bound course - research and conservation projects organised by
Earthwatch, the environmental charity.
Earthwatch sends 'volunteers' around the world on the equivalent of working
holidays - helping scientists with such projects as monitoring the mating
rituals of moths in Ecuador or excavating bison skeletons in Nebraska.
The difference from a normal working holiday is that 'volunteers' pay to
participate - anything up to Pounds 1,200 plus air fare for a two-week
project. The money that Earthwatch receives is used to finance the
scientists' work.
Earthwatch has sent 32,000 volunteers on projects since starting up in the
US 20 years ago. Now it is looking to increase links with business and
industry to raise more money for environmental science and help improve what
it calls the 'environmental literacy' of companies.
Earthwatch believes the projects are relevant to businesses because they can
teach their employees teamwork while enhancing specialist knowledge. Andrew
Mitchell, deputy director of Earthwatch Europe, which started up two years
ago, says: 'Many people sitting behind desks have skills they do not
immediately recognise as being useful to the environment - computer
analysts, surveyors and architects could all contribute.'
The itineraries are demanding. Volunteers might have to rise with the dawn,
work in all sorts of weather conditions, walk miles every day and all the
while get along with strangers.
Rockware was one of the first UK companies to sponsor employees on
Earthwatch projects. One of those chosen was Alastair Pike, the company's
marketing manager, who went to study the wetlands of Albufera in Majorca.
His experience made him more environmentally aware, says Pike. 'Plastics has
not got a good image environmentally and I almost felt I was acting against
my conscience by working for an industry that in the eyes of the outside
world could be causing the environment harm.'
On his return he increased the company's involvement in plastics recycling,
organising a presentation by Recoup, the non profit-making plastics
recycling organisation.
BAT, the tobacco group, also chose Earthwatch when deciding to increase its
environmental commitment. 'We looked at a whole series of environmental
initiatives and liked Earthwatch's personal involvement and commitment,'
says Helen McDonald, external affairs officer. The group ran an in-house
competition for four places on Earthwatch projects, and the winning
employees are expected to produce a report on their return.
Companies can also get involved by becoming members of the Earthwatch's
Corporate Environmental Responsibility Group; through one-off donations; and
by sponsoring project places for teachers or students. British Airways, for
example, is sending four teachers from local communities on projects. 'We
have a 'good neighbour' goal. It's one way of improving our interaction with
the community,' says Hugh Somerville, head of environment at BA.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Third world city, first world
smog - Urban Air Pollution / Bangkok chokes on success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU DON'T need to be a scientist to know that Bangkok's air is filthy as
well as hot. Choking clouds of building dust, diesel smoke and burnt engine
oil from two-stroke motorcycles assault the lungs and nostrils of
pedestrians. Traffic policemen often wear face masks and bus passengers
unable to afford the luxury of air-conditioned transport hold a handkerchief
to mouth and nose as they crawl to work in the city's notorious traffic
jams.
A group of US and Thai experts recently confirmed what some people had
already guessed: Bangkok's environmental problems are legion (only 2 per
cent of its 9m inhabitants are served by sewage facilities, for example) but
air pollution probably has the worst impact on human health.
Their report, Ranking Environmental Health Risks in Bangkok, published by
the US Agency for International Development (USAID), concludes that both
airborne dust and lead pollution are particularly serious problems.
Reliable data on pollution in Bangkok are rare, but the authors describe the
level of particles as 'a serious threat to public health' which could lead
to 1,400 deaths a year. According to the Thai government, even the lowest
reported average blood lead levels in Thailand are three times as high as
those in the US or western Europe.
The reasons for Bangkok's environmental crisis are not hard to find.
Thailand has undergone very rapid economic expansion and industrialisation
over the past two decades. Much of the growth has taken place without the
benefit of planning and has been centred on the Bangkok metropolitan area.
Its infrastructure has been overwhelmed by an influx of factories, vehicles,
people and the residential and office blocks thrown up by property
developers.
Vehicle sales in Thailand have been growing at about 35 per cent a year  -
with 500 vehicles added to the streets of Bangkok each day - and the Bangkok
region now accounts for three quarters of the country's industrial gross
domestic product. Environmental regulations which do exist in Thailand are
as often honoured in the breach as in the observance.
As Bangkok began to choke on its own economic success, however, increasingly
prosperous city residents resentful of pollution found common cause with
businessmen worried about profits and officials anxious to lure more
tourists to Thailand. Non-governmental organisations sprang up to fight for
green causes and the newspapers started to publish a torrent of articles
about the environment.
The authorities were forced to take note, and the last government -
installed by the armed forces to run the country between their coup d'etat
13 months ago and this week's general election - has been active in
implementing environmental projects.
Anand Panyarachun, the outgoing prime minister, boasted this month of his
cabinet's record in championing the introduction of unleaded fuel in May
last year and creating an environment fund to help businesses adapt to new
environmental demands.
At the same time the government has required local refineries to reduce the
lead in petrol and to adjust crude oil distillation procedures in order to
make lighter diesel which produces less smoke when burned. This week new
rules come into force requiring the use of low-smoke lubricants for
two-stroke engines.
Perhaps just as important in a city with no underground railway system are
the government's efforts to push through three mass transit projects worth
some Dollars 6bn. If the conflicts between the proposed Hopewell road and
rail project, the long-delayed SNC-Lavalin skytrain and the Bangkok
Metropolitan Authority light railway can be resolved, the city's road
traffic problems and the associated pollution might be eased.
Bangkok may yet turn out to be a city so horrified by its own environmental
degradation that it starts to correct mistakes with the wealth that
Thailand's economic development has generated. 'If you walk on to the
streets of Bangkok, the seriousness of the pollution issue is evident,' says
Dhira Phantumvanit, director of the Natural Resources and Environment
Programme at the Thailand Development Research Institute. 'At least with
countries at our level of development you have money to invest in pollution
control.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Jobs: A promising scheme . . . and what befell it - First
trial of subsidised self-advertising by unemployed executives was marred by
human frailty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READERS will doubtless have heard the old jingle about all the important
things that fell apart because a nail dropped out of a horse's shoe. Well,
meet the horse-shoe nail.
Just four weeks ago the FT was preparing to run the first trial of a scheme
to help executives who've lost their jobs by providing them with a
subsidised market. As first proposed by redundancy victim Peter Laurence,
the plan was that employing organisations would be invited to join this
newspaper in funding - say - half the cost of a regular advertising space in
our pages, in which people out of work could offer their abilities at a
commensurately reduced price.
Numerous readers responded to that proposal, some volunteering active help.
They included several outplacement and recruitment consultants as well as
Streets Direct Marketing which said it would handle the production of the ad
free of charge. The trouble was a distinct lack of similarly generous
responses from employers.
The only one to offer any help was Bowater, whose chief executive David Lyon
said his group would sponsor a one-off trial. It would consist of sufficient
space for brief self-advertisements by six jobless executives with skills
specifically in business-development, at a personal cost to them of Pounds
50 apiece. The date of the trial was set for the last week of February.
After announcing the project three weeks before, I eventually received
submissions of the right length from 43 suitably qualified people. Although
the majority were in Britain, there were individuals from Belgium, Germany,
Italy, Norway and Spain.
The six to appear were chosen at random, and the advertisement was set up.
The arrangement was that it would run at the foot of the page headed by the
Jobs column which, on the day, would spell out what was happening beneath.
The plans were thus well laid, and ready to run.
At which point I emulated the horse-shoe nail by falling ill.
The Bowater-backed ad ran all right, and generously large it was. But no
explanation of it appeared above, which resulted in grievous bewilderment
among people who had not read my announcement three weeks before. Indeed the
only responses received by two of the half-dozen were from fellow victims of
executive cut-backs, wondering what on earth was going on.
The other four fared at least a little better. The sole overseas candidate,
from Italy, had one lead. Another received two, and the remaining couple
each had four.
The only thing I can see in their self-ads that might account for the
differences is that the pair who were left lead-less offered no
foreign-language skills, whereas the better-off quartet all did. Then again,
the one speaking the most languages - the Italian with six - received only a
single response.
Although even the two who had none have said they still think the scheme was
worth a try, I am sorry for marring it and would like to make amends by
trying again. Unfortunately, except for Bowater, no employers have shown
interest in lending the necessary help. But if any should suddenly be struck
with public spirit, I'll let you know.
NOW to the table alongside, giving the latest indicators of management pay
in Britain as shown by the twice-yearly surveys of the Reward consultancy.
The study just completed was based on information from more than 1,000
organisations of widely varied types, sizes and locations. Anyone wanting
the full report, priced at Pounds 180, should contact Bill Couldrey of
Reward at Diamond Way, Stone, Staffordshire ST15 0SD; telephone 0785 813566,
fax 0785 817007.
Although the survey covers six levels of executives, my extracts focus on
just one - those placed immediately below director. In the smallest
businesses, however, they may be on the board while doing essentially the
same kind of job.
The left-hand two columns of figures refer to the lower quartile manager who
would be a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all doing similar
work. The first gives the base salary, the second total cash pay including
bonuses.
The next four columns relate to the median manager halfway in the ranking,
giving the latest salaries and total cash pay, followed by the equivalents
12 months before. Then come the new figures for the upper quartile executive
a quarter way down from the top of the ranking. Lastly we have the
percentages with company cars.
To allow for pay rises between the collection of the data and April 1,
Reward says all cash figures should be upped by 1 per cent, with another 0.5
per cent being added for each further month from May 1 onwards.
Regional variations from the overall median salary of Pounds 29,535 were:
Higher - London by 18.5 per cent, Scotland 8.4, and south-east England 2.5
per cent. Lower - Northern Ireland by 1.6 per cent, west midlands 6.9,
south-west 8.6, north-west 9.0, eastern counties 10.1, and north-east 10.3
per cent.
Variances from the Pounds 29,535 by the employing company's sales turnover
were: Higher - Pounds 100m-plus by 17.5 per cent, and Pounds 40m-Pounds 100m
by 1.6. Lower - Pounds 15m-Pounds 40m by 6.1 per cent, Pounds 5m-Pounds 15m
by 9.4, and up to Pounds 5m by 17.7 per cent.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Greens may rely on economy's move from red to
black - The Issues, Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE environment is not exactly a burning issue in this election. The Tories
place it at the end of their manifesto; Labour assigns it to page 21 of its
28-page document; the Liberal Democrats put it higher up; but only the Green
party gives it pride of place.
At the last election, pollsters tracked every blip in the Green party's
fortunes; now they lump green voters in with 'others'. The recession is
largely to blame - the main parties have much more pressing social and
economic issues on their plate, and protecting the environment can look
expensive when times are hard.
However, while green issues may have lost some of their sharpness, they have
also moved into the political mainstream. Voters expect politicians to be
green these days; the question now is how they set about it.
The Tories are fighting on what they call their record of achievement. Their
manifesto stresses that their party is not one that makes wild promises and
fails to deliver.
The keystone of the Conservative strategy will be to set up a new
environment agency, a kind of super environmental watchdog that will combine
the functions of the National Rivers Authority, the Pollution Inspectorate
and local authority waste regulation. The body will have to produce an
annual state-of-the-environment report.
The Tories also say they will press the EC to introduce integrated pollution
controls on the UK model, something they are rather proud of.
If he wins, John Major will fly the green flag by going down to Rio for
June's earth summit; he was one of the first national leaders to agree to
attend.
However, the Tories look vulnerable on the environment. They may have lived
up to some of their promises, but many were modest. The UK lags the rest of
the EC, for example, in its plans to curb carbon dioxide and sewage
emissions.
The daily battles between motorway builders and conservationists on Twyford
Down in Hampshire coincide embarrassingly with the election campaign, and
give Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, a distinctly
anti-green tinge.
The Tories' policies also need to be tested against promises they are making
in related areas, such as energy and transport. Can they curb the growth of
traffic? Can they curb carbon emissions and still make British Coal an
attractive privatisation prospect?
Labour will be targeting the Tories' 'laggardly and reluctant' green
policies. Their central pledge is to establish a legal right to a clean
environment, though the party has yet to spell out what this means.
There will also be greater freedom of green information, and EC-driven
environmental impact assessments. Labour wants to subject every policy to
environmental appraisal, co-ordinated by a newly created cabinet minister
for environmental protection. There will be an annual 'Green Book' on the
environmental impact of government policy.
Pollution rules will be enforced by an independent environmental protection
executive, and there will be more stress on curbing waste and on eco-audits
for business. Trade in toxic wastes will be banned. Mr Kinnock would also go
to Rio if he wins.
Labour's policies seem to tie in more logically with its plans to invest
heavily in public transport and curb traffic growth. However, its commitment
to the coal industry must raise questions about its ability to deal with
carbon dioxide unless it promotes an effective energy efficiency campaign.
The Liberal Democrats promise a far-reaching fiscal and regulatory package
to clean up the environment. There would be tough targets for cutting
pollution, backed up by measures such as an energy tax, emission licences
and the scrapping of the nuclear-power programme. Heavy investment would go
into public transport, and money would be spent on roads only where
necessary.
The Green party manifesto goes well beyond the symptoms of pollution to
tackle what it believes are the root causes: poverty, a tax system that
penalises work rather than use of resources, and a Gatt regime which
discourages environment-friendly rules.
There is a lot about cyclists, windmills and energy-efficient light bulbs,
yet the manifesto makes by far the most interesting reading of the four and
will cause some voters to wonder whether the main parties are only tinkering
with the problems.
The Greens are fielding 250 candidates. At the last election they polled 1.5
per cent of the vote, though they managed to get up to 15 per cent in the
1989 European elections. However, they may have to wait until the next
boom-time election to raise their showing.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour broadcasts its national health warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S election broadcast last night appeared to be something of a mystery
to the party's press office.
The broadcast, scenes of which are shown below, showed a young girl in pain
waiting for a National Health Service ear operation while another girl,
whose mother writes a Pounds 200 cheque, receives private treatment.
The only available details were that the director was Mr Mike Newell, who
has made advertisements and 'small films'; that the song used, Someone
Really Loves You, was a cover version of a BB King song; and that the two
girls were actresses. Production was thought to have been completed 'quite
recently'.
Labour's press office said that the broadcast's message was 'prompted by a
letter from a father whose daughter had to wait 11 months' for a quite
common childhood problem known as 'glue ear', which is painful and affects
hearing.
But officials said it was not an exact re-enactment of the case.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, says in the film: 'If the Conservatives
win, they will continue to privatise the NHS and make it more like the
American system.'
The broadcast opens with the words: 'The story of two girls with the same
problem - one can afford private treatment, the other can't' It ends with
the message: 'It's their future, don't let it end in tiers.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher defends the union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher ventured into the traditionally hostile territory of
Scotland yesterday and said she did not believe Scots would abandon the
union of the United Kingdom by choosing independence, James Buxton, Scottish
Correspondent, writes.
She said: 'The union has done wonderful things for us all over the
centuries. People may talk about breaking it but when it really comes to the
point they will realise that you don't jettison something that has brought
the world so much.'
Earlier, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, made an uncharacteristically
angry attack on the Scottish Nationalist party, which threatens three of the
Tories' nine Scottish seats including Mr Lang's in Galloway. He warned that
it would make Scotland 'the new Albania' of Europe, just as Albania was
abandoning socialism. He denounced the SNP as 'the most socialist party in
Europe'.
The SNP said yesterday that Scotland would lose another 100,000 jobs under
either Labour or the Tories. Mr Alex Neil, SNP vice-convener, said: 'The SNP
stands alone in offering Scots full employment.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems on attack over tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR and the Conservatives are collaborating in a 'tax is bad' campaign
which will hinder future social provision by the government, Mr Des Wilson,
the Liberal Democrats' campaign director, complained last night.
Liberal Democrats backed a one penny increase in the basic rate of income
tax to fund Pounds 2bn extra spending on education because 'it's the best
investment we can make', he said in a speech in Aylesbury.
Mr Wilson said Labour had lost its traditional understanding of the value
electors placed on the use of tax for developing transport infrastructure,
education and health service. The Liberal Democrats have embarked on the
risky strategy of focusing on their education plans in the belief that there
is support for higher taxes for public services.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Union tunes up the campaign machine - The
GMB's election drive in the north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the Magnesia Bank, a North Shields pub that is popular with Labour
activists, Mr George Thompkins and Mr Kevan Jones are having a quick lunch.
Mr Thompkins is not so much eating his steak as forcing it into submission.
Mr Jones, smartly suited, mobile telephone beside his plate, is polishing
off scampi and chips.
Mr Thompkins, caretaker at the Newcastle headquarters of the General,
Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union, the north's biggest union,
is volunteer driver for Mr Jones during the election.
Mr Jones, the GMB's regional political officer, is helping the Labour
party's campaign in the north-east and Cumbria as its head of logistics. He
is doing what the GMB (motto: Working Together) does best  - organise. Last
week they drove 2,000 miles, preparing the ground for Labour's stars and
smoothing their way.
The day they lunched at the Magnesia Bank, he organised events in Tory-held
marginals Tynemouth and Darlington. They including two factory visits by Mr
John Edmonds, the GMB's general secretary, in support of Labour's Darlington
candidate.
Then they drove to West Cumbria for a meeting between GMB shop stewards from
the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's
national campaign co-ordinator, who is defending a 1,894 majority in
Copeland. Also attending was Mr Doug Henderson, the shadow trade and
industry spokesman, a former GMB official and Labour MP for Newcastle North.
Mr Cunningham and Mr Henderson were two of the GMB's five sponsored
northern-region MPs. Each receives a Pounds 600 annual donation to his
constituency party and 80 per cent - about Pounds 4,500 - of his general
election campaign costs. The money comes from the GMB's political fund,
levied from members' subscriptions. Those who object can opt out, Mr Jones
stresses.
GMB activists help with dog's-body tasks for the union's sponsored
candidates and the three non-sponsored GMB members standing in the region.
They include Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's former image-maker, in Hartlepool.
Mr Alan Donnelly, Tyne and Wear's MEP and former GMB northern officer, is
organising the campaign tour of Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor.
This general election is the first in which Labour candidates have been
selected under the electoral college system. This gives members the right to
vote and limits affiliated bodies to 40 per cent of the votes. The party's
aim of moving entirely to one-member-one-vote has GMB support.
Mr Nick Anderson, GMB northern region secretary, denies that GMB help puts
Labour in its debt. He says the only thing the union has wanted is the
right, included in Labour's manifesto, of union recognition in new plants.
The GMB is trying to persuade members who support the party to become
individual members. Mr Jones has recruited 1,300 people for Labour in the
past two years. The union might recommend a candidate to its members, he
says, but individual Labour members vote by secret ballot so they cannot be
coerced.
'Where the Tories go wrong is arguing that the Labour party is still
controlled by the unions,' he says.
Anecdotes about the GMB's culture vary from warily affectionate to biting,
but they hardly trouble the GMB. 'We have a future,' says Mr Anderson. 'We
are totally efficient, that's why we are the best. So is the Labour party.'

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A golden opportunity for the gilts traders -
City Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilts market may have been quaking since the Budget, but every billion
pounds added to future borrowing spells lucrative extra business for dealers
in government securities.
Mr Robert Thomas, head economist at NatWest Treasury and Capital Markets,
has been projecting how far borrowing might jump. The starting point is the
official public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn for the
financial year 1992-93. On a more cautious economic growth assumption than
the Treasury's, Mr Thomas finds that even the Tories would be borrowing
Pounds 36bn by calendar year 1994. If Labour wins, the PSBR could hit Pounds
48bn in the same year, he believes.
'Labour needs to do something about confidence,' he observes.
At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, economist Mr Bill Martin thinks the PSBR could reach
almost Pounds 60bn by 1996. His colleague, gilts specialist Mr Chris
Anthony, also believes that whoever forms the next government will need to
provide reassurance. 'Investors will be reluctant to place money into the
market until a new economic package is unveiled,' he says.
Back in October, when investors thought the Conservatives were likely to win
the election, gilts were yielding only 1.3 percentage points more than
German bunds. Now the gap has widened to more than 2 points - a measure of
the extra risk perceived by foreign investors, who have recently been buying
half of the newly issued gilts.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Montagu, says the market is
becoming worried about a hung parliament. Yields on long-dated bonds have
jumped from 9.2 per cent to 9.7 per cent in a month. But Mr Bootle says:
'Plenty of people are prepared to buy the ultra-longs at 10 per cent.'
Older traders look forward to gilts returning to centre-stage, where they
starred in the late 1970s. But as the Thatcher government paid off the
national debt in the 1980s, the gilts market was pushed to the wings.
For the moment, however, government bond prices are uneasy as investors face
up to the prospect of a huge increase in new issues. But the rise in yields
does not seem to reflect fears of inflation: index-linked gilts have also
become depressed and now offer a real yield of as much as 4 1/2 per cent,
suggesting that investors are upset by the sheer volume of paper in the
pipeline.
Mr Jeremy Alford of Whittingdale, a specialist bond investment house, is
trying to stimulate public interest. He warns that building society returns
could soon tail off. 'UK savers should invest in fixed-interest securities
which could provide significant returns as interest rates fall,' he claims.
But too many domestic investors - private and institutional - have simply
lost the habit of buying fixed-income securities. 'We will continue to rely
very heavily on foreign investors', Mr Anthony of UBS P&amp;D predicts. It is
fortunate, he adds, that 'high-yield currencies are all the rage on European
Community convergence arguments'.
The big international bond houses which dominate the gilts market are
looking forward to a prosperous few years of marketing large volumes of
gilts to the world. Only signs that Britain's finances might go so badly
awry that it would be forced to abandon its commitment to the ERM could
seriously spoil the outlook. So far, none of the parties has put a foot
wrong on that score.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major keeps up attack with European accent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR added a Euro-sceptical edge to his election campaign yesterday
as the Conservatives combined their harrying of Mr Neil Kinnock over
taxation and spending with an attack on Labour's inexperience on the world
stage.
Party strategists also seized on apparent differences between Mr Kinnock and
his shadow chancellor after Mr John Smith sought to clarify the type of
credit controls that might be put into practice by a Labour government.
Mr Smith's insistence that such controls would not operate directly on
borrowers was contrasted with Mr Kinnock's earlier suggestion that the
policy might lead to the reappearance of mortgage 'queues'.
Speaking at a Westminster press conference, Mr Major emphasised that a
re-elected Conservative government would take a hard line with Brussels over
the Com-munity's budget and farm policy.
Taking sideswipes at the interventionist instincts of some of Britain's
European partners, he also indicated that he remained to be convinced that a
single currency was practicable before the end of the century.
Mr Major, who was joined by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in his
attack on Mr Kinnock's leadership in foreign affairs, said: 'The question at
this election is a stark one. Who can you trust to defend our interests and
keep Britain safe?'
Using untypically abrasive language, Mr Hurd said that Labour's policy on
Europe had moved from 'total opposition to total subservience'.
The Conservatives, however, continued to direct most of their fire at
Labour's tax and spending plans, with Mr Major repeating his challenge to Mr
Kinnock to 'cost' Labour's manifesto pledges.
The prime minister said he would continue to put a Pounds 38bn price tag on
the Labour manifesto until the Labour leader offered his own figures.
That strategy was underlined by Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the
Treasury, who launched an advertising campaign emphasising that the Labour
party's proposals would cost every taxpayer Pounds 1,250 a year.
Mr Mellor, however, agreed that the scope for any increases in public
spending under a re-elected Conservative government would be severely
limited by the impact of the economic recession on the Treasury's finances.
He said that the next public spending round would not be easy. While the
Conservatives would maintain 'priority' programmes, there would not be scope
for increases in other disdiscretionary expenditure.
Mr John Smith yesterday rejected suggestions that Labour would ration
mortgages, Peter Norman writes. The shadow chancellor said that the sole
form of credit management considered by Labour was strengthening of the
reserve asset ratios of credit institutions, but that would be unlikely at
present because of the depressed state of the economy.
Mr Smith, campaigning in the West Midlands, accused the Conservatives of
trying to create a 'scare' on the mortgages issue. He said high interest
rates - of the sort prevalent in the late 1980s - were also a means of
credit control that 'slaughtered industry'.
Mr Smith said that Labour had four economic objectives: steady economic
growth, low inflation, high employment and equilibrium in the balance of
payments.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Cut in jobs at Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, announced 95 white-collar
redundancies yesterday.
The job cuts, affecting management, technical and clerical staff, arise from
a gap in the order book at the company, which won its last shipbuilding
contract - for three Type 23 frigates for the Ministry of Defence - in
December 1989.
Swan Hunter, privatised in a management buyout six years ago, has fought to
cut its dependence on UK warship orders. It has hopes for its first overseas
ship order since privatisation, a Pounds 200m deal from Singapore for 12
vessels.

LAWYERS for General Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose drug-trafficking
conspiracy trial in Miami is nearing its end, have subpoenaed Mr F. Lee
Bailey, the noted US criminal attorney, to testify today about possibly
inconsistent statements by a star prosecution witness.
The unusual last-minute subpoena was issued after Mr Bailey notified defence
lawyers that he had previously written to the former Panamanian leader's
prosecutors about testimony by Mr Gabriel Taboada.
Mr Bailey said the testimony by Mr Taboada, which placed Gen Noriega at a
1983 meeting with the Medelln cartel, was inconsistent with information
which Mr Taboada had given him.
Mr Bailey at one time represented Gen Noriega. Later, he was retained by Mr
Taboada. In his letter to prosecutors Mr Bailey said Mr Taboada's testimony
about the meeting contradicted assurances Mr Taboada had given him that he
knew nothing which would cause a conflict for Mr Bailey in acting as lawyer
for both the general and Mr Taboada.

The Pope had said on Monday that Argentina should ensure the poor do not
become 'victims of adjustment plans, or marginalised by the dynamism of
growth, to which they have contributed considerably'. President Carlos Menem
said his statements had been blown up by the press.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister and architect of free market reforms,

CVG, whose activities include steel, aluminium smelting and products,

<TEXT>
THE contract for the Dollars 684m (Pounds 395.3m) Tanjung Priok power
station is to be signed today between Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN),
the Indonesian state electricity company, and a consortium of the
Swiss-Swedish company, Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), and Marubeni of Japan.
Construction of the 1,180MW combined cycle (gas and steam) plant is due to
begin next month, with the first of the six gas turbines operational by
mid-1993 and the project complete in the first half of 1995.
ABB and Marubeni beat off a rival consortium of Mitsui of Japan and General
Electric of the US to win the contract. Industry officials say Mitsui, in a
consortium with Mission Energy of the US, remains a leading contender to
build two 600MW units at Paiton in Java, worth about Dollars 1.2bn.
A contract worth more than Dollars 2bn for two similar units at Paiton was
awarded last year to Intercontinental Electric of the US and PT Bimantara
Bayu Nusa, an Indonesian company. Both projects are designed to be privately
financed, but bankers say international market funds are limited and only
one project is likely to proceed.
Paiton is the first attempt by Indonesia to develop a private-sector
financed and operated plant to be linked directly to the national grid. It
should mark the future direction of the industry.
Indonesian demand for electricity is projected to grow 17 per cent a year
over the next 10 years, but industry officials say PLN will only be able to
finance half the growth required.
PLN has a total installed capacity of 9,275MW, and has new plants with a
capacity of more than 7,000MW and a total value of about Dollars 6.4bn
either being built or seeking finance.
ABB said yesterday it had been awarded a letter of acceptance from India's
Ministry of Railways for delivery of 33 locomotives worth Dollars 220m,
writes Andrew Baxter.
The order will be financed by the Asian Development Bank, and comprises 11
four-axle high-speed passenger locomotives and 22 six-axle freight
locomotives.
A substantial part of the order will be supplied by ABB Germany, with
partial assembly in India, plus transfer of technology to set up local
manufacturing. Commissioning the locomotives is due to begin towards the end
of next year.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Sabena cancels Dollars 200m firm order for
five Boeings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SABENA, the Belgian national airline, has cancelled a firm order for five
Boeing 737-500 twin-engine aircraft, worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds
115.6m), because of cash problems caused by the delay in its planned
partnership with Air France.
But the Belgian airline said Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) had agreed to buy
the five Boeing 110-120 seater aircraft as part of its efforts to replace
its fleet of Soviet-built airliners with western jets.
The CSA agreement to take over the order means that the Belgian airline is
not expected to face penalty payments for cancelling a firm order.
Sabena also has ordered five other Boeing 737s, for delivery in 1994 and
1995.
The Sabena decision reflects not only the airline's own cash problems but
the continuing softness in the commercial aircraft market.
Although Boeing expects to deliver a record total of 223 of its 737
narrow-body airliners this year, the manufacturer is planning to reduce
monthly 737 production from 21 aircraft at present to 14 in October.
The Sabena move also represents the first time an airline has cancelled a
firm order with Boeing.
Sabena is still waiting for Belgian government approval for its partnership
deal with Air France.
This would see Air France and Belgian investors acquire a 37.5 per cent
stake in Sabena for BFr6bn (Pounds 101m).
Air France is also closely associated with CSA.
It became last week the first western carrier to acquire a stake in an
eastern European airline by taking, with a group of French and international
institutional investors, 40 per cent of CSA.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan, China could join Gatt on same day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA and Taiwan could both be members of Gatt a year from now, following an
informal deal between China, the US and EC over Taiwan's application to join
the 103-member world trade body.
Officials said yesterday the next meeting of Gatt's governing council, on
April 30, was likely to set up a working party to consider Taipei's
membership bid. Taiwan applied in January 1990 as a 'separate customs
territory', the formula used by Hong Kong and Macao, already Gatt members.
But China first opposed the application, then insisted Taiwan could not join
before it did.
The working party drafting China's membership terms, set up in 1987, was
reactivated in February after a long hiatus thatfollowed Beijing's 1989
clampdown on the pro-democracy movement and a slowing of economic reform.
The US, Taipei's principal sponsor, opposed a link between the two sets of
membership talks but failed to gain the support of other Gatt members. Under
the terms of the informal understanding, China will join Gatt first,
possibly only minutes ahead of Taiwan. 'The most probable scenario is that
they will join on the same day,' one trade official said.
Since Taiwan is a market economy which has already taken steps to liberalise
its trade regime, the negotiation of membership terms could be finished
within 12 months. Officials said yesterday a special protocol of accession
for China, taking account of its largely state-controlled non-market
economy, could also be completed in that time.
Despite recent moves by China to make its trading system more
Gatt-compatible, special membership provisions are seen as essential since
normal Gatt rules cannot apply to an economy where prices may bear no
relation to output costs. The accession protocol is likely to include
special safeguards to protect trading partners against surges of imports
from China.
The understanding reflects the desire of most Gatt members to have China in
the fold, which they hope will cement economic (and potential political)
liberalisation. But it could spark opposition in the US Congress, which
wants tougher action against Beijing over human rights abuses and unfair
trading practices.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Austria's EC entry carries trade risks,
Gatt report warns
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIA's prospective membership of the EC will result in more open markets
for other Community countries but risks increasing still further its
reliance on preferential trade arrangements, a Gatt report warned yesterday
The report notes that about 75 per cent of Austrian imports originate in
preferential sources, mainly members of the EC or the European Free Trade
Association (Efta), to which Austria belongs. Trade under Gatt's
non-discriminatory 'most-favoured-nation' (MFN) principle 'is therefore the
exception rather than the rule'.
Discussing the report in Gatt's governing council yesterday, trading
partners focused on Austria's plans for closer European integration, through
EC membership, participation in the EC/Efta European Economic Area and a
growing number of free trade accords with central and eastern European
countries.
The report says EC membership and introduction of the common external tariff
will result in a substantial cut in Austria's tariff barriers to third
countries, which for industrial goods are well above the
industrialised-country average.
But Japan and the US were among those countries expressing anxiety yesterday
that closer economic ties with Europe could be at the expense of Austria's
trade with others.
The council urged Austria to ensure further European integration was fully
compatible with Gatt obligations and that liberalisation measures opened
markets on an MFN basis. In reply, Mr Gerhard Waas, director-general of
Austria's federal economics ministry, said EC membership would improve
competitive conditions in Austria and should help create trade.
Gatt's review of Austrian trade policies, part of a series eventually
covering all Gatt's 103 members, notes the contrast between its relatively
liberal trade regime for industrial goods and its restrictive farm trade
policies. Domestic farm prices are more than twice world levels for some
products, the report says.
Other criticisms related to Austria's import licensing and surveillance
schemes; the wide-ranging but informal powers of the 'social partnership'
(government, employers and trade unions) in trade-related matters; and price
controls and the high degree of cartelisation of the Austrian market. This
reduced competition and benefits of open trade.
The council said market-oriented policy reforms by Austria in recent years
had laid the ground for strong economic performance in growth and employment
but expressed concern over high levels of protection and discriminatory
policies in some areas.

FT  25 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan study into McDonnell Douglas stake
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE results of a study by China Steel, a state-owned Taiwanese company, of
the proposed acquisition by Taiwan Aerospace of a large stake in the
commercial aircraft operations of McDonnell Douglas of the US are expected
to be known by the middle of April, Mr Yang Shijian, Taiwan's economics
vice-minister, said yesterday.
China Steel, which could acquire a big interest in Taiwan Aerospace, is
leading a Taiwanese team examining the potential investment.
The two-week postponement of the study's conclusion - it had been expected
to be completed by the end of March - is a further blow to the deal, dogged
by delays and criticism on both sides of the Pacific.
Mr Denny Ko, Taiwan Aerospace president, said the delay was caused by
uncertainty over plans for McDonnell Douglas's new wide-bodied jet, the
MD-12, and that further assessment was necessary.
Under an initial agreement reached last November, Taiwan Aerospace, a
recently formed company, would buy a maximum of 40 per cent of McDonnell
Douglas's commercial aircraft business for Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Taiwan Aerospace has since indicated the stake acquired could be as low as
25 per cent.
McDonnell Douglas will retain a 51 per cent stake, but the US company is
already discussing, with other investors from south-east Asia or South
Korea, making up the shortfall in Taiwan's investment.
Faced with criticism in the Taiwanese media and Yuan (parliament), the
government in Taipei has denied it will be funding the deal.
It holds a 29 per cent stake in Taiwan Aerospace which, with a capital of
Dollars 200m, is not in a position at present to finance the deal alone.
The government says the money will come from the private sector, and from
some of the larger concerns which already hold a stake in Taiwan Aerospace.
These include Evergreen Marine, Tatung, Yueloong Motor, and Formosa
Plastics.
Critics in Taiwan fear that Taiwanese taxpayers' money will be wasted.
Opposition DPP legislators have attacked the proposals, playing recordings
of speeches made by Taiwan Aerospace chairman Mr David Huang in the US.
He is said to have asserted in the speeches that the government in Taipei
would continue to invest in McDonnell Douglas until it was successful.
Analysts said that, without government backing, the companies which have
invested in Taiwan Aerospace would be reluctant to increase their stake in
the venture, either individually or as part of the consortium.
If direct investment is not politically possible for the government, other
carrots might take the form of tax incentives, guarantees and investment
through the cabinet's development fund or state-owned banks.
Another question hanging over the deal is whether Taiwan will gain any
transfer of aerospace technology if the deal goes ahead.
The issue is sensitive in the US, where McDonnell Douglas has testified to
Congress that the company would make no such commitment.
But Mr Ko says the question arises from what is meant by 'technology'. 'What
we want is quality-control methodology, know-how which is automatic in the
US aerospace industry,' Mr Ko said. 'I think of that as technology.'
Mr Robert Hood, president of the Douglas commercial aircraft subsidiary,
said recently it was important for the company to secure a launch decision
for the 400 to 600-seater MD-12 programme this year so as to ensure first
deliveries in 1997.
The longer-term future of Douglas largely depends on securing financial
backing from investors to expand its product range.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Saudis to pay 37% less for petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA, already one of the world's cheapest places to fill up a car,
has slashed domestic petrol prices by 37 per cent to 8.6 cents a litre.
The price cut is one of several on services and utilities made in a surprise
announcement by King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, to 'ease the burden of the cost
of living on the citizens'.
The move appears in part designed to soften the effects of inflation in the
kingdom since the Gulf war, which has risen substantially in the past year
in tandem with the general buoyancy of the economy.
However, the decision can also be seen as a concession to Islamic hardliners
in the kingdom, who have been increasingly critical of the ruling family
since the war and who believe that payment for essential services is an
unacceptable form of tax given the kingdom's vast oil wealth.
The price cuts certainly run counter to the government's general need to
reduce expenditure, given that it is already slated to run an Dollars 8bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) budget deficit for 1992 - its 10th successive budget
shortfall. 'From the purely financial standpoint, it makes little sense,'
said one Riyadh banker yesterday.
Mr Ali Hassan al-Shaer, the information minister, was quoted by SPA, the
Saudi press agency, as saying that the king had decreed price cuts including
a reduction of 30 per cent in domestic gas prices and a 28.5 per cent fall
in electricity prices. Water prices would also be halved.
Registration fees for businessmen and traders will be cut by up to 87 per
cent and cuts will also be made on port tariffs and exit visas.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Lockerbie puts Arabs in quandary: Libya's allies bristling
at western 'bullying'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX RODENBECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR after Arab and western armies joined forces to expel Iraq from
Kuwait, the test of wills between western governments and the regime of
Colonel Muammer Gadaffi over Libya's harbouring of the suspected Lockerbie
bombers has forced Arabs to ponder their place in the new world order.
Since the confrontation began last November, Libya's Arab allies have
bristled at what is seen as bullying by Britain and the US. In private, they
have advised Libya to be more accommodating.
Like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the affair has put pro-western Arabs in a
quandary. Street opinion throughout the Arab world has strongly backed
Libyan protestations of innocence. Libya's offer to try the suspects
domestically was seen as a reasonable offer, and its refusal to extradite
them was widely accepted as understandable in the light of Libyan mistrust
of its accusers.
By contrast, the west's uncompromising demand has been viewed here as an
assault on Arab dignity. US hints of resorting to force and the use of the
UN Security Council to escalate international pressure have created
uncomfortable parallels with the beating suffered by Iraq. As a result many
Arabs are again accusing the west of applying double standards.
Moderate Arab governments, whatever their distaste for the Gadaffi regime,
have been obliged to respond to public pressure. At the same time they have
been annoyed by the stridency of western demands, which have in their view
exacerbated the problem. Arab analysts note that before the confrontation
Libya had shown signs of a desire to improve ties with the west. Moderate
countries such as Egypt assured their western friends that the Gadaffi
leopard was trying to change his spots.
By coupling attempts to try the terrorist suspects with veiled threats of
force, the west missed a chance to work out a quiet deal that would have
preserved the revolutionary Libyan regime's legitimacy, Arab observers say.
As they see it , backing the Libyan leader into a corner could provoke him
to extremism or - worse for his poorer neighbours - into cutting trade and
expelling their surplus labour.
As time has passed Libyan friends, and in particular, Egypt, have grown
uncomfortable with Tripoli's dithering. They have come to feel that Libya
cannot expect to put its past behind it without paying some price.
To Libya's chagrin, the Arab League's 21 members turned down a draft
resolution calling on them to defy sanctions against Libya which the UN
Security Council has threatened to impose. Instead, they urged the UN to
delay punitive measures until the world court rules whether international
law requires Libya to hand over the wanted men.
In effect, the resolution declared sympathy with Libya, but within the
framework of respect for international law. With its earlier face-saving
proposals rejected Libya appears to have felt obliged to hold on to the
skimpy cover offered by its erstwhile brothers by volunteering to place the
Lockerbie suspects in Arab League custody.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Amnesty accuses Indian police of 'routine' torture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE torture of suspects by police has become routine in India, according to
Amnesty International, which today publishes a report on human rights abuses
in India.
Amnesty lists 415 deaths as a result of police brutality between 1985 and
November 1990, but says the true number is likely to be higher.
In its report - India: Torture, Rape and Deaths in Custody - Amnesty says
that in only three cases listed were police convicted of the use of torture,
and in only 42 cases were judicial inquiries ordered.
'A major cause of the persistence of widespread torture in India', the
report says, 'is the failure or unwillingness of leading government
officials and representatives to acknowledge that torture even exists, let
alone that it needs to be vigorously tackled.'
In an effort to arouse public opinion and press the government into action,
Amnesty is distributing 5,000 copies of the report to prominent Indians, and
calling on Indians to write to the prime minister and the home minister.
Amnesty's campaign comes at a embarrassing time for the government, because
of the country's dependence on bilateral and multilateral aid, and because
donor nations are increasingly linking aid to respect for human rights.
The government yesterday accused Amnesty of having launched an anti-India
campaign.
The report says the use of torture has been most systematic in Kashmir, the
Punjab and Assam, where the government faces armed opposition. Otherwise, it
says the main victims of police brutality are the poor or minority groups -
untouchables, tribal people, and Moslems.

A JAPANESE former senior civil servant was yesterday given a suspended jail
sentence and fined for his part in the Recruit bribery scandal which rocked
Japan three years ago, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo.
Mr Takeshi Kato, once a vice-minister in the labour ministry, was found
guilty of having accepted bribes from Recruit, an employment information

and fined Y6.81m (Pounds 29,700) at the Tokyo District Court.
Mr Kato is the fourth person to be convicted on charges arising from the
Recruit affair, in which the company offered cut-price stock to influential
people in return for their favour. They include Mr Hisashi Shinto,
ex-chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the telecommunications
utility. Eight others are still on trial, among them Mr Takao Fujinami, a
former chief cabinet secretary.
Mr Taketaka Nakagawa, the presiding judge, told Mr Kato the case was grave
because he had damaged people's trust in the labour ministry and in the
fairness of government officials.

FT  25 MAR 92 / French trade surplus declines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE's monthly trade surplus narrowed sharply in February, underlining the
extent to which any economic recovery there is dependent on the pattern of
demand in export markets.
Last month's surplus was FFr407m (Pounds 42m), down from FFr3.53bn in
January, said the customs directorate yesterday. Yet this still marks a big
improvement year-on-year, bringing the surplus for the first two months of
1992 to FFr3.9bn, as against a FFr8.7bn deficit in the same period of 1991.
Moreover, France has maintained a FFr7.6bn surplus with the rest of the
European Community for the first two months of the year. This was a good
result, which confirmed the increase in France's competitiveness thanks to
its control of inflation and the costs of production, said the Finance
Ministry.
The main reason for the narrowing of the month-on-month surplus was a sudden
halt in the growth of overseas sales. Exports were roughly stable at
FFr103.8bn last month, while imports to France climbed by 3.2 per cent, from
FFr100.2bn in January to FFr103.4bn in February. The change was most marked
in industrial goods, where France swung into a FFr1.6bn deficit last month,
from a FFr1.4bn surplus in January.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Berlin attacks Treuhand over sale of factory

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand agency came under fire yesterday from the Berlin city
government and union leaders for selling east Germany's largest light bulb
factory in east Berlin to a west German property developer.
Mr Norbert Meisner, the head of Berlin's economics department, criticised
the Treuhand for seeking to 'maximise' short-term profits from yesterday's
announced sale of the Narva factory to the Erhard Hartl property company in
Bavaria.
Although the price was not disclosed, the Treuhand said it would make a net
cash gain of DM2.8m (Pounds 970m) from the sale. The Social Democratic
partner of the Christian Democratic-led coalition government expressed its
'outrage' over the sale. The privatisation agency was also taken to task by
the influential German Federation of Industry (BDI). It said that instead of
giving liquidity loans and guarantees to former state companies and assuming
their losses - all totalling nearly DM40bn this year - the Treuhand should
grant clearly-defined start-up aid for a limited time. Although the Treuhand
is to be allowed to borrow up to DM38bn annually under a draft law presented
to the Bundestag, critics charge that it diverts too much money to cover
running expenses of companies and too little to restructuring them.
The Treuhand said Hartl intends to close down the Narva plant (formerly
Osram), which lost DM62m last year, and will bring medium-sized producers
from southern Germany to a substitute east Berlin property. It will get the
site from the Treuhand which faces possible claims by the city on the
original Narva property. Hartl pledged to invest up to DM40m and to employ
the remaining 1,080 Narva workers in non-industrial jobs for three years.
The Treuhand agreed to assume nearly DM23m in Narva debts.
A Treuhand plan last August to sell Narva to a west Berlin property
developer was cancelled under pressure from city officials who said it
amounted to a 'gift' of prime urban real estate.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Amsterdam votes on the future of the car: A long battle for
control of the streets culminates in a referendum today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTERDAM'S girdle of graceful 17th-century canals is proof that the Dutch
capital was built to accommodate boats, not cars. More than 300 years later,
however, the quiet canals are used for little more than sedate tourist
cruises, while the roads on either side of the waterways have become the
scene of increasingly fierce battles between cars, bicycles, trams and
buses.
Years of simmering resentment among car drivers, cyclists and pedestrians
will come to a head today when Amsterdam holds a referendum on the future of
the car in the city centre.
Amsterdam residents will be given two choices: they can either support the
city's existing traffic policy, aimed at a gradual reduction in car traffic,
or vote in favour of a drastic curtailment of automobiles in the inner city.
This more radical option would involve halving the number of parking spaces
to 11,000 and restricting access to the canal zone itself.
The referendum - the first in Amsterdam's history - pits a coalition of
environmental groups and cyclists' clubs against business organisations,
shopkeepers and local unions, which argue that as many as 20,000 of the city
centre's 80,000 jobs will be lost if the car is virtually banned. The
anti-car lobby dismisses this figure as scaremongering.
It says some jobs would go but others would be created, as central Amsterdam
becomes a more pleasant place to live, work and shop.
'Businesses which depend on cars do not belong in the city centre but on the
outskirts,' said a spokesman for the Car-Free City-Centre movement.
Exceptions would be made for delivery vans and cars driven by disabled
people, among others.
Residents of the zone who own cars would be allowed to drive in and out.
However, they would have to compete for ever-fewer parking spaces.
The Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce believes the referendum - non-binding but
sure to influence the city's policies - has already affected the business
climate.
'Companies are hesitant to make new investments in the city until they know
what the referendum will mean for them,' a spokesman said.
'It has created an uncertain climate for decisions on business location,' he
added.
The referendum campaign by the pro-car and anti-car lobbies has been bitter,
reflecting the animosity on the city streets between cyclists and car
drivers, who rival each other in their disregard for traffic lights, speed
limits, zebra crossings and pedestrians.
Proponents of a virtually car-free zone have filed a complaint with the
Advertising Code Commission, accusing the Amsterdam business community of
putting out misleading information in their promotional material.
They are particularly incensed about a cartoon showing road signs saying
'Goodbye cars, goodbye business, goodbye restaurants, goodbye jobs'.
Adding fuel to the controversy is the choice being offered in the ballot
itself. Critics say voters are unable to make an informed decision because
they have not been told exactly how cars would be kept out of the city
centre under the radical 'Choice B' option.
Physical barriers and the issuing of magnetic passes to drivers exempt from
the ban have been mentioned as possibilities, but no firm decision has been
taken; nor have specific plans been drawn up to build the parking garages
which would be needed on the edges of the city centre.
The fact that the referendum is taking place at all is a sign of Amsterdam
city council's fear that people have lost faith in conventional politics and
need to be mobilised through direct ballots on single issues.
In the last local elections, in 1990, voter turn-out was just 50 per cent,
the lowest on record.
Further referendums may be in the offing.
One popular subject might be another perennial Amsterdam hazard - dogs and
their excrement.
Of the nearly 900 referendum ideas forwarded to the city council in 1990,
more than 40 per cent were related in one way or another to the pervasive
dog nuisance.

FT  25 MAR 92 / German money supply worries
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of an early reduction in Germany's official interest rates
receded further yesterday with news that money supply growth continued to
exceed the Bundesbank's target range by a wide margin in February.
The central bank said M3, the broad monetary aggregate, expanded at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 per cent last month compared with the
average in the fourth quarter of 1991. This was a slight decline on the 9
per cent rate in January, but economists said M3 expansion was still too
high to allow any scope for relaxing monetary controls. The target range is
growth of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent this year.
The Bundesbank lifted interest rates by half a point in December to leave
the discount rate at 8 per cent and the Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is understood to have backed the Bundesbank's tough
monetary line when he attended its council meeting last Thursday.
The Bundesbank said the main force propelling M3 was the volume of bank
lending to companies and individuals, though this had weakened slightly;
long-term lending remained strong, while short-term lending eased. In the
past six months, it has risen at an annual seasonally adjusted rate of 11.5
per cent.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Lenin's revenge on the ad men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE there were the privileged nomenklatura, the well-off speculanti, the
herdlike narod (people) and the hopeless and hapless bedalagi (poor). But
then Boris Yeltsin arrived and the Russian class structure went topsy-turvy,
utterly ruining the crafty but rather stereotyped marketing plans dreamed up
by westerners hoping to make a fast buck.
Russian consumers no longer fit the patterns of yesteryear, according to
'The Russian Consumer', a report published yesterday by the international
division of the advertising agency DMB&amp;B, which has an outpost in Moscow.
Purveyors of western goods should accustom themselves to new categories.
They include:
The kuptsi, or merchant-minded class, who mix self-reliance, hard work and
decisiveness with self-centredness, greed, smugness, narrow-mindedness and
intolerance. Their preference is to 'buy Russian rather than foreign goods'
and they are biased against marketing on foreign appeal only.
The Cossacks, who are as 'fiercely Russian' as the kuptsi but 'hanker after
bright western imagery', and given their interest in 'brands which are
difficult to obtain, unusual, expensive or of high status' hanker after
goods which enable them to show off.
The students, who are guided in their purchases by an idealism which wants
'society to be healthy, rich and open for all'. The bad news is that they
possess 'a relatively high aversion to hard work . . . they are in search of
western symbols of prestige - but on the cheap'.
The businessmen, who are less work-shy; indeed they are preoccupied with
making money.
They look for products which are easily found ('no time for shopping
around') and which have 'strong functionality' - the Mercedes is bought
because it is thought to be reliable as well as socially prestigious.
Finally, the Russian souls, 'a rather sad group, consisting of people with
low material status who are likely to remain so . . . they are happy to join
a queue without knowing the object'. Thus, says the report, 'classic
marketing techniques are very difficult to apply to Russian souls. The very
idea of choice frightens him or her'.
Although many of the categorisations sound rather tongue-in-cheek, DMB&amp;B's
study is the result of 18 months research in urban and rural Russia, based
on 'hundreds of hours of discussions' with bankers, consumers, local and
international advertisers and businessmen.
While insisting that western businesses need to shake up their ideas on
Russian consumers, the report admits that any hope of mass marketing is
still a pipedream. 'Markets and consumers do not as yet exist in any real
sense in Russia.'
The Russian Consumer: a new perspective and a marketing approach. Available
from DMB&amp;B Ltd, 2 St James's Square, London SW1Y 4JN. Price Pounds 48.50.

FT  25 MAR 92 / Bulgaria unveils austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   SOFIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA unveiled a tough austerity budget yesterday, saying it was tailored
to please the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), Reuter
reports from Sofia.
The draft budget, which provoked heated debates in parliament, proposes a
deficit of 9.2bn leva (Pounds 226.5m) or 4.3 per cent of gross domestic
product (GDP).
Last year's budget deficit turned out to be 8.5bn leva, or about 3.9 per
cent of GDP. It was originally set at 7.5bn leva.
'The budget has been drawn up in line with the the IMF and World Bank and
fulfils their recommendations,' the finance minister, Mr Ivan Kostov told
parliament.
Bulgaria, whose economy contracted by around 20 to 25 per cent last year,
and which is saddled with an Dollars 11.5bn foreign debt, needs the approval
of the IMF to attract foreign investment and reach agreements with its bank
creditors.
The 1992 budget provides for 53.6bn leva of expenditure and 44.4bn leva of
revenue. Last year's budget originally set revenue of 63bn leva and
expenditure of 70.5bn.
The new budget, the first by a non - communist government for four decades,
slashes capital and social security spending.
'The budget is reasonable and consistent with the objectives of the
government, which set priority on privatisation and development of the
private sector,' said Mr Emmanuel Dzervoudakis, the IMF representative in
Bulgaria.
The former communist Bulgarian Socialist party protested at the austerity
measures.
The government faced its first crisis on yesterday when miners and oil
workers demanding better working conditions threatened to strike against new
economic policies.
The Podkrepa trade union warned of strike action after talks with the
government broke down over plans to close down or cut production at uranium,
zinc, lead and iron ore mines.
'We are protesting against the lack of a government concept for the
country's mining industries and failure to fulfil promises given to us last
year on better working and pay conditions,' a union official, Mr Dimitar
Dimov, said.
Coal miners and workers at Bulgaria's largest oil refinery in Burgas on the
Blask Sea also threatened to strike.
The industry minister, Mr Ivan Pushkarov, said metal production could
survive only with radical restructuring of the industry and drastic manpower
cuts. He said the state had spent more than 900m leva recently to cover
losses by the mining industry.
In recent years Bulgaria produced an average 105m tonnes of lead annually,
but output more than halved to 50m tonnes last year.

fourfold

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK IG, one of Poland's larger private banks, has reported a fourfold
increase on its original 57.1bn zloyts capital and reserve funds following
the sale of new shares plus a bonus issue.
Bank IG has also retained Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, the international
accountancy firm, as advisers on the possible sale of 25 per cent of the
bank to a foreign bank.
The capital increase brings Bank IG's capital adequacy ratio to 7 per cent,
according to Mr Boguslaw Kott, the bank chairman. This is in line with
changes in banking laws to be implemented soon which require Polish domestic
banks to achieve a 6 per cent ratio by the end of this year.
Of the capital and reserves increase, 42.5bn zloyts comes from a scrip issue
after shareholders agreed last December to take new shares in place of an
interim dividend for the first nine months.
A further 131.4bn zloyts came from shares placed mainly with existing
investors such as Warta and PZU, the state-owned insurance companies.
PZM, a large Polish shipping company based in Szczecin which has taken a 9.6
per cent share in Bank IG, is also a new shareholder.
Bank IG reported a 23.3bn zloyts (Dollars 1.7m) net profit in 1990 while the
first nine months of last year saw net profits reach 61.2bn zloyts.
The bank has also applied to Poland's Securities Commission for permission
to be listed on Warsaw's fledgling stock exchange. If successful, Bank IG
would be the first bank to appear alongside the 11 companies whose shares
are traded twice a week on the exchange.
Aachener und Munchener (AMB), the German financial holding company, said it
has agreed with French bank Credit Lyonnais to begin talks on Credit
Lyonnais taking a stake in AMB's banking unit, BfG Bank, Reuter reports.

GEORGE Fisher, the Swiss foundries and machinery group, suffered a 47 per

and the directors are recommending a 20 per cent cut in the dividends,
writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Consolidated sales were unchanged at SFr2.5bn, but the worldwide economic
downturn put pressure on margins, the company said. The manufacturing
technology division, which produces specialised machine tools, had an
'altogether unsatisfactory result'.
An improved result is expected in 1992 even if economic conditions remain
unchanged.
To simplify the capital structure, the directors are also proposing to
convert the participation certificates into bearer shares on the basis of
one share for every five PCs.

   BAKU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AZERBAIJAN, rocked by setbacks in its fight with Armenia, moved yesterday
towards putting itself on a war footing to retake the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Baku.
Azerbaijan's new leadership, backed by the nationalist opposition, told an
emergency session of parliament that only militarising the entire society
could reverse the republic's declining fortunes inside Nagorno-Karabakh.
It demanded special powers to subordinate industrial production and fiscal
policy in the former Soviet republic of 7m people to the creation of a
20,000-man army capable of re-establishing control over the predominantly
Armenian-populated enclave.
'All plants and enterprises must go on to a military regime,' the acting
president, Mr Yagub Mamedov, told legislators. 'We must be strict and demand
discipline in the republic. This is the only way to repel the aggressors.'
The ministers of defence and interior affairs echoed that call. Others
sounded the alarm for a witchhunt, demanding the names of officials
responsible for recent setbacks in the field.
'No state in which there is no discipline can win a war. All the mechanisms
of state must work for victory,' said Mr Tair Aliyev, the interior minister,
a former deputy police chief in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Parliament was later to consider a proposal by the opposition Popular Front
to abolish the presidency and create a coalition government with the former
communists. Under the plan, security policy would be completely in the
Front's hands.
Mr Mamedov said talk of military preparations did not mean Azerbaijan was
insisting on a military solution. Iran, Turkey, the United Nations and other
international bodies are pursuing a political settlement.
But the message from the provisional government was clear. Any talks had to
be held from a position of strength. 'We must all concentrate on the
creation of a national army. Now, this is question number one,' Mr Mamedov
said.
His predecessor was forced out largely for failing to create an adequate
armed force capable of protecting the Azeri minority in Nagorno-Karabakh.
That policy exploded last month with the capture by Armenian irregulars of
the strategic Azeri-populated town of Khojaly. Baku says more than 1,000
Azeri civilians were slaughtered, a charge Armenia dismisses as wildly
exaggerated.
Whatever the number, it is clear that Mamedov and his allies are determined
not to make the same mistake.

SIKORSKY, the US helicopter maker, part of the United Technologies group, is
studying with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan the development of a
19-seat civil helicopter, Paul Betts writes. The S-92 helicopter would be
the first civil helicopter programme launched by Sikorsky since 1978 and
would replace the S-61 the company produced between 1962-1981.
Mr Mike Baxter, Sikorsky's vice-president of international and commercial
business, said Mitsubishi had not yet committed itself to a joint venture.
But Mitsubishi, a Sikorsky licensee during the past 30 years, has agreed to
study the potential market.
Sikorsky said other potential partners in Asia and Europe were interested.
The US group is expected to decide whether to launch the programme by the
end of this year.
The US-led helicopter programme would compete against plans by Eurocopter,
the new European helicopter group which has absorbed the helicopter
activities of Aerospatiale of France and Germany's
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, to develop a new version of Aerospatiale's Super
Puma helicopter, the Mark 2. Sikorsky is expected to target the offshore oil
industry for its new helicopter.

FT  24 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Kohl sees clear signs of movement in farm
talks

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany returned yesterday from his talks with
President Bush in Washington, insisting he detected clear signs of movement
in Gatt's farm trade liberalisation talks.
At the same time, he flatly rejected calls for Germany to put pressure on
France to compromise in the fight over how far to cut the subsidies and
quantities of EC farm exports. 'We have made progress, but we have still not
made the grade (necessary to reach a final agreement),' he declared.
Mr Kohl rejected suggestions that President Bush would be happy to allow the
talks to drag on until after the US elections, or that President Francois
Mitterrand of France would prefer a failed Gatt round to a successful
compromise.
'President Bush wants the Gatt round to be brought to a successful
conclusion by the end of April, just as President Mitterrand and I and the
other partners in the EC do. We must have a compromise, and that means all
the participants will have to make concessions.'
As far as France was concerned in resisting more EC concessions, 'I am not
ready to put pressure on one member of our Community. It is a common affair
and we should not single out one country. Anybody who knows French politics
should know that would be a fatal thing to do.'
Mr Kohl suggested that the three key areas for compromise concerned cuts in
EC exports (in quantity and level of subsidy), control over US cereal
substitute exports to the EC (Germany wants a total freeze), and securing
European farm income subsidies as part of the continuing reform programme.
A German official involved in the talks said two conclusions emerged from
the talks with Mr Bush: both sides were absolutely determined to reach an
end in April; and compromise could only be found in flexibility on both
sides. 'This movement is certainly to be seen.' But he declined to say just
where.
Mr Kohl expressed his determination that the Gatt talks should not dragged
on until the Group of Seven's economic summit in Munich in July. 'If we do
not have an agreement by then, we will not be able to solve it in Munich
either.'

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOOD of political uncertainty continued to hang over the futures market,
sidelining many investors and depressing trading, but the March contract, at
a discount to the cash market for most of yesterday, staged a late rally,
writes Christopher Price.
March opened slightly down at 2,440 before a small rally took it to 2,452,
with independent traders featuring prominently. However, it then began a
decline which found little support, although a few buyers were evident at
the 2,430 level by midday.
The early afternoon saw a further fall and March was dragged down to 2,418
by 2pm. Some support was found at this level, chiefly from Goldman Sachs,
which had been the biggest seller on Friday.
March rallied to 2,432 and further buying took it to 2,444 by the close, the
same level as the previous finish, and at a three-point premium to the cash
market. There were 8,089 contracts traded.
The traded options market had its first day's trading of the newly merged
LTOM and Liffe. One trader reported that changes to margin rules had caught
some people unawares and that other technical teething problems had had some
effect on trading. Turnover was a low 14,447.

Wall Street
US SHARES eased slightly yesterday as investors and dealers stayed on the
sidelines in the absence of fresh economic news and a lead from the bond
markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 4.25 off at 3,272.14, having spent
the entire session trading in a narrow range a few points below last
Friday's closing mark.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.39 to 409.91 and the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks receded 2.45 to 621.83. NYSE turnover was extremely
light at 157m shares, and falls led rises by 984 to 692.
The direction of investor sentiment remained uncertain yesterday, although
the recent ability of the Dow to hold its own under pressure at the 3,200
level has led some analysts to predict there is enough support for stocks to
push the leading index to new highs in coming sessions.
Du Pont gained Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46 7/8 in active trading after
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrett, the brokerage house, raised its valuation of
the stock from 'moderately attractive' to 'very attractive'.
Mr William Young, the DLJ chemicals analyst, upgraded Du Pont because he
thinks the benefits of recent cost cutting and improved fibre, chemical and
automotive markets have brightened the earnings outlook for the group, which
he says may increase its annual dividend later in the year.
Harley-Davidson climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 62 7/8 after Morgan Stanley
added the maker of luxury motorcycles to its model portfolio.
Phillips Petroleum ended Dollars  1/4 down at Dollars 23 5/8 on reports that
its chairman had warned that first-quarter earnings would be 'lousy' and
that there was little chance of an improvement in net income until the third
quarter of this year.
Coleman firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 after Shearson Lehman Brothers
had initiated research coverage of the stock with a prediction of
outperformance. The company went public in January for Dollars 19.50 a
share.
Intel retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 63 1/4 on 2.2m shares as the stock
came under pressure in the wake of a profile in Barron's magazine which
highlighted the increasing competition that the company faces.
Canada
TORONTO weakened after reports of debt worries for privately held Olympia &amp;
York Developments put pressure on the financial services and the real estate
and construction sectors.
The composite index lost 26.3 to 3,443.7 and falls led rises by 118 to 64,
while volume on the exchange totalled 27.1m shares. The financial services
sub-group dropped 2.5 per cent on worries over banks' exposure to O &amp; Y debt
or other commercial real estate borrowers.
The real estate and construction index declined 83.2 to 6,149.0, with
Bramalea and Trizec 'A', both O &amp; Y interests, pressuring the sector most.
Bramalea fell 15 cents to CDollars 3.75 and Trizec 'A' CDollars 3/8 to
CDollars 7 1/8 .
Bank of Montreal slipped CDollars 1 to CDollars 42 1/4 , Bank of Nova Scotia
CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 20 1/8 , Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
CDollars 1 to CDollars 29 3/4 and Royal Bank of Canada CDollars  1/2 to
CDollars 24 3/4 . These four banks are said to have the largest exposure to
O &amp; Y's debt in Canada.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drifts lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR drifted a pfennig lower to DM1.6650/60 yesterday on
disappointment from the market that it could not make more of recent figures
showing US economic improvement, and the currency was unable to sustain a
break above DM1.68.
In Tokyo it ended higher in listless Asian trade at Y134.20. Dealings were
pared to a minimum due to lack of fresh incentives, dealers said.
Customers were virtually absent and dealers said the dollar is likely to
enter a consolidation phase, particularly against the yen, until a clearer
direction emerges.
Market participants said long-term sentiment remains bullish, but some
market bulls are turning cautious as the US currency appears to be unable to
breach key technical resistance at DM1.68 and Y135.
The pound stood up well in the wake of worse than expected UK February trade
figures and a bad showing for the Conservatives in the weekend opinion
polls.
Dealers remained bewildered by the British currency's firmness, saying the
only reasons they could give were the shake-out in the dollar and concern
from Federal Reserve officials that hopes of a US recovery could fade.
Dealers at Barclays Bank suggested the firmness of sterling was helped by
comment from a Bundesbank council member on money supply which helped the
D-Mark and knocked the dollar slightly.
'It has been a bit confused today,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser
with Chemical Bank. 'It was a fairly quiet day with no data of any note.'
German M3 money supply grew by 8.6 per cent in February, after January's 9
per cent increase, on the back of strong demand for credit, the president of
the regional central bank in the state of Lower Saxony said.
Mr Helmut Hesse, who also sits in the Bundesbank central policy-making
council, told reporters that this M3 growth trend would not permit any
reductions in official German interest rates.
Bundesbank deputy president Mr Hans Tietmeyer also drew attention to M3
money supply, saving he did not see the strong decline in growth needed to
change monetary policy.
The growth contrasted with expectations in the market of around 8 per cent,
and the Bundesbank's 1992 growth target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
The pound was on its floor within the ERM, but against the D-Mark it moved
between a  1/2 and  3/4 of a pfennig better to DM2.8655 from DM2.8591. It
ended more than a cent higher at Dollars 1.7170 against the dollar, and in
New York it finished at Dollars 1.7190.
Against the Swiss franc, the US currency weakened to SFr1.5185, from
SFr1.5250, and for the French franc, it dipped to FFr5.6625 from FFr5.7025.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rates rise further
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN over the Conservative Party's lag in the opinion polls and the
absence of an anticipated reduction in the February trade deficit helped
push rates up further in a worried market yesterday.
Interbank rates continued to firm, with the key three-month rate up 1/8 from
Friday's close to 10 7/8 -10 13/16 per cent. The six-month rate rose to
11-10 15/16 . The one-year rose as high as 11 3/32 -11 1/32 at one point but
closed back at 11 1/8 -11 per cent.
The June sterling contract opened down two basis points at 88.94 and jumped
to a peak of 89 before dropping slightly to close at 88.97.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.4bn in the morning,
principally driven by a fall in treasury bills and maturing assistance, and
in bills for repurchase by the market.
It acted early, purchasing outright Pounds 75m in band 2 at 10 3/8 per cent,
Pounds 11m at 10 7/32 in band 3 and Pounds 3m at 10  3/16 in band 4, as well
as Pounds 1bn for resale to the market on April 3 and 6 at 10 7/16 per cent.
It revised the shortage to Pounds 1.3bn at midday and bought Pounds 206m.
That included Pounds 75m at 10 3/8 in band 1, Pounds 21m at 10 7/32 in band
3 and treasury bills of Pounds 22m at 10 3/16 and another Pounds 88m in
bills in band 4.
The afternoon forecast rose again to Pounds 1.45bn, and it purchased bills
totalling Pounds 155m in band 1 at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank provided late
assistance of around Pounds 50m.
'The Bank of England was quite keen to be quite helpful,' said one dealer.
Overnight rates fell from 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent to 8 1/2 -8 per cent at
lunchtime following the operations from the Bank of England, but rose to 10
3/8 -10 1/4 by the close.
German call rates remained unchanged from Friday at 9.65/70 per cent, near
to the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. This was in spite of an injection of
short-term funds into the money markets by the Bundesbank during the morning
estimated by one dealer at DM5-6bn.
Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist with Barclays Bank, stressed the
importance of a statement from the South African reserve bank that it would
be prepared to intervene for the first time since 1985.
'This marks a sea change in policy which will inject a degree of stability,'
he said. 'It should encourage foreign investment in what is a very thin
market which can be hugely volatile.'

FT  24 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Political concerns help weaken French
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government bond futures lost nearly half a percentage point as the
combination of the Socialist Party's poor showing in Sunday's regional
elections and the fall in the German bond market pushed prices down.
French government bonds have weakened over the past fortnight on political
worries, but dealers said the regional election results were not as bad as
investors had feared, with the right-wing National Front not doing as well
as some had feared.
'There was no panic, no heavy selling, but the atmosphere was not very good
and the mood is bearish,' said one trader. The Matif futures contract fell
from 107.46 at the opening to close at 107.04 although it firmed slightly in
after-hours trading.
GERMAN government bond prices dropped on the release of higher-than-expected
money supply figures, concern about the current wage negotiations, and the
weakness in the US Treasury bond market.
The Liffe bund futures contract fell from its opening of 88.44 to end at
around 88.14, compared with Friday's close of 88.50.
German M3 money growth hit 8.6 per cent in February, compared with 9 per
cent in January, according to Mr Helmut Hesse, head of the regional central
bank in the state of Lower Saxony.
Official confirmation of the M3 data is due later this week, but Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, said that German M3 money growth
remained too high and therefore monetary policy would not change in the
short term.
Dealers said they had expected M3 money to grow by around 7.5 per cent in
February. 'M3 growth is showing no conclusive sign of decelerating' said one
trader.
The breakdown of the wage negotiations at the end of last week further
depressed the market. High wage settlements are likely to mean the
Bundesbank will continue with its tight monetary policy, dealers said.
US TREASURIES recovered from early weakness yesterday, but amid quiet
trading ahead of the week's auctions prices showed no signs of posting solid
gains.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 99
9/16 , yielding 8.032 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 3/16 ,
yielding 5.806 per cent.
After last Friday's big sell-off in the wake of the Philadelphia' Reserve
Bank's business outlook survey, trading opened in subdued fashion yesterday.
In the absence of important economic statistics, the market's attention
remained focused on today's auction of Dollars 14.75bn of two-year notes and
tomorrow's sale of Dollars 10.25bn of five-year notes.
In the current economic climate, with indicators showing signs of a modest
recovery, dealers are worried the injection of fresh supply could depress
prices further.
LONG-DATED UK government bonds made limited gains yesterday, shrugging off
the results of the latest batch of general election opinion polls.
Labour moved ahead of the Conservatives in four out of five polls at the
weekend.
Traders noted some switching out of short-dated gilts into the long end of
the market. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from its
opening of 112 1/32 to 112 1/4 by late afternoon, while the 10 per cent gilt
due 1994 slipped from 99 23/32 to 99 21/32 .
Volumes in the futures market were slightly below average at 19,000
contracts, and the Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 94.04 to 94.15 by
late afternoon.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day little changed as the market
continued to wait for the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates.
The market expects a cut in the official discount rate (ODR) - currently at
4.5 per cent - of between 50 and 75 basis points this week.
Traders said the interest rate on three-month certificates of deposit
slipped further as the money market continues to discount a cut in the ODR
and reached 4.86 per cent yesterday compared with 4.92 per cent on Thursday.
Activity in the cash market was lacklustre, with the yield on the benchmark
No 129 ending unchanged on the day at 5.345 per cent after profit-taking had
wiped out early gains.
Dealers said that the market was encouraged by news that money supply growth
in February reached a record low for the third consecutive month, with a
year-on-year rise of 1.6 per cent, compared with 1.8 per cent in January.

<TEXT>
DFC New Zealand, the former government-owned development bank which
collapsed owing more than NZDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.1bn) to international
banks in October 1989, believes it can repay all its creditors earlier than
expected.
It said yesterday it would repay the final NZDollars 235m to its tier-one
creditors, those with top priority for repayment, on April 15, three years
earlier than expected. This creditor group comprises several hundred mainly
overseas banks.
Mr Sandy Maier, the statutory manager, said creditors in tier two, who were
owed NZDollars 1bn, also 'have the potential to see earlier repayments.
There is nobody in front of them in the line now'. The tier-two creditors
were not scheduled to receive payments in their principal debt until 1997.
They were not expecting interest payments until 1995 at the earliest.
With tier-one debt out of the way, interest costs had been reduced, so that
money received from DFC's asset realisations could now be used to pay
interest on tier-two debt. The early repayment of tier-one debt meant that
NZDollars 1bn had been repaid in one year.
Mr Maier said DFC had sufficient assets to satisfy outstanding claims, even
on a worst-case basis. It was also pursuing ongoing litigation.

The change will take effect after it is approved at a shareholders' meeting

NKK said the change was aimed at strengthening management because NKK had to
develop new business areas, such as electronics, and rationalise old areas
when the economy was slow and difficult.

THE New Brunswick provincial government has stepped in to solve a dispute
between Stone Container of Chicago and the Canadian Paperworkers Union,
writes Robert Gibbens.
Stone closed its pulp mill at Bathurst, New Brunswick, last autumn because
of poor market conditions and threatened to close the packaging materials
machine alongside if the union did not accept job flexibility and a 20 per
cent cut in the mill's labour costs.
The union agreed to job flexibility and manning reductions, but would not
give way on pay.
The province has provided CDollars 3.5m (USDollars 2.94m) and the union will
put aside CDollars 2m to ease the burden of job losses.
A new contract has been ratified, with pay based on the existing contract
running out next year.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Record Telecom Argentina float
raises over Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARGENTINE govern-ment has raised more than Dollars 1bn in the country's
most successful privatisation.
The government yesterday completed the privatisation of Telecom Argentina
when it sold its remaining 30 per cent share in the country's second largest
telephone company to individual and corporate investors in an international
share offering.
Officials said the Telecom flotation far exceeded their forecasts and
out-performed the Dollars 838m raised last December from the sale of 30 per
cent of Telefonica de Argentina, the country's leading telephone company.
There is concern, however, that Telecom's share price has been inflated by
excessive bank financing. One bank offered to lend investors 80 per cent of
their bid, many of whom hope Telecom will emulate Telefonica's share price,
which has risen by two-thirds since flotation in December.
An analyst said: 'This is like a great big margin trading South Sea bubble.'
Government officials are considering restricting bank financing in future
flotations.
The privatisation process began in November 1990 when the telephone system
was split into two companies and 60 per cent of their capital sold to two
foreign operators in 1990 for Dollars 5.03bn in foreign debt certificates
and Dollars 214m in cash. The remaining 10 per cent of equity is held in
trust for company employees.
Mr Pedro Lopez, an official of the National Securities Commission, said the
government had received more than 340,000 applications from potential
investors offering Dollars 5.95bn for the shares.
However, only Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.1bn worth of applications will be
accepted, since most of the bids were made below the price established by
auction.
Officials say that only about 20 per cent of the bids were made by foreign
investors, the rest coming from Argentine investors using local or offshore
funds.
Telecom, managed by the French and Italian state telephone companies which
hold 39 per cent of the company, has stated it expected to raise sales this
year to Dollars 1.2bn, up 39 per cent on 1991. Net profit is forecast to
rise 30 per cent to Dollars 120m. Net margin is to rise to 25 per cent of
sales by 1996, when annual sales should reach Dollars 2bn.
The second consecutive success of a privatisation issue has fuelled the
booming Buenos Aires equity market, which climbed yesterday on the strength
of the Telecom flotation. Telefonica shares closed at 42 cents a share
yesterday.

branches

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Bank of Canada and CT Financial Services, the trust company arm of
Imasco, the financial services, fast-food, tobacco and retailing group, are
bidding for about 100 branches of Central Guaranty Trust, a key member of
the troubled Central Capital group.
The branches have about CDollars 7bn (USDollars 5.8bn) of assets and
represent about half Central Guaranty's business.
The two bidders would pay a premium approaching CDollars 200m, analysts
estimate, to be used to shore up Central Guaranty's capital position.
National would take 48 branches in Atlantic Canada and Quebec while CT
Financial, parent of Canada Trust, would gain 49 branches in eastern and
northern Ontario. Central Guaranty would be left with its business centred
on southern Ontario, with branches in western Canada.
National Bank said it had revised the offer it originally made last December
and is making it jointly with Canada Trust. It is Canada's sixth largest
chartered bank, while Canada Trust is one of the country's two biggest trust
companies.
Earlier, Montreal Trustco, a subsidiary of BCE, planned to take over all
Central Guaranty through a merger, but failed to reach agreement on terms.
National and Canada Trust say their joint offer has received approval from
Central Guaranty's board.

The new company, called Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift, will become
operative on July 1.
A preliminary accord to explore a possible joint venture had been struck
last December, but the final agreement came last Saturday. MHI will hold 80
per cent of the equity of the new joint venture company and Caterpillar 20
per cent.
While already approved by the two companies' boards, the joint venture is
subject to approval by US, Japanese and European Community authorities.
Its main plants are planned for Houston, Texas, and Almere, in the
Netherlands, though local manufacturing and marketing centres are envisaged
for the Americas, Europe and Asia. The new company will design, manufacture
and distribute lift trucks and other material-handling equipment and related
components.
It plans to vertically integrate with in-house production of components such
as hydraulics and power trains. Its products will be marketed under both the
Caterpillar and Mitsubishi brand names and through the two parents' dealer
organisations.
This latest venture deepens a lengthy working relationship between
Caterpillar and Mitsubishi. Since 1963, they have been business partners in
a joint venture company in Japan, called Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi, which
designs and manufactures construction equipment.
The announcement comes in the middle of a long and increasingly embittered
strike at Caterpillar by the United Auto Workers. The strike, about to enter
its sixth month, is expected to hurt Caterpillar's results this year.

AMERICAN EXPRESS and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), two corporate
giants under pressure from nimble rivals, have joined forces in an attempt
to woo the US small business community.
They announced yesterday that AT&amp;T's corporate calling card and the American
Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses
as a single entity.
The system will allow small businesses which are American Express corporate
card members to charge AT&amp;T telecommunications expenses along with other
out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement.
American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card
operations.

<TEXT>
NORANDA FOREST sees higher prices later this year for market pulp, wood
products, and many packaging products, but little recovery in newsprint and
fine papers.
However, operating rates should rise in all sectors, helping productivity
and bolstering cash flow, Canada's biggest forest products company said. The
outlook for 1993 is better.
Capital spending this year will be CDollars 350m (USDollars 292m), against
CDollars 284m in 1991, including CDollars 300m to bring Macmillan Bloedel's
mill effluent in British Columbia up to new federal environmental standards
for 1994-1995.
Noranda Forest says all its mills in eastern and western Canada will meet
the federal standards in time, but the big Northwood Pulp mill in British
Columbia will require major modifications to meet the province's latest
target of complete chlorine-free operation by the year 2002.
The British Columbia forest products industry is now in talks with the
government concerning this new target, saying that no technology yet exists
anywhere in the world to make compliance possible.

TT Group, the acquisitive industrial holding company, yesterday announced
that it had acquired a 7.5 per cent shareholding (3.75m shares) in ML
Holdings, the aerospace, cargo handling and electronic component
manufacturer.
The move, which sent ML shares up by 7p to 28p, comes a week after TT
announced that it had acquired a 4.6 per cent stake in Renold, the power
transmission equipment maker.
That announcement elicited a sharp response from Renold which accused TT of
attempting to acquire it 'on the cheap'. Renold closed 1p lower at 63p
yesterday.
In January ML turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.31m for the half year
ended September 1990, compared with a profit of Pounds 3.03m previously.
TT is due to announce its results for 1991 today. For the first six months
pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 6.77m.

bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT Chemicals International reported a 60 per cent fall in profits as its
core businesses were hit by recession.
The pre-tax line fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 5.24m after exceptional
items of Pounds 3.16m relating to the closure and reorganisation of
businesses which the company said would have been considered extraordinary
items under last year's accounting treatment.
Sales rose 11 per cent to Pounds 100m, largely due to acquisitions.
Mr Steve Cuthbert, chief executive, said Brent had successfully cut Pounds
2.8m of costs, had managed to increase research and development spending and
was coming to the end of a three year Pounds 20m investment programme.
The pre-press business had had a particularly good start to the year, and
civil aviation was also beginning to enjoy a recovery as people returned to
flying after the Gulf war.
While sales in industrial metals finishing were firm in January there was no
sign a recovery would continue. Nor were there any signs of recovery in the
electronics division.
Earnings per share fell from 13.4p to 2.9p. As promised in November when the
group announced a Pounds 15.6m rights issue, the final dividend is
maintained at 5.8p for an unchanged total of 7.4p.

to Pounds 5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
W CANNING, the Birm-ingham-based speciality chemicals and electronics
distribution group, is maintaining its dividend despite a setback in pre-tax
profits for 1991.
Profits fell 16 per cent to Pounds 5.72m, compared with Pounds 6.84m,
achieved on turnover of Pounds 117m (Pounds 125.8m). Earnings per share
worked through at 12.2p (12.7p).
But the costs of meeting the closure of electronic distribution businesses
in Germany and Spain, tax and the dividend payment wiped out profits and led
to a retained loss of Pounds 1.25m.
The Pounds 2.1m cost of the dividend, maintained at 7.29p with a final of
4.35p, was, in effect, met by increasing borrowings so that gearing was 58
per cent against a target of 45 per cent.
Mr David Probert, chairman, said that that the dividend was justified by the
fact that extraordinary charges would not recur and that the group had
Pounds 6m of surplus assets, largely property, which once sold would reduce
gearing 'comfortably below 45 per cent'.
Last year the group saw sales in its electronic distribution business
falling quarter by quarter.
By contrast the speciality chemical business held up well and increased
operating profits from Pounds 5m to Pounds 7.05m.
The current year has started steadily. Chemical sales and profits were
higher and electronic equipment sales were better than the last quarter of
1991 although lower than in the first quarter.
The 1992 figures would respond to cost-cutting measures taken in 1991. But,
said Mr Probert, 'I do not envisage any significant improvement in
underlying demand levels until the last quarter of the year at the
earliest.'

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Linread's Pounds 2.2m loss as exceptionals
take toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINREAD, the Birmingham-based manufacturer of fasteners and components for
the aerospace and motor industries, fell into losses in 1991. Turnover
dipped Pounds 3m to Pounds 39.7m.
The pre-tax deficit, struck after sizeable exceptional charges, was Pounds
2.2m, compared with profits of Pounds 2.08m in the previous year and a first
half profit this time of Pounds 126,000. Losses per share were 13.84p
compared with earnings of 11.07p.
Nevertheless, a final dividend of 1.5p is proposed, bringing the total to
3.5p (5.7p). Mr Peter Tahany, chairman, said the payment 'is basically an
expression of confidence.'
This follows elimination of loss-making activities, including the North
Bridge Hassall subsidiary in the US and a fasteners factory in the UK, at an
exceptional cost of Pounds 2.86m.
It also springs from the turnround in the commercial products division, of
which fasteners are a part. In 1991, it incurred trading losses of Pounds
1.47m but in the first two months of this year has been trading at a slender
profit.
The company is expecting higher earnings to flow from a reduced cost base,
but Mr Tahany is taking a cautious view of demand this year from the
aerospace market, hitherto the main source of profits, where British
Aerospace is a leading customer. However, on the engine side, he noted that
Linread had been designated as a preferred supplier by Pratt &amp; Whitney, the
US engine manufacturer.
Mr Tahany was more optimistic about demand from the motor industry.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Nestle and Agnellis agree on Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE bitter battle for control of Perrier mineral water, the well-known
French brand name, ended yesterday when Nestle, the powerful Swiss food
group, and its allies agreed terms for a settlement with their opponents,
the Agnelli family of Italy.
Full details of the agreement, which was concluded at 2am yesterday, will be
announced in Paris today.
Speculation on the stock market suggested that Nestle has agreed to increase
its FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.38bn) offer for Perrier in return for the Agnellis
raising their FFr5.6bn bid for Exor, the French property company that
controls Perrier. BSN, the French food group which turned against its old
allies, the Agnellis, to side with Nestle, its chief competitor, would then
drop its FFr6bn counter-bid for Exor.
The Agnellis stand to make a substantial profit from selling Exor's shares
in Perrier. The Agnellis may also retain control of Exor's extensive
property interests and Chateau Margaux wines. Meanwhile, BSN is expected to
exercise its prior agreement with Nestle to buy Volvic, one of the Perrier
waters.
'It looks as though peace has broken out although we're still not sure on
what terms,' said Mr John Graham, European food analyst at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew in London. 'The Agnellis seem to have decided it would be too expensive
and too damaging to drag out the battle any longer.'
The seeds of the Perrier fracas were sown last year when the Agnellis
accepted an invitation from Exor to become one of its minority shareholders.
This angered both BSN, previously the Agnellis' partner in France, and
Lazard Freres, the Paris-based bank that had orchestrated the partnership.
Their anger intensified last autumn when the Agnellis announced an agreed
partial offer for Exor. The Agnellis then agreed to make a full offer for
Exor.
Nestle, having failed to persuade the Agnellis to sell Exor's shares in
Perrier, prepared to mount its own bid.
The pressure on the Agnellis intensified when BSN mounted a FFr6bn
counter-bid for Exor. When Nestle scored two decisive legal victories, the
pressure to negotiate became intolerable resulting in the settlement.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Re-engineering the Paris stock market: A new wave of changes
to French securities rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The brightest brains in the French civil service, it is often said, end up
at the finance ministry. Their brainpower is now being put to the test as
they tussle over a series of reforms of France's stock markets.
Over the next few months the ministry will finish proposals on issues with
important implications for the market's future. A forthcoming reform of the
French pension system and a series of share sales in large state-owned
companies should provide a new influx of investment and equity. Other
reforms in the pipeline include an overhaul of France's complex takeover
laws and measures to halt the drift of 'block' trades in large numbers of
shares from Paris to London.
'Clearly there is a political will to complete the modernisation of the
French financial system,' said Mr Micha Spierenberg, president of Bacot
Allain Warburg, the French arm of the SG Warburg securities group. 'All in
all these reforms are very encouraging and should make the market more
modern and more efficient.'
The first wave of French stock market reform was in the mid-1980s when Paris
followed the precedent set by London in opening up its financial markets in
preparation for the 1990s. The pace of change was frenetic: old monopolies
were abolished, closed markets opened and state-of-the-art technology
introduced.
But some old practices, such as a right to make a 'partial' bid for two
thirds of a company and a bourse tax on share transactions, survived. Paris
banks and brokers have long complained about them, arguing that they
reinforce international investors' suspicions about the inbred nature of the
French market and make it difficult for Paris to compete.
Recently these complaints have been reinforced by the rows over the partial
bid for the Printemps retail group by Pinault, the property company, and the
battle for Perrier mineral water.
As a result the French government and the regulatory authorities are now
amenable to the prospect of reform. The finance ministry is reviewing the
takeover laws and is expected to abolish partial bids in favour of forcing
investors to make full offers.
The stock market authorities are also reviewing the procedure for executing
block trades in Paris, which has lost much of such business to London where
the system is more flexible. This review could result in a more flexible
disclosure system and, possibly, a new cadre of market makers.
These changes may make little practical difference. So many large French
companies are controlled by friendly shareholders that there are relatively
few hostile bids. And it is probably too late for Paris to recapture the
block trading business already lost to London. But, said Mr Rene de la
Serre, managing director of Credit Commercial de France, one of the larger
banks, these were 'important refinements which should enhance the standing
of the French market'.
But these technical changes pale beside the more important issue of the
future size and structure of the stock market. The overwhelming problem for
the French market is its shortage of equity and investment, largely due to
the all-pervasive nature of government involvement. The state controls many
large French companies, which restricts the number of publicly quoted
groups. It also dominates the pension and savings systems, so that France,
unlike the US or the UK, does not have a steady influx of securities
investment from private sector institutions such as pension funds.
This is where the most significant changes are taking place. The socialist
government recently announced a programme of sales of minority stakes in
state-controlled companies. The first of these issues, the FFr2bn (Pounds
200m) sale of 2.3 per cent of the Elf Aquitaine oil group, is under way.
'These partial privatisations should provide a steady source of new equity,'
says Mr David Finch, director of the stockbroking subsidiary of Finacor in
Paris. 'They ought to continue whichever party wins the next general
election. In fact if the right wins, they will probably accelerate.'
The reform of the pension system should also help address the lack of
investment. French pensions are administered by the state, which pays them
on a pay-as-you-go basis from money received from those in employment. This
system is coming under strain as the population ages and there are
proportionately fewer workers to support the pensioners. The solution, as Mr
Pierre Beregovoy the finance minister has acknowledged, is to increase the
use of private pensions.
So far Mr Beregovoy has not gone as far as the financial community had hoped
with pension reform. Last week he announced plans for a new FFr60,000
tax-efficient personal equity plan, although he did not specify whether the
tax benefits would be realised throughout its six-year lifespan, or at the
end. But he also dashed the market's hopes by refusing to introduce
corporate pension funds, presumably because of opposition from the trade
unions.
'The PEP initiative is a step in the right direction, but without upfront
tax advantages, it is unlikely to have a major impact,' said Mr Spierenberg.
'The creation of pension funds would be the single most important step, but
it looks as though we may have to wait a little longer for that.' Mr
Beregovoy is expected to wait until after next year's elections before
returning to the issue.
Corporate pension funds would not only provide new investment but also
create a new breed of powerful investment institutions, instilling greater
discipline in the market. But the unions are not the only obstacle.
The brains in the finance ministry must also work out a way of persuading
the French electorate to shell out for private pensions at the same time as
they are supporting those already in retirement - an intellectual puzzle
which will really test their ingenuity.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Frank B Hall stake for sale
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELIANCE Group Holdings, the US insurance and investment company controlled
by Mr Saul Steinberg, is seeking a buyer for its majority stake in Frank B.
Hall, its troubled insurance broking subsidiary.
Hall, which is the seventh biggest broker in the world with income of around
Dollars 462m (Pounds 267m) in 1991, owns Leslie &amp; Godwin, the Lloyd's
broker.
Its sale would signal further realignment within the highly competitive
broking sector.
Hall revealed that Reliance, the investment and insurance company was
exploring the sale of its stake in a filing with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission last week.
Reliance owns 68 per cent of the common stock, or 84 per cent if all
warrants are exercised and preferred shares converted. It is believed to
have called in Bear Stearns, the Wall Street investment bank, to advise.
Hall has incurred losses after tax in four of the last five years, reporting
a deficit of Dollars 25.6m in 1991.
The sale opens new opportunities for Hall's leading international
competitors who have been expanding market share in recent years. Three of
Hall's toughest competitors in the US retail market have all made
significant headway in the last 18 months. Corroon &amp; Black linked up with
the London-based broker, Willis Faber, in October 1990 to form Willis
Corroon, the world's second biggest broker.
Rollins Burdick Hunter, which is part of the Aon Corporation, has also been
expanding in Europe. It bought the Dutch broker Hudig-Langeveldt last
August, overtaking Hall in the rankings (by revenues) as a result. Aon also
owns a significant minority stake in the London market broker, Nicholson
Chamberlain Colls, but lacks any presence in UK retail broking.
Last month New York-based Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest broker, also
broadened its base in Europe, by buying Faugere et Jutheau, France's biggest
broker.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Pretoria moves to set up first multiracial councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRETORIA, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government, buoyed by victory in a white referendum on
apartheid, expects to have the first phase of a multiracial interim
government in place by next month, ministers said yesterday.
Government proposals tabled at the Convention for Democratic South Africa,
the multi-party forum negotiating a post-apartheid constitution, called for
multi-party transitional councils to oversee key areas of government in the
run-up to elections next year for an interim legislature.
The councils would include six members chosen by Codesa and a seventh
appointed by the president in consultation with the convention.
However, under Pretoria's plans the existing all-white cabinet would remain
in place, though ministers made clear it would be bound by council
decisions.
The proposals were initially rejected by the African National Congress in
the belief the councils would play a purely advisory role. Later, however,
senior ANC officials said they thought agreement could be reached after
further talks.
But they rejected the government's hard-line insistence that the ANC disband
its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, before a full transitional government
was in place.
Pretoria says that joint control of the police and army will only be
conceded once the question of armed struggle has been resolved.
The transitional councils would oversee four areas of government:
preparation for elections, government finance, regional government and local
government.
Councils on education, health, housing and foreign relations would be set up
later.
Ministers said that, as the councils would take decisions by consensus - and
that as consensus could not be achieved without the agreement of all
parties, including government - the cabinet would have no reason to veto
council decisions.
Pretoria may have to make further concessions on the powers of the councils,
but it seems likely that the issue can be swiftly resolved in Codesa.
Further stumbling blocks could yet emerge, however, over who should be
appointed to the councils, and over how many parties should be represented.
The ANC wants the broadest possible representation, while the government
wants to exclude all but major parties.

FT  24 MAR 92 / US and Japan tussle over gentle giant from Hawaii
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 41-STONE sumo wrestler called Konishiki is looming as a large source of
friction between Japan and the US.
The 28-year-old Hawaiian, also known as the Dump Truck, is in line for
promotion to the top rank, yokozuna, of the Japanese sport - never before
held by a foreigner.
But there are suggestions that Konishiki, who has just won his third sumo
tournament, lacks the 'spirit' for such an elevated position. Last night,
Konishiki was told he must wait until 'the next tournament or the tournament
after that'. Some suspect he may remain forever a second-ranking ozeki.
There are no specific standards for promotion to yokozuna, but the sumo
promotion committee in Japan generally decides after assessing performance,
health and spirit - qualities that are open to flexible interpretation.
President George Bush has followed Konishiki's progress with interest.
Prominent US coverage of the wrestler's latest win and a congratulatory
message from Mr Bush and 'the American people' have prompted Japanese
officials to fear US Congress will soon enter the dohyo, the sumo ring, with
allegations that the Hawaiian is another US victim of 'structural
impediments' - trade jargon for cultural barriers.
His tournament victory on Sunday marked the 39th win of his past 45 bouts.
One cause of concern is his winning technique - the wrapping of massive arms
around an opponent and the use of his bulk to manoeuvre them slowly but
inevitably out of the ring.
This style irritates the purists, who believe that a yokozuna should have a
repertoire of throws and thrusts. Other critics argue that Konishiki, as a
foreigner, cannot fully appreciate the spiritual connotations of the sport,
an argument implicit in a magazine headline last week: 'Foreign yokozuna not
needed.'
Konishiki has blurred the lines by recently marrying a Japanese model, and
he is a skilled speaker of the language. Yet he must still overcome the
likes of Mr Noboru Kojima, a member of the promotion committee, who lamented
last week that sumo will soon be flooded with oversized and underskilled
foreigners out to make a quick yen.
The question of Konishiki's promotion to grand champion and a sudden
increase in foreigners in the sport's lower ranks are putting Japan's
self-proclaimed 'internationalisation' to the test. About 40 foreigners are
trying to make it as sumoists, including six Mongolians and a Sri Lankan,
and three Hawaiian wrestlers have been dominant in the two tournaments so
far this year.
While sumo officials huddle in debate over Konishiki, ordinary Japanese are
generally charmed by his out-of-ring gentleness and humour. Before leaving
Japan yesterday for a Hawaiian holiday and another celebration of his
wedding, he said humbly that the promotion decision is not his to make.
'I did my best on the dohyo. What people think off the dohyo is up to them.'

<TEXT>
Paris is preparing for the denouement of the most absorbing cross-border
continental European takeover tussle since the three-cornered fight for
Societe Generale de Belgique. Details of the carve-up between major
participants will only be announced today, but whatever the sweeteners the
Agnelli family is being forced to retreat with a bloody nose.
The irony is that the story has not been one of foreigner in shining armour
frustrated by Machiavellian intrigue at the French establishment. The
Agnellis look to have got what they deserved for trying to avoid paying a
fair price for Exor, and then conniving in what looked like a dubious, and
subsequently disallowed, poison pill manoeuvre which was masterminded by
Exor and Perrier chairman Jacques Vincent.

FT  24 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Argos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by yesterday's results, the only thing holding Argos back last year
was the lack of confidence among its customers. But the effect was severe
enough to reduce pre-tax profits by 17 per cent. Underlying sales volumes
fell, and the group's cost base proved relatively inflexible despite the
best efforts of management.
That was not unlike the experience of rival retailers, so the market may
have been unduly sceptical about Argos's premium rating - its shares
underperformed the stores sector by a fifth over the last year. What
originally singled the group out was the quality of its management and a
relatively protected position in the market. Neither has changed. And it is
hard to quibble with Argos's responses to the recession.
It has Pounds 180m of cash in hand, so can afford to be patient. The new
Chesterman furniture stores will add spice to the standard fare of
controlled expansion via new catalogue stores. If the furniture business
works, Argos will have a broader base for growth. Should it fail, the price
will be no more than Pounds 10m.
There are also reasons for mild optimism in the longer-term about the better
end of the retailing sector. Because costs have begun to move slowly in
favour of retailers, there is real scope for operating margins to improve.
Consumers may remain nervous for a while yet, but even a modest improvement
in sales will have a gratifying effect on profits. The trick for investors
will be to select those best positioned to benefit. Although its shares are
still on an above-average historic multiple of 18, Argos deserves to be on
the list.

FT  24 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Election day is fast approaching in Redland's Pounds 600m bid for Steetley.
By Thursday lunchtime the relatively small number of UK institutions that
will determine the outcome must decide whether to accept a final paper offer
worth 377p in last night's market, opt for the 365p per share cash
alternative, or cast their vote for an independent Steetley.
In many ways it is remarkable that there is still a contest. Redland has
made most of the running since Day One, leaving Steetley to grab the
headlines mainly when its luckless management stood on one of the unusually
large number of banana skins scattered in its way. The City and most
commentators wrote off the target company's chances early on, though to its
credit Steetley management stood its ground.
Redland deserves to win, but the arguments are certainly not as clear cut as
its skilfully marshalled campaign has implied. The logic of Steetley's
industrial strategy in the 1980s, for instance, has been obscured by the
attention devoted to the company's poor financial health. The dreadful and
embarrassing timing of the Pounds 40m Gobitta aggregates write-off has
overshadowed appreciation of the useful market position which Steetley has
built up in France. Steetley cannot pin all the blame for the aborted Tarmac
building materials merger on high politics in London and Brussels -
especially when it formed such a central part of the early defence - but
Redland may not be the ideal brick partner for a deep recession.
In the end, though, it will require a lot of faith to reject an offer which
only looks cheap on the basis of Steetley profit projections for the
mid-1990s, and which has not been capped by the much mooted counter-bidder.
The more pertinent question is whether to take shares or cash. Given the
continuing economic and political uncertainties, the bank may be a better
bet for the next six months.

FT  24 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: A trade-off for shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FINANCIAL markets appear increasingly confused by the election and its
impact on the economy. The glimmerings of recovery were apparent in
yesterday's trade figures. Import volumes were up sharply in February,
especially for capital goods and basic materials, while exports bounced back
from January's trough. Yet the FT-SE 100 slipped 15 points, presumably
because of worries about Labour's edge in the polls.
Sterling appeared unruffled and actually rose against the D-Mark. Perhaps
the currency held up because, having accepted the possibility of a Labour
victory or a hung parliament, the money markets are starting to discount a
rise in base rates after the election. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats
are committed to the ERM, but higher rates, at least initially, would almost
certainly be needed to defend the parity. Yet that prospect ought to have
done much more damage to equities than the 5 per cent fall since the
election was announced. Coming on top of the shock to the economy of the
adjustment to Labour's tax changes for top wage earners, higher mortgage
rates would kill any recovery. A half-point rise would wipe out nearly all
the gains in Mr John Smith's budget for a family man on average earnings.
One possibility is that the equity market mistrusts Mr Smith's ERM
commitment and believes he would try to kick-start the economy with a large
devaluation. That would be good for shares, but only in the longer run.
Another is that it does not yet believe in a Tory defeat. Were the Tories to
win, the election bears could be trampled in the rush to buy. Not only does
the trade data add to the more positive picture of the economy painted by
last week's retail sales. At their current levels, equities would look cheap
in a politically certain world.

FT  24 MAR 92 / New world watchdog in search of bark and bite: The CSCE will
seek to define its role after the end of the Cold War in a summit meeting
which starts today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The founders of the various international security organisations have a
penchant for uninspiring titles and acronyms.
The 'Helsinki Follow-Up Conference', which begins in the Finnish capital
today and ends in July with a full-scale summit of its 48 member states is a
case in point. Yet it is potentially one of the most significant
international gatherings since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
communist system in eastern Europe.
Its avowed purpose is not only to review the work of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) since the last conference of its
kind ended, in Vienna, in 1989, but to attempt to give the CSCE the
necessary teeth to turn itself into an effective guardian of the continent's
security. That will require not only imagination, but political will. In
particular, it remains to be demonstrated whether the increased enthusiasm
of Britain and the US for the organisation in a radically transformed
European political and military environment is more than skin-deep.
The reservations of Washington and London are based partly on the belief
that a 48-member organisation, now embracing countries such as the US and
Canada at one end of the spectrum, and Russia and the newly-independent
Central Asian republics at the other, can never be an effective body for
taking decisions and action. The organisation is likely to grow further with
the inclusion of new states such as Georgia. More fundamentally, the US and
UK fear that if too much weight is attached to the CSCE's security functions
it will undermine the already diminished role of Nato, even though the CSCE
lacks the latter's characteristics of a military alliance with mutual
defence guarantees.
It is a matter of continuing debate among western governments whether Nato
has been deprived of most of its raison d'etre following the dissolution of
the Warsaw Pact, or whether instability in the eastern part of the continent
requires western countries to keep up their military guard. For the moment,
the view that a continuing insurance policy is required, in the form of a
viable western defence organisation, has won the day. Equally, however, Nato
members have recognised that they cannot permit a security vacuum in eastern
Europe.
These twin considerations, instead of leading to a strengthening of the
CSCE, the long-existing political forum for bridging the east-west gap, have
initially spawned a hybrid 'son of Nato', the North Atlantic Co-operation
Council (Nacc). Though not offering the full membership and security
guarantees that many of the east European states and even Russia want, Nacc
offers them a permanent forum for consultation and co-operation on security
and related issues.
There is no reason to suppose that Nacc would continue to play this dominant
role if the CSCE were strengthened and made more effective. The prospects of
this happening have improved as the view that Nato and the CSCE could be
truly complementary has become rather more firmly rooted. Both the US and
British governments have begun to abandon their lukewarm attitude towards
the CSCE and to underline the constructive division of labour that could be
achieved in the security field if the two organisations stick to their
appointed functions. One of the more useful suggestions endorsed by the US
is that, if any peace-keeping forces were required to keep combattants apart
in a conflict for which the CSCE was trying to find a political solution,
these could be provided by Nato.
The CSCE does not have, and can probably never aspire to, the formal
military structure that Nato has. However, the CSCE can boast a wider
membership than Nato, and competence in the fields of disarmament,
confidence-building measures, the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict
prevention and human rights.
The CSCE's achievements since its establishment by the 1975 Final Act in
Helsinki, have been much greater than the adverse publicity it has often
received. It became an international benchmark for the respect of human
rights and principles such as non-interference in the internal affairs of
others.
The CSCE's role in the disarmament process, if less spectacular than the
bilateral negotiations on the reduction of nuclear arms between the US and
the Soviet Union, was also vital. While there has always been a dispute over
whether it should be used as an arms control forum, it has served as the
umbrella organisation, in particular, for the Conventional Forces in Europe
(CFE) treaty signed in December 1990.
But above all, the CSCE has played a leading and innovative role in the
field of military confidence-building, notably through the Stockholm and
Vienna agreements of 1986 and 1990 respectively, which provided for the
right of states to observe big military manoeuvres, laid down minimum
periods of notice for exercises above a certain size and provided for
verification measures. It is now proposed to create a new security forum
which will deal both with future talks on confidence-building measures and
the incompleted conventional arms talks in Europe.
In the post-Cold War era, in which the risk of war between the two big
military blocs has been replaced by the threat of multiple conflicts between
ethnic groups seeking independence, it should be one of the CSCE's main
tasks to build on these military confidence-building measures with an
effective process to prevent and resolve political conflicts. At the moment,
it is ill-equipped to undertake such tasks.
The extent to which the CSCE has been hamstrung by its rule that all
decisions must be taken by consensus was underlined by its impotence in the
Yugoslav crisis. Since then, a cautious step towards modifying this rule has
been taken by CSCE ministers, who decided at a recent meeting in Prague that
a single member state could be overridden if found guilty of 'clear and
gross violation' of its CSCE commitments. Yet it is accepted that any move
under this so-called 'consensus minus one' rule would be confined to
political statements.
Much more ambitious is a proposal by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German
foreign minister, to overcome the problem of decision-making in such an
unwieldy body. Germany, backed by the Netherlands, is suggesting that to nip
a dangerous conflict in the bud, a special committee of about five member
states should be designated to work out a solution with the parties to any
dispute.
Whatever the decision on this matter, however, it is clear that if the CSCE
is serious about its conflict prevention role, the special Conflict
Prevention Centre in Vienna created by the CSCE's 1990 Paris Charter will
have to be given a shot in the arm. A director, two officers, a few
administrative staff and an annual budget of Dollars 1m are hardly
sufficient to deal with disputes as serious as the one between Armenia and
Azerbaijan, to which the CSCE is now addressing itself.
This conflict between the two former Soviet republics, is just the kind of
emergency which a new-style CSCE will have to tackle. But to do so, the
ministers and officials in Helsinki will have to give the organisation the
tools and resources to do the job.

Poor Rita Tushingham, you might think she had given only one performance in
her life. The billing for tonight's half-hour ITV drama reminds us that she
played the lead in 'A Taste Of Honey', which she did .....31 years ago.
Today she stars in a romantic story by NJ Crisp about a widower who puts an
advertisement in a lonely hearts column: Sunday Pursuit (9.00).
I had a pretty misspent youth, yet the number of times I listened to Radio
Luxembourg could be counted on the fingers of one hand. For some of my
contemporaries, however, listening to the 'station of the stars' under the
bedclothes was the high point of existence. Now it is only a satellite
service and 40 Minutes sys 'Farewell Fab 208' (9.50 BBC2).
The biggest argument among the jurors on last year's Banff TV Festival was
about a bizarre Australian programme called The Year Of The Patronising
Bastard. In illustrating society's mistreatment of the disabled it does some
questionable things itself. I thought it worked and that the disabled were
glad to be treated tough like anyone else. Others found it cruel. You can
judge for yourself at 10.25 on C4.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission said yesterday it intended soon to
advertise the licence for Channel 5, the new television channel.
Channel 5 will cause interference on video recorders and home computers, and
the successful bidder will have to pay for retuning all the affected
equipment. The plans were suspended while the commission considered how
bidders would cope with this.
The ITC said yesterday comments from potential applicants 'indicated that
the extent of the retuning problems is recognised and that serious
consideration has been given to solving them'.
The licence will now be advertised in early April with the intention to
award it by the end of October.
The winner is expected to be on air in part of the country by the end of
1994, and some viewers will need new aerials. The applicants will include Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest and FiveTV, a consortium supported by Canadian
broadcaster Mr Moser Znaimer.

A MAIL-ORDER magazine is to be launched next week by Mr George Davies,
former head of the Next clothing chain, in his latest venture in clothing
retail, Gary Mead writes.
Mr Davies said the publication, which he describes as a 'magalogue', will be
a cross between a magazine and a mail-order catalogue.
The monthly publication will be given away with some newspapers, and will be
sold in retail newsagents Dillons.
Mr Davies said yesterday he had been 'impressed by changes in the newspaper
industry' and that desktop publishing technologies had made it possible to
produce a monthly mail-order magazine.
The venture has been funded by Mr Davies and a group of friends with Pounds
10m raised with 'very little' finance from banks.

FT  24 MAR 92 / County Hall sale can be reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE company's deal to buy the main building at County Hall, former
headquarters of the Greater London Council, can be terminated up to the end
of the year by the London Residuary Body. The body is responsible for
selling the assets of the GLC, which was abolished in 1986.
The contract for the sale, at an undisclosed price, to the privately owned
Shirayama Corporation, was signed in Osaka yesterday by Sir Godfrey Taylor,
chairman of the residuary body. The deal is not due to be concluded before
October next year.
The outcome of the general election will decide whether the building is used
as a hotel and leisure centre, as envisaged by Shirayama, or shared between
a new Greater London Authority and the London School of Economics, as
proposed by the Labour party. Labour has said it would reverse the sale to
Shirayama.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Import volumes rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTS MEASURED in terms of volume rose faster than exports in the UK last
month, government figures showed yesterday.
The volume of imports excluding oil and erratics in the three months to
February rose 3 per cent compared with the three months to November last
year while exports rose by only half as much.
The value of UK exports rose 8.5 per cent last month to reach Pounds 9bn,
while imports rose 6.5 per cent in the month to Pounds 10.1bn.
In the three months to February the value of exports was 1 per cent higher
than in the previous three months and 5.5 per cent higher than a year
earlier.
The three-monthly trend for import value showed them 1.5 per cent higher
than in the previous three-month period and 4 per cent higher than a year
before.
Last month's deficit in the current account, which covers trade in goods,
services and certain transfer payments, totalled Pounds 750m, about Pounds
250m worse than the market forecast of Pounds 500m. It compared with a
revised deficit in January of Pounds 858m.
The visible trade deficit - trade in merchandise goods - improved slightly
last month, falling from Pounds 1.2bn in January to just over Pounds 1bn in
February. However, this was the second consecutive month in which the
visible trade deficit had exceeded Pounds 1bn. The poor figure was caused
partly by weaker trade in oil and erratics, and the surplus on these two
items was only Pounds 72m last month compared with Pounds 187m in January.
The estimate of the surplus on invisible earnings such as banking, insurance
and tourism was held at Pounds 300m.
A breakdown of exports and imports measured by value shows that imports of
manufactured goods, excluding erratics such as aircraft and precious stones,
grew by 2 per cent in the latest three months while exports of manufactured
goods rose 2.5 per cent.
Imports of finished manufactures, which include consumer durables and cars,
grew by 2.5 per cent in the three months to last month - ahead of exports
which grew by 2 per cent.
Within finished manufactures, the outlook for the UK motor industry was
bleak. Exports of cars fell 4.5 per cent in the three months to February
while imports rose 13 per cent.
However, the value of imports of capital goods rose 1.5 per cent in the
latest three months compared with the previous three months while exports
fell 1 per cent. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the rise in imports
of capital goods was a sign that companies were investing in plant and
equipment.
The value of chemicals exports, one of the few buoyant sectors of the
economy, rose 2.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the
three months to November and by 12 per cent on the year.
Imports of food, beverages and tobacco, measured by value, rose 5.5 per cent
in the latest three months and by 13 per cent on the year.
Britain's surplus on oil fell slightly last month to Pounds 100m compared
with Pounds 200m in January.
The January fall in exports to the European Community was reversed last
month. Exports to the EC rose 2 per cent in the three months to last month
compared with the previous quarter and by 5.5 per cent on the year.
Exports to north America fell 0.5 per cent.
Imports from the EC rose by 2 per cent on the three-monthly basis and by 3
per cent compared with a year ago.
Imports from other OECD countries, which include Japan, jumped by 18 per
cent in the latest three months, bringing the year-on-year increase to 25
per cent.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Punch may be about to receive its final blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Punch, the UK's best-known humorous magazine, appeared
yesterday to be no laughing matter.
Mr David Thomas, the editor, moved quickly to exploit the uncertainty over
the publication's future by urging everyone to rush out and buy this week's
issue. 'If this week's is the last issue it will make a tremendous
souvenir,' he said. 'If it isn't going to be the last issue then the extra
sales will really save it.' Mr Thomas has been practising his gallows humour
since he became editor more than three years ago of the magazine, which was
founded 150 years ago.
He has spent his time in the editor's chair fighting a rearguard action
against declining circulation and the publication's association with
dentists' waiting rooms. He said yesterday that he had hear nothing about
its future.
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, which owns the
magazine, did not seem to be in a joking mood yesterday. 'No comment,' he
said.
The circulation of Punch, which has published humorists such as PG
Wodehouse, has not been a fit subject for humour for 50 years. From a
circulation peak of about 175,000 in the 1940s it fell below 100,000 in 1976
and reached 33,000 last year.
Mr Thomas said circulation has now reached 40,000. But whoever eventually

FT  24 MAR 92 / Warning on accounting proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to change the structure of the profit-and-loss account will be
costly and make company accounts more confusing, the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants (Cima) said yesterday.
Cima also said in its response to the proposed financial reporting standard
issued by the Accounting Standards Board late last year that the definition
of some of the information required was unclear.
It called for accounting standards to be 'field-tested' on companies and
then refined.
Cima also argued that requirements for additional information in the
accounts were often justified on their own, but collectively risked
'cluttering' the profit-and-loss account and reducing its usefulness.
The institute said information on revenue investment - expenditure leading
to increased future earnings - was often not collected as part of existing
management information, and the requirement for disclosure would therefore
involve additional costs.

FT  24 MAR 92 / FT Conference: EC rules attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Europe's third-biggest packaging company yesterday launched a
fierce attack on the main thrust of European environmental legislation that
affects his industry.
Mr Hans Rausing, chairman and chief executive of Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval Group
of Sweden, said at a Financial Times conference in London on packaging and
the environment that the attention paid to waste from packaging was
disproportionate to its impact on the environment.
He said household packaging waste constituted less than 2.5 per cent of the
total waste generated by society.
Mr Clemens Stroetmann, state secretary in the German environment ministry,
defended the German approach which was based on the 'polluter pays'
principle. He said the recycling system being created by German industry was
already proving a 'clear success'.
However, Mr Jonathan Sims, a consultant with RMA, the packaging consultants,
told the conference: 'More resources are being spent transporting waste
packaging around Germany, sorting it, recycling it, warehousing it and
dumping it on other markets than are being saved.' Repeating the process on
a European scale would lead to 'environmental vandalism' masquerading as
environmental benefit.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour unveils proposals for London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday played down its plans to remove the Corporation of London's
local-government powers over the City as it launched its manifesto for the
whole of London.
The 10-page document did not mention the proposed transfer of powers,
although the party later insisted it would implement the plan. It described
the transfer as 'not a high priority'.
The party also predicted that its proposed strategic London government would
be in place within about two years.
The cost of the body would be met partly by taking over the budgets of the
joint boards which have replaced the Greater London Council. Mr Bryan Gould,
shadow environment secretary, said joint-board functions and budgets would
be taken over by the proposed Greater London Authority 'in most cases'. The
rest of its funding would be provided by government grant.
The authority is the centrepiece of Labour's plans for the capital. They
also involve a new London Development Agency and a range of transport
measures, including reforms to maximise the use of travel and network cards
and new regulation of taxis and minicabs.
Mr Gould said the authority would be elected by 'a new and more proportional
electoral system' guaranteeing equal representation for women. It would have
approximately half the number of elected members the GLC had.
The GLA would be the basis of a wholly elected London police authority.
Labour wants the authority to be based at County Hall, the former GLC
headquarters. Its planned sale to a Japanese developer was announced earlier
this week.
The Conservative London manifesto, unveiled last week, proposes a cabinet
sub-committee for the capital, a London transport minister and a
private-sector forum to advise on promoting the city as a cultural and
business centre.
The Liberal Democrats want a strategic London authority to be elected by a
system of proportional representation.

FT  24 MAR 92 / National Gallery bids for Holbein painting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Gallery said last night that it had made a bid for Holbein's
painting Lady with a Pet Squirrel and a Starling, which was due to go to
auction next month. The work was expected to make up to Pounds 15m at
Christie's, and could have become the most expensive Old Master sold at
auction in the UK.
The gallery said it had made an offer to the Marquess of Cholmondeley, the
owner, for a private-treaty deal, in which the vendor does not have to pay
the tax or commission involved in an auction sale, so that a lower price can
be agreed.
The Museums and Galleries Commission, which advises the government, said it
was delighted that the painting might go to the gallery instead of being
sold at auction, possibly to an overseas buyer.
The commission said that the marquess might have received only Pounds 5m or
Pounds 6m if the picture had reached Pounds 15m in an auction.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Arms groups 'may fare better under Labour'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH defence manufac-turers could face heavier cuts in government
spending under the Conservatives than under Labour, according to a report
published today.
The report by the Oxford Research Group, an independent organisation dealing
with defence issues, says a Conservative government committed to curbing
public spending would probably be forced to make big cuts beyond those
already announced.
A Labour government, on the other hand, would be likely to maintain defence
spending, or at least delay cuts rather than face widespread redundancies
and closures.
The report says: 'There thus arises the curious situation whereby, although
the Conservatives are accusing Labour of planning large cuts in defence,
there is a distinct possibility that future cuts could actually be greater
under a Conservative government than a Labour one.'
The report says Labour's commitment to preserving employment would 'severely
limit' scope for reducing military spending.
It says, however, that the role of the Defence Diversification Agency
proposed by Labour is not yet well defined.
The report argues that, because of the size of its defence sector, the UK
faces a greater adjustment problem than any other European country, but that
the government has so far been reluctant to become involved.
'UK industry is not adapting as rapidly as other countries, or as quickly as
it could, because there is not a clear enough signal from government on the
shape of the future,' it says. Job losses in defence, it argues, are not
solely the result of the end of the Cold War. They also reflect changing
equipment requirements and efficiency improvements made necessary by
competition.
A report published last week by the University of Bradford's Department of
Peace Studies put the number of direct or indirect defence industry jobs
lost or scheduled to go since 1990 at 61,000.
The IPMS Civil Service union, the MSF technical union and the TGWU general
workers' union yesterday indicated how they believed a defence
diversification agency should work.
Their joint report foresees defence budget savings of Pounds 30.5bn by the
end of the century and calls for a commitment to 'frontload' the proposed
agency's expenditure.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Charities see need to improve managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST CHARITIES believe more professional management and marketing are needed
in the voluntary sector, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations
said yesterday.
The council published a survey in which more than half the charities
questioned listed better management as their most pressing concern.
The survey results were issued on the eve of the launch of a three-year
campaign aimed at increasing public awareness of charities. The Charities
for Change campaign, co-ordinated by the council, comes as the government
has been trying to encourage charities to take over services from the public
sector.
A trend towards greater involvement by the voluntary sector in the provision
of services is likely to continue whoever forms the next government, but
charity directors are concerned that they lack the resources to cope with
growing demands.
The campaign aims to raise Pounds 1.5m to help promote improved efficiency
and effectiveness through better training and other initiatives.
Many voluntary organisations have been affected by cuts in public funding in
the past two years.
Seventy-seven per cent of charities surveyed believed council funding would
remain static or decline in the next financial year, and 64 per cent said
the same about government funding. The survey shows that 20 per cent of
charities expect to have to reduce their services next year, while a third
believe they will be able to improve them. Constraints on public-sector
finance are making the sector increasingly active in the search for private
corporate support.
In an effort to make potential donors more aware of the importance of
Britain's voluntary sector the campaign will emphasise the scale of its
activities, point-ing out that it provides 10 per cent of all state-assisted
training.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Union leaders accept freeze in pay at foundries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS of 10,000 workers employed by foundry companies and appliance
manufacturers have agreed to a six-month pay freeze in a move which has
implications for many other engineering employers.
It is one of the first freezes to be agreed by workers whose pay rises are
covered by a national multi-company agreement.
Since the collapse three years ago of a national agreement covering
mainstream engineering workers, many employers in the sector have used the
rises agreed by foundry and appliance companies as a guide in their own
negotiations.
Under a deal due to be signed today, unions including the AEU engineering
workers and the National Metal Trades Federation have agreed that minimum
time-rates will be frozen for six months from January 1, the traditional
settlement date, and will rise by 3.6 per cent from July.
The federation had originally proposed a freeze for the full year. Pay
freezes have become increasingly common in Britain during the recession,
particularly among manufacturers, but they remain rare in industry-wide
negotiations.
Among other sectors which retain national bargaining, print employers this
year abandoned plans for a pay freeze. Footwear employers are still seeking
a three-month pay freeze from March 1 followed by a 3.75 per cent rise from
June. That proposed deal has been rejected by employees, however.
In the NMTF negotiations, minimum time-rates are the lowest that can be paid
by the federation's members. The rate rises are traditionally used by
companies and unions as a benchmark for rises that are negotiated at company
level. They also have an effect on overtime and shift premiums.
In pressing for the freeze the federation told unions that its 50 member
companies did not expect any 'meaningful' recovery in business conditions
this year.
Last year's settlement, which took effect in January last year, was for 6.7
per cent and led to the minimum time-rate rising to Pounds 139 a week by
last June. That agreement included provision for a two-hour reduction in the
39-hour week by August this year.
This year the federation rejected union calls for a further reduction in the
working week and for an increase in the holiday provision of 33 days.
Mr Nigel Harris, an AEU executive councillor, said he was unhappy with the
outcome of the negotiations.

FT  24 MAR 92 / EOC opposes Tory shake-up plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission is opposing government plans to shift
responsibility for overseeing its work from the Home Office to the
Department of Employment.
The move was announced last week in the Conservative manifesto as part of a
shake-up of government departments.
The manifesto said the Department of Employment would take 'lead
responsibility for co-ordinating government policy on issues of particular
concern to women'.
The EOC, which is funded by the government, has written to Mr John Major,
the prime minister, saying it has reservations about the move and that it
wants talks about any changes. The manifesto announcement surprised the EOC,
which said there had been no consultation on the issue.
Ms Margaret Prosser, an EOC commissioner and an officer of the TGWU general
workers' union, said the proposed move to the Department of Employment would
be 'likely to make it difficult for the commission to function properly'.
The EOC needed to be in a central policy department, she said. There were
also fears that the Department of Employment could be 'seriously downgraded'
if the Conservatives won the election.
There is stronger logic in the Home Office retaining responsibility for the
EOC, according to the commission, because sex equality is an issue of
'social justice'.
The EOC also stressed that supervision by the Department of Employment would
be too narrow because the EOC covered education, health, housing, training,
consumer rights and service delivery as well as employment.
The EOC has criticised the Labour manifesto proposals for a ministry for
women, with a women's minister in the cabinet. This 'could be seen as
running counter to equality of opportunity for both sexes', the commission
commented.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Rate of business failures slower in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of business failures in the UK slowed slightly in the first quarter
of this year, according to figures published yesterday by Trade Indemnity, a
leading independent credit insurance group.
It says business failures in the first quarter of this year will total about
1,985, an increase of 5 per cent on the fourth quarter of last year.
It is much slower than the increase in the corresponding period last year,
when business failures were up 84 per cent on the previous quarter. The peak
number of failures in a single quarter was last summer, since when quarterly
failure seems to have been on a plateau.
The 5 per cent increase for this year is encouraging because the first
quarter tends to have the highest number of business failures as companies
are hit by a slack market after Christmas and other seasonal problems,
including tax demands. In 1990 and last year, the first-quarter increase
over the previous quarter was 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.
The figures cover all business failures in the UK, other than those of
private individuals.
Trade Indemnity accompanied the figures with a warning that bad debts and
business failures this year are likely to remain at high levels.
Mr Clive Brand, senior economist at Trade Indemnity, said the slight upturn
was encouraging, but he still thought that business failures in the UK this
year would be at about the same level as last year.
Mr Brand said he did not expect much of an improvement next year. 'With the
uncertain economic situation, present levels of gearing and high level of
real interest rates, the severe financial pressures currently impacting on
the corporate sector will remain apparent until well into next year,' he
said.

FT  24 MAR 92 / The Kinnock factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This election was supposed to be about rubbishing Mr Neil Kinnock, to the
advantage of the Conservatives. It is turning out to be about Mr John Major,
and so far the Tories are not the beneficiaries.
The theory was that the country would never accept Mr Kinnock. Most members
of the cabinet have at one time or another suggested, in public or in
private, that the leader of the opposition is a garrulous economic
illiterate whose principles are dictated by opinion polls and whose general
demeanour varies between that of jester and bully-boy.
The government's campaign strategy has been constructed around this
characterisation. It is intended to be reinforced in the voters' minds by
contrasting it with the optimum representation of Mr Major - as a man of the
people who understands economics, sticks to his principles, is serious,
straightforward, and not Welsh.
That is why the prime minister personifies the campaign. His face dominates
the Tory manifesto. His boyhood reminiscences fill the TV screens. His
parents' treatment by the National Health Service informs every argument
about the NHS. His brief spell of youthful unemployment is never allowed to
be forgotten. The early-morning press conferences centre on the answers
given by this decent man with the ready smile. The subliminal message is
plain: would you exchange honest John for untrustworthy Neil?
Unfortunately for the Conservatives, Labour has not followed the
government's script. The plan was that Mr Major's plain visage would be set
against the uncontrolled smirking and loud presence of Mr Kinnock. It has
not happened yet. With a deviousness typical of your average socialist
fiend, the Labour leader has spoiled the game. He has declined to play. Mr
Kinnock's face is not on the Labour manifesto. His presence on TV is
carefully controlled by members of his staff. When he appears he is soberly
dressed. His face is not awry: it bears the self-confident expression of a
man who believes he is winning. Mr Kinnock is an actor; he projects himself,
for better or worse, according to the tastes of the audience as he sees it.
He is shown where it suits his managers' purposes, when it is of help to his
party, speaking to issues long planned to be raised on a particular day,
against the most propitious of backgrounds, always to Labour's best
advantage. What a cheat] The man has probably fought general elections
before.
Mr Major has not. Yet in personal terms he is still well ahead of Mr Kinnock
in the opinion polls. He is better-liked, and more trusted. His scores on
most aspects of political popularity have fallen since the end of the Gulf
war, but if the two of them were running for president Mr Kinnock would come
nowhere.
The difficulty for the Conservatives is that Mr Major is running for
president against a Labour party that is running for parliamentary control
and a Labour leader who is running for prime minister. Mr Kinnock will not
stand still to be compared with Mr Major. He and his colleagues know who
would win such a contest.
The perverse consequence is that the eye of criticism is falling on the
prime minister. Mr Kinnock has had many years in which to unite his party
around an agreed strategy and programme. There are, to be sure, incorrigible
leftists lurking in Labour's ranks, but they are under restraint. Mr Major
is still having to judge every move against his need to hold the Tories
together. The bitterness of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's supporters has not been
entirely assuaged. That explains the complicated Thatcherite but caring,
free-market yet interventionist, pro-European/anti-Brussels message of the
Conservative manifesto.
Labour can afford to laugh off the lapses of hopeless junkies of 1960s
orthodoxies like Mr Roy Hattersley (although not for much longer); the
Tories are embarrassed even when they show unity-in-desperation by bringing
Mrs Thatcher into the fray. Every glitch in the Conservative campaign is
blamed on Mr Major; Labour's serious foot-faults are yet to come. The prime
minister's strategic sense in choosing the election date will be put to the
test on April 9. His tactical instincts are being questioned, not least by
his own side, right now.
If the polls turn decisively in the government's favour the questions will
vanish; if not the list will lengthen. There is no obvious way out. When the
election was announced Mr Kinnock challenged Mr Major to a TV debate. The
prime minister demurred, saying only losers accepted such invitations. Thus
he left himself no possibility of changing his mind. That was a mistake.
Now Mr Kinnock's appearances are entirely in his own hands. The Tories may
be tempted to run an advertising campaign aimed crudely and directly at his
many changes of mind and his past leftwing views. The effect of that could
not be guaranteed. Mr Kinnock may trip himself up - he has done so before -
but it is on that slender expectation alone that the 'rubbish Kinnock'
strategy depends.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago Nicholas Edwards, as Welsh secretary, appointed John Elfed
Jones as chairman of the Welsh Water Authority. Edwards, now Lord
Crickhowell, moved on to be chairman of the National Rivers Authority and
Jones became chairman of the privatised company.
Their paths have crossed again. The rivers authority has suggested that
water from Wales should be piped to help relieve the drought over the
border. Water is an emotive subject in Wales. Birmingham and Liverpool, and
other parts of England already get a large part of their supplies from Welsh
dams - free. The Welsh have always said England should pay for it.
Now Jones has told his erstwhile boss that the government ban on Wales
earning what it can from one of the few commodities it has in abundance has
cost the country Pounds 50m over the years. Pay for it or look elsewhere for
your water, he has said.
All of which is manna to the Liberal Democrats. 'If Welsh Water is taken, it
will be the end of the Tories in Wales,' says Richard Livsey, Liberal
Democrat MP for Brecon and Radnor.

Opinion polls can be wrong, as the French have just discovered. The polls
forecast a turnout between 50 per cent and 55 per cent in the regional
elections on Sunday. The actual turn-out was 68.7 per cent, which may have
had a significant influence on the result.
British polls seldom bother with the turnout figure, but it may be worth
watching and even betting on. When Edward Heath and the Tories won a
surprise victory in 1970, it was 72 per cent - the lowest since 1945. When
Labour crept back in the February 1974 election, it was 78.1 per cent - the
highest since 1959.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The group of pro-Labour scientists who wrote to The Times yesterday were
stretching a point. 'Between 1974 and 1979,' they said, 'British scientists
won six Nobel prizes. In 1980-85 the number dropped to four, and for 1986-91
there was just one British laureate.'
About the long-term trend, they may well be right, but there is a time lag
in these matters and it is surely pushing it a bit to claim the number of
prizes between 1974-79 as a triumph for the Labour government of that
period.
Most Nobel prizes are based on research done five to 20 years previously,
though the interval between a discovery and its recognition by the Nobel
committee varies enormously.
Cesar Milstein of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge
discovered monoclonal antibodies - a key development in molecular biology -
in 1976 and won a Nobel Prize in 1984, which was fast by Nobel standards.
On the other hand, Peyton Rous discovered in 1911 that viruses can cause
cancer. He won the prize in 1966. Perhaps the scientists who did their best
work in the Thatcher period will get their reward by the millennium.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Margaret Thatcher's speech with John Major on Sunday is regarded as having
done the Tories proud. But will the same be said of her trip today to
Scotland?
Thatcher is still anathema to most Scots. Indeed, some people say that her
government bears heavy responsibility for pushing Scotland towards
devolution or separatism.
There is little evidence that anyone in the Scottish Tory party actually
wanted her to campaign in Scotland; it appears that she offered to go and
nobody was able to dissuade her.
That she will be supporting Michael Forsyth in his Stirling constituency is
no surprise: he was the most Thatcherite of the Scottish Office team and her
great ally.
He has, however, publicly accepted many tenets of Majorism since then, and
last year produced a pamphlet called 'A country at ease with itself'.
The constituents of both Forsyth and Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North which
Thatcher is also visiting, know the Thatcherite feelings of their MPs.
One wonders, however, about the people of Edinburgh West, a further port of
call, where the MP is Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, another Scottish Office
minister.
Lord James is the most popular member of the Scottish Office team. Very
little dirt from the Thatcherite period has stuck to him, partly because he
was given few controversial things to do and partly because everyone could
see that, as well as being an Oxford boxing blue, he was such a nice man.
With a majority of only 1,234, it could be that the less he has to do with
the former prime minister the better.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown offers farmers a carrot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'substantial programme' to ease the difficulties caused by the fall in
farmers' incomes was advocated yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, when he toured some of his party's most fertile electoral
ground in mid Wales.
He said in Montgomery that the programme should be funded from money
currently used to raise agricultural production.
Mr Ashdown charged the Labour party with not being interested in
agriculture, and accused the Conservatives of having forgotten the farmers.
'They have turned their back on you,' he said.
He reaffirmed his party's commitment to the small family farm. They formed
the 'backbone' of the industry and should not be left to the cold winds of
the free market. But he warned: 'Farming will have to move back into balance
with the market over a period of time.' He also called for more
environmental management schemes which would pay farmers for preserving the
countryside.
Mr Ashdown, interviewed on BBC television's Panorama last night, said his
party was 'not prepared to give' on its pledge to increase education
spending by Pounds 2bn if it were involved in negotiations with either
Labour or Tories in a hung parliament.
Earlier he had insisted that the increase in spending - financed by 1p on
the basic rate of income tax - would be the 'number one priority' of his
party in any coalition negotiations.
Questioned by students in Brecon, Mr Ashdown said part of the extra spending
on education would be devoted to the reintroduction of student grants and
the abolition of student loans.
At the same time he stressed that the Liberal Democrats were not committed
to restoring student grants to their 1979 level.
Mr Ashdown's whirlwind election campaign tour is to include a visit to
northern France on Sunday, party officials said last night. The visit is
intended to underline the Liberal Democrats' pro-European credentials.

The survey, for Yorkshire Television, revealed the most urgent issue in the
campaign, according to those interviewed, was the National Health Service,
followed by education then jobs. Taxes and the poll tax were low priorities.
Mori interviewed 1,059 adults.

MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, last night signalled his
determination to take a tough stance in negotiations on European Community
finances if the Conservatives are re-elected, Ralph Atkins writes.
Tories knew 'how to get the best terms for Britain', he said in a speech at
Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.
The Conservatives were 'committed but not uncritical' of the EC. Europe
would prosper through widening opportunities for individual citizens and
businesses, he added.
Mr Hurd deliberately focused his speech to attack what he described as
Labour's 'amazing contradictions and confusions' over Europe.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour to seize fiscal initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR strategists are increasingly convinced that the Conservatives'
attacks on its tax policies have backfired on the government, offering them
a rare opportunity to go on the offensive over fiscal policy.
Mr Neil Kinnock yesterday seized on the prime minister's remarks on the tax
burden at his morning news conference to claim that Mr John Major had all
but confirmed longstanding charges that the Tories' have a secret agenda to
increase value added tax.
'The VAT cat is now well and truly out of the bag. It is clear John Major is
backtracking on what he said only a couple of weeks ago,' said Mr Kinnock.
'I am not surprised. It has always been clear that if they were re-elected
the Conservatives would have to raise VAT.'
That theme was taken up by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, in a speech
in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, last night. He said the Conservatives were now
'hunting for scapegoats' to justify the poor state of the economy in
negative campaigning that was making little impact on the electorate.
Turning round an old Tory charge against Labour, he said to resounding
applause: 'The British economy is not safe in their hands.'
The buoyant mood in the Labour camp was fuelled by a report in The Guardian
yesterday claiming that the government had breached longstanding convention
by allowing current government outgoings to exceed the amount that the
Treasury receives in taxation.
The report provoked a call from Mr Kinnock for the resignation of Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, and a flurry of attacks from shadow ministers.
In an open letter to the prime minister, Mr Smith argued that increases in
National Insurance contributions from 6.5 per cent to 9 per cent and VAT
from 8 per cent to 17 per cent showed that 'the Tories are the party of high
taxation'.
He added: 'It is the Labour party - as my Budget demonstrated conclusively
last week - that will reduce the burden of taxation on the ordinary taxpayer
and in the process make eight out of 10 families in Britain better off.'
Heartened by the weekend's opinion poll figures, Labour is now expected to
shift its attack to allegations of deteriorating public-sector services.
The main thrust of Labour's strategy will be gradually to move the campaign
towards its key 'winning' issues of education and the National Health
Service.
While senior party officials are aware that the Conservatives will
relentlessly press their charges of a hidden Labour 'tax bombshell', they
believe that the raising yesterday of the government's record on the tax
burden has supplied them with valuable ammunition to use the VAT card to
counter such claims.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major attacks move to 'industrial euthanasia'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, DAVID OWEN and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night widened his assault on Labour's prospectus for the
1990s by calling the party's proposals for trade union legislation
'industrial euthanasia'.
The prime minister also used his speech at a rally in Sheffield to reiterate
the wish for a 'classless society' which he expressed when he became Tory
leader in November 1990.
Labour, Mr Major said, would allow secondary strikes, prevent employers from
obtaining immediate court orders to stop unlawful strikes and take away from
individual union members the right not to take part in industrial action.
Labour would stop economic recovery in its tracks.
By contrast the Tories would ensure that unions gave at least a week's
notice of a strike and give the public new rights against the disruption of
public services by illegal wildcat strikes. Legislation to introduce this
would be in the first session of a new parliament.
Mr Major - speaking to 1,000 Tories from the Yorkshire area - - attacked Mr
Neil Kinnock's remarks yesterday committing Labour to reintroducing credit
controls.
The Labour leader said his party planned to use credit controls in addition
to interest rates to staunch price rises. Housebuyers would rather wait 'a
month or two' for loans than pay penal interest rates, Mr Kinnock suggested.
He said he would use temporary controls if borrowing looked set to rise
unacceptably.
Mr Major said Mr Kinnock's policy was a typical socialist answer. 'Form a
queue. Wait for the state to tell you when you can buy a home,' said Mr
Major. 'Wait for the state to tell you when you can sell your house to
someone who wants to buy it.'
The credit-control plans were also attacked by Mr Michael Heseltine,
environment secretary. He said: 'We have always said . . . that mortgages
under Labour would be more expensive. Now you are going to have to queue for
them as well.'
Mr Heseltine predicted that monthly mortgage payments would rise by an
average of between Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 under Labour, because higher
interest rates would be needed to protect the pound.
Mr Heseltine lambasted Mr Kinnock's 'economic illiteracy', saying it was
'utterly incredible that a delay of a month or two' could affect the level
of interest rates. 'How does he prevent foreign companies lending money
across the exchanges unless Labour is also threatening to reintroduce
exchange controls?'
Mr Heseltine promised a nationwide rents-to-mortgages scheme which would
enable 1.5m local authority tenants to convert their present rent into a
mortgage payment.
Mr Major, in his speech, also claimed Conservatism rather than socialism was
the way of breaking down social barriers. He highlighted his vision of 'a
country in which everyone is able to develop their talent to the full. Our
modern Tory party is for each and every person in Britain. We want to banish
for ever the artificial divisions in our society.'

<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont's appearance in Birmingham to launch the Conservatives'
campaign there confirmed him as one of nature's less lucky politicians.
He came to Birmingham to attack Labour's tax plans and publicise the goodies
for the car industry in his recent Budget. The start of his day was hardly
auspicious. Mr Lamont faced only a handful of journalists at Tory
headquarters in suburban Edgbaston.
The chancellor's later photo-opportunities were similarly low-key. 'Ask
about our redundancy protection schemes,' screamed a poster in a Rover
dealership where he had gone to present the keys of a new Rover 420GSA to
its owner. The purchaser failed to turn up. Instead Mr Kelvin Dignam, aged
65, was the surprise recipient of the chancellor's attentions when he
arrived to pick up his rather less glossy model.
'Here's the key. Open the box,' enthused Mr Lamont. 'Are you giving me this
car?' asked a surprised Mr Dignam, who had refused to say whether he would
vote Tory 'in the light of current events'.
Mr Lamont's day improved at lunchtime, where he met sympathetic businessmen.
But here too, his fortunes were mixed. Journalists pressed him to explain
whether the government really was breaking a 'golden rule' of fiscal probity
by borrowing to finance current expenditure.
'I have never accepted any golden rules about the PSBR,' Mr Lamont
complained. This was true. British fiscal policy has no such rule. But the
surrounding news sleuths were left wondering: 'Why not?'

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Golden rule hidden by statistical jungle /
Examining whether government borrowing has exceeded investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW yesterday over the consequences of a shortfall in tax revenues
highlights the fact that the recession and its aftermath will cast a shadow
over Britain's public spending plans for the next few years.
The new government will find itself boxed in by likely shortfalls in tax
revenues and the large increases in spending already set in train both by
the effects of recession and by decisions by the Conservatives over the past
two years.
These hard facts of financial life will impede the ability of whoever takes
office from pushing through tax cuts or raising spending significantly on
popular public-sector areas such as education and health.
At the same time, picking out what has happened in public spending in the 13
years of Conservative government is made hazardous by competing statistical
definitions - especially in the tricky area of public-sector investment.
According to the Treasury, receipts from sources such as taxation in the
financial year beginning on April 1 will be limited by weak economic
activity to Pounds 230bn, just Pounds 8bn above the figure for 1991-92.
Meanwhile, government spending will climb to Pounds 258bn, a Pounds 22bn
jump from 1990-91.
That will mean a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn in
1992-93, about twice this year's likely figure, followed by a PSBR of Pounds
32bn in 1993-94. On the Treasury's arithmetic, the deficit will fall as
economic growth picks up, to Pounds 25bn in 1994-95, Pounds 19bn in 1995-96
and Pounds 6bn in 1996-97.
While these figures are large enough to have unsettled financial markets in
the past two weeks, Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers,
has made his own calculations which point to still gloomier conclusions.
He believes that over the next few years government f what the Treasury is
expecting, due to relatively modest growth in overall economic activity.
Assuming no new increases in public spending programmes - which Mr Saunders
admits is open to question - the PSBR will rise on his calculations to
Pounds 38bn in both 1993-94 and 1994-95, before coming down to Pounds 35bn
in 1995-96 and Pounds 28bn in 1996-97.
While the Conservatives can come up with statistics that suggest a fairly
constant level of public-sector investment spending in the 1980s, Labour and
the Liberal Democrats both accuse the Tories of presiding over a
deterioration of the infrastructure.
However, discussion is hindered by a welter of different definitions.
Depending on which is chosen, capital spending can be taken to be between
about 5 per cent and 15 per cent of total public spending, the rest being
current expenditure, mainly salaries.
The broadest way of looking at public-sector investment is to use what the
Treasury defines as public-sector asset creation (PSAC).
This comprises gross spending on fixed assets by all government bodies
including nationalised industries, but not counting privatisation proceeds
which under normal government rules are considered as negative spending,
capital grants by the public sector, and some items of defence spending such
as tanks and missiles which under conventional UK government accounting
standards count as current spending.
According to the PSAC definition, capital spending by the government in the
1980s, excluding nationalised industries which have since been privatised,
has stayed about constant at just under Pounds 30bn a year in 1990-91
prices. In 1991-92, according to the Treasury, PSAC is likely to be Pounds
28.6bn, about in line with next year's expected PSBR. That would keep the UK
in line with the 'golden rule' in some countries' fiscal accounting which
says that the amount the government borrows over a set period should not
exceed the amount it invests.
On other definitions of public spending investment - and the Treasury uses
no fewer than three others - Britain's position on public-sector spending
looks considerably worse. These definitions lead to more of the public
spending bill being classed as current spending, with the capital figure
being depressed.
Applying the Treasury definition for investment which is used in most UK
government spending calculations, the UK public sector may be in danger for
the first time since records began in the 1960s of running a financial
deficit on current spending.
The current balance is calculated as the difference between current revenue,
excluding capital taxes from public sector revenue, and current public
spending leaving aside capital spending. This would mean the UK might be
about to borrow to finance consumption, violating the 'golden rule' and
shifting the public sector accounts into a difficult period.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lamont rejects criticisms of borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday rejected suggestions that the
government was borrowing to fi-nance current expenditure and would have to
raise taxes if re-elected.
He said that a report to this effect in The Guardian yesterday was 'complete
nonsense'. Mr Lamont said government spending plans for the coming year
envisaged investment of Pounds 30bn when defined as public-sector asset
creation. This, he said, was larger than the Pounds 28bn that the government
said in its Budget that it would borrow in 1992-93.
Speaking on a visit to Birmingham Mr Lamont insisted that the public sector
borrowing requirement, which the government expects will grow further to
Pounds 32bn in 1993-94, would start to decline after the economy had begun
to recover. The present large PSBR reflected the impact of reduced economic
activity on tax revenues.
He predicted that tax revenues would 'turn round' when the economy recovered
and that public finances would move back towards balance. Britain's
financial position was strong and the tax regime was 'perfectly
sustainable', he added.
Mr Lamont was in Birmingham to launch his party's campaign in the West
Midlands by attacking Labour's taxation plans. Labour would increase the
income tax burden and National Insurance contributions of the more highly
paid members of the car-buying public, while Tory tax benefits in the Budget
would help the car industry.
However, the doubts that surfaced yesterday about the government's finances
clouded the chancellor's message.

MR NEIL KINNOCK pressed home Labour's claim to be the party of exports and
industry by using a whistlestop visit to the Midlands to launch a
'manufacturing manifesto'.
The 'Made In Britain' presentation in Birmingham - Labour's first big
election news conference outside London - was timed to coincide with
publication of the latest trade figures, which showed that Britain recorded
a deficit of Pounds 750m last month.
In what is expected to be the party's last initiative on the economy before
a shift to its public services' agenda today, Mr Kinnock argued that tax
breaks for investment alongside training and employment schemes would
'stimulate activity and build confidence'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, unveiled a modest three-point
programme of additional steps to flesh out Labour's Pounds 1.1bn industrial
recovery programme. The measures included grant aid for engineering
investment, an 'Inventions in Britain' project to help small companies bring
innovations to production, and regionally based export advice centres.
Mr Kinnock described the trade figures as 'quite dreadful . . . What is
really concerning about them is that we have got an economy which is at best
flat and possibly still slipping backwards. The government should have taken
action recommended by the Labour party a long time ago to get an
investment-led recovery.'
Earlier, asked how he would control inflation, Mr Kinnock said that
constraints imposed by membership of the ERM, supply-side measures and
credit controls would prove adequate to contain price rises. He rejected
suggestions that a minimum wage would lead to escalating pay claims.
Contrasting his policies with the Conservatives, Mr Kinnock said that a
Labour administration would make economic growth a higher priority than
achieving a zero inflation rate. Labour would be satisfied by a rate of
price rises paralleling the average of those prevalent in the European
Community.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher recalls past triumphs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET Thatcher spent more than an hour last night recalling the
virtues of her premiership - one of which she said was to have achieved a
budget surplus during the four final years.
Speaking to the party faithful in Knutsford, south of Manchester, Mrs
Thatcher reaffirmed her commitment to sound finances, balanced budgets and
the repayment of national debt.
Her statements sat uncomfortably alongside the continuing controversy over
Mr John Major's planned public sector borrowing requirement for next year of
Pounds 28bn.
Her message - although not apparently designed to embarrass her successor as
prime minister - was nonetheless applicable to both main parties.
It was very easy, she said, for governments to borrow money - but all
political promises had to be paid for. Every family, every company and every
country should live within its means. The alternative was to borrow, with
all the implications that had for interest rates and the development of
industry.
Thatcherism had rolled back the socialist commitment to spend, spend, spend,
its originator claimed.
She jousted with or slayed other familiar dragons along the way. Mr Jacques
Delors, General Galtieri, President Saddam Hussein, trade unions, and world
communism were past or continuing targets. The character of the British
people, freedom of choice, personal responsibility and Mr Ronald Reagan were
hailed as ideals worthy of emulation. 'Britain still has something to
achieve in teaching other nations,' she concluded.
Her audience was enthusiastic was not ecstatic. There was perhaps just a bit
too much history, not enough about the present battle; more than a touch of
yesterday's woman.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Uncertain start forces Tories to change tack
 -John Major's switch to a more strident style is a gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has had a rough start to what may prove the pivotal week of
the campaign. The strategy shaped around him has looked uncertain and
defensive. The prime minister has discovered that rousing receptions from
the party faithful cannot insulate him from the bruising exchanges with the
media which inevitably follow a Labour opinion poll lead.
There are two roles for a leader during an election: the first is to fire
the enthusiasm of supporters; the second to win the votes of the
uncommitted. Just 10 days into the campaign, Mr Major has swerved in an
attempt to do both.
For months, the senior members of Mr Major's campaign team have been pumping
out a single message. The Conservatives would defy economic gravity and win
an election in the depths of a recession because the voters liked and
trusted the prime minister and feared Labour's tax plans.
Mr Major would harness the mood for change in the country to the
Conservative cause - robbing Mr Neil Kinnock of one of his most precious
assets during Mrs Thatcher's leadership. The voters would opt for Mr Major's
caring Conservatism rather than Mr Kinnock's wallet-threatening socialism.
The opinion polls still carry the message that the prime minister is one of
his party's strongest assets. Voters who blame the government for the
recession, decry the poll tax and worry about the National Health Service
still speak of 'that nice Mr Major'.
His popularity, though well below the levels achieved during the Gulf war,
has remained consistently above that of Mr Kinnock. The latest NOP poll puts
the prime minister's personal-approval rating at 53 per cent, 20 points
clear of the Labour leader. The contrast with his predecessor could not be
starker. Mrs Thatcher won elections almost in spite of herself. She was
adored by party activists and never greatly liked by voters. But her
outspoken clarity conveyed to enough of the electorate the message that her
policies were right.
Mr Chris Patten, party chairman, and the other senior ministers in charge of
mapping out the campaign, were convinced that the prime minister should play
to his different strengths. He would stand above the fray, while the likes
of Mr Michael Heseltine destroyed the Opposition's prospectus. But Mr John
Smith's shadow Budget undercut the ground on tax. Senior ministers realised
that if they could not begin to climb back this week the election might be
lost before the votes were cast.
The result has been an abrupt change in tactics. Almost overnight, the prime
minister who offered a soft-focus vision in which wealth creation and
welfare went hand-in-hand has embraced the harsher language of Thatcherism
in an all-out drive to discredit the Labour party.
Party strategists acknowledge two serious mistakes in the earlier approach.
The first was to forget the simple fact that, during a campaign, about two
thirds of the images that a party conveys to the voters are channelled
through its leader. So, if Mr Major was excluded from the assault on
Labour's tax plans, the Conservatives would be denying themselves their most
important link with the electorate on what they regard as the most important
issue of the campaign. The second error was a calculation that Mr Smith's
shadow Budget could be attacked on its own terms. When he did enter the
fray, the prime minister who had advocated a classless society emerged as
the champion of the middle classes.
That has now changed. Mr Major has been at the centre of the battle since
the weekend and the focus of the attack on Labour's tax policies has been
recalibrated to underline the 'threat' to the incomes of the skilled working
classes - the C2s at the centre of the election battle.
The shift has pleased the party faithful. Their message to Central Office
during the opening days of the campaign was that they wanted a more vigorous
defence of the party's record in government. But Mr Major's colleagues
acknowledge that it is far less clear how the shift will be greeted. Some
candidates are already reporting complaints from voters attracted by his
less partisan approach.
The new approach has brought another set of problems. Mr Major,
inexperienced in election campaigns and lacking the combative rhetorical
style of his predecessors, insisted on the switch. But he has sometimes
looked ill at ease. Television images of his vituperative attacks on Mr
Kinnock have jarred. He has been caught off-guard when journalists have
probed the negative campaigning and have pressed him to differentiate his
policies from those of his predecessor.
Party strategists insist that both Mr Major and his campaign are now
settling into a more comfortable rhythm. But they have lost more than a week
of the campaign. If they do not regain the ground, Mr Major risks becoming
one the most popular prime ministers to lose an election.

THE decision to play the first ever World Cup soccer game indoors was taken
yesterday when Fifa, the sport's governing body, announced that the
Silverdome stadium near Detroit, Michigan, would be one of nine locations
for the 1994 tournament.
The Silverdome, normally home to the Detroit Lions American football team,
will lay natural grass over its artificial turf for the 24-team tournament,
which is due to be played across the US between June 17 and July 17 1994.
Previously experts have doubted whether grass would survive in an indoor
stadium, but the Silverdome is confident grass will last for the two or
three weeks necessary.
There are expected to be few complications in preparing the other eight
sites chosen by Fifa. They are: Giants Stadium in New Jersey; Foxboro
Stadium near Boston; Soldier Field in Chicago; the Cotton Bowl in Dallas;
the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida; the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California;
Stanford Stadium near San Francisco; and RFK Stadium in Washington DC.
A decision on which site will host the final has not been taken, although
the Rose Bowl is hot favourite because of its 102,000 capacity and the
favourable climate in southern California. The choices were made after the
27 cities which bid for the games were pared down in October to 19. Among
those turned down were Atlanta, Denver, New Orleans, Philadelphia and Miami.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Brown shoots to wound opponent in Connecticut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHIGNTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE principal interest in today's US primary in Connecticut lies in the
extent to which Mr Jerry Brown can shoot holes below the waterline of the
front-running Democratic party candidacy of Mr Bill Clinton.
Yesterday Mr Brown, former governor of California, described Mr Clinton, the
governor of Arkansas, as the 'greatest bluffer to enter American politics in
my lifetime'. He said: 'I think it would be an alarming situation if the
spin doctors of Bill Clinton were able to adopt a Politburo-type,
one-candidate strategy for the Democrats.'
At the weekend, he said his opponent was unelectable, morally irresponsible,
insensitive on racial issues, an abuser of the public trust, and incapable
even of running a campaign without recourse to deficits. The Connecticut
contest, for 53 convention delegates, is pretty much a straight fight
between Mr Clinton and Mr Brown, though the name of Mr Paul Tsongas, who
withdrew from the race last week, remains on the ballot. It is also seen as
a preview of what could be a bitter contest in New York two weeks later.
Mr Brown has ruthlessly exploited every allegation and half-charge against
Mr Clinton. Yesterday the Los Angeles Times reported that, as governor, Mr
Clinton had lobbied his local legislature to approve a state bond contract
to a company headed by a man who later pleaded guilty to cocaine charges. Mr
Clinton then granted him a pardon after he had served time in prison.
On Sunday, the Washington Post had reported about the relationship between
the governor and the head of Tyson's Food, a big Arkansas poultry producer,
including Mr Clinton's use of a corporate aircraft on state business.
As before, Mr Clinton issued careful rebuttals. He said the pardon had
followed the unanimous recommendation of the state parole board and he had,
in any case, pursued a policy of spreading state bond business among more
companies so as to avoid favouritism. On the second question, he said
Arkansas could not afford an aircraft for gubernatorial use and he saw
nothing wrong in saving state money, especially as he had disclosed every
use of the facility.
But the mere existence of such reports is grist to the Brown mill. He has
also sought to exploit in speeches to black audiences the fact that Mr
Clinton played golf last week at a Little Rock country club which excludes
blacks from membership (Mr Clinton has apologised for doing so).
On the Republican side, President George Bush has faced no real active
campaigning in Connecticut from his challenger, Mr Pat Buchanan.
Reuter adds: An opinion poll by CNN/USA/Gallup found that Americans would
re-elect President Bush by a 52-to-43 per cent majority over Mr Clinton if
the November 3 presidential election were held now.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Citicorp chief optimistic on debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING international banker expressed optimism yesterday that an
agreement in principle could be signed within two weeks between commercial
banks and both Brazil and Argentina, Latin America's first and third most
indebted countries.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which heads the bank advisory
committees to both countries, said such agreements would mark a 'landmark'
in the 10-year debt crisis.
Argentine government officials were yesterday to make a new debt
restructuring proposal to banks in New York. Mr Rhodes's comments followed
weekend telephone conversations with Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine
economy minister. Brazil's chief debt negotiator, Mr Pedro Malan, said last
week he expected agreement in principle soon with banks.
'We are making good progress with both Brazil and Argentina. We could have
agreement with one or both governments by the Inter-American Development
Bank meeting,' Mr Rhodes said. The IADB holds its annual meeting in the
Dominican Republic on April 6 and 7.
'All parties - the governments, banks, the international financial
institutions and the G7 (Group of Seven) - now feel that the moment is
propitious to reach agreement,' he said.
Even if agreements in principle are quickly reached, final agreement will
take months. Both debt restructurings will take advantage of the Brady debt
reduction initiative in 1989 by Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary.
Banks are offered a variety of options, most of which involve exchanging
debt for new concessional bonds.
Argentina and Brazil appear likely to settle on a discount on the
concessional bonds of around 35 per cent, the level gained by Mexico two
years ago.

FT  24 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Secret Nafta draft shows big obstacles
remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SECRET composite draft of the proposed North American Free Trade
Agreement, leaked over the weekend in Washington and Mexico, suggests that
while some progress was made by the time of a high-level February 21 meeting
in Dallas, huge obstacles remain.
A spokesman for the US trade representative said the negotiators had made
more progress since the text was completed. Differences are expected to
narrow further in talks between top negotiators from the US, Canada and
Mexico and their technical advisers, meeting in Washington yesterday.
Release of the draft could undermine the stance of the negotiators, who have
conducted the talks in secrecy to avoid political controversy as long as
possible. Mexico has refused to reveal how well the treaty is going, where
agreement has been reached, and where differences lie. In Washington, Mrs
Carla Hills, US trade representative, has offered little detail, but last
week insisted the talks were moving faster than any multinational
negotiation she had ever seen.
The environmental groups, which released the text and who will have some
influence on whether or not it gets congressional approval, complained that
food safety, health and environment standards were similar to those
contained in the Uruguay Round draft, which they oppose. But as a concession
to them, the section on investment leaves open the possibility that
'language on the environment may be provided for this chapter.'
The draft showed no final agreement on areas such as agriculture, financial
services, treatment of foreign investment or rules of origin. Two sectors,
cars and energy, are omitted from the leaked documents. The US is pushing to
open petrol stations in Mexico to sell American petrol. Some 80 per cent of
the text contained brackets, but this is common until the end of most trade
negotiations.
The US and Mexico seemed near accord on textiles. Dates of quota expirations
are left blank, but the two agree to phase out customs duties and refrain
from new curbs. US officials have said a gap still exists between Canada and
the joint US-Mexican proposal. In other areas, the text revealed:
Mexico insists on full market access for its banks in Canada and the US,
while US and Canadian banks would have to have a commercial presence in
Mexico through licensed Mexican subsidiaries. In the past month, Mexico has
agreed to open its financial sector in 1995, slowly increasing foreign
market share to a maximum 15 per cent in 2002.
Mexico asks the right to adjustment programmes for its farmers without being
subject to countervailing duties. It says farm supports should be 'at most
minimally' trade distorting, and requests exemption from US sugar quotas.

FT  24 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US risking Round over services, says EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC, on the defensive over farm subsidies in the stalled Uruguay Round
trade talks, has accused the US of imperilling the talks by refusing to
apply multilateral trade rules to services, Frances Williams reports from
Geneva. EC officials said yesterday the US was seeking wide exemptions for
its services sectors from the basic fair trade principle that liberalisation
measures should apply without discrimination to all trading partners.
The US proposes it be exempted from most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment on
maritime transport, financial services, air transport and basic
telecommunications. Brussels says the four sectors make up perhaps
three-quarters of world services trade. The US stance may be seen as an
attempt to press the EC to compromise on deadlocked farm trade talks,
officials said.
US officials say that, excepting exemption for maritime transport, the
proposed derogations are negotiable and could be withdrawn if trading
partners make better offers to open their markets.
The US, EC and 40 other countries have indicated the sectors where they wish
to take MFN derogations. Exemption would allow nations to keep their markets
closed, or open only to partners with reciprocal arrangements. Main US
targets for market-opening are financial services of Japan and important
developing countries, basic telecoms markets in almost all trading partners,
and the EC audio-visual market. The services talks are due to finish this
month, ready for an Easter end to the Round - an increasingly unlikely
deadline.
The US could seek trade sanctions against the EC unless Brussels reforms the
way its subsidises oilseeds farmers or renegotiates trade concessions to the
US, Reuter reports from Brussels. A panel appointed by Gatt has criticised
the EC system of subsidising the producers. An extract from its report says
Gatt members should act against the EC if the US asks.

FT  24 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan's trade 'umpire' thrives on tension
 -FTC chief views corporate complacency as his worst enemy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DON'T be 'a Ness'. This advice was given to Mr Setsuo Umezawa, chairman of
Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC), whose pursuit of cartels and other
corporate foul play has led to comparisons with Elliot Ness, Al Capone's
crime-busting enemy.
Mr Umezawa savours the tension his commission has created among Japanese
companies, and explains that past responsibilities as a tax investigator and
as head of the National Tax Agency had taught him corporate complacency
could be his worst enemy. 'I remember just after the war, we tax officials
were told about the importance of tension, and those words have stayed with
me. There should always be a sort of tension between the investigator and
the investigated.'
The rise of Mr Umezawa, 61, was partly prompted by trade friction between
Tokyo and Washington, which argued that Japanese companies routinely set up
cartels and excluded outsiders from markets. But the chairman argues that US
pressure for a bigger FTC budget and a toughening of his investigation
division had impact, because the demands coincided with similar sentiments
within Japan.
'The US-Japan connection is important. We in Japan are a part of the world
economy and have to be in harmony with international standards. At the same
time, Japanese government policy is becoming more consumer-oriented.
Japanese industry was encouraged and the economy developed, but consumers
didn't feel they had benefited.'
Consumers may feel the wealth are yet to be fairly shared, but Japanese
companies have been startled by the determination of Mr Umezawa and his
investigators. In 1988, a year after he became chairman, the FTC launched
126 investigations and issued five cease-and-desist orders. Last year, there
were 155 new cases and 24 formal orders. The commission imposed Y11bn
(Pounds 48m) in surcharges last March on cement companies for price fixing.
Criminal charges were filed in November against plastic wrap makers and
their employees for fixing foodwrap prices. The eight companies, controlling
97 per cent of the Japanese market, admit they held meetings to discuss
market trends and plan price rises.
While the FTC has been accused by Japanese executives of working in
Washington's interests, US officials are not satisfied by the monitoring of
anti-monopoly laws and want the commission to tackle the keiretsu, the
Japanese corporate families. There are two main types: the vertical, where a
top industrial company has layers of contracted suppliers filling its orders
and of distributors selling its products, and the horizontal, where an
industrial group has extensive cross-shareholdings and management ties with
a family of companies.
Mr Umezawa insisted the keiretsu were not a violation of anti-monopoly laws.
He said a US study had shown the structure of Japanese car makers' keiretsu
was not founded on exclusion, but on efficiency. 'For some US people, the
word means monopoly. But the structure of the keiretsu is very different,
and corporate groups have loose ties. We have looked at the
manufacturer-type (the vertical) distribution, and we told car makers they
couldn't require retailers' prior consultation on selling other vehicles.'
That FTC instruction resulted in changes to contracts between maker and
retailer not long before President Bush's controversial trip to Japan, but
US manufacturers say that while the words are different, the spirit of the
exclusive relationship stays unchanged. Mr Umezawa is aware of the
criticism. 'We will survey actual conditions as well as contractual
clauses.'
He has just finished several weeks' talks with the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party on toughening fines for anti-monopoly violations, which the FTC
reportedly wanted to raise from the present maximum Y5m to Y300m.
Corporate executives had demanded the LDP intervene, and senior party
members began talks with the FTC. The result was a Y100m maximum fine, which
the US called insufficient, but which Mr Umezawa considers the result of
compromise needed to ensure the legislation would be considered by MPs. 'The
new fine is 20 times higher than the previous maximum, and we established an
important consensus about the need for tougher punishment.'

FT  24 MAR 92 / An angry church confronts a troubled state in Kenya: Recent
violence is feared to be related to official warnings of the danger of
multi-party politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURSTS of applause punctuating a passionate speech and ice-cream vendors
hovering on the edge of the crowd created the atmosphere of a political
rally.
In fact, angry church was confronting troubled state at Nairobi's Holy
Family Minor Basilica, where Sunday's huge congregation had spilled over
into the forecourt. Reading from a pastoral letter, the Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Nairobi, Cardinal Maurice Otunga challenged President Daniel
arap Moi's commitment to multi-party politics, and accused the government of
instigating the violence in western Kenya that has cost more than 60 lives
over the past three weeks.
The near-euphoria that greeted the repeal last December of the ban on
opposition parties has gone. In its place are growing doubts about Kenya's
capacity to manage the transition to democracy. Recent riots in Nairobi,
tribal clashes in the west, an economy in difficulties, and continuing aid
donor dissatisfaction with government policies are putting the 68-year-old
president and the ruling Kanu party under severe test.
Last year's expectations of an early general election have proved wishful
thinking. 'When he ended one-party rule,' says one critic, 'we weren't sure
whether he was being a Kaunda or a Mobutu' - distinguishing between the
former Zambian president's acceptance of defeat in a general election last
October, and President Sese Seko Mobutu's determination to cling to power in
Zaire.
'We are starting to think that he is a Mobutu,' he said.
President Moi's warnings that multi-party politics would lead only to
inter-tribal violence have started to look like a self-fulfilling prophecy,
designed to delay - perhaps indefinitely - an election Kanu seems
increasingly likely to lose.
The ban last week on political meetings - intended, says the government, to
stop the violence, not curb debate - fuelled suspicions. They are apparently
shared by the country's Roman Catholic bishops.
'Well-trained bandits,' the pastoral letter claimed, were responsible for
the killings in western Kenya, where members of the president's minority
Kalenjin clan have clashed with Luo and Luhya tribes.
The killings were 'part of a wider political strategy', claimed the bishops:
'The whole issue is officially presented to the public as a clear sign of
the failure of the multi-party system in this country.'
Yet even if the government could in this way stifle the opposition, economic
and political imperatives have caught President Moi in a squeeze.
The first set of pressures is external. Western assistance to Kenya is
vital, with the proportion of grants to gross domestic product rising from 1
per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent in 1990.
During the 1980s Kenya covered its USDollars 3bn accumulated budget deficit
with disbursements from the World Bank and bilateral donors. The same donors
turned this assistance into leverage last November, insisting at a meeting
in Paris that new aid would be conditional on faster implementation of
economic and political reforms.
The bind Mr Moi now finds himself in is that the economic measures expected
of him - such as trimming the overstaffed state bureaucracy and charging for
social services - will free held-up aid, but will count heavily against him
at the ballot box.
Meanwhile other internal economic pressures, coming on top of high
unemployment and weak prices for tea and coffee, the two leading exports,
are mounting. Poor rains have made it likely that Kenya must import 500,000
tonnes of maize this year. But strained relations with donors will make
concessional supplies difficult to obtain.
And the tourist trade, the largest foreign exchange earner, may be hit by
the international publicity given to recent attacks on tourists (albeit a
handful out of the 750,000 visitors each year).
The only way out, most western diplomats believe, is for Mr Moi to bite the
bullet and call an election: 'Only the president,' said one ambassador, 'can
set the positive tone for which the country cries out.'

FT  24 MAR 92 / UN says Iraq has destroyed Scud missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS ballistics inspectors in Iraq have confirmed that Iraq has
destroyed and buried a number of Scud missiles and other weapons which they
had failed to declare to the UN until late last week.
UN officials are also studying plans submitted by the Iraqis for the
destruction of manufacturing equipment related to its Scud missile programme
 -equipment Iraq had refused to destroy during a previous UN inspection.
However, UN officials said it was 'too early to tell' if Iraq was going to
hold good to its promise, made in a letter to the UN special commission
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction last Friday, to
make 'full, final and complete' disclosure of its weapons of mass destruct
ion.
A 35-strong team of inspectors reported finding evidence of destroyed
missiles in three sites. Mr Derek Boothby, the team leader, said his
investigators would visit several more sites in the next few days.
Iraq is believed to have declared the secret destruction of around 100 Scud
missiles. President Bush said that yesterday Iraq had moved in the right
direction towards complying with UN resolutions: 'I think our firmness has
now caused them to back down once again,' he told a television interviewer.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Japan's money growth slows again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID cooling of the Japanese economy was underscored yesterday when the
Bank of Japan reported that money supply growth in February fell to a record
low for the third month running as a result of weak credit demand from the
corporate sector.
Broad money - M2 plus certificates of deposit - rose by just 1.6 per cent
compared to February last year, reinforcing expectations that the official
discount rate (ODR) will be cut soon, perhaps this week, for the fourth time
since July. The ODR is now 4.5 per cent, compared to 6 per cent a year ago.
'This is a very good reason why they should cut interest rates sharply,
rather than just tinkering with 50 basis points,' said Mr Russell Jones,
economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Money supply growth, which was slower than the Bank expected, was pulled
down by weaker-than-expected corporate demand for funding, the Bank said.
Corporations are cutting capital investment and trying to reduce surging
inventories of unsold goods. Inventory adjustment, which is pulling down
industrial output, was expected to continue into the third quarter. The bank
appears to accept that the economy may not hit bottom in the second quarter,
as had been suggested earlier.
The severity of the industrial slowdown was highlighted by figures from the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association yesterday showing vehicle
production in February down 7.1 per cent to 1.06m units. Money supply growth
is now running well below the central bank's projections of 2-3 per cent
growth in the first quarter. This is unlikely to be met after January's 1.8
per cent growth rate.
'It (the money supply figure) reinforces the view that the Bank of Japan
needs to act quickly to reinforce credit expansion,' said Mr Kermit
Schoenholtz, economist at Salomon Brothers Asia. 'Credit is not expanding
rapidly enough to support sufficient economic growth in the months ahead.'
Moves by the central bank to stimulate the economy, however, will be
tempered by fears of reigniting inflation in asset prices. Broad money was
also reduced by a continuing shift of money into Postal Saving deposits,
which are outside the banking system. However, broad liquidity, which
includes the postal savings, also grew at a record low of 4.5 per cent.
Savers have been shifting money out of the banking system in order to lock
in high interest rates as they decline.
Broad money fell in February to Y500,500bn from Y507,000bn in January,
amounting to an annualised month-to-month decline of 6.3 per cent,
seasonally adjusted basis. M1, which includes cash and demand deposits,
expanded by 7.8 per cent compared to February 1991.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Hyundai founder's shadow looms over poll: Chung's party has
tapped fears for S Korea's economic miracle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chung Ju Yung, the founder and former chairman of Hyundai, the South
Korean conglomerate, is casting an imposing shadow over the country's
parliamentary elections, which take place today.
When Mr Chung formed his Unification National Party (UNP) in January,
government officials dismissed it as a quixotic attempt to challenge the
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) of President Roh Tae Woo.
But Mr Chung may now be able to help prevent the DLP getting a parliamentary
majority, with the UNP possibly holding the balance of power in the 299-seat
National Assembly.
The outcome of today's polling is uncertain, with 40 per cent of the voters
undecided on the eve of the election. The turnout is expected to be
relatively heavy at 77 per cent, which is expected to benefit the opposition
parties.
The DLP claims it is leading in 45 per cent of the constituencies, while the
main opposition Democratic Party says it will capture a third of the seats,
mainly in the south-eastern region of Cholla.
Mr Chung's UNP claims it will win at least 13 per cent of the electoral
districts. It has tapped middle-class fears that South Korea's economic
miracle may be waning as a result of the present government's policies. The
DLP now has two-thirds of the assembly seats, while the Democrats have 63.
Although the country achieved a growth rate of 8.6 per cent last year, it is
plagued by an inflation rate of 10 per cent and a soaring trade deficit of
Dollars 8.8bn (Pounds 5.08bn).
The implicit argument of the UNP is that South Korea will achieve its
economic salvation as long as the government does not interfere with the
chaebol, the powerful industrial conglomerates that include Mr Chung's
Hyundai.
The government has tried to streamline the chaebol's activities in an
attempt to increase competition in the domestic market. Measures so far
include a directive requiring the chaebol to restrict their control to three
core areas and to reduce or sell non-core operations.
Mr Chung is taking a gamble in challenging the government. The Chung family
has already been the subject of a tax evasion investigation and was forced
to pay Dollars 181m in back taxes and penalties last autumn.
They charge that the investigation was politically motivated. Hyundai
subsidiaries have since alleged that the government is trying to restrict
credit to them as a result of Mr Chung's political activities.
Mr Chung and the Hyundai group could face further retribution from the
government if the UNP fails to secure a firm parliamentary position. But
that threat appears to be receding as the UNP's campaign attracts voters.
The biggest casualty of the elections could be the presidential hopes of Mr
Kim Young Sam, the former opposition leader who merged his party with
President Roh in 1990 to give the government a parliamentary majority.
Mr Kim had been expected to be anointed as the DLP's candidate for the
presidential election in December. But a poor election showing by the DLP
could give his rivals in the party the chance to deny Mr Kim the nomination.
Mr Kim is heading the parliamentary campaign as the DLP's executive
chairman.
If the nomination goes to a rival - possibly Kim Jong Pil, another
opposition leader who joined the DLP in 1990, or Park Tae Joon, the leader
of President Roh's faction in the DLP - Mr Kim might pull out of the DLP.
This would leave the government with a minority of seats in the National
Assembly, even if it achieves a majority in today's voting.
Mr Kim's departure would also probably end the government's hopes of
creating a dominant political party that would guarantee stable one-party
rule like that of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party.
The spoiling tactics of Mr Chung may cause the government greater chaos than
even he would have dared believe.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Libya offers to hand agents to Arab League
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA has agreed to surrender the two alleged Lockerbie bombers to the Arab
League in an effort to head off United Nations sanctions. The two men would
then be put in UN custody, according to reports at the UN, although details
and timing of the handover were not clear last night.
The men are accused of masterminding the bombing of the Pan Am jet that
exploded over Lockerbie in Scotland in December 1988 with the loss of 270
lives.
Mr Diego Arria of Venezuela, the current president of the UN Security
Council, said the Libyan move was unconditional. Speaking of a two-stage
transfer, Mr Arria said the Arab League would give the men into the custody
of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.
But Libya's ambassador to the UN, Dr Ali Elhouderi, said only: 'A decision
was taken to hand over the accused to the Arab League; I don't have the rest
of the details.'
Asked if the men would eventually be tried by a court in the US or Scotland,
he said that Libya had provided assurances of its 'full co-operation and
flexibility'. He added that Mr Boutros Ghali would have an 'essential role'.
The UN secretary-general later issued a statement, making clear that the
handover of the two men must be in conformity with the UN resolution that
demanded the men's extradition for trial in the US or Britain.
There was some doubt last night that Libya might still be attempting
delaying tactics.
The International Court is expected to take up the case at Libya's request
in a preliminary session at The Hague this week and hearings could drag on
for weeks or months. Diplomats said last night the US, Britain and France
were unlikely to allow the court proceedings to stall punitive measures
against Libya if the Libyans were slow to hand over the men.
Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to send an envoy to Tripoli to work out the
details of the handover of the two men.
In the meantime, the foreign ministers of the five Maghreb countries and of
Egypt and Syria are expected in New York shortly for talks with the Security
Council.

<TEXT>
ALBANIA'S opposition Democratic party captured a clear parliamentary
majority in Sunday's general election with 62.2 per cent of the vote against
25.6 per cent for the outgoing Socialist party, the Central Electoral
Commission said, Reuter reports from Tirana.
With tallies from 97 of 100 constituencies counted, there was still no clear
indication of how many seats each party would have under Albania's
sophisticated new electoral system that combined first-past-the-post
elements with proportional representation.
In essence, parties that win more than 4 per cent of the ballot can get
seats equivalent to their share of the vote in the country's new,
slimmed-down 140-seat assembly.
Commission sources said the Democratic party of Mr Sali Berisha - beaten a
year ago when it first attempted to unseat the governing Communist party -
had won 76 seats outright, while the renamed Socialists took only five.
'This has ended a long night of communism,' Mr Berisha said.
With a popular vote of close to 63 per cent the Democratic party could
expect to control around 88 seats in the assembly. The Socialists with
around 25 per cent would have about 36 seats.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community will not be able to meet its commitment to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 without some form
of the tax on fossil and other forms of energy advocated by Brussels,
European Commission officials said yesterday.
Several member states had maintained that their own energy-saving and
anti-global-warming measures could meet the EC target without a tax.
But with a week to go before the deadline by which each of the 12 agreed to
submit a programme of 'complementary measures' to cut CO output, only three
member states - Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands - have done so. The UK,
which has promised to stabilise emissions only by 2005, has submitted its
white paper on the environment, This Common Inheritance, which lacks
detailed timetables on emissions.
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner behind the energy
tax proposal, said: 'This proves that on a strictly national level, far from
being sufficient to deal with the emissions, the problem is that they
(member states) do not even fulfil these basic commitments.'
The national programmes are supposed to constitute one of three weapons  -
alongside the SAVE energy conservation programme and the carbon/energy tax -
in the EC arsenal against global warming.
The Commission had originally calculated that without a tax, the EC would
only meet three-fifths of its emission reduction target by 2000. It
therefore wants a levy falling half on fossil fuels and half on other forms
of non-renewable energy, equivalent to Dollars 3 on a barrel of oil, rising
to Dollars 10 by 2000, which member states would offset by tax reductions.
Industry has lobbied against the plan in proportion to the intensity with
which it consumes energy, arguing voluntary measures would meet the EC
target.
Ministers did, however, agree on tighter limits to the sulphur content in
diesel and heating oil. Sulphur in diesel will have to be not more than 0.2
per cent by October 1994, and 0.05 per cent by October 1996.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Tough Polish draft budget cuts subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S centre right coalition government has cut subsidies and social
welfare in a tough draft budget designed to recoup international
credibility, spur exports and curb domestic demand.
The draft now passes to parliament where it faces a month-long scrutiny by
the 29 parties, many elected in opposition to market reform policies
introduced by the first two post-communist governments.
The International Monetary Fund, which has suspended disbursement of its
Dollars 1.6bn loan facility because of the soaring budget deficit, gave
conditional backing for the budget provided Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the
finance minister, managed to keep the budget deficit below Zl 65,550bn
(Pounds 2.8bn), equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP.
Implementation of last year's Paris Club agreement under which Poland's
official creditors agreed to a 50 per cent reduction in the country's
Dollars 33bn (Pounds 19bn) official debt is linked to Poland's conformity to
terms agreed with the IMF.
Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, originally favoured an easing of
economic policy, but yesterday called on parliament to recognise the
importance of retaining the confidence of the IMF.
Poland's crisis deepened as the recession pushed thousands of state
industries into loss, cutting the major source of tax income, while social
welfare spending soared.
Mr Olechowski said corporate taxes were to be eased and the debts of some
companies would be re-scheduled to help industry survive. But the average
level of indirect taxes on consumer goods is to rise from 5.4 per cent to
7.5 per cent coupled with tighter state sector wage controls.
Real incomes of health, education and government administrative staff and 8m
pensioners will fall. Mr Olechowski, said Poland managed to keep within its
spending limits over the first quarter, but a broader political coalition
was needed to ensure that the budget was passed 'in the face resistance from
various social groups'.
The government is hoping to finance a part of its budget deficit with World
Bank loans and support from western governments. It also hopes to raise Zl
10,000bn by selling one and three-year government bonds.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Germany takes a hard line on Delors budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY, struggling to meet the mounting cost of unification, is determined
to resist European Commission plans to increase EC revenue by nearly a third
over the next five years.
German officials negotiating the EC's new medium-term finance package say
Bonn will not accept the full increase being sought for 1993-97, which needs
approval by all 12 member states. Nor does Germany intend to let the rebate
the UK has received from the EC budget since 1985 pass unchallenged, the
officials said.
They added that they did not expect the new revenue base to be in place
before 1994. The Commission had hoped for agreement on the new package at
the Lisbon summit in June. Any long delay risks complicating ratification by
the 12 of the Maastricht treaty, which is due to come into effect next year
and foresees new fiscal transfers to the EC's four poorest member states,
Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece.
Germany wants the Commission to scale back its plans to double these
transfers to these four to raise their per capita income. It is incensed
that Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, last week linked this aim of
'cohesion' with 'convergence' - the tight financial targets Maastricht set
for entry into monetary union later this decade. Mr Delors told EC finance
ministers last week the doubling of transfers was essential for the four
countries to 'surmount the contradiction' between tightening their budgets
and modernising their economies. This is also the thesis of Spain, which
made its approval of Maastricht conditional on 'cohesion' transfers.
If the transfers 'have a positive effect on convergence, so much the
better', said a senior German finance ministry official. 'But we refuse to
accept any cause-and-effect relation.' The transfers were a gesture of
solidarity, whereas meeting criteria for monetary union 'is a strictly
national effort.'
Bonn had little option but to resist Brussels' revenue ambitions at a time
when Germany was having to rein in its own spending, and during a public
backlash against currency union. Germany, like the UK with which it is
allied in resisting the size of the budget increase, reckons the Commission
could get two thirds of what it wants without changing the EC revenue
ceiling.
This ceiling, which has not yet been reached, now stands at 1.2 per cent of
EC gross national product and Brussels wants to raise it to 1.37 per cent by
1997. The plan would give an increase from Ecu66bn (Pounds 47.2bn) now to
Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at 1992 prices.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Tories shift focus to rally support of skilled workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP of Mr John Major's campaign strategy was signalled last night
after the Conservatives had been put on the defensive by the prime
minister's admission that he might be unable to reduce the tax burden in the
next parliament.
Senior ministers said the Conservative campaign had been 'recalibrated' to
focus all of its efforts on winning back the support of the skilled working
classes who delivered the party victory in 1983 and 1987.
After a bruising day, Mr Major was cheered by an opinion poll showing the
Conservatives with a five-point lead over Labour. The Harris poll for
today's Daily Express put the Tories at 43 per cent, Labour at 38 per cent
and the Liberal Democrats at 15 per cent.
The result contrasted with the average of most recent polls which have shown
a Labour lead of two points, but ministers said it offered the first sign
that their onslaught on Labour's tax plans was yielding results.
Harris has tended to give the Conservatives a higher rating than other
polling organisations, so confirmation of any trend back to the
Conservatives will hinge on three further surveys due over the next two
days. Those results are seen by strategists on all sides as potentially
crucial to the outcome of the April 9 election.
As the Conservatives conceded that scope for tax cuts was limited, Mr Neil
Kinnock launched his party's 'manufacturing manifesto' in Birmingham,
stressing a Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme as a blueprint for boosting
industry and exports.
The document's release - timed to coincide with yesterday's trade figures -
was followed with a denunciation by Mr Kinnock of news of another Pounds
750m trade gap in February as 'quite dreadful'. Labour is now expected to
shift the focus of its campaign to allegations of deteriorating public
sector services.
Mr Major's campaign aides acknowledged that the Conservatives had made two
important errors in the first week of the campaign. The view last night was
that the party had been mistaken initially in believing that the prime
minister could be kept above the fray in the assault on Labour's tax plans.
It had then directed too much attention on the impact on those higher up the
income scale.
Mr Richard Ryder, the Conservative chief whip and a confidant of the prime
minister, is said to be the moving force behind the new approach. Mr Ryder,
who has been given a wide-ranging brief to oversee the party's strategy, has
established a base at Conservative central office.
The strategy is designed to press home the charge - dismissed as absurd by
Mr Kinnock - that the opposition's spending plans would force an increase of
Pounds 1,250 a year in the bills of all taxpayers. One senior minister
described the shift - designed to win back the so-called C2 group of skilled
manual workers - as the only hope of regaining the initiative.
But, facing strong questioning about the Conservatives' tax plans, Mr Major
was forced to concede that, in spite of a pledge to reduce eventually the
basic rate of income tax to 20p in the pound, he could not guarantee a
reduction in the overall tax burden.
Amid charge and countercharge about the two parties' tax plans, Mr Kinnock
said the admission had all but confirmed Labour's longstanding charges that
the the prime minister had a secret agenda to increase value added tax.
The prime minister hotly denied suggestions that the deterioration in the
government's finances was such that it was now paying for current
expenditure from borrowing. He insisted that next year's prospective
borrowing of Pounds 28bn had to be set against public investment of Pounds
30bn.
But while Mr Major said that the tax burden had been 'broadly flat' under
successive Conservative government, official figures showed a rise from 35.5
per cent of national income in 1979 to 36.75 per cent this year.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Canada may come to the rescue of Olympia &amp; York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN government is considering measures to help Olympia &amp; York, the
world's biggest property developer, overcome its financial difficulties.
A spokesman for Mr Donald Mazankowski, the Canadian finance minister, said
O&amp;Y, developer of Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest new office development in
the London Docklands, is 'talking to us about certain possibilities' and
that agreement on a plan of action is likely by the end of the week.
Authorities in the UK and the US are understood to have been told that the
Canadian government is likely to help O&amp;Y, which is controlled by Toronto's
Reichmann family, dispose of assets in Canada.
Under this plan, the Canadian government would act as a 'guarantor' in asset
sales by O&amp;Y, according to a UK government official.
If banks or other buyers were not able to raise sufficient funds to buy
O&amp;Y's properties, the Canadian government could provide a portion of the
required finance in the form of bridging loans to facilitate these deals.
It is believed that the Canadian government may help dispose of the Exchange
Tower, a Toronto office block being sold to banks for around Dollars 300m
(Pounds 173m).
The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have been kept informed of
O&amp;Y's discussions with the Canadian government. There is no suggestion that
the UK and US governments will participate in attempts to help the company.
O&amp;Y admitted on Sunday night that it had been suffering from a 'liquidity
crisis', or shortage of cash. At the end of last week, it persuaded banks to
provide it with more than Pounds 100m in emergency short-term loans, to meet
requirements including the costs of continuing to build at Canary Wharf.
A senior Canadian official said the authorities had already played an
important role in encouraging banks to provide short-term loans designed to
keep O&amp;Y trading while discussions took place on a more thorough
reorganisation of its debt, estimated at considerably more than CDollars
10bn in total. 'It's a question of giving people time to make intelligent
decisions,' he said.
The Canadian authorities were concerned that any 'precipitate' action by
O&amp;Y's lenders had the potential to disrupt financial markets, he added.
O&amp;Y is among Canada's biggest companies. It has around 70 banks led by
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Other Canadian banks with big loans to
it are Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia. Bank
shares fell yesterday on the Toronto stock exchange.
In the UK, Barclays and Lloyds each have loans to it of more than Pounds
50m, most of it lent for the construction of Canary Wharf.
Vanessa Houlder writes: O&amp;Y's request for planning permission to build 3.2m
sq ft of offices at Heron Quays, next to Canary Wharf, came under fire at a
public meeting held by local authorities and community groups in Poplar last
night.
The meeting resolved to seek legal redress against the London Docklands
Development Corporation, the body responsible for the area's regeneration,
if it gave planning permission to O&amp;Y during the run-up to the election.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Pay rise of 17.6% for gas chief sparks Labour attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 17.6 per cent pay rise last year for the chairman of British Gas, Mr
Robert Evans, sparked controversy yesterday.
British Gas revealed that Mr Evans earned Pounds 435,222 last year including
a bonus related to earnings per share of some Pounds 84,512, compared with
Pounds 370,083 the previous year. The company made after-tax profits of
Pounds 1.16bn last year resulting in earnings per share of 27.3p.
Coming in the middle of the election campaign, news of Mr Evans' pay rise
unleashed a strong attack from the Labour party. Mr Frank Dobson, the
party's energy spokesman, called it 'another example of the sheer unrivalled
greed which has been let loose by setting up privatised monopolies'.
The scale of the pay rise is likely to embarrass the Conservatives in the
campaign. The government has come under fire for failing to regulate the
salaries of the chairmen of privatised utilities.
But Mr John Major said yesterday that pay levels must be a matter for the
companies concerned. However, he added, 'as I have repeatedly made clear, I
believe chairmen should exercise leadership in questions of pay'.
White-collar workers at British Gas warned that the chairman's salary
increase would influence current pay talks where 33,000 members of the Nalgo
union have put in a claim for an increase in excess of inflation.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo's general secretary said: 'Coming in the middle of
a general election campaign we can see clearly what fairness and equity mean
to high income earners . . . This is RPI plus 400 per cent and far exceeds
any increase in dividends.'
British Gas recently agreed a pay increase of 4.25 per cent with its craft
and manual workers.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Trade deficit narrows as imports and exports rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS and imports rose sharply last month, leaving Britain's current
account deficit higher than expected, despite a fall on the month.
The value of exports rose 8.5 per cent in February over January, while the
value of imports rose 6.5 per cent, leaving the current account deficit
slightly narrower at Pounds 750m in February, against January's Pounds 858m.
The Conservatives welcomed the increases in both exports and imports as
evidence that the economy was recovering.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said increases in UK manufactured exports
were encouraging and forecast that the deficit for the year would be in line
with prediction. Mr John Major said the rise in imports showed that the
recovery was under way.
Economists warned that the UK's inability to eliminate its current account
deficit during recession meant the balance of payments could deteriorate
once recovery began. Mr Stephen Bell, chief UK economist at Morgan Grenfell,
said: 'The plus side is that exports continue to do well despite the big
deterioration in Germany's economy, but the bad news is that in the longest
recession since the war, we still have a deficit.'
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader described the month's figures as 'quite
dreadful', saying they showed that Britain's economy was 'at best, flat and
possibly still slipping backwards'.
Central Statistical Office figures showed that the value of exports for
February was Pounds 9bn - the highest since August - while imports rose to
just over Pounds 10bn, the highest since June 1990.
However, measured by volume, in the three months to February, imports rose
faster than exports.
The surplus on invisible earnings such as banking, insurance and tourism was
estimated at Pounds 300m, the same as in January.
On a three-monthly basis, the current account deficit worsened slightly,
rising to Pounds 1.7bn for the three months to February, from Pounds 1.1bn
for the three months to November.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Survey of Employee Ownership (7): Beyond the boardroom - Tax
Incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE SUCCESS of share ownership schemes in Britain is inextricably
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
although far from exclusively - linked to the tax system.
The Inland Revenue had recognised three different types of 'approved'
employee share schemes awarded tax advantages since the late 1970s. The jury
is still out on how successful they have been.
Profit-sharing schemes, introduced in 1979, allow a company to allocate free
shares to its employees. The shares are not subject to income tax, although
there may be a capital gains tax liability.
Savings-related share option schemes, created by the 1980 Finance Act, allow
a company to grant options to employees to buy shares using the proceeds of
save-as-you-earn savings contracts.
By contrast to these two all-employee schemes, a third set up under the 1984
Finance Act requires less universal coverage. Discretionary share option
schemes allow a company to grant selected employees options to buy shares.
The latest Inland Revenue statistics, issued in February, for the take-up in
the year to March 1991, show a decline in two of the three schemes. Only
those with savings-related share option schemes (where employees can keep
the interest-free savings allocated for their contribution in place of
buying shares) rose, with an increase of 80,000 to 540,000 people covered.
The number of employees in profit-sharing schemes dropped by 20,000 to
900,000 and the number granted discretionary share options fell by 35,000 to
65,000. This is no doubt partly driven by the recession, which has made
shares less attractive to potential investors and employers less willing to
award incentives.
There was little encouragement to spread employee ownership further in Mr
Norman Lamont's 1992 budget proposals. However, there were two significant
changes in last year's Finance Act, which came into effect at the beginning
of this year: one to encourage executives to promote schemes among their
employees; and the other to allow share option beneficiaries to roll their
shares into PEPs.
In his 1991 budget speech, Mr Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,
expressed dissatisfaction that most employee share schemes 'have been
directed solely at highly paid company executives'.
To extend benefits beyond the boardroom, he considered using a stick but
ultimately opted for a carrot when the bill was introduced. Directors would
be given extra incentives if they publicised the presence of a scheme for
which all employees were eligible.
Until the amendment, it was a condition that any executive share option
scheme seeking approval by the Inland Revenue had to ensure that the price
payable for share options when exercised should not be less than the share
value when the option was first granted.
Under the new arrangement, which came into effect at the beginning of 1992,
executives were permitted to receive up to a 15 per cent discount on this
initial price provided that an all-employee scheme was in place and
publicised to their staff.
The problem - which caused surprise among many commentators in view of the
rhetoric - is that there is no requirement for employees actually to
participate in such a scheme. In fact, in the most extreme case it could
mean that a company could merely discreetly make employees aware of a scheme
without ever setting one up.
'You don't have to have offered participation but merely communicate its
existence,' says Mr Calvin Jackson, a principal with Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte. 'You could just put a note in with employees' pay slips that a
scheme exists.'
While employees may have been given little encouragement as a result of the
change, executives have since had much of the attraction of the perk to them
wiped out, too. Tough guidelines issued by the Association of British
Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds have made it much
more difficult to claim the 15 per cent discount by linking it to tough
performance targets.
Very few executives appeared to have taken full advantage of the discounts,
at least in part as a result of these restrictions. 'Most professional
observers would say the ABI has probably over-cooked it,' says Mr Jackson.
The second key tax change introduced in the 1991 budget was to allow
beneficiaries of an all-employee share options scheme a chance to roll their
shares into a single company PEP within 90 days of exercising their right to
buy them. That removes the need to pay any capital gains tax on the shares.
Again, it is rather early to assess the success of the initiative: the
practice only became effective from the beginning of this year. However, Mr
Jackson says that early indications on the take-up appear to be positive.
The tax system has also had more subtle effects on the popularity of
different employee share schemes. Mr Brian Freeman, managing director of
Stoy Benefits, says that there has been an explosion of interest in
unapproved schemes: those ones which are not approved by the Inland Revenue.
There are no official statistics but Mr Freeman says that, based on
conversations with his counterparts in other consulting firms, he estimates
that 500 or 600 companies now have such schemes.
Before 1988, with a considerable gulf between income tax and capital gains
tax rates, the advantage of approved schemes was clear and unquestionable.
Unapproved schemes were liable to income tax. Approved schemes would be
charged CGT only when any shares were later sold.
Now the rates are so similar that Mr Freeman says: 'People do not care so
much as they used to whether schemes are approved or not.' However, Mr
Jackson says: 'Unapproved schemes have rather more unfriendly tax
regulations. I think I would prefer to be in an approved scheme.'
It is difficult to quantify how many people retain their shares even once
they have exercised an option to buy them in the short-term. Take-up figures
aside, Mr Freeman questions the long-term effectiveness of employee share
schemes. 'I am not sure of the extent to which they engender a real feeling
of wider share ownership,' he says.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Survey of Employee Ownership (6): Owners work harder / A
look at the attitudes of institutional investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IF EMPLOYEES own a stake in a company, we generally think that's a good
thing,' says Mr David Rough, investment manager at Legal and General, one of
the UK's largest life insurers. 'The question for us is what kind of
employee share option scheme it is.'
Institutional shareholders see workers who are owners as having a stake in
the company's success - raising the odds that they will work hard to earn
profits for their employer. They point to NFC, formerly the nationalised
National Freight Company. It was saved by the intervention of its staff and
management who bought it and turned it into a highly profitable venture.
Rarely is there any concern that employee shareholdings limit the ability of
senior management to make changes to company structure, such as those
involving redundancies. Indeed, most institutional shareholders say they
have given little thought to the matter. Only when employee share ownership
is used to accomplish a corporate goal do institutional shareholders sit up
and take notice.
In particular, US-style employee stock option plans, often funded by the
employer itself, raise the hackles of institutional shareholders. Last
August, the Association of British Insurers issued 'best practice'
guidelines for companies. There is no compulsion for companies to follow ABI
guidelines on Esops, but they risk the ire of big institutional shareholders
in ignoring them.
'The additional interest which is now developing in Esops and Esots (trusts)
is welcomed in the context that they can genuinely result in wider share
ownership. Such schemes however are increasingly being advocated as
providing a means of building up 'an anti-takeover stake',' the ABI wrote in
its paper.
According to the ABI, any anti-takeover mechanism which prevents existing
shareholders from recognising the full value of their investments is a bad
thing. Its guidelines say that no more than 10 per cent of a company's
shares should be held by employees and management as a group, with each
limited to 5 per cent. 'Where an Esop or Esot would be capable of building
up a holding of more than 5 per cent of a company's issued ordinary share
capital, the arrangements should be first submitted to shareholders for
their prior approval,' the ABI said.
Mr Tom Crombie, investment chief at Scottish Equitable, says that the ABI
guidelines appear to have had the desired effect. 'Most of those wishing to
increase their shareholdings discuss it with the ABI's investment committee
first and are turned down.'
According to Mr Robin Garrow, investment manager at Scottish Widows: 'As
long as employee shareholdings are relatively insignificant, we think they
are a good thing.'
Legal and General's Mr Rough says that he is concerned about how Esops are
financed. US-style Esops are typically arranged with bank borrowings secured
on the shares themselves. Thus, if the value of the shares fall, the lender
will demand additional collateral, possibly in the form of more shares.
Concern about financing Esops has led to some innovations to prevent
precisely that scenario. In June 1990, Exxon Corporation, the US-based oil
concern, raised Dollars 174m by selling notes of a special vehicle set up to
hold a Dollars 220m pool of its own shares for an Esop.
However, the investment community is divided over stock option plans for
senior management, in particular directors. The odds are greater that these
shareholdings will act as an anti-takeover mechanism, says an ABI official.
But even if directors' holdings remain within the 5 per cent ceiling, how
the shares should be awarded to them is still an issue. The ABI view,
consistent with Inland Revenue rules on the taxation of stock options, says
that options may be offered to directors at a discount of up to 15 per cent
on the offer date - with the caveat that they should not be exercisable for
at least five years. The restriction is intended to prevent managers from
taking a quick profit and moving to another company.
However, the Institutional Fund Managers Association says that system is too
generous to ineffective managers and affords too little incentive to see
that the shares perform well. 'If the shares do nothing for five years, the
directors have made a profit,' says one IFMA member. Instead, the trade
association says directors should simply be offered the right to buy shares
five years hence at a price equal to the current one. Only if the share
price rises more than inflation will they have made a profit.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Survey of Employee Ownership (5): US link worth grasping -
Esops boost corporate performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE caring, sharing 1990s, the concept of employee share ownership sits
comfortably in the US. Recent research shows how much of a financial
interest American workers now have in their own companies' futures. In the
US employees are estimated to own Dollars 150bn worth of company stock.
Combined, they control an average of 12 per cent of the 1,000 largest US
companies whose employee shareholdings exceed 4 per cent. The trend to wider
employee ownership will accelerate if companies pay attention to the spate
of recent studies which appear to show a firm link between employee
ownership - and the use of Employee Share Ownership Plans (Esops) in
particular - and corporate performance. The Institute of Management and
Labor Relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey last year showed how the
stocks of public corporations with meaningful employee ownership beat the
main market averages in 1991. The Rutgers team compiled an 'employee owners'
index' made up of 205 publicly traded US companies with a stock market value
of Dollars 50m or more and with employee holdings of at least 10 per cent,
well over half of them through Esops. In 1991 the Rutgers index rose 35.9
per cent excluding dividends, a superior performance to the S&amp;P 500, which
gained 26.3 per cent. The theory that employee ownership benefits companies
and their employees is also supported by a recent study by the University of
Baltimore, which reviewed 2,776 public companies with Esops, and found that
as an investment, they produced a higher return than comparable mutual
funds. Even the recession seems not to have dulled the success of many Esop
companies. A poll by the Washington DC-based Esop Association asked its
members: 'How did your company perform in 1991 compared with 1990?'.
Sixty-five per cent of the respondents answered 'better, or the same'. It is
hard to gauge the value of an Esop for a company struggling to survive a
recession. It has been argued that Esops restrict a company's flexibility in
restructuring its way out of trouble, especially in small worker-owned
concerns that may be reluctant to cut jobs or take drastic action. It has
also been said that the large amounts of debt taken on with Esops pushes
companies closer to failure. Yet Esop-led leveraged buy-outs, where the
debt-load is likely to be most onerous, have fared well in recent years. A
study in 1991 by the National Centre for Employee Ownership (NCEO) in
California found that Esop LBOs were much less likely to file for
bankruptcy, default on loans or need major restructuring than conventional
LBOs.
Mr Joseph Blasi of Rutgers University and co-author of 'The New Owners'
(published in the US by HarperCollins), cautions against assuming a strong
link between ownership and performance. 'All the studies show that
employee-owned companies don't perform any worse than comparable
non-employee owned companies. But there is also no evidence that
employee-owned companies automatically perform in a superior fashion.'
Detractors of Esops have argued over the years that employee-owned companies
use profits to boost workers' pay in the short term instead of putting them
into long-term capital investment. Yet, says Mr Blasi, 'there is absolutely
zero evidence that this is true.'
Similarly, Mr Blasi has found nothing to back claims that employee-owned
companies reduce dividends to shareholders to pay for increased wages, or
that employees in such companies undermine the management hierarchy and
hamper the decision-making process.
In fact, the evidence reveals that there is not enough employee
participation in the management of employee-owned companies. Mr Blasi found
that employees were the dominant shareholders in half of the 1,000 companies
identified as significantly employee-owned, yet employees had a place on the
board as non-management representatives at just three of them.
This dismays those who believe the full potential of employee ownership is
not being exploited. 'Most managers are unwilling or unable to institute
organisational changes in their companies that would ensure employee
ownership really made a big difference,' says Mr Blasi.
One criticism of Esops and employee ownership that is harder to refute is
the argument that they create too much risk for workers, whose entire
retirement savings may be tied up in the fortunes of one company.
Whereas in the past workers retirement savings were housed in defined
benefit plans that were highly diversified and insured by the government,
Esop company employees are putting all their eggs in one basket. If a
company goes under, and there is no back-up for employee funds in the form
of another savings plan, employee holdings can be wiped out in one go.
Despite the risks, however, workers appear fixed on a course towards
adopting more flexible forms of retirement savings. This, says Mr Blasi, is
because of changes in society and business culture. He claims that as
workers increasingly favour, or are being offered by employers,
entrepreneurial forms of retirement savings plans, the fixed wage and
benefits system of the post-war era is collapsing.
Esops continue to play a big part in the collapse of that system, and today
there are about 10,000 Esops in the US, covering more than 11m employees.
The rate of growth in new plans, however, has dropped sharply. According to
Morgan Stanley, Dollars 2bn went into the plans last year, compared with
Dollars 10bn in 1990 and Dollars 18bn in 1989.
Yet 1989 and 1990 were probably aberrations, with many companies creating
Esops as a defence against unwanted takeovers, or as part of a share
repurchase programme. Since last year the takeover binge has died, and
because of buoyant stock markets companies have issued more equity, rather
than bought it back.
Esops do not represent the entire picture of employee ownership in the US.
In fact, less than half of companies that are significantly employee-owned
have an Esop. Other routes to employee ownership include employee benefit
schemes, savings plans, deferred profit sharing plans that own company
stock, employee share purchase plans, broad-based stock option plans (such
as those in place at Pepsi-Cola and drugs group Merck), and even retiree
medical plans funded with stock.
The growth of all forms of employee ownership has important implications for
the way businesses in the US are run, and it cannot be long before
employee-owners will want a greater say in management.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Survey of Employee Ownership (2): Fewer lenders, smaller
deals - Finance for management buy-outs and the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has been a mixed blessing for managers looking to take a stake
in their own business. It has created opportunities for management buy-outs
from forced asset sales, but there is less finance available as lenders have
withdrawn from the market. In spite of a decline in the number of active
lenders, 400 transactions were completed during 1991. This is only slightly
down from the 440 deals struck in 1990 and well above the 360 deals closed
during the 'boom' year of 1989. However, finance for management buy-outs is
certainly more difficult to secure than in the late 1980s. Most deals are
now smaller and more conservatively financed. Statistics compiled by KPMG
Peat Marwick show that the total value of management buy-outs and buy-ins
amounted to Pounds 2.62bn last year, down from Pounds 2.8bn in 1990 and
Pounds 6.4bn in 1989. The average size of deals has fallen to Pounds 5.2m
from Pounds 13m over the same period. Lenders are insisting on more
conservative financing structures, including lower debt-to-equity ratios.
Again according to KPMG figures, the average debt-to-equity ratio for MBOs
during the second half of 1991 was 180 per cent, compared to 590 per cent in
the second half of 1989. As gearing levels have declined, there has also
been less use of mezzanine finance, subordinated loans which rank between
senior debt and equity in the event of winding-up. There is no shortage of
mezzanine funding available. Mr Erik Linnes, head of the Kleinwort Benson
Mezzanine Fund, estimated that UK mezzanine funds have around Pounds 300m
committed but unallocated finance available. A similar amount is looking for
a home in continental Europe.
But with senior lenders insisting on a less reliance on debt finance
overall, fewer deals have included a mezzanine portion.
Yet there is no question that mezzanine finance is here to stay. As overall
business confidence returns, gearing levels on management buy- outs will
probably return to near the long-term average of 270 per cent. Under these
conditions, senior lenders will probably prefer to see an element of
mezzanine finance in a deal, since it creates an additional loss-absorbing
cushion between them and the company.
For the moment, however, caution prevails. This is evident from the
covenants of recent MBO financings, which tie the buy-out team tightly to
strict profit and performance targets.
There has been a knee-jerk response to losses incurred on some infamous
buy-outs of the late 1980s. For example, the team heading the Pounds 629m
buy-out of Magnet in 1989 forecast annual pre-tax profits growth of 15 per
cent over three years. The eventual outturn was a profits fall even in the
year of the buy-out. The company is now in effect in the hands of its
bankers.
To some, the trend has gone too far in the opposite direction: managers need
some latitude in the long-term development of the business. Covenants which
are drawn too tightly can be counter- productive.
This same conservatism and lack of business confidence has also reduced the
number of new Employee Share Ownership Plans (Esops) being set up.
In the past around 20 per cent new Esops have been set up alongside
management buy-outs.
As part of the MBO financing, the management team simply sets up an employee
share trust, which then takes a stake in the company and grants options over
the shares to employees.
But as the number of larger MBOs has fallen, and as core debt finance has
become more difficult to secure, the number of buy-outs including an Esop
has declined.
Esops were first recognised under UK law in 1989. Unlike ordinary share
option schemes, an employee trust is set up to buy existing equity in the
market, rather than granting options over new shares which are subsequently
issued at a discount to market value.
However, the vast majority of Esops has been set up independently of
statute, which lays down strict conditions by which the trust must be run -
covering the election of trustees, for example. Lawyers have established
that Esops which do not comply with every letter of the law are still
entitled to the tax breaks granted to statutory Esops.
Other than MBOs, the rate of creation of Esops is closely linked to business
confidence and the outlook for corporate earnings. The employee trust's
purchase of shares is usually financed by a bank loan, guaranteed by the
company. This can eat into credit lines with banks.
The loan is serviced by the dividends that the trust receives from its
shareholding. However, this is never enough to cover all debt-service costs
and the company invariably has to make periodic 'gifts' to the trust. This
can use up valuable working capital.
Loans for the creation of an Esop carry the same lending margin as loans to
the parent company which guarantees the debt. As corporate lending margins
have widened, so the cost of running an Esop has increased.
In addition, initial legal and banking fees for setting up an Esop are
generally around 1 per cent of the value of the scheme. There are ways to
reduce the marginal financing costs of an Esop. For example, if the lending
bank holds the shares on behalf of the trust, any dividend income it
receives counts as tax-free franked investment income.
But there are clearly identifiable costs involved in setting up an Esop. In
a recession few companies feel they have either credit lines or working
capital to spare, and the creation of new Esops slowed almost to a
standstill.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Survey of Employee Ownership (3): Perks for the board -
Executive Incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT A packed annual general meeting last November, frustrated shareholders
unanimously voted down a proposal from their board to introduce a share
option scheme for senior managers and executive directors of the company.
This was not a typical meeting of normal shareholders in an ordinary
company. It was the AGM of Manchester United, which counts large numbers of
football fans among its shareholders. But it does illustrates the growing
frustration being expressed with the nature of executive incentives.
'There was a fair amount of dissatisfaction with the board,' says Mr David
Craddock, a supporter of the club who stood up at the meeting to oppose the
scheme. 'I felt it was outside the spirit of the flotation, which was to
spread share ownership more widely.'
He is a member of a share option scheme himself, and argues that the board
should come back at the next AGM and propose a scheme which applies to all
employees of the club.
'If there is an executive scheme, it should be very closely linked to the
performance of financial factors  .. and how the team performs,' he says.
'Football operates in a perfectly competitive market. There is a price for
failure.'
He suggests that any rewards should be linked to factors such as attendance
at matches, and how well the football club performs each season.
Mr Craddock's criteria may be harsh, but the message is a common one:
shareholders are becoming restless with the liberties taken by their boards
over remuneration.
'There is increasing emphasis that share options should be
performance-related,' says Mr Brian Freeman, managing director of Stoy
Benefit Consulting.
Mr Hugh Turrall-Clarke, a partner with the executive benefits services group
of Price Waterhouse, says there is a growing feeling that executives have
been seen to make a great deal of money from options, unrelated to their
company's performance. In addition, many critics suggest that managers
should not simply have an incentive geared to the upside of a company's
performance.
Incidents including the 'super share options' arranged for Sir Ralph
Halpern, former chairman of Burton, which were valued by one estimate at
Pounds 7.1m in the late 1980s, have hardly helped the case of directors,
particularly at a time of economic downturn.
A study produced by the London Business School last year showed little
evidence that senior executives were manipulating their performance-related
pay schemes unfairly to receive additional rewards.
But it found few companies which voluntarily disclosed sufficient
information to allow the formulae for calculating their bonuses to be
understood. The academics were unable to probe as thoroughly as they would
have liked as a result. Such concealment is unlikely to endear itself to
shareholders.
Mr Freeman says the introduction in 1984 of discretionary share option
schemes went against the grain of previous schemes, which were targeted at
all employees.
Discretionary schemes, differentially helping directors, were given a
further boost in the 1991 Finance Bill. The chancellor of the exchequer
allowed executives to take a 15 per cent discount off the market price at
the time the option was granted. The only condition was that there should
also be an all-employee scheme in place.
The aim was at least in part to boost wider share ownership. The result was
considerable concern that directors would again be in a position to benefit
more than their employees.
Both the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of
Pension Funds frowned on the initiative. The ABI produced guidelines late
last year which placed strict limits on its use.
It argued that the effect would be to increase the cost of options to
existing shareholders, and created divisions between directors now eligible
for the discount and those who previously had to pay the full price on the
options.
As a result, it recommended that such options could only be taken up after
five years, rather than the more typical three. It added that the discount
should in any case apply only to a maximum of one quarter of the total
number of shares allocated under the scheme.
This advice came on top of earlier notes, stressing that there should be a
limit on the maximum participation by an individual, and suggesting that any
discretionary option should be linked to performance, and not granted unless
the company's earnings per share had grown by at least 2 per cent above
inflation.
The weight of the ABI guidelines has meant the 15 per cent discount has
barely been taken advantage of. 'The ABI has pretty well killed it with its
requirements for performance-linking,' says Mr Turrall-Clarke. 'Its
influence is quite strong. You don't go against it without thinking pretty
carefully.'
Theoretically, Mr Freeman argues it might be better if options could be
matched to individual performance, rather than general company-wide
objectives. At the moment, he says the scheme is open to abuse, with options
sometimes given to 'blue-eyed boys'.
Even when earnings per share is used as a yardstick, he argues that the
figure can be increased by 'good luck and good planning' more than the
contribution of an individual. It gives little reflection of the
contribution made by the managing director of a small subsidiary within a
group, for instance.
He suggests that, ideally, executive options should be tied to personnel
policies, job evaluation and formal appraisal systems. He also welcomes the
trend towards remuneration committees and - not surprisingly - to outside
advisers.
Despite the limited efforts at reform, Mr Freeman argues there is still
generally little opportunity for shareholders to object. 'Shareholders have
been remarkably docile,' he says. 'In far too many companies executive share
options are left in the fiefdom of the directors. It's very feudalistic.'

FT  24 MAR 92 / Survey of Employee Ownership (4): Value of free shares / A
look at the problems being caused by privatisation in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THEORY, the workers used to own everything in the so-called worker-states
of eastern Europe. In practice, the absence of clearly defined property
rights proved to be one of the greatest obstacles to rational economic
development.
Over the past two years, the collapse of communist regimes throughout the
region has made privatisation a key element of economic reform. Inevitably,
this has revealed the need for new forms of ownership, including a
redefinition of employee ownership.
The quickest and most complete transformation to employee ownership has
followed the rapid privatisation of trade and retail outlets, especially in
the three central European 'fast track' reforming economies of
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Czechoslovakia has been particularly
concerned either to compensate, or restore to whatever previous owners can
still be traced, small shops and restaurants which were privately owned
until the various waves of nationalisation which followed the post-war
imposition of a Soviet-style regime.
In some cases, state property has simply been auctioned off to the highest
bidder, a satisfactorily quick and cheap process. Often such small
enterprises and retail outlets have been leased to their new proprietors,
especially where property rights are disputed by former owners or unclear.
Lack of clarity about original ownership has been a major difficulty
bedevilling transfers of property in many cases.
Poland began first and has proceeded fastest with this so-called 'small
privatisation'. Alone in eastern Europe, Poland managed to retain 80 per
cent of the land in peasant proprietorship throughout the communist period
and this helped to keep alive both the concept of private property and the
basic institutions needed to assert property rights and transfer property,
at least in country areas.
Poland passed its first privatisation law in July 1990 and within a few
months more than 100,000 small and medium-sized retail outlets owned mainly
by local authorities were sold off or leased. By the end of last year, well
over 80 per cent of retail trade was in private hands as well as over 40 per
cent of the building industry and 60 per cent of road transport.
With extraordinary speed a privatised wholesale network also sprung up in
Poland to replace the former centralised state system whose legendary
inefficiency had made queueing and shortages part of the country's way of
life. Last year over 46 per cent of Poland's Dollars 14bn import trade was
carried out by privatised companies.
It is a similar story in Hungary and Czechoslovakia where privatisation of
small firms began in January 1991. Over the next year 17,000 small
businesses were privatised, of which 2,000 were returned to their former
owners. Unfortunately, there are no clear statistics for the number of
employee buyouts but these are believed to have been a substantial
proportion. A further 30,000 small companies are due to be sold or leased in
the next nine months.
Progress with small-scale privatisation has been closely watched by the
so-called 'southern tier' countries of Romania, Bulgaria and Albania,
although Yugoslavia, which used to boast of its own special form of worker
self-management, has been distracted by the inter-republican fighting which
has thrown most of the republics into economic disarray.
Bulgaria began to privatise small shops, service stations and restaurants
only in the second half of 1991 while Romania is planning to auction small
enterprises later this year. The government in Bucharest, the Romanian
capital, has also drawn up plans for privatising 6,000 fully state-owned
industrial and other enterprises under the Privatisation Law promulgated
last August. The law transfers all state property, apart from utility
companies, into joint stock companies. The shares will then be held by five
private ownership funds.
Some 30 per cent of the shares in these funds are intended to be transferred
free to Romanian citizens as certificates of ownership. The remaining 70 per
cent will be held in a state ownership fund until they can be sold to
foreign or Romanian investors.
Given the shortage of capital in the region, and the need for time and
expertise to rebuild the legal and institutional framework for the effective
transfer of ownership and control, it clearly made sense for the governments
to transform as many employees as possible into owners or leaseholders of
small businesses.
But the real debate over shares for workers and employee ownership schemes
has surfaced in the second, far more difficult stage of privatisation. This
is the transformation of the thousands of large and medium-sized industrial
enterprises which remain the basis of the former centrally planned
economies.
Over the past two years, an enormous amount of intellectual effort and
specialised advice from western bankers, accountants and lawyers has been
devoted to working out complex mass privatisation schemes. All include some
form of free or preferential transfer of shares to workers in the various
enterprises.
However, the free element has been sharply reduced as the various drafts
succeeded each other. This is partly because pro-market governments have
argued with increasing strength that free distribution of shares resembles
too closely old socialist attitudes. It also reflects the cost of such
complex schemes and the need to make them as self-financing as possible.
Czechoslovakia hopes to return half of the remaining 4,000 state-owned
enterprises to private ownership through a so-called 'coupon privatisation'
programme which is due to start in March. Over 8m Czech and Slovak citizens
have paid a nominal sum for voucher booklets which will entitle them to
choose which shares they want to hold.
Poland has an equally complex system of 'mass privatisation' under which
shares in 200-400 of Poland's 8,000 state or municipally-owned enterprises
will be transferred into Polish and foreign-managed investment funds this
year. For a nominal fee, Polish citizens will be offered shares in the
closed end funds, but not in the companies themselves.
Employees will be given up to 10 per cent of the shares in the enterprises
taking part in the mass privatisation scheme. As an added incentive, they
will also be relieved from the strictures of the so-called popiwek tax. This
punitive tax on wage increases which exceed a below-inflation norm set by
the government is levied only on state-owned enterprises as a brake on the
power of the workers' councils.
Once companies are privatised, either by foreign investment, liquidation or
through the mass privatisation scheme, workers receive up to 10 per cent of
shares in the enterprise. But they lose the protection of the workers
councils. They are also freed from the restrictions of popiwek and are
allowed free wage bargaining.
The real problem is that the vast majority of enterprises in this part of
the world are under-capitalised, overmanned and technologically obsolescent.
Creating real value for the shares given to employees or obtained cheaply
through various mass privatisation schemes poses a daunting challenge for
years ahead.

<TEXT>
THE growth of employee share ownership in the US and the UK was one of the
phenomena of the financial world in the 1980s. From being an idea touted by
a small band of idealists, the drive to put shares into the hands of workers
grew into a mass movement which gained broad-based support from workers,
managers and existing shareholders, with strong political backing. There are
now reckoned to be around 11m workers in the US covered by share schemes,
while some 4 per cent of adults in the UK, or around 1.7m people, own shares
in the companies for which they work. Two main forces have been behind this
expansion of worker ownership - the tax system, and a plentiful supply of
bank finance. The surging stock market also helped, encouraging financially
inexpert employees to believe that owning shares is a worthwhile thing to
do. All three have become less significant factors in the 1990s - and the
volatility that has crept into stock markets may even have destroyed the
faith of some employees in the idea altogether. The result: employee
ownership is at a crossroads, poised between a further leap forward, as its
advocates say is coming, and a retrenchment. Which way it goes will depend
on whether companies and outside shareholders come to believe firmly that
share ownership motivates employees and leads to improved financial
performance (a case that has never been conclusively made). The tax system
provided the main springboard for the 1980s expansion of employee ownership
on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1984, the US Congress allowed banks to
deduct half of the interest they receive on loans to employee share
ownership plans (Esops) for tax purposes. The incentive led to a surge in
the use of Esops in the US.
In the UK, meanwhile, a series of measures from the late 1970s led to the
introduction of a range of schemes designed to place shares into the hands
of workers. Shares handed out under such statutory arrangements were to be
treated as free from income tax, though they did not escape tax on capital
gains. With income tax rates at a high level for much of the 1980s, the
attractions to a worker - particularly a highly paid one - of receiving
capital gains rather than income were obvious. Not surprisingly, shares
turned into a disguised form of remuneration, not different in character
from the range of other fringe benefits offered by many companies,
particularly to their executives.
Things have changed. The tax support for Esops in the US has come under
attack after the perceived abuses of such schemes in the late 1980s. And in
the UK, the equalisation of income tax and capital gains tax rates has
removed much of the attraction for using shares as disguised income (though
some tax benefits remain).
The second factor which helped to spur greater employee ownership in the
1980s - the financial backing of banks - has also receded. This is due in
part to the unwillingness of many of the world's biggest banks to increase
their loan portfolios as aggressively as before, if at all: they will be
subject to more stringent capital adequacy rules from 1993, and need to
ration the use of their funds more carefully.
A further factor has been the recessions in the US and UK, which have
greatly reduced the leveraged buy-outs (also known as management buy-outs)
which drew heavily on bank finance in the 1980s. The over-borrowing of many
such vehicles has led to more cautious financial structuring of buy-outs in
the 1990s.
As a result, lending to Esops in the US has tumbled. Last year, it amounted
to around Dollars 2bn, a fifth of its level two years before. Management
buy-outs are still being completed, but on a far smaller scale than before.
The Esop has yet to catch on in a big way elsewhere. By harnessing bank
finance to acquire shares for workers, and by using existing shares rather
than newly-created ones (and thereby avoiding diluting the stakes of
existing shareholders), Esops offer the best opportunity for large-scale
employee ownership, rather than the drip-feed offered by other share
benefits.
But in the UK, the idea has been slow to catch on - around Pounds
300m-Pounds 400m has been lent to Esops so far, according to New Bridge
Street Consultants, an employee benefits consultancy.
The 1980s boom in employee ownership may have ended: but there are
continuing factors which suggest that the trend could be set to continue in
the 1990s, albeit in a different form.
The continued privatisation of enterprises around the world, and the use of
share incentives by companies which operate internationally, provide the two
main thrusts.
Privatisation has advanced the cause of employee ownership in two ways. It
creates new publicly-traded companies: with more workers in the private
sector of the economy, share ownership can be spread more widely.
This is especially true in eastern Europe, where the creation of joint-stock
companies is making employee share ownership (and indeed all other types of
share ownership) possible for the first time since the nationalisations
earlier this century.
Privatisation also creates the opportunity for management buy-outs, with
workers going the whole way and taking full control of their enterprises. In
the UK, for instance, privatisation of bus companies has acted as a spur to
management buy-outs, and the sale of trust-owned ports looks likely to have
a similar effect.
Employee ownership is now more prevalent in the bus industry than in any
other industry in the UK, according to a survey by Capital Strategies, an
employee buy-out adviser: employee-owned firms account for around a third of
the private-sector bus market.
Meanwhile, it was recently announced that three of the UK's biggest trust
ports - Tilbury, Medway and Clyde - are to be sold to their managers and
employees (though the transfer of the ports into private ownership has not
been a smooth process: the first to be privatised, Tees &amp; Hartlepool, caused
a political uproar when the employees and the highest bidders were passed
over.)
A second factor likely to lead to wider employee ownership over the next
decade is the use of share schemes by companies which operate
internationally. US and UK companies, for instance, have begun to export
share incentives to workers outside their home territories, encouraged by
the apparent success of such schemes at home.
Legal and fiscal differences have held back the export of such schemes,
making them a time-consuming and expensive process. But that has not stopped
companies pushing ahead. Guinness, the UK drinks and leisure group, last
year offered share incentives to employees in 21 countries, modelled closely
on the savings related share option scheme it has maintained in the UK for
many years (under this, employees save for five or seven years and use the
money at the end of the period to take up options on shares at a discount to
the share price at the outset). The average take-up rate by employees
outside the UK is an impressive 60 per cent.
Guinness' approach is unusual. More commonly, companies shape share
incentives to meet local tax and cultural factors, creating a patchwork of
schemes around the world. But according to Mr Mike Redhouse, Guinness's head
of remuneration and benefits: 'We knew that this would cause a huge amount
of work to implement, an administrative nightmare to operate and
inequalities between employees in different countries.'
The development of such incentives in internationally active companies
varies greatly, according to a report on financial participation in Europe
conducted by The Wyatt Company, a remuneration and benefits consultancy. UK
companies have done most to export financial participation schemes
(including profit sharing and savings plans, as well as stock option and
purchase schemes): more than half use such arrangements abroad, compared to
around three quarters at home. By comparison, while a similar proportion of
German companies offer incentives at home, only 40 per cent have exported
the idea. Companies based in other European countries had done far less for
their workers abroad.
Nor is there any common pattern in how companies introduce benefits
overseas. According to The Wyatt Company, 47 per cent of US companies
operating in Sweden have introduced share options for their workers there:
by comparison, only 11 per cent of US companies in France have similar
benefits. Again, tax and cultural differences predominate.
The European Commission, in its drive to create a single labour market in
the EC, has made efforts to overcome these differences, though it has
stopped short of legislating on the subject.
Last year, it issued a recommendation that member states encourage the use
of financial participation. The Commission also intends to study the
possibility of creating common structures for share schemes to apply across
the Community, although any legislation on the matter is likely to be years
away.

FT  24 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Comment hits media stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKETMAKERS worried by the relative strength in media stocks took their
chance to adjust prices yesterday. They seized on news that the Labour party
would launch a monopoly inquiry into cross-media ownership if it wins power
in the April 9 general election.
Pearson, Reed International and News International all fell sharply.
However, the turnovers of 250,000, 1m and 152,000 shares respectively
suggested that few genuine sellers were behind the falls. A partial recovery
left Pearson a net 13 off at 770p and Reed 14 down on the day at 499p.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, the only company likely to be
seriously affected by a cross-media ownership review and believed to be
Labour's principal target, fell 12 to 341p.
Reed was also depressed by a profits forecast cut from agency broker James
Capel, which reduced its current year estimate from Pounds 225m to Pounds
217m. Capel said the change was not great in financial terms but had a
psychological effect as it brought the figure below last year's Pounds
221.8m.
Forth Ports debut
Scottish port operator Forth Ports came to the market yesterday and was the
third most heavily traded stock. The shares surged above the offer price of
110p to close at 122p. Volume was a heavy 9m, which equates to around 31 per
cent of equity.
The group, which was owned by the UK government, operates all the ports in
the Firth of Forth and last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m.
Although profits are expected to decline this year - mainly because of a
fall in orders for British Pipe Coaters, which treats pipes at Leith -
analysts are generally enthusiastic about Forth's prospects.
Mr Mark Laurence at Smith New Court said: 'The price of the placing will
ensure a strong following for the stock, and we think a fundamental value of
Forth could support a share price of around 145p.'
Drugs feature
Sharp polarity in the performances of Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham left a
number of observers slightly bemused as there seemed to be no specific
stories driving the stock prices.
At first sight, investors appeared to be switching from one stock to the
other. However, the impetus came, as it often does, from New York.
US securities houses were strong buyers of Glaxo, partly on weakness, partly
because a number of them - Smith Barney for example - are continually
reiterating their buy stance on the shares, and partly because nervousness
over the forthcoming UK general election is promoting a return to defensive
stocks. Glaxo shares jumped 18 to 782p.
SmithKline has a large exposure to consumer recovery, or the lack of it, in
the UK. It reacted, yesterday, to heavy selling of the Units on Friday. The
'A' shares dropped 22 to 855p while the Units slid 112 further to 3928p.
A report that oil reserves in Colombia's Cusiana oil field may be smaller
than expected hurt shares in BP, which has a 40 per cent interest in the
field. The stock lost 4 to 258p on turnover of 5.9m, also dampened by County
NatWest reiterating its negative stance at the house morning meeting.
Royal Insurance moved against the general trend and rose 4 to 174p following
a buy recommendation from County NatWest.
Mr David Nisbet, County's insurance analyst, changed his short-term stance
to buy from hold. He said the stock was trading at 'almost half its net
asset value' and argued that, although there were risks attached, its
discount to asset value should be closer to 40 per cent. This would put the
share price at around Pounds 2, he added.
The running saga over British Aerospace's long-promised Saudi Arabian
defence contract continued to drag the group down as talk in the market
suggested further delays - and possible cancellations - to the signing. BAe,
14 weaker at one stage, recovered to 291p for a fall of 10 on the day.
Aerospace, cargo handling and electronic component distributor ML Holdings
received the unwelcome attention of TT Group as the latter took a 7 per cent
stake. ML, whose shares collapsed from 53p after its interims in January,
rose 7 to 28p. TT was steady at 200p.
Dividend hopes helped Bridon add 4 at 89p. Reports that Smith New Court had
turned a seller of British Steel left the stock 2 1/2 easier at 75p after
busy turnover of 11m.
BET advanced 6 to 131p on news of the appointment of Sir Christopher Harding
as chairman. The stock was also helped by sentiment that the dividend would
be maintained.
Further nervousness at Harland Simon - the group issued a profits warning in
February - saw the shares drop 28 to 103p.
Selected property shares were sold as the swing towards Labour in the
opinion polls unnerved some investors with the feeling that a Labour
government would prolong the sector's plight. British Land lost 14 to 189p
as a big line of stock went through. Land Securities slipped 9 to 394p, and
Hammerson 'A' 8 to 405p. Sentiment was also unhinged by the problems at
Olympia &amp; York.
There was further recovery in Guinness after the initial caution that
followed last week's figures. The shares firmed 3 to 561p in a subdued
brewing and drinks sector. The main reason for the earlier caution was
Guinness's suggestion that there is unlikely to be a speedy end to the
recession in its major whisky markets.
This view was echoed by Macallan-Glenlivet, the much smaller but prestigious
malt whisky producer. Like Guinness, yesterday's figures for 1991 were good,
with profits rising to Pounds 6.36m from Pounds 5.34m, but it warned that
trading conditions remain difficult. The shares slipped 12 to 163p.
British Airways' purchase of a German airline helped it to gain 5 to 253p.
The move will strengthen BA's position in the German regional commuter
market.
Stores conglomerate Kingfisher bucked the downward trend, holding at 466p
ahead of tomorrow's results, which some analysts fear will fail to equal
last year's profits of Pounds 215.3m.
Market predictions of profits around the Pounds 60m mark proved fairly
accurate for Argos, which turned in Pounds 62.09 pre-tax for 1991, compared
with Pounds 75.11m previously. Strong cash flow allowed the company to
increase its dividend but the shares fell 4 to 253p as analysts worried that
it may be losing its 'value for money image'.

FT  24 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities fall after poor trade
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH worse than expected trade figures for February set the seal on a dismal
trading session and saw London's equity market close at its lowest level
this year. At the close of business, the FT-SE 100-share index showed a 15.6
decline at 2,441.0.
The poor trade figures were seen as damaging even more the chances of the
ruling Conservative government being re-elected on April 9. The figures came
hard on the heels of the latest batch of opinion polls published over the
weekend. Of the five poll results, four indicated a Labour lead over the
Tories with one favouring the Conservatives.
Dealers were said to be bracing themselves for more bad news in the
never-ending stream of polls, with today expected to bring another reading
of the nation's current political leanings. However, it was pointed out by
traders that the City had absorbed the latest bad news on the economy with
minimum fuss.
They said that, although the trade figures ruffled the stock market, they
did little to upset the foreign exchange and bond markets. Sterling closed
higher against both the dollar and the D-Mark, promoting stability in the
gilt-edged market, where prices closed virtually unaltered after initial
small gains and a subsequent bout of nervousness in midsession.
The first trading session of the new account began relatively brightly, with
marketmakers opening prices around Friday's levels in the hope that much of
the political news had been expected and factored into prices last week. An
opening decline of four points on the Footsie reflected an unusually large
number of constituents - including BAT Industries, Legal &amp; General, Reuters
and BTR - going ex-dividend, a factor that lowered the index by over five
points. Little genuine institutional business was transacted during the
early part of the morning, with the Footsie future again leading the primary
market lower after a relatively sedate start to trading.
Evidence of a small programme trade and growing nervousness about the trade
figures then began to unsettle the market, which showed a loss of 18 points
before the trade numbers were published. After this, the market fell
sharply, reaching the session's low of 2,427.9, or down 28.7, as Wall Street
came in lower.
A determined rally developed towards the close, however, with buyers said to
have been stimulated by hopes of a better showing for the Conservatives in
an opinion poll expected this morning and by a firmer trend on Wall Street.
The Labour party's election campaign bore down on the media sector, hitting
shares in Pearson, Reed International News International and Granada as Mr
Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of Labour, said his party would launch a
monopoly inquiry into cross-media ownership if it wins the election.
Property shares were sold hard as investors took fright at the latest
developments surrounding international property development group Olympia &amp;
York.
Equity turnover remained at miserably low levels. Yesterday's 370.6m
compared very badly with Friday's 587.8m.

FT  24 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak bonds weigh on
continental bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK bond markets pushed most bourses lower yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT more than wiped out Friday's 11-point gain, which had been
generated by the 'quadruple witching hour' expiry of options and futures.
Attention returned to more worrying aspects, such as cautious statements
from the corporate sector and rising bond yields, which approached 8.10 per
cent at the long end yesterday.
The DAX index ended 18.83 lower at 1,717.47 while the FAZ index, calculated
at midsession, fell 5.31 to 699.13. Turnover fell to DM5.7bn from Friday's
inflated DM15.7bn.
Most blue chips were lower, though BMW stood out with a DM1.10 gain to
DM561.90, supported by last week's good results. In steels, Thyssen fell
DM14.20 to DM218.90 following its chairman's warning that profits this year
would be 'markedly lower' than last year.
Brokers are divided about Thyssen: County NatWest expects a 30 per cent fall
in Thyssen's first half results and is worried by the lack of a dividend
guarantee for the current year from the chairman. James Capel, however, says
the shares are good for a recovery, since it thinks the company will be a
major beneficiary of higher prices for flat steel products.
PARIS fell through the 1,900 support level, pressured by a weaker bond
market and the results of the regional elections. Trading was dominated by
arbitrage activity, with institutions opting to stay away. This was
reflected in the day's moderate turnover of FFr2.4bn, as the CAC-40 index
closed down 34.55 or 1.8 per cent to 1,884.57.
Total fell FFr7.70 or 3.4 per cent to FFr222.40 following a wire agency
report on Friday that the company's Colombian oil find might be smaller than
expected. The company declined to comment, though dealers expect a
clarification at Total's analysts' meeting in two weeks' time.
Yesterday's suspension of Perrier and Exor came as no surprise, and
speculation spilled over from last week that the Agnellis and Nestle had
carved up the mineral water company behind closed doors. There was also talk
that Nestle had lifted its bid for Perrier to FFr1,600 from FFr1,475.
Minority shareholders were still in the dark yesterday, though all should be
revealed at Nestle's news conference today.
MILAN remained on the sidelines ahead of the general election in April, and
corporate results scheduled this week are not expected to provide much
direction. The Comit index fell 1.26 to 510.61 in turnover estimated at
close to Friday's L68bn.
Friday's news that Total of France was interested in buying some of
Pirelli's diversified activities lifted the stock by L2 to L1,265, before
rising to L1,286 after hours. Olivetti rose L7 to L2,919 ahead of news that
it had broadened its collaboration with Canon of Japan.
Shares in the Agnelli group rose on hopes of an amicable settlement with
Nestle over Perrier, with Fiat adding L4 to L4,849. Ifi fell L120 to L12,370
but reached L12,850 later.
In telecoms, Sirti eased L15 to L10,740 on rumours of a scrip issue.
AMSTERDAM weakened in dull trading as the CBS Tendency Index closed 0.8
lower at 125.0 in turnover of FL 401.6m. The crash in the US of a Fokker
aircraft sent the shares down to close Fl 1.00 lower or 3 per cent at Fl
33.40. Elsevier weakened 20 cents to Fl 114.30 following Friday's results
which were in line with expectations. Nedlloyd advanced Fl 1.00 or 1.7 per
cent to Fl 59.00 having been under pressure last week after a
debt-for-equity swap was announced.
ZURICH closed slightly off the day's lows with rising money market rates and
a weak bond market keeping activity down. The SMI index fell 18.9 to
1,818.2.
Banks and insurers lost ground: CS Holding bearers fell SFr10 to SFr1,960
and UBS bearers shed SFr30 to SFr3,750. George Fischer bearers closed down
SFr15 at SFr1,020 ahead of reporting a dividend cut.
STOCKHOLM declined on profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden General Index ended
down 8.1 at 1,001.6 in turnover of SKr594m, down from SKr830m. Volvo B
closed up SKr1 at SKr412. Reports that Mr Soeren Gyll, chief executive of
Procordia, was to replace Mr Christer Zetterberg as Volvo chief came after
the close.
MADRID closed with the general index shedding 2.19 to 256.19.

FT  24 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Norway takes heart from good US data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN moves were found in smaller stock markets last week as a rise on
Wall Street and weakness in Japan kept the overall global equity performance
steady. According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the world index rose
just 0.27 per cent in local currency terms.
Norway provided the biggest gain on the week, of 4.2 per cent, but Mr Klas
Andersson of Goldman Sachs says the stimulus came from good economic data in
the US rather than from domestic news. Norsk Hydro led the way with an
advance of 6.3 per cent.
The rise in the index was matched by improved volume, thanks partly to a
domestic placing. In the first two months of this year, liquidity has been
constrained by the lack of big domestic participants, such as the banks
which, because of a crisis in the industry, are now mostly state-owned. Uni
Storebrand, the insurer, in its pursuit of Skandia, the Swedish insurance
group, has also neglected the domestic stock market.
The longer term outlook for Norwegian equities is favourable as the
continued fall in inflation prepares the ground for lower domestic interest
rates. Cyclical heavyweights are expected to take heart from further signs
of recovery in the US. Volatility, however, is likely in the short term, due
to the rapid buying and selling by foreign investors as sentiment changes.
Singapore was the worst performer of the week, falling 1.8 per cent in local
currency terms. The market fell in tandem with Tokyo last week, but the low
volume indicated that there was no large sell-off.
Elsewhere, Mexico recovered 1.8 per cent after falling 5.5 per cent the
previous week on investor caution ahead of the share offers in Cemex, Telmex
and Banacci, to the tune of Dollars 703bn. Latin American Securities says
last week's successful placements of Bancomer and Sears show that the market
is still thirsty for new paper.

FT  24 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gains
as hopes for rate cut recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Early gains were lost as hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount
rate receded, and the Nikkei average closed only slightly ahead, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally 54.51 up at 20,239.60, after having risen
to a day's high of 20,434.71 on foreign buying in the morning. It fell to
the day's low of 20,160.24 as stock index futures weakened in the afternoon.
Volume dropped to 280m shares from 550m, but advances still led declines by
672 to 323 at the close, with 162 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained a net 8.74 at 1,459.88. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index lost 2.23 at 1,135.35.
Shares rose in the morning on continued hopes of an imminent discount rate
cut, which had pushed the Nikkei above the psychologically important 20,000
level last Thursday. However, a rise in the overnight call rate, which is
controlled by the Bank of Japan's money market operations, discouraged
market participants.
Money supply growth figures for February, which fell to a record low of 1.6
per cent, also restrained investors. Traders said investors linked the weak
figures with continued slow economic growth and lower company earnings.
High-technology blue chips rose on bargain hunting by foreigners. Hitachi
added Y15 at Y774 and Toshiba Y2 at Y586. Also gaining ground were brokers,
Nomura rising Y60 to Y1,250 and Daiwa Y30 to Y800.
Car and related shares were weak on Japan's decision last week to cut its
voluntary ceiling on car exports to the US. Toyota Motor shed Y20 to Y1,360
and Nippondenso Y100 to Y1,350. Mitsubishi Motors fell Y92 to Y612 on heavy
selling amid rumours that Chrysler, of the US, would liquidate its
shareholding in Mitsubishi.
Small-capital component stocks of the Nikkei average, with low liquidity,
fell on index-related selling. Godo Shusei lost Y170 to Y1,640 and Daito
Woollen Spinning and Weaving Y140 to Y1,560.
A leading Japanese brokerage was seen selling Sankyo, down Y10 at Y2,470,
and Takeda Chemical, unchanged at Y1,070. This triggered declines in other
pharmaceutical issues.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 145.01 at 21,696.08 in volume of 561.2m
shares. Small-lot buying by foreigners and individuals lifted the index,
while volume swelled on cross-trades by companies.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets were generally firmer. Bombay was closed.
HONG KONG opened higher and maintained its strength during the day, the Hang
Seng index finishing 45.33 ahead at 5,061.14 in turnover of HKDollars 2.5bn,
after HKDollars 2.7bn.
Utilities were active: Hong Kong Electric put on 30 cents to HKDollars 16
and China Light and Gas HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 32.75. Banks rose
moderately, HSBC gaining 25 cents to HKDollars 41.50 and subsidiary Hang

NatSteel fell 16 cents to SDollars 3.68 after reporting a 20 per cent drop

Gains were posted across the board on support from the Securities Market
Stabilisation Fund. Particularly strong were issues that have already
reported or are expected to announce good 1991 results.
TAIWAN fell further, dragged lower by political worries as the National
Assembly started to debate constitutional reforms. The weighted index closed
59.87 or 1.3 per cent down at 4,685.16 in turnover of TDollars 17.26bn
(TDollars 14.2bn).
MANILA weakened after Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) lost ground
in the US on Friday. The composite index finished 18.38 down at 1,101.79 in
turnover of 91m pesos, up from 52m pesos. PLDT fell 15 pesos to 860 pesos.
BANGKOK failed to be influenced by the general election and the SET index
closed at its highest since June last year, registering a rise of 12.80 at
827.19 in turnover of Bt7.1bn.
Investors were said to be buying finance shares, anticipating better than
expected first-quarter earnings.

index closed 2.6 firmer at 1,586.7 in turnover of ADollars 152m.
News Corporation strengthened 38 cents to ADollars 18.00, but BHP eased 2
cents to ADollars 13.42 and Western Mining receded 5 cents to ADollars 4.81.
NEW ZEALAND drifted through a quiet session and the NZSE-40 index finished
the day down 2.51 at 1,436.30 following turnover of NZDollars 7.9m.
Lion Nathan rose 4 cents to NZDollars 3.82, but fellow brewer Magnum
retreated 3 cents to 99 cents over difficulties in selling part of its
retail businesses.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India's bumper tea crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S 1991 tea exceeded the target by more than 6m kg to reach 741.7m kg.
In 1990 production was 714.7m kg.
Last year's rise was achieved in the face of serious problems on the Assam
tea estates, which account for more than 52 per cent of national output,
posed by the militant activity of the United Liberation Front of Assam and
the Bodos tribe, which is fighting for a separate state within Assam.
While Assam's crop rose nearly 8m kg to 388m kg, the rest of the north
Indian crop advanced by 4.5m kg to 168.8m kg. Although management was
severely hampered in many Assam tea gardens, quality was generally up to the
mark.
Aided once again by favourable weather, South India raised its tea crop by
14.5m kg to 185m kg, following 1990s spectacular rise of 18.7m kg.
For the same reason, the Sri Lankan tea crop increased last year by 7.5m kg
to 240.7m kg.
The share of CTC (cut tear and curl) and orthodox teas in the Indian total
was is 578m kg and 155.4m kg respectively. Miscellaneous varieties
constituted the balance of 8.3m kg.
According to Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the industry, in spite of the
former Soviet Union buying only 109.6m kg (repeat 109.6m kg) of Indian tea
in 1991, compared with 124.32m kg in the previous year, total Indian tea
exports rose to 203.57m kg from 199.66m kg. That was because India was able
to step up tea exports to hard currency countries to 87.87m kg from 66.66m
kg. The UK bought 23.84m kg, up from 22.24m kg, while Iran, West Germany,
Ireland, the Netherlands, the US, Egypt and Saudi Arabia all bought more
Indian tea.
The Indian tea industry, according to Mr Dudeja, earned lower profits in
1991 because prices lost ground. Compared with Rs43.27 (90p) a kilogram in
1990, the average auction price realisation last year was Rs40.31 a
kilogram. Lower Soviet purchases and the reluctance of the trade to maintain
stocks because of high interest rate were responsible for the price falls.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US likely to pull out of sugar
organisation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is expected to pull out of the International Sugar Organisation as a
result of last week's decision at negotiations in Geneva to retain the
possibility of ISO action to stabilise prices in the market.
The US had insisted that wording in the present International Sugar
Agreement allowing for negotiation of a new accord with 'economic
provisions' be dropped when the agreement expired at the end of this year.
Washington wanted the London-based ISO downgraded to a 'study group', which
would be simpler and cheaper to run.
The agreement, which came into force in 1987, has no market-intervention
measures, unlike its predecessor. The ISO currently acts primarily as an
information clearing-house and discussion forum.
Though backed by Australia, the US found itself facing strong opposition
from the European Community and Japan as well as producing countries. For
legal reasons some countries cannot join study groups but, more
fundamentally, most ISO members wanted to maintain the flexibility to
negotiate a price stabilisation accord if and when circumstances changed.
The new sugar agreement, which will come into force next year, will be
automatically renewable every two years unless members agree to negotiate
price-stabilisation arrangements.
Although, in a concession to US sensibilities, negotiation of a pact with
economic provisions will no longer be an 'objective' of the new sugar
agreement, Mr Dan Cruz-de-Paula, Washington's chief delegate, said the US
could not join the final consensus on the agreement. The administration will
make a decision on whether to withdraw from the ISO later this year.
A pull-out by the US would be 'very serious but not a disaster', according
to one European delegate at the talks.
Washington now contributes nearly 10 per cent of the ISO's Pounds 1m annual
budget. However, added to the forthcoming reduction in the contribution by
Russia, the organisation will be under heavy pressure to trim costs further.
Russia is paying the share of the former Soviet Union but, as from 1993, it
will pay a reduced amount, based on its own share of world trade. There are
hopes that part of the difference can be made up if the Ukraine and
Belorussia, both big producers, can be persuaded to join.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulgaria far from solving
energy equation - Problems have worsened since the collapse of the Soviet
Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIANS LOVE March 20. It heralds the beginning of spring, even if it was
snowing on that day this year. Spring also brings some hope to Bulgarians
that the energy shortages will end.
But their optimism is not shared by Mr Lulin Radulov, who as president of
Bulgaria's Committee of Energy has the task of co-ordinating the country's
energy needs. This involves buying energy from the Commonwealth of
Independent States and selling it to Bulgarian enterprises, which is more
easily said than done. The republics of the CIS have their own energy
problems.
Since the 1950s, Bulgaria has been heavily dependent on energy supplies from
the CIS. Until recently, 70 per cent of its energy requirements, including
electricity, and all its oil and gas, were imported from the CIS.
'In the past, we imported about 12m tonnes of oil each year from the former
Soviet Union, and about 3m tonnes of coal. We obtained about 500,000 tonnes
of coal over the past three months. I do not know if these supplies will
continue,' said Mr Radulov.
The CIS, which used to supply about 10 per cent of Bulgaria's total
electricity needs, is now providing less than 3 per cent.
'You cannot even talk about negotiating with the CIS. There is no central
authority with whom to negotiate,' said Mr Radulov.
As a result, Bulgaria's committee of energy, and Bulgarian enterprises, are
now trying to deal directly with the enterprises in republics of the CIS.
But neither have money.
'We can hardly pay for our energy imports. We are owed about 1bn lev
(USDollars 42m) from Bulgarian enterprises. The greater the energy cutbacks,
the greater the fall in industrial output, and revenue for our enterprises,'
he explained.
Because of the energy shortages, about 60 per cent of Bulgaria's heavy
industrial sector is operating at 50 per cent capacity.
Some enterprises have found a way of breaking this vicious circle by
resorting to barter with energy suppliers in the CIS. But Mr Radulov added
that there were still problems in transporting the energy to Bulgarian
enterprises.
'For instance, if enterprises deal directly with enterprises in the Ukraine,
the supplies have to pass through the former Soviet republic of Moldova,
which can demand high transit fees. It is very costly,' explained Mr
Radulov.
Bulgaria's own energy sector is in no position to compensate for the
shortfall in supplies from the CIS. Under the recommendation of the
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, two of the five reactors at
Kozluduy, near the Romanian border, which were built in 1974 and 1975, were
shut down last autumn because of very poor safety standards. The two 440 Mw
units had supplied 10 per cent of Bulgaria's electricity.
'There is nothing wrong with the construction of these Soviet-designed
reactors. The problem is that under the communist system, the management was
very poor. Pressure to increase production levels took precedence over
safety standards. It was really awful,' explained Mr Radulov.
'Maybe the IAEA should have identified these problems at a much earlier
stage. Maybe the IAEA did not fulfil its (monitoring) obligations over the
years. But much of the blame must be placed on the communist-controlled
management at Kozluduy,' said Mr Radulov. The management was replaced last
year.
An international team of experts that has been working on the two reactors
for the past few months says the units fall below western safety standards.
It points out, for example, that the two reactors lack emergency cooling
systems. Unlike their Bulgarian counterparts, the experts are not convinced
that the reactors should start operating again in the autumn. 'It would cost
about Dollars 200m to bring these two old units fully up to western
standards,' one expert said.
A sixth unit, with a 1,000 Mw, is undergoing tests before going into
operation.
The shutdown of the two reactors, and the cut in energy supplies from the
CIS, has meant that the Bulgarian government has had to consider boosting
output from its own domestic hydro-electrical plants, increasing coal
production and finding new foreign suppliers. None of these options look
particularly promising.
For one thing, water in the hydro-electric plants' reservoirs has been
depleted because of consecutive years of drought. Second, three quarters of
Bulgaria's lignite coal production, which is earmarked for generating
electricity, contains a high moisture and ash content. This has led to an
increase in atmospheric pollution. The use of dry-burning and other
technical options could help reduce the pollution. But the technologies are
costly.
The third possibility, importing regular supplies of oil at world market
prices, is not yet feasible. Bulgaria is in the process of negotiating the
rescheduling of its Dollars 9.6bn debt with its western commercial bank
creditors. Until these talks have been concluded it cannot expect fresh
loans.
As an interim measure, the first tranche of a World Bank loan of Dollars
150m, which was released late last year, has been used to pay for imports of
petroleum products, including heavy fuel oil.
In the long term, Mr Radulov says a strategy for Bulgaria's future energy
requirements is urgently needed.
He dismisses suggestions that the economic reforms, which have already led
to the liberalisation of prices, including energy, will in the short term
make enterprises and domestic consumers more sparing in their use of use of
energy.
'We have to address two issues. First, we have to move away from a
heavy-industrial sector which uses a great deal of energy. Second, saving
energy must be linked to the efficient production and use of energy.
'Let me give you some examples,' he said.
'Apartments are badly insulated. Local residential districts, or apartment
blocks, are controlled by a centralised heating system. This means there are
no thermostats in the individual apartments. A room's temperature is
regulated by opening or closing the windows,' he explained.
But the energy loss began much earlier in the system than that, said Mr
Radulov. 'We waste about 30 per cent of electricity because of the
inefficient way we produce it. Another 10 per cent is wasted as it runs
through the grid system. Gas is wasted as well. The domestic supply is not
linked to a grid system. Consumers use gas cans,' he said.

hit by drought

<TEXT>
THE PORTUGUESE government, faced with what could turn out to be one of the
country's most severe droughts in decades, has decided to allocate about
Esc20bn (Pounds 80m) to help farmers in the most badly affected areas.
A separate line of emergency credit to help farmers facing financial
difficulties may also be launched soon if the situation does not improve.
The government aid, which will be partly funded by the European Community,
will go mostly to farmers raising livestock and growing grain.
The decision was well received by several farming associations that had been
pressing the social democratic administration for urgent action to avert
what they claimed was a 'catastrophy' threatening the livelihood of
thousands of farmers.
Large parts of the interior and of the Alentejo in the south have not seen
any rain for months and local farmers fear they will lose their livestock
and crops unless the weather changes within days rather than weeks. In many
areas entire communities have joined in emotional processions and in special
prayers for rain.
Daily reports in the newspapers and on television have been filled with
pictures showing dried up wells and rivers in the middle of parched and
cracked land, with emaciated cattle feeding on scant patches of dried up
grass.
The drought could not come at a worse time for Portuguese agriculture, which
already suffers from the lowest productivity in the EC. With the advent of
the community's single market, protection and price subsidies are having to
be cut drastically, and many farmers already say they will not be able to
survive the increase in competition from imports.
Farmers have accused the government of failing to defend their interest in
the community and last summer launched a spate of spontaneous demonstrations
that took the government and the established farm unions by surprise.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil expects 28% fall in
coffee crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S 1992-93 coffee crop will be down 28 per cent at 18.9m bags (60 kg
each), Mr Antonio Cabrera, the agriculture minister, has forecast. The
1991-92 harvest was 27.4m bags.
The supply will fall well short of fulfilling demand for Brazilian coffee.
Last year, exports alone reached 21m bags, though that figure could fall to
18m-19m this year. Domestic consumption is expected to remain steady at
about 9m bags.
To meet demand, the government is likely to release part of its 17m-bag
reserve stock.
The minister blamed the reduction on the crop's normal two-year cycle,
exacerbated by falling productivity stemming from decreased fertiliser use
and less pest control. He also cited low rainfall between August and October
1991.
The low harvest also reflects a downward trend in the overall area dedicated
to coffee. The number of trees has dropped by 1bn since the 1988-89 season,
according to ministry figures.
Meanwhile, the Brazilian government continues to prepare its position for
negotiations on the International Coffee Agreement, scheduled to begin in
London on April 6. Officials remain reticent about revealing their probable
stance. Their job is complicated by continued divisions in the private
sector.
The National Coffee Council, a producer group, is arguing for quotas and the
Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters is prepared to discuss them.
But Mr Dagmar Oswaldo Cupaiolo, president of the Sao Paulo State Coffee
Processors Association, said: 'Discussing economic clauses doesn't mean
accepting quotas. . . Quotas are not in the interest of Brazil, nor in the
interest of my sector'.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead and zinc produced at a
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIM HOLDINGS of Australia is not making money from lead and zinc at present
prices of 22 cents a lb and 55 cents a lb respectively, according to Mr Norm
Fussell, the chief executive.
MIM accounts for 10 per cent of lead produced outside the former communist
bloc and 6 per cent of the zinc. It also produces 4 per cent of the copper
and Mr Fussell said these operations were profitable at present prices of
about Dollars 1 a lb.
During an interview in London where he was meeting institutional investors
he warned that the recession in metals markets would continue to be felt for
some time. MIM was not relying on a recovery in prices to solve its problems
 -'we must do that ourselves by cutting costs and improving productivity'.
Mr Fussell said there were very clear signs that metals demand was improving
in the US. In Europe, although demand for metals was as poor as at the end
of last year, there was more optimism in the markets. However, slowing
economic growth in Japan was becoming more accentuated. He suggested: 'There
is every chance of a recession there'.
What this would mean for metals demand was difficult to judge, however,
because so much of Japan's output was exported. The good, solidly-based
recovery in the US would help Japanese and European exports.
He said that a world-wide move to 'just in time' stocks meant that the
recovery process would be much more transparent than after the previous
recession in 1982. Then there were six months stocks of metals and it was a
long time after recovery started before the trend was widely recognised.
Mr Fussell recalled that a year ago MIM set itself a target of reducing
annual costs at its Mount Isa operations by ADollars 100m within two years.
'After one year we are now 70 per cent of the way there. We also have
targeted a 40 per cent improvement in productivity by 1995. After one year
we are half-way towards this longer range target. Since the Dollars 100m
cost reduction objective for Mount Isa was announced, productivity, as
measured by tonnes treated per man shift, has risen by 21 per cent.'
He said that MIM's diversification from mining into downstream operations
helped it to overcome the volatility of smelting and refining charges, which
fluctuated widely as economies swung from full capacity to recession and
back again.
He reported on some of the downstream activities in Europe in which MIM has
stakes. The Rheinzinc, zinc products, and Norddeutsche Affinerie, copper
smelter and refinery, were operating profitably. However, the Ruhr-Zink and
Duisburg refineries 'are suffering from depressed zinc and lead prices and
will turn round as economies recover'.

Three-months ALUMINIUM prices bounced off the key Dollars 1,300 a tonne
level on the LME, but still closed well below Friday. The market came under
pressure from hedge selling and liquidation, with fundamentals pointing
downwards. LME stock figures are forecast to rise again today. Trade in
other LME metals was largely routine, with little emerging in the way of
news to disturb markets from recent ranges. GOLD closed almost unchanged on
the London bullion market. Dealers said the market was moving to test the
upside of its Dollars 336 to Dollars 340 a troy ounce range in the absence
of the physical sales that sent the market to near six-year lows last week.
PLATINUM was fixed at Dollars 351.50 before retesting the the day's highs
around Dollars 352 on news that the death toll in weekend fighting at Impala
Platinum's Bafokeng North mine had risen to 13. About 8,000 employees on the
morning shift did not report for work yesterday. Platinum faces stiff
resistance at Dollars 358, but is garnering support from expectations of a
Japanese discount rate cut.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Options market adopts revised
margining regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVISED margining regime came into force in the UK options market
yesterday which, some traders claim, will have a significant impact on the
way options are traded.
For some, the revised regime - one consequence of the merger of the London
Traded Options Market with the London International Financial Futures
Exchange, which was completed on Sunday - has come as an unpleasant
surprise.
One trader complained his margin requirement - the collateral he must
provide to guard against losses on his trading positions - had jumped more
than threefold, to more than Pounds 750,000 (Dollars 1.2m), as a result of
the merger. As a result, he must unwind some of his positions to reduce his
exposure - a fact that made him reluctant to be named.
However, Liffe said the new rules had reduced the margining requirements for
most options traders. As such, they may help to encourage trading of
individual stock options, which have languished in London in the past.
The new method of assessing margining for options is one which has been in
use for some time on the futures market. It is based on the 'Span' method
for calculating margins, developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
used in London by Liffe and other derivatives markets. Liffe claims the
system is more sensitive to risk than its previous version, or that used by
the traded options market.
'The intention is to assess risk more accurately. There are particular
situations where it will result in an increase in margin, but they are very
few,' Liffe said. The Span method assesses margin requirements by taking an
overall view of a trader's portfolio. Factors which determine margin levels
include market volatility over the past six months. One result of this has
been to push up margining for stocks which have fallen in recent months, in
some cases substantially. Previously, the traded options market applied only
a nominal margining requirement for options which are substantially 'out of
the money' (where the exercise price and current market price are far apart,
making exercise unlikely).
The implications of this for the market are only just beginning to sink in.
As one trader said: 'Before, you tried to get spreads as wide apart as
possible. Now, the aim will be to get them as close to the money as
possible.'
He complained Liffe had done little to educate traders or brokers about the
implications of the new rules, making it difficult to adapt a trading
strategy to the new regime.
Liffe said it had used workshops and other methods to publicise the changes
in advance. However, the full implications of the system seem only to have
sunk in the past fortnight, since Liffe first told traders what their new
margins would be.
The first day's business on London's newly-merged futures and options
markets failed to inspire a burst of celebratory trading, writes Tracy
Corrigan.
Volume in FT-SE 100 index options reached 11,300 yesterday, virtually
unchanged from Friday, against an uninspiring stock market. Index options
are expected to benefit most from the merger, partly because cross-margining
between the FT-SE futures and options contracts is now allowed - that is,
traders can net off trading positions in the two contracts.
The market in individual stock options, which the merger is designed to
revive, tailed off yesterday. Volume reached 17,700, down from 27,400 on
Friday, but in line with average daily volume in February.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Merrill chairman awarded
Dollars 16.8m salary package

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERRILL Lynch, the big US securities house which last year earned record
profits of Dollars 696m, has awarded its chairman a 1991 pay package of
salary and stock options worth a current indicated value of Dollars 16.8m.
The pay package for Mr William Schreyer, Merrill chairman for the past
decade, is one of the largest ever seen on Wall Street and is likely to add
fresh fuel to the simmering controversy in the US over excessive pay awards
to top business executives.
Only last week, it was revealed that Coca-Cola, the soft drinks group, had
given its chairman 1m shares of restricted stock with a current market value
of more than Dollars 80m.
Institutional investors and shareholders rights' groups in the US have
argued recently that too many senior executives are being overpaid, and have
targeted in particular the inclusion of stock options in pay awards.
Merrill, however, defended the payout yesterday. Mr James Wiggins, director
of media relations at the securities firm said: 'All of our compensation
formulas are designed to pay for performance, and they reflect a record year
of earnings for the company when shareholders saw the value of their common
stock nearly triple.'
Mr Wiggins also pointed out that only Dollars 5.9m of the package had been
paid to Mr Schreyer. The remainder consisted of 300,000 in stock options
which Mr Schreyer can exercise only at yearly intervals over the next four
years.
Based on the difference between the options' exercise price of Dollars
21.375 and Merrill's current share price of almost Dollars 60, the options
package is worth nearly Dollars 11m.
Mr Schreyer could earn more, or less, from the options over the four years
depending upon how well the company's share price performs. Merrill said Mr
Schreyer had so far not taken up his rights to any of the options, neither
had he exercised any of the 300,000 options he was awarded in 1990, when his
cash payout was Dollars 1.6m.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Unibanco launches Dollars 100m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market dwindled to a virtual standstill yesterday
due to adverse conditions in most continental European government bond
markets and an overhang of paper in the dollar sector.
But there was some activity in the specialised market for Latin American
borrowers.
Unibanco (Uniao de Bancos Brasilieros), a private-sector Brazilian bank,
launched a Dollars 100m two-year deal, arranged by Citicorp Investment Bank.
The deal carries a 10 per cent coupon and was priced to yield 10 1/2 per
cent semi-annually, which amounts to a spread over the comparable US
Treasury of 462 basis points.
The deal was oversubscribed, according to Citicorp and was bid at 99 1/8 at
the close of European trading, just above its fixed reoffer level.
Spreads on Brazilian issues have tightened dramatically. State sector
borrowers are now paying around 350 basis points over the comparable
Treasury yield at two years, against 600 to 700 basis points when Brazil
returned to the market last year, despite the fact Brazil has still not
reached an agreement with its creditor banks over its commercial debt
restructuring.
Another Brazilian borrower is expected to tap the Eurodollar bond market
shortly. Copene (Copanhia Petroquimica do Nordeste), a private sector
petrochemical company, is preparing to launch a Dollars 50m two-year deal
which will have an 11 per cent coupon, with a 12 per cent yield to maturity.
Neither the Unibanco nor the Copene deals will be affected by a change in
Brazilian withholding tax rules. However, future deals must have a maturity
of more than 2 1/2 years in order to be exempt from 25 per cent withholding
tax on coupon payments to foreign investors. Until now, the minimum maturity
for exemption was two years.

<TEXT>
FAMILY shareholders in Sibille-Dalle, one of the few remaining French-owned
paper groups, have agreed to sell a 34 per cent stake to Ahlstrom, the
diversified Finnish industrial group with interests in the paper business.
The deal, the price of which is not revealed, lifts Ahlstrom's investment in
Sibille-Dalle, an unquoted company with a turnover of FFr2.8bn (Dollars
500m) which makes specialist papers, from 13 per cent to 47 per cent. The
shares are being sold by the Bonduelle family, owners of vegetable canning
business of the same name.
The remaining majority stake will continue to be held by the Sibille-Dalle
family, which merged its paper interests with the Bonduelle paper business
two years ago.
This is the latest in a series of investments by Scandinavian pulp and paper
groups in the French paper industry, seen as attractive for its access to
cheap nuclear powered electricity - valuable to such an energy intensive
business - and to the main European paper markets.
In recent years, Finland's United Paper Mills has acquired French
paper-maker Stracel and Kymmene has taken over La Chapelle-Darblay, France's
main producer of newsprint. MoDo, the Swedish paper group, has taken over
Alicel, while Beghin-Corbehem has been acquired by Stora, another Swedish
group.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bekaert slides to BFr652m
loss

RESTRUCTURING costs hit Bekaert hard last year, turning a BFr508m profit at
the Belgian producer of wire and steel cord into a consolidated loss of
BFr652m (Dollars 18.8m). This compares with the 1990 loss of BFr454m.
Attempts to improve the group's competitiveness in steel cord and
engineering activities cost Bekaert BFr1.16bn in 1991, but the group pointed
out that operating margins and cash-flow had both improved.
The directors, who recommended a cut in Bekaert's dividend in 1990, have
decided to maintain the payout for 1991 at BFr100 per share.
Bekaert's profits collapsed in 1990 and cash-flow halved, but Mr Jean
Charles Velge, the chairman, said yesterday he felt the improving trend of
Bekaert's results would strengthen in 1992.
He pointed out that the improved 1991 results were almost entirely due to
internal efforts.
'Bekaert is not counting on a general economic recovery. We count first and
foremost on our own strengths,' he said.
Volume and turnover fell again last year, reflecting the continued economic
uncertainty in Bekaert's overseas markets, particularly the US and UK, and
persistent and fierce competition among tyre-makers, the principal customers
for the group's steel cord.
Turnover dropped by 7 per cent to BFr53bn from BFr57bn, and sales volume
slipped by 6.7 per cent.
Depreciation charges rose to a new high of BFr3.6bn as a result of the
group's heavy investment programme. Cash-flow recovered to BFr3.99m compared
with BFr2.66m, but that was still short of the 1989 figure of BFr5.68m.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bayerische Vereinsbank up 10%

BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, the large Bavarian-based bank, said that partial
operating profits of its parent company rose by 10 per cent in the first two
months of this year.
Mr Albrecht Schmidt, the chief executive, said yesterday there was no
indication yet of a downturn in the lively lending business which led the
group to report a 21 per cent increase to DM1.2bn (Dollars 720m) in partial
operating profits for the whole of last year.
Mr Schmidt defended the bank's decision to hold the dividend for 1991 at
DM13 per share - the same as in the past five years - in spite of the
advance in profits, saying that the uncertain economic outlook for Germany
made it sensible to harbour its resources and maintain its financial
resilience.
Moreover, he said, the two rights issues last year meant that the total
dividend would actually rise by 16 per cent. He noted that shareholders had
also benefited from a 25 per cent increase in the share price in 1991.
Bayerische Vereinsbank last week announced a rights issue totalling DM627m
to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of new minimum reserve requirements
and to help fund new lending business later in the year.
Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank) said group partial
operating profits rose by 18 per cent last year to DM1.2bn.
Total operating profits, which include trading on the bank's own account,
were 27 per cent higher at nearly DM1.4bn. The bank, which last week
announced a DM910m rights issue, is holding its dividend at DM13 a share.
Hypo-Bank said the lending volume of its parent bank rose by 10 per cent
during the year to DM102bn, with the balance sheet total up by 8 per cent to
DM134bn.
The group balance sheet total was 11 per cent higher at DM193bn.

GALERIES Lafayette, the French stores group, said its parent company's net
profit rose to a provisional FFr177.2m (Dollars 31.6m) in 1991 from FFr84.8m
in 1990, Reuter reports from Paris.
The company said the net effect of acquisitions had depressed pre-tax
profits by FFr68.9m. Without these exceptional items, pre-tax profit would
be comparable with the 1990 level of FFr140.1m. Before amortisation of
goodwill incurred in the acquisition of Nouvelles Galeries, Galeries
Lafayette estimated its 1991 consolidated net profit, before minority
interests, at FFr300m. It put no figure on the goodwill. Attributable net
profit in 1991 was FFr144.4m.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Leaders feel the need for a
dose of fiscal discipline - Caribbean governments are putting state
enterprises up for sale to reduce deficits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS in the Caribbean are putting a range of state enterprises up for
sale as they become penned in by reduced foreign investment and the need for
improved fiscal discipline.
The driving force behind divestment has in some cases been the need to
reduce fiscal deficits by selling off enterprises which have been a drain on
the budget and to ease balance of payments problems by selling to foreign
investors.
The deregulation of economies has provided another spur to divestment
programmes, as well as the growing belief in market forces.
However, the effort can prove a headache. The Jamaican government, for
example, announced last year it would have sell its 39 per cent stake in the
island's largest commercial bank to the public. But this month, in a
reversal of policy, its sold the shares by private treaty to a local
insurance company and a building society for the equivalent of Dollars 23m.
Mr Hugh Small, the finance minister, said the state of the market would have
brought the government much less than it received from the two purchasers.
Government sources said later that the government could not risk going
public because it needed the money to satisfy conditions of an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund.
The government is likely to hope that this does not affect its privatisation
programme which has seen the sale of assets worth about Dollars 60m. These
include holdings in hotels, telecommunications companies and a cement plant.
The government has identified another 65 enterprises and agencies which it
intends to divest, among which are the international and domestic airlines,
water and electricity companies, the railways, some port facilities and the
postal service.
The Puerto Rican government tried last year to sell its telephone company
for Dollars 3bn. Although several companies showed interest, they all balked
at the price. The administration withdrew the offer, but saved some face
last month with the sale of its long distance carrier to Telefonica de
Espana, the Spanish telecommunications group, for Dollars 141m.
Guyana has been more fortunate in attracting buyers for state enterprises.
The government has divested 13 state enterprises since the start of last
year and is negotiating for another 10 to be partly or totally privatised.
Another 16 are likely to be put on the block.
Among the enterprises the government wants to privatise are a sugar company,
which Booker Tate of the UK is managing under contract while a US company
has been negotiating for a stake in the local power company.
Just over 4m acres of the country's forests have been leased to South Korean
and Malaysian investors who are putting Dollars 50m into a joint logging and
saw-milling venture.
Prospective participants in the divestment programme may be wary of the
attitude of the parliamentary opposition.
Elections are expected later this year, and Dr Cheddi Jagan, the opposition
leader, has said there was no guarantee that, if elected to the presidency,
he would honour any divestment agreements reached just before the election.
In neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago, the government which took office in
December is reviewing the divestment programme.
According to officials, the government is committed to implementing the
programme started by the previous administration, 'but is studying it to see
what aspects can be improved'.
In the Dominican Republic, the administration maintains it is committed to
selling off state companies. But Mr Juan Arteaga, economic adviser to
President Joaquin Balaguer, says there is reluctance to pursue the
programme. 'We are taking steps in this matter, but very slowly,' he said.
'There are vital companies that we should have a hand on, such as the flour
mills. On the other hand, electricity and the airline can be privatised.'
The local representative of one multilateral financial institution concluded
that privatisation was a sensitive political issue. 'There are many public
employees in the state enterprises, and they represent many votes which the
government does not want to lose.'
However, there are those, who counsel against undue haste in privatisation.
'I do not think that profitable government operations should be privatised,'
said Mr Michael Howard, an economist at the Barbados campus of the
University of the West Indies.

<TEXT>
HONG KONG Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm,
announced profit after tax for 1991 of USDollars 298.1m, an increase of 11
per cent from USDollars 267.7m in 1990.
The company, which dominates the office and retail market in the colony's
financial district, reported an extraordinary profit of USDollars 115.8m
from the sale of seven non-core Hong Kong properties. It said none of its
other properties was on the market, refuting widespread speculation that
core properties may soon be sold.
Hong Kong Land recorded an average occupancy rate of 97 per cent on its
investment portfolio. The average rental rates on office and retail space
increased by 16 per cent and 31 per cent respectively, despite the softening
rental market in 1992. Much of this would be attributable to the disposal of
non-core properties, commanding significantly lower rentals.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said there was little scope for earnings growth
in 1992 from the existing Hong Kong portfolio. However, he said: 'The group
is in a strong financial position to take advantage of opportunities either
in Hong Kong or in depressed world property markets.'
The company had net borrowing of USDollars 349.9m at the year-end,
representing only 8 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Hong Kong Land's investment portfolio has come under pressure from an
increase in supply of top-grade office space on Hong Kong island, which
resulted in a sharp overall decline in market rental rates last year.
The directors recommended a final dividend of 6.15 US cents per share,
making a total of 9 cents for the year, compared with 8.25 cents in 1990.
The company also announced plans to transfer its primary listing to London
if the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong goes ahead with proposed changes in its
secondary listing rules.

SHOWA Shell Sekiyu, the leading Japanese oil refiner and distributor 50 per
cent-owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell group, has reported that group net
profits for 1991 advanced by 160.9 per cent to Y26.53bn (Dollars 200.98m)
from Y10.17bn a year earlier. Sales were marginally down at Y1,660bn
compared with Y1,68bn, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The company ascribed the large rise in group profits mainly to higher
domestic prices for oil and oil products and to the strong yen.
Group pre-tax profits rose 90.3 per cent to Y45.6bn from Y23.97bn. Group
earnings per share surged to Y97.14 from Y37.23.
The directors forecast group net profits for 1992 of Y21bn and group sales
of Y1,570bn. They put group earnings per share for the year ahead well down
at Y64.8.
A court injunction stopping Shell Australia sending takeover documents to
shareholders of coal mining group, Austen and Butta, has been extended to
Thursday, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Austen and Butta has rejected a 70 cent-a-share bid from Shell Australia,
owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, as too low. Shell Australia owns 49.5 per cent
of the target's ordinary shares. The bid values it at ADollars 67.5m
(Dollars 51.5m).
Mr John Fuller, of Gadens Ridgeway, the law firm representing Austen and
Butta, said orders made on Friday were yesterday extended in the New South
Wales Supreme Court.

MALAYSIA'S life insurance industry earned aggregate revenue of MDollars
2.71bn (USDollars 1bn) in 1991, a rise of 21.4 per cent from 1990. Premium
receipts grew 21.3 per cent, the country's director-general of insurance
said in his 1991 report, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Investment income rose 21.1 per cent and income from other sources by 23.8
per cent. New sums insured for life insurance in grew 5.8 per cent in 1991
to MDollars 26.12bn, against 16 per cent growth in 1990.
The slower growth for sums insured was due to a sharp fall in temporary
policies, to 3.9 per cent in 1990 from 25.3 per cent in 1990. The number of
new policies issued and new annual premiums rose sharply by 24.8 per cent
and 26.8 per cent respectively in 1991, from 5.7 per cent and 19.9 per cent.
Premium receipts accounted for 73.4 per cent of total income. Total
expenditure incurred by the industry rose 19.8 per cent in 1991 to MDollars
1.47bn.
As a result, the surplus of income over expenditure rose 23.5 per cent in
1991, from 14.6 per cent in 1990, to MDollars 1.24bn. The director-general
said total assets of life insurance funds stood at MDollars 8.38bn at the
end of 1991, an increase of 17 per cent from MDollars 7.1bn at end-1990.
The general insurance industry total written premiums grew 18.1 per cent in
1991 to MDollars 2.34bn, after growing 21.8 per cent in 1990.

<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transport group, expects its European distribution
network to move into profit in 1992-93, Sir Peter Abeles, chief executive,
said yesterday.
Sir Peter said increased revenues from deals with Federal Express, the US
express mail group, and five European and North American post offices, would
transform the loss-making European network.
The European network, which Sir Peter described as 'the single biggest drag'
on group profits, has never made a profit in spite of significant investment
in trucks, aircraft and handling facilities.
Sir Peter said its prospects had been transformed by the post office deal,
which sets up a joint venture company, called GD Net, to merge the express
mail businesses of TNT and the Canadian, Swedish, French, German and Dutch
postal authorities.
GD Net is also negotiating commercial agreements with a number of other post
offices, including several in Scandinavia, Sir Peter said.
TNT announced last week that it had agreed to act as a sub-contractor for
Federal Express in the delivery of inbound packages from the US to 10
European countries.
Sir Peter said the GD Net joint venture was expected to add about USDollars
120m to European revenues next year. However, he said TNT did not expect to
retain all the USDollars 100m revenue of Federal Express' European
operations.
Sir Peter said the GD Net deal had been delayed for more than six months by
adverse comment last year on the group's profitability and ability to pay
its debts.
He said TNT had always maintained sufficient liquidity to meet its debts as
they fell due for payment, and claimed media and market analysts had
misunderstood the group because of its complex spread of businesses.
Sir Peter said TNT was 'well on the way' to achieving a debt to equity ratio
of 1:1, as forecast in last year's annual report. The current ratio was 'in
the region' of 1.3:1 or 1.4:1, he said.
Sir Peter, who founded TNT in the 1950s, also said he had no plans to
retire, in spite of speculation that he would hand over to younger
management once the group's balance sheet had strengthened.

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION in South Africa caused earnings at Pick 'n Pay, the country's
largest supermarket chain, to slip in the year to February.
Turnover rose 13.9 per cent to R5.91bn (Dollars 2.05bn), but tighter margins
meant trading income declined to R127.9m from R133.5m a year earlier. The
trading margin fell to 2.16 per cent from 2.57 per cent amid conditions
described by Mr Raymond Ackerman, chairman, as the toughest he has
experienced in 25 years.
Earnings dropped 2.5 per cent to R84.4m, with earnings per share similarly
down at 107.9 cents. The total dividend was maintained at 57.5 cents.
Pick 'n Pay said its results showed it could not be blamed for the high
level of food price inflation in the country. Food price rises have been
singled out as the main culprit for the relative lack of success in driving
down inflation in the country despite tight monetary policy by the Reserve
Bank, the central bank.
The South African Central Statistical Service has estimated food price
increases in 1991 were about 28 per cent. Pick 'n Pay disputes this figure,
saying it overstates the importance of small traders and meat sales.
Prices in its stores, including tax, rose by 13 to 14 per cent during the
year. Mr Ackerman said higher-margin, non-food sales, which account for
about 20 per cent of the group's total sales, were subsidising food sales,
not the other way round.
Although South Africa is only expecting 1 per cent real economic growth in
1992, the directors are confident Pick 'n Pay will achieve real growth in
the year ahead.

TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment group, plans an autumn launch of
the first round-the-clock cable news channel that is specifically focused on
news in New York City.
The new channel, to be known as New York 1 News, is part of the company's
expansion of its cable operations, which are the second largest in the US.
Fewer than 1m of Time Warner's nearly 7m national cable subscribers will be
able to see the channel.
The launch of the new channel has been put off until September because of
problems related to the site chosen for its Manhattan headquarters.
New York is one of the most profitable cable franchises in the US, and Time
Warner has a number of expansion plans for the metropolitan area.
It recently started a 150-channel cable facility in the Queens section of
New York and has been stepping up the development of pay-per-view movie

Sears, Roebuck

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT MONKS, the shareholder rights activist who has been campaigning
vigorously for changes at Sears, Roebuck, yesterday withdrew his candidacy
for a seat on the struggling retail and financial services group's board.
But Mr Monks made clear he was withdrawing only because he believed success
in the vote at the Sears annual meeting in May was 'mathematically
inachievable'.
He stressed he would support other dissident shareholder resolutions - 'both
vocally and financially' - including one which demands a study of the
demerger possibilities at the group.
Mr Monks's Washington office also said it was 'very likely' the activist
would run for a board seat in 1993, if the company takes no action in the
interim.
Sears confirmed it had been informed about the withdrawal of Mr Robert Monks
as a candidate for its board, but refused to comment further.
Mr Monks lost a bid to join the Sears board last year, receiving 12 per cent
of the vote. Before the election took place, Sears decided to shrink the
size of its board from 15 members to 10, meaning that only three seats were
up for election, instead of five. Under the cumulative voting system, that
meant Mr Monks needed 25 per cent of votes cast at the meeting.
Sears has pledged to add new outside directors, but yesterday Mr Monks noted
that 'by not proposing any new candidate for a vacated seat', the company
had effectively shrunk the board again.
'This leaves only three directors to be elected in 1992,' he said, 'making
my candidacy mathematically inachievable.'
Mr Monks, who owns 100 Sears shares and has no intention of buying more,
highlighted a proposal which would require Sears management to hire
independent investment bankers to evaluate the spin-off of the non-retail
assets, as one that he was particularly keen to support. The proposal was
made by Mr Hazard Bentley, agent of Allstate, the property-casualty insurer
owned by Sears.
Concern over Sears has centred on its retailing business, which has a high
cost base compared with many rivals. Critics say that retail operation has
been slow to respond to trends in the industry.
Sears claims to be addressing the problems, but dissident shareholders argue
that worries about the retail side depress the share price and the value of
the financial services interests are overlooked.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica deal produces
indifference - Reaction to the latest example of Italy's privatisation
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING sold its Cementir cement operation and further diluted its
telecommunications interests through convertible bond issues, Italy's giant
IRI state holding company has turned to an outright flotation to muster
funds for cash-hungry subsidiaries.
The candidate this time is Finmeccanica, the holding company for most of
IRI's engineering interests. So far, the stock market has reacted with
caution to the latest example of the Italian government's strategy on
privatisation.
Milanese brokers gave Mr Giulio Andreotti, Italy's premier, a cool reception
when he visited the bourse last week just one day after the Finmeccanica
scheme was unveiled. Their reaction stemmed from cynicism about the
government's privatisation policy in general and indifference to the deal in
particular.
Many dealers are bitter that privatisation, Italian style, has been
disappointing so far. Powerful vested interests among state companies'
managements and the desire of politicians to keep their hands on the strings
have meant that flotations have involved minority stakes or just slight
dilutions of the state's entrenched majorities.
Even when more than 50 per cent of a state-owned company has changed hands,
as in the case of Cementir, the transaction has been conducted via an
auction, by-passing the bourse. To make matters worse, the Cementir deal
took place just days before a new law came into effect protecting the rights
of minority shareholders. Had the deal been postponed, the buyer, a Rome
building group, would have had to offer small shareholders the same generous
terms it bid to gain IRI's controlling interest.
The Finmeccanica deal will do little to diminish brokers' scepticism about
privatisation. Under the complex terms, Finmeccanica will be floated via a
reverse takeover by Sifa, a stock market-listed property and financial
services subsidiary. That will be followed by a two-stage capital increase,
with the eventual target of having 40 per cent of Finmeccanica's capital on
the stock exchange.
Unless the pricing is unusually generous, the deal will do little to excite
the market. Some of Finmeccanica's businesses, like the troubled Alenia
aerospace concern and Elsag Bailey, a precision engineering outfit, are
already listed. Others, like the Franco-Italian SGS Thomson electronics
joint venture, would find it difficult to attract private-sector capital on
their own.
The mixture of Finmeccanica's interests is one reason why analysts do not
share politicians' enthusiasm about the proposed float. Selective investors
can already buy into the group through the quoted subsidiaries. And if
raising money is the priority, why not list Ansaldo, Finmeccanica's heavy
engineering arm, which is the only big part of the group not already quoted,
ask some analysts? As matters stand, only its Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary
has a listing.
The practice of floating both a public-sector holding company and its
subsidiaries is not new in Italy. Both STET, the IRI-owned
telecommunications holding, and its leading operating units like SIP and
Italcable are traded on the market.
But the telecommunications set-up is easier to justify than that now planned
for engineering. STET's quotation dates back longer. Analysts point out that
buying shares in STET gives an investor a proxy for the entire Italian
telecoms sector from manufacturing to operating utilities. The same can
hardly be said for Finmeccanica.
The company has thoroughly restructured its activities since the days when
it was best known for its loss-making Alfa Romeo cars operation, sold to
Fiat in 1986. Finmeccanica has invested heavily, partly through purchases
abroad, in high-tech businesses such as Elsag Bailey and Esaote Biomedica, a
small bio-technology operation also due to be quoted.
Yet, despite its acquisitions, not all of Finmeccanica is flourishing.
Alenia, formed in December 1990 from the merger of Finmeccanica's Aeritalia
aerospace unit and Selenia, the defence electronics subsidiary of STET, has
run into heavy turbulence following the dive in the civilian and military
aerospace business. Earnings last year shrank to L56bn (Dollars 44m),
forcing the company to cut its dividend for the second time running.
Although Alenia is now starting to slim down, the outlook is not rosy.
Ansaldo, which had sales of L2,372bn in 1990, may now be faring somewhat
better, having returned to profit in 1990 after its nuclear electricity
generating operation was knocked for six by Italy's 1987 referendum against
nuclear power. However, the group is still suffering from the economic
downturn which has affected the world's big engineering and contracting
concerns.
Even the legacy of Alfa Romeo lives on. One reason for Finmeccanica's
current need to raise cash is to repay IRI L615bn, plus interest, which the
European Commission says it gave in illegal subsidies to the cars group
while still owned by Finmeccanica.
The repayment explains why Finmeccanica posted a L525bn group loss for 1991,
compared with net profits of L119.6bn in 1990. Sales rose by 14 per cent to
L10,966bn last year, but even after stripping out extraordinaries, the ratio
of net profits to sales of 1.5 per cent in 1991 is hardly stunning.
Meanwhile net financial liabilities jumped by almost 17 per cent to L4,862bn
 -representing 44 per cent of turnover. Sceptics say Finmeccanica's argument
that the high capital content of its activities dictates a lengthy pay-back
period can also be used as a cover for poor results.
A marked improvement in operating earnings showed Finmeccanica may now be
getting to grips with some of its problems. Next year will also see the
arrival of the first tranche of the L1,025bn due from Fiat under the terms
of the Alfa Romeo sale. The total is payable, interest free, in installments
over the next five years. If Finmeccanica could offer terms like that to its
future shareholders, there might be more of a rush to buy its stock.

FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Volvo goes to Procordia for new
chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO has appointed Mr Soren Gyll as chief executive to replace Mr Christer
Zetterberg, who has headed Volvo since April 1990, writes Kevin Done, Motor
Industry correspondent.
Mr Gyll, chief executive of Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and foods
group, would move to Volvo whether or not the planned merger of Volvo and
Procordia takes place, the car and truck group said yesterday.
The appointment of Mr Gyll is a severe blow to the fortunes of Mr Christer
Zetterberg, who is to be relegated to the post of deputy chief executive,
according to a statement yesterday.
Mr Zetterberg, formerly president and chief executive of PKBanken, the
Swedish state-owned bank, was expected eventually to succeed Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman. But the relationship between the two has
proved difficult.
The fate of the proposed SKr38.7bn (Dollars 6.5bn) merger of Volvo and
Procordia remains uncertain. The Swedish government, which owns 42.7 per
cent of the voting rights in Procordia, blocked the merger in January but is
still discussing alternative solutions.
Mr Zetterberg said last week that the talks had entered a decisive phase and
that a settlement would probably be announced in one to two weeks. He
refused to predict the outcome.
When the deal was announced in January, the two companies said that Mr
Gyllenhammar would become chairman of the merged group with Mr Gyll as
president and chief executive officer. Mr Zetterberg was to become deputy
chief executive responsible for Volvo's vehicle operations.
The appointment of Mr Gyll by the Volvo board, regardless of the outcome of
the merger negotiations, has renewed speculation that Mr Zetterberg will
shortly leave Volvo, however, possibly to return to the Swedish pulp and
paper industry.

link with Canon

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computers and office equipment group, is
reinforcing its links with Canon of Japan with a L130bn (Dollars 103m) joint
venture to produce up to 700,000 bubble ink-jet printers annually.
Bubble ink-jet printers represent the fastest-growing sector of the computer
printer market. Olivetti estimates that such 'non-impact' technology
accounted for around one-third of the 7.8m printers sold in Europe in 1991,
with a growth rate of around 25 per cent.
The two already collaborate through Olivetti Canon Industriale (OCI), a
joint venture set up in 1987 to make photocopiers under both the Canon and
Olivetti badges.
Under the latest deal, to take effect in April, OCI will create a new bubble
ink-jet printer division, providing 580 jobs at its existing plant in
northern Italy over the next five years. First-year output is expected to
reach 200,000 units. Around L70bn of the total investment will go towards
research and development, while L46bn will be spent on production.
Olivetti has been attacked, unfairly it claims, for being slow to strike
strategic alliances with other high-technology groups to help overcome its
current problems. The latest deal should go some way to meeting such
criticisms.
The company gave no precise sales or profits forecasts for the new venture.
However, it claimed to hold around 11 per cent of the market, with sales of
around L400bn.
The new joint venture will be based on Olivetti's existing production and
research activities, to be complemented by the introduction of Canon
technologies. According to Olivetti, the two companies are, with Hewlett
Packard, the leaders in bubble ink-jet technology. The division will extend
Olivetti's two-model range, with products using technology from both
companies and marketed under both Olivetti and Canon names.

PHILIPS, of the Netherlands, and Grundig, its 32 per cent-owned German
consumer electronics associate company, said yesterday they intend to set up
joint ventures in the fields of video equipment and cordless telephones.
The video venture will encompass the development and production of video
components such as video heads, scanners and video tape-decks.
Grundig, which has been controlled by Philips since 1984, will contribute
its Nuremberg-based video operation to the venture, while the Dutch company
will include its entire Vienna-based video business group.
A Philips spokesman said that details, including the precise split in share
ownership, still had to be settled. No turnover figures were disclosed, but
Grundig's video operations employ 1,900 people and Philips' 3,000.
The components and equipment made by the venture will be sold under the
separate brand names Philips and Grundig. They will also be sold to other
original equipment manufacturers for relabelling.
The aim of the video partnership is to make better use of production and
research facilities.

buying Texas bank
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANC ONE, the rapidly-growing US regional banking group, is expanding its
presence in Texas with the Dollars 782m purchase of Team Bancshares, the
sixth largest bank in the state.
The move is the latest in a series of mergers among regional banking groups
which is slowly consolidating the extremely fragmented US banking system.
Banc One, based in Ohio, is one of the most highly regarded banking groups
in the US, with a strong balance sheet, consistently good earnings and
record of successfully integrating acquisitions across the midwest and
Texas.
It first expanded into Texas in 1989 through the purchase of the troubled
MCorp banking group from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
government agency which oversees failed banks, and has since added to its
network by buying several failed thrifts.
Its local subsidiary, Banc One, Texas, is the third largest bank in the
state, ranked by assets. It said the Team acquisition will move it into
second place, with roughly 200 branches and Dollars 19bn in assets, behind
NCNB and ahead of First Interstate.
Team, based in Dallas, has assets of some Dollars 5.5bn and concentrates on
retail and middle-market lending - areas which Banc One also favours.
The deal will give Banc One the largest presence, in terms of branches, in
the Dallas/Forth Worth area and around the state capital of Austin.
The merger involves Banc One offering Dollars 82 of its stock for each share
in Team. The two sides expect to complete the deal during the fourth quarter
of this year.
Banc One has largely avoided the loan loss problems which have afflicted
many leading US banks over the past two years.
It shunned very large corporate credits and highly-leveraged transactions,
which have caused large headaches elsewhere, while the property markets in
its areas of operation have been relatively buoyant.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: 'More efficient' Bupa swings from Pounds
38m deficit to surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in subscription rates and tighter cost control helped Bupa, the
private health insurance and services group, return to the black in 1991.
Group revenue exceeded Pounds 1bn for the first time and the taxable result
swung from a deficit of Pounds 38.2m to a Pounds 1.3m surplus.
Bupa is a provident institution but new management was installed last year
with the aim of injecting a more commercial approach.
Mr Peter Jacobs, the chief executive who arrived last May, said that, given
the trading environment, the result showed a 'pretty dramatic turnaround'.
When he joined he decided that Bupa needed 'to operate on a more efficient
and competitive basis'. There had been 20 new entrants to the health
insurance market, he said, such as composite insurance groups.
Mr Jacobs felt that if a Labour government was elected and removed tax
relief for health insurance for pensioners, it would not have much effect on
Bupa's business. He said that the limited resources available for
healthcare, both state and private, could only be optimised if the two
sectors co-operated.
On the insurance side, Bupa increased premiums by an average of 20 per cent
and a similar rise was expected in the current year. The number of
subscribers fell by a net 6 per cent, although Mr Jacobs said it was hard to
say whether this represented a loss of market share, which is just under
half in the UK.
Subscriptions increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 819m, but benefits were up
by a lesser 15 per cent to Pounds 717.4m. At the same time, Bupa took a
tougher line on costs, which rose by 9.3 per cent to Pounds 142.3m. Net
investment income was up from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 21m, thanks to stronger
cash flow and lower interest payments on the purchase consideration for
Sanitas, the Spanish business acquired in 1989. This left the deficit before
tax from insurance activities down from Pounds 53.6m to Pounds 19.7m.
Within this total the Spanish business, which Mr Edward Lea, finance
director, said had operated an uncommercial pricing policy when acquired,
produced a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 7m (deficit Pounds 1.7m). Bupa has
renegotiated the purchase price of Sanitas after the final acquisition
audit.
The health services surplus rose 36 per cent to Pounds 21m, with income up
almost 12 per cent to Pounds 201.3m and costs up 9 per cent to Pounds
180.3m.
Bupa only pays tax on its investment income and health services activities,
and the Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 4m) charge left it requiring a Pounds 11.2m
(Pounds 42.2m) transfer from reserves. Thses, however, were increased during
the year from Pounds 239.7m to Pounds 311.8m, helped by a Pounds 40.6m
goodwill write-back after the renegotiation of the purchase price of
Sanitas, a Pounds 24.4m increase in the value of investments and a Pounds
12.3m surplus on revaluation of fixed assets.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEMROSE Corporation, the printing group, was able to maintain annual profits
and dividends in spite of tough conditions in its markets.
Pre-tax profits for the year to December 28 1991 came to Pounds 5.06m
(Pounds 4.91m) and the final dividend is again 7.45p for an 11.75p total.
Mr Rodger Booth, chief executive, said the result had been achieved despite
an increase in the effective tax rate to 35 per cent against 22 per cent
last time.
In the UK, profitability in the security and promotional printing division
declined amid tough conditions. Worst affected was the advertising calendar
and diary business, said Mr Booth.
However, with a view to a recovery, in July 1991 Bemrose acquired Moments
Calendars for Pounds 1.1m.
Demand for Henry Booth tickets was strong and in May the ticket printing
division of Almex was acquired for Pounds 750,000. Cost savings here had
progressed to plan, Mr Booth said.
ESP, the bar code printing business acquired in November 1990, achieved good
growth in both sales and profits.
During the year GNP Booth and Bemrose Decorative Products were sold to
management teams. There was an extraordinary charge relating to closures and
disposals amounting to Pounds 1.4m.
In the US, with the exception of Janesville Group - the etched crystal
manufacturer - all activities achieved growth.
Group turnover declined to Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 50.6m) while earnings per
share slipped to 19.87p (23.21p). Gearing at the year-end increased to 57
per cent (44 per cent).

<TEXT>
PROFITS of Community Hospitals, the private medical group, rose from Pounds
1.99m to Pounds 2.68m pre-tax for the six months ended December 31.
And a 'best view' prediction by the directors was for full year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7m compared to Pounds 5.8m previously.
On the political front, Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, said he felt
'comfortable' about a Labour victory - although he conceded that Labour was
'ideologically opposed to private health care'.
Operating profit rose 31 per cent to Pounds 2.6m on sales of Pounds 19.3m
(Pounds 16.1m).
Gearing increased from 15 per cent to 22 per cent - representing borrowings
of Pounds 14.7m.
A rights issue in early 1991 raised Pounds 10.4m to help pay for a Pounds
33m building programme.
Mr Dexter did not expect to have to call on shareholders for more money
before 1993 - unless there was a particular acquisition to fund.
The hospitals increased operating profits to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.6m) on
turnover of Pounds 16.5m as the group opened more facilities to cope with
the growing demand for day surgery treatment.
Operating profits from nursing homes rose to Pounds 536,000 (Pounds 358,000)
on turnover of Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2m).
The group received interest of Pounds 154,000 from the balance of its rights
issue.
Earnings per share rose from 5.5p to 6.2p and the interim dividend is being
raised by 0.2p to 2.4p per share, an increase of 9 per cent - a final of
3.8p was paid for the 1990-91 year.
The directors pointed out that the UK healthcare market had shown continued
resilience to the economic conditions and that both the acute and long-term
care divisions were performing well.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTEC (BSR), the electronics company 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson of the
US, yesterday tumbled into the red as losses from its electronic components
division more than offset profits from power converter sales.
Pre-tax losses were Pounds 4.8m in the year to the end of December, compared
with profits of Pounds 4m. Turnover slipped from Pounds 283.4m to Pounds
273m.
The power conversion division increased operating profits to Pounds 6m
(Pounds 3.8m) on sales of Pounds 171.7m (Pounds 159.6m). But electronic
components and communications, which rely on the US and European computer
and information technology markets, were affected by recession and incurred
an operating loss of Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 3.9m profit).
Mr Anthony Shanagher, finance director, described the performance from
components as 'very disappointing' and hoped the division would reverse its
losses this year.
There were exceptional costs of Pounds 2.2m from redundancy and other
rationalisation costs. Staff numbers at the company's Stourbridge facility
almost halved to 300 after the manufacture of some its power supply products
was switched to Malaysia and China.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.7m). Gearing was reduced from
54.8 per cent to 39.6 per cent, mainly due to tighter working capital and
stock control. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 30m at the year-end.
Emerson took its stake in 1989 at an effective purchase price of 65p per
share. A three year standstill agreement, which prevents Emerson selling its
shares or increasing its stake, runs out at the end of this month.

of early hopes

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants and chemicals group, has sold its ceramics,
abrasives and diamond products businesses to Apax Partners, the European
venture capital fund, for Pounds 44m.
A year ago when the businesses were put up for sale Burmah expected to raise
Pounds 70m as it thought that this year would see some economic recovery.
'We are pleased to have sold the division in such terrible trading
conditions,' it said yesterday.
The consideration was met by Pounds 41.5m cash and the assumption by Apax of
Pounds 2.5m in long-term liabilities.
Pre-tax profits for the division, which Burmah acquired with Foseco, a
speciality chemicals producer, at the end of 1990, were Pounds 6.7m last
year. However, trading conditions have deteriorated significantly during the
present year and the company said the businesses were trading at a reduced
level of activ-ity.
Burmah has almost completed the disposals envisaged when it bought Foseco in
a Pounds 259m deal. Yesterday's announcement brings the running total to
Pounds 52m and a further Pounds 5m is expected from selling UK industrial
activit-ies.
When Burmah reports its 1991 results on Thursday analysts are expecting a
fall in net income to about Pounds 70m from last year's Pounds 97m.
World oil refining margins have been depressed and the chemicals sector is
suffering from deep recession. An unchanged total dividend of 23p is
forecast.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: A new era in prospect for predators - The
proposed dismantling of Govett Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE investment trust sector has been in an expansionary mood over the past
year or so. New issues have abounded and the air of gloom that followed the
1990 takeover of Globe, the sector's largest trust, has disappeared.
But now Govett Atlantic, a trust with a market capitalisation of more than
Pounds 160m, is set to dismantle itself after pressure from its
shareholders.
Is this a sign that predators are returning to the market or is Govett
Atlantic the victim of special circumstances?
Govett Atlantic was founded in 1925 as the Stockholders Investment Trust,
adopting its current name as recently as 1986, when it also acquired the
sister trust Govett Enterprise.
Its policy has been to invest in North America, with a concentration on
smaller companies. This focus has caused some difficulties, given the long
period of underperformance of small company shares since 1983, a trend which
only showed some signs of reversal in 1991.
The trust has produced just 12 per cent growth in net assets over the past
five years, according to Mr Lewis Aaron, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd.
But its current difficulties really date from November, when a big
shareholder called Sequoia Investments, a Jersey-based vehicle for James
Hardie Industries, an Australian group, placed a 23.5 per cent stake in the
market. The stock was sold at a 20 per cent-plus discount to net asset
value.
The placing had two effects. First, there was a lot of loose Govett Atlantic
stock available. Second, the size of the discount made the trust vulnerable.
According to Mr Aaron, a 20 per cent-plus discount is the point where
arbitrageurs can see the prospect for profit in the investment trust sector.
Sure enough by February, ST Partners, a vehicle for Mr Andrew Schechtel, an
American investor, and Buchanan Partners, a London-based investment group,
had each emerged with 5 per cent stakes and had requisitioned an
extraordinary general meeting. They called on the managers to propose plans
to eliminate the discount at the EGM.
Govett has duly produced a plan, which will split the trust in three. The
bulk of the assets will be spun off into a unit trust, which will be managed
to track the S&amp;P 500 Index. In practice, however, this is a device to enable
investors to realise their holdings for cash at asset value.
A smaller part of the assets will be converted into a new investment trust
to be called the Govett American Smaller Companies Trust. This will allow
private investors to maintain their investments in the US and enable such
investors to roll over their holdings and thus postpone liability to capital
gains tax.
The investment trust will have a limited life, probably five years. By
offering the prospect of realisation at asset value in the foreseeable
future, the hope is that the discount will be contained.
The unquoted element of the portfolio will be transferred into a
Dublin-listed vehicle, the Realisation Company, shares in which will be
distributed pro rata to existing holders. This will allow the assets to be
sold off in an orderly fashion, and thus at better prices than if a 'fire
sale' was held immediately.
The plan which needs 75 per cent shareholder approval, seems to have met the
desires of ST and Buchanan Partners, who have withdrawn their EGM
requisition. John Govett, the management group, will receive a Pounds 1m
pay-off but will lose perhaps more than 5 per cent of its funds under
management.
The story of Govett Atlantic is highly reminiscent of the late 1980s, when
trust after trust was taken over or reconstructed in the face of action from
predators and dissident shareholders.
That era seemed to have ended with the Globe bid. In the past few years,
investment trusts have had great success in marketing themselves to private
investors, via savings schemes and personal equity plans. Private investor
demand has steadily mopped up the unwanted stock owned by institutions, and
resulted in a narrowing of the discount to asset value. A narrow discount
does not allow the opportunity for profitable reconstruction.
In addition, many of the trusts launched in recent years have been
geographical specialists, meeting the needs of institutions which lack the
resources to specialise in such areas. And such trusts are expensive to
liquidate, again reducing the scope for arbitrage profit.
Nevertheless, there are one or two straws in the wind to suggest that
predators have re-emerged. Scottish Value Trust, a revamped shell company
formerly known as Bremner, has been involved in reconstruction at trusts
such as Ensign and Pacific Property.
And the fashion for new issues, by increasing supply in the sector, may
eventually lead to a widening in discounts. That in turn will bring back the
predators. Fund managers will need to keep a wary eye on their share
registers.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Era sets its sights on return to the
dividend list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERA GROUP, the specialist retailer which includes Beatties hobbies and
Techno cameras in its stable, reported profits down 15 per cent but
continued its progress towards returning to the dividend list.
Mr Anthony Fay, chairman, said the holding company should be in a good
position to pay preference and possibly ordinary dividends next year if 1992
trading goes as planned.
The deficit on shareholders funds had been reduced to a small negative level
by retained profits of Pounds 1.26m.
Earnings per share fell from 2.44p to 2.18p.
Pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds 2.17m on sales down 3
per cent at Pounds 71.1m.
Mr Fay said the group had swapped Pounds 7m of its debt, which averaged
Pounds 13m over the year, into a five year loan facility.
More customers had visited the hobbies stores but on average, had spent
less.
Consumer confidence had started bad, deteriorated and had not picked up for
Christmas, he said. The group, nevertheless, maintained gross margins.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Woodchester advances 34% to IPounds 39.6m

<TEXT>
WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and financial services
group, reported a 34 per cent growth in pre-tax profits from IPounds 29.6m
to IPounds 39.6m (Pounds 37m) for 1991.
The results included an exceptional gain of IPounds 3.3m from the disposal
of Pinnacle Insurance in the UK. The underlying trading profits increased by
a more modest 26 per cent. The results were broadly in line with market
expectations.
Gross rentals were up by 16 per cent to IPounds 377.5m (IPounds 324.3m),
while group assets rose from IPounds 1.08bn to IPounds 1.12bn.
The figures included a first time contribution from the Mercantile Credit
Company (Ireland), acquired from Barclays at the end of 1990.
Mr Craig McKinney, chairman, said: 'The result represents a considerable
achievement given the difficult conditions prevailing, in particular in the
UK.' He added that the group's consumer finance and leasing operations had
remained profitable in the UK despite the high level of insolvencies there.
The expansion of the equity base from 139m shares to 194m shares was largely
the result of Credit Lyonnais increasing its 29.8 per cent stake to 45 per
cent in January 1991, and a IPounds 12m rights issue the same month.
The group now has estimated cash of IPounds 80m, which together with a new
Pounds 85m syndicated loan facility arranged through Credit Lyonnais, gives
it a substantial war chest for new acquisitions.
A number of opportunities in the UK are being examined. Mr McKinney said:
'We will not be looking at anything with gross assets of anything less than
IPounds 200m'.
He added that although competitors in the Irish market had been dismantling
their UK leasing operations 'we believe it is short-sighted. The UK is
always going to be an important market . . . While we believe that 1992 will
be difficult, with our well developed infrastructure we are well positioned
to take advantage of any upturn in the UK economy'.
Meanwhile, the strategic acquisition of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent
of CLLE, Credit Lyonnais' European leasing activities, is moving forward. A
due diligence exercise of CLLE's subsidiaries is under way and the deal is
expected to be presented for shareholder approval 'within the next two
months'.
The incorporation of CLLE will double the group's core activity of
small-ticket leasing and for the first time give it a broad European spread.
In its domestic market, the group earlier this month finalised the
acquisition of UDT Bank. On a pro-forma balance sheet, including UDT at
October 31 1991, total assets now stand at IPounds 1.45bn.
From earnings per share of 17p (16.8p) a final dividend of 2.24p makes a
total of 3.75p (3.125p).

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Single malt lift for Macallan-Glenlivet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACALLAN-GLENLIVET, the Scotch whisky distiller, increased pre-tax profits
by 10 per cent, from Pounds 6.69m to Pounds 7.38m, over 1991.
Operating profit rose 19 per cent to Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 5.34m) on turnover
9 per cent higher at Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 15.9m).
Mr Allan Shiach, chairman, said the profit increase came primarily from
growth in sales of the Macallan single malt, which was now achieving
widening international distribution. Sales were particularly buoyant in
Italy.
The deflated world economy led to even more competitive market conditions
and to a lower demand than usual from blending customers.
Commenting on the short-term outlook, Mr Shiach said the effects of
recession at home and abroad were likely to make trading conditions
particularly difficult.
'These conditions have influenced blenders' forecasts and further reduced
demand for new whisky,' he added. 'We expect the current year to reflect
this decline though we also look to growth in sales of the Macallan to help
mitigate its effect.'
Earnings per share improved to 4.95p (4.69p) after conversion of 90 per cent
of the convertible loan stock issued in 1985.
A final of 0.5125p raises the total to 0.7625p (0.61p).

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: US casualties at property blackspot /
Assessing the consequences of Randsworth's losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S reputation as one of the world's worst property blackspots has been
underlined by the heavy losses sustained in the first large foray by US
funds into the UK property market.
The Pounds 258m acquisition of Randsworth Trust at the peak of the market in
1989 has resulted in estimates of a Pounds 70m loss for Citibank and a
Pounds 238m loss for the clients of JMB Realty, a Chicago real estate group.
The losses demonstrate the severity of the decline in London office values.
At the time of the acquisition, the Randsworth portfolio was worth Pounds
473m. In April 1991, it was valued at Pounds 353m. The latest assessment
puts the value at about Pounds 260m.
This slump is worse than average. After soaring between 1985 and 1989, West
End office values have fallen by 30 per cent from the peak as the recession
took a particularly heavy toll on the service businesses in the area. The
retail market was also badly scarred by increased rates charges and the
impact of high interest rates.
The Randsworth portfolio, which comprises 650,000 sq ft of office space and
300,000 sq ft of retail space in Oxford Street, Mayfair, Knightsbridge,
Kensington and St James's, may have been particularly badly-hit because of
the development properties within its portfolio. Its best-known development,
in Berkeley Square, which aims to be one of the most expensive addresses in
London, has been empty for several months.
Randsworth's problems were exacerbated by the highly geared structure of the
acquisition vehicle. Investors put up Pounds 95m of equity and Pounds 95m of
loan notes, while Citibank put up Pounds 180m of debt. The Citibank debt
ranked second to a Pounds 135m debenture held against the assets of London &amp;
Provincial Shop Centres, the company's main asset.
JMB has been in talks for 15 months in an attempt to raise more equity and
persuade its bank to swap debt for equity. After putting in an extra Pounds
58m at the start of 1991, its investors called a halt to further cash
injections. 'The money was running out faster than it was being put in,'
said one adviser.
The collapse of the Randsworth deal has important consequences for the
perception of the UK property market for US investors. JMB's misfortunes
have been followed with intense interest. It is seen as one of the largest,
controlling some Pounds 10bn of property funds, and most skilled property
investors in the US.
For some US commentators, the failure of Randsworth highlights both the
insecurity of the London market and the extra risks entailed by venturing
into unknown territory.
JMB was attracted to London because of the relatively high investment
returns. However, at the same time that it and other overseas investors were
putting funds into the UK market, UK institutions were taking money out of
London property.
The company also made large losses on its stakes in Rosehaugh and Priest
Marians, two high-flying property companies which came close to collapse by
the decline in the market.
Not all US investors have been deterred from exploring the UK market. The
O'Connor Group, a real estate fund, has been talking to Hammerson about a
joint acquisition of the Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, West
Midlands. 'The more astute realise they are looking at an different market,'
says a US pensions fund adviser.
But some commentators think that the failure of JMB's long-running attempt
to salvage the business is fundamentally a vote of no confidence in the
London market.
If the investors believed that the UK market was likely to see an upturn,
they would be prepared to see the Randsworth deal through. Randsworth's
demise, coming in the same month as the well-publicised problems of Olympia
&amp; York, another North American investor that put money in the London market,
is a sobering precedent for future investors.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Record result at Spring Ram in 'worst
downturn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM Corporation, the bathroom and kitchen manufacturer, reported a 25
per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 30.1m to Pounds 37.6m, for
the year to January 3.
The result, struck on turnover 34 per cent higher at Pounds 194.2m (Pounds
145.3m), was boosted by Pounds 2.5m in interest gains. The group ended the
year with no debt and cash 45 per cent higher at Pounds 45.3m.
The Fordham group, purchased for Pounds 5.8m last year, contributed Pounds
12m in turnover, but nothing to profits.
Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director, said the group had performed well
through 'the worst downturn in living history'. Turnover, earnings per share
and profits had all reached record levels. Furthermore, he added, 'we have a
balance sheet like a fortress'. The planned Pounds 102m expansion plan would
be funded out of cash resources and Pounds 8.5m of government grants.
Phase one of the programme had been completed during the year, accounting
for about half of the Pounds 14m (Pounds 2.3m) in capital expenditure.
Capital spending was expected to jump to Pounds 42m in 1992 and Pounds 35m
in 1993.
Phase two, which was aimed at building a plant to accommodate the
recently-purchased Regency Doors group, would be complete in mid-1992. Other
plans included a ceramic tile and sanitaryware factory to be built in
Bradford at a cost of Pounds 35m.
Mr Greenwood said that in spite of the increased capital spending the group
expected to end 1992 with Pounds 25m in cash.
The group's three divisions, kitchens, bathrooms, and special products, all
showed good growth in the 12 months. The company refused to break down the
individual figures, however.
Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said the new year had started well, with sales
well up in the first 10 weeks.
Earnings per share advanced from 5.4p to 7.1p. A proposed final dividend of
0.202p makes a total of 0.288p (0.24p).
COMMENT
If you really search, it might be possible to find a city analyst with a
criticism of this rapidly-growing company, which claims 16 subsidiaries and
47 directors, (all of whom are male). Attempts include those who wonder
whether the cracks are showing in the happy family structure following the
departure of Mr Francis Galvin, a director, last year, and rumours
surrounding others. Also the group's depreciation charge has been accused of
being 'a bit miserly'. Finally, Spring Ram has seen a hefty jump in its
stock levels, but the company has a ready answer. 'We build for stock,' they
say and cite their reputation for prompt delivery. No gearing means they can
probably afford it. The company looks almost certain to continue building
market share on its successful formula. But the market has already absorbed
this fact. Forecasts of Pounds 45m leave the group on a multiple of about
18. For now, the shares look fully valued.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Co-op Bank deficit cut to Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD DEBTS on its lending to small and medium sized business customers pushed
the Co-operative Bank into a loss for the second year running in 1991.
The pre-tax loss, after Pounds 45m in provisions against bad debts on the
bank's loan book of Pounds 2.7bn, was Pounds 6m, down from a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 14.9m in 1990.
In 1990 bad debt provisions totalled Pounds 57.2m.
Losses per share emerged at 1.2p (1.7p).
During the year, the size of the bank's balance sheet shrank from Pounds 3bn
to Pounds 2.8bn. There was also a reduction of 753 in the bank's staff which
now stands at 3,684. The restructuring of its operations cost the bank
Pounds 6.3m in exceptional costs.
Though the bank's bad debt experience remained poor in 1991, there were
fewer hits from large company failures than in the previous year.
Mr Terry Thomas, general manager, said that more than 60 per cent of the
bank's bad debts came from individual losses of below Pounds 500,000.
'The fashionable view is that these failures related to new and overgeared
companies established in the boom years of the 1980s, but sad to relate this
is not our experience.
'Many corporate customers of 10 years or more who had already survived one
or more recessions have perished during this incredibly difficult year,' Mr
Thomas said.
He said that the bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries had all improved
their profits in 1990 despite the recession. Its cost-income ratio is now
11.3 per cent, compared to 11.5 per cent a year ago.

<TEXT>
Directors of Wardell Roberts, the Dublin-based food products company, said
yesterday that they expected profits for the current year to be in the
region of IPounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.24m).
They pointed out that that was less than market expectations and said the
downturn from the previous year's IPounds 2.86m reflected difficult
conditions in both the UK and Irish markets.
The company was also withdrawing from the UK poultry market. Provisions of
some IPounds 2.6m connected with the withdrawal would be taken below the
line in the full year results.

Taxable profits at Lincat Group, the USM-quoted catering equipment maker,
tumbled from Pounds 376,000 to Pounds 106,000 in the six months to December
31. However, the interim dividend is maintained at 1.8p.
Mr Martin Craddock, chairman, said the downturn largely reflected the sharp
fall in orders at Colbrook and Douglas, both of which had been strong
contributors to profits last time. Lincat and Corsair performed well
considering the economic climate.
Turnover slid to Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 5.82m) and operating profits to Pounds
250,000 (Pounds 587,000). Earnings dropped to 1p (3.7p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with a confession over the efficacy of his economic forecasting, Mr
Grenville Dean, chairman of Merivale Moore, the property investment and
development group, revealed that his company had fallen into the red in the
six months to December 31.
He recalled that in September he had said that the property slump appeared
to 'be on its last legs', but the fall from profits of Pounds 1.84m to
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.43m had disproved his words. Turnover plunged to
Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 43.2m).
Mr Dean added that the pace of business had been 'witheringly slow'.
Total income amounted to Pounds 4.28m (Pounds 8.7m), but interest charges
were down at Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 5.18m). Net debt at the year-end stood at
Pounds 66.7m, inflated by September's Pounds 20m acquisition in London's St
John's Wood. It was expected to fall to about Pounds 35m by June 1992 after
anticipated residential and commercial sales of about Pounds 30m.
Losses totalled 7p (earnings 8.7p) and the interim dividend is reduced from
2.75p to 1p.

Hibernian Group, the Dublin-based insurance company, more than doubled
pre-tax profits in 1991, from IPounds 3.66m to IPounds 8.25m (Pounds 7.68m),

Total premium income from life assurance rose by almost IPounds 10m to
IPounds 49.1m and from non-life insurance to IPounds 151.9m (IPounds

Earnings advanced to 10.2p (4.4p) per share and the final dividend is lifted

The company said that volumes in its main markets for cold-formed sections

The share of losses of the associate increased to Pounds 236,000 (Pounds

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
P-E INTERNATIONAL, the management and computer consultancy, reported a fall
in profits from Pounds 4.21m to Pounds 1.62m pre-tax for 1991.
Mr Hugh Lang, the outgoing chairman, blamed market conditions which he said
had deteriorated further in the second half.
A sharp fall in consultancy fees in the past two quarters from Pounds 32.7m
in 1990 to Pounds 29.5m had been the main reason for the profits decline.
Further cuts in the cost base resulted in staff levels being reduced by some
15 per cent. Redundancy costs of Pounds 541,000 were taken above the line.
Group turnover for the 12 months improved to Pounds 68.8m (Pounds 65m) and
included Pounds 5.5m from Handley-Walker, one of last year's three
acquisitions.
Overseas sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 13.1m - the main markets being
Benelux, Germany, the US and Hong Kong.
Earnings fell to 4.9p (15p) but a maintained final dividend of 4.2p makes a
same-again 6.2p total. Net borrowings of Pounds 3m boosted gearing from 6
per cent to 22 per cent.
Mr Lang is being succeeded by Mr George Cox following the May annual
meeting.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ex-BAT director to take chair at Cannon
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANNON Street Investments, the industrial holding company undergoing a
financial reorganisation, is to appoint a new chairman as it prepares for
further disposals to bring down borrowings.
The company is expected to announce on Thursday, when it publishes its
results, that Mr Tom Long, a former director of BAT Industries, is to become
chairman.
He will replace Mr John Maclean, who briefly took over the chair in December
following the resignation of Mr William Hislop.
Mr Hislop turned Cannon Street round in the 1970s, but allowed the group's
borrowings to get out of hand in the 1980s. By 1991 gearing was more than
400 per cent.
Mr Long's appointment follows pressure from institutional investors who had
wanted to see an independent non-executive chairman. He helped BAT to repel
Sir James Goldsmith's unbundling attempts in 1989 and is also a former
chairman of Foseco, now part of Burmah Castrol.
Cannon Street has recently made three disposals, worth Pounds 50m,
strengthened the management team, under the new chief executive Mr Robin
Binks, and cut operating costs.
While gearing has fallen to less than 80 per cent, the group is looking at
further divestments. Top of the list is the Craigendarrock group of Scottish
hotels and leisure activities, expected to fetch about Pounds 30m although
they were bought for Pounds 40m.
The mini-conglomerate recently announced the flotation of its Avonside
building arm.

pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 4,1m for 1991.
The result was struck on turnover up from Pounds 22.4m to Pounds 24.1m.
Earnings per share increased by 22 per cent to 23.6p (19.3p) and a final
dividend of 7p (6p) is proposed for an improved total of 10p (8p).
Mr Norman Corlett, chairman, said the improvement reflected an increased
share of passenger arrivals to the Isle of Man from 47.5 per cent to 50.5
per cent and showed the benefit of operating fewer but better ships.
Mr James Sherwood's Sea Containers has a 41 per cent stake in the company,
and in June, 1990, launched a takeover bid.
As the company provided the Isle of Man's only lifeline, the bid produced an
emotive response from islanders. The Manx government threated retrospective
legislation forbidding any person or company to own more than 15 per cent of
the company's shares.
The legislation was not enacted, but Sea Containers withdrew its offer.
Last year, Mr Sherwood said he was predisposed to make another bid. Under
Stock Exchange rules, he is free to do so, but so far has not announced any
move.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reversion to former name and NY listing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ECC, which said yesterday it was reverting to its former name of English
China Clays, is to seek a listing for its shares (in the form of American
Depositary Securities) on the New York Stock Exchange. The ADS are currently
quoted on Nasdaq in the US. Last week ECC regained its place in the FT-SE
100 Index on the London Stock Exchange following a rise in its market
capitalisation. Its share price has risen by more than three quarters during
the past 18 months, during which time it has outperformed the FT-A All-Share
Index by almost half. Following yesterday's announcement the shares slipped
back slightly by 7p to 486p.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: China clay volume sales help ECC to Pounds
115.4m - Net debt reduced from Pounds 246.5m to Pounds 132.5m, giving
gearing of 17 per cent

ECC GROUP, the world's largest supplier of china clay, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 115.4m for 1991. This represents a 15 per cent
advance on the Pounds 100.3m reported for the 15 months to December 31 1990,
but a 58 per cent increase on the unaudited annualised Pounds 73.3m for the
notional 1990 year.
Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said that even stripping out last time's
Pounds 32m exceptional provision against redundancies and restructuring - in
1991 there was a Pounds 2.2m credit - the profits figure this time would
still have been 7.5 per cent higher than the annualised figure.
A further Pounds 8m to Pounds 10m of profits were generated through
disposals and cost reductions following the group's reorganisation, said Mr
Teare.
The increase in underlying profits was helped by the first-time contribution
from Georgia Kaolin, the US china clay company acquired for Dollars 340m in
December 1990. The GK contribution meant that ECC's volume sales of china
clay, which is used mainly for fillers and coatings by the paper industry,
rose by about 12 per cent last year despite a worldwide decline in demand of
about 2 per cent for fillers and coatings.
The group, which also has aggregates businesses in the UK and US, generated
a positive cash flow of Pounds 114m last year, of which about half came from
disposals. The money was used to reduce net debt from Pounds 246.5m at
end-1990 to Pounds 132.5m at end-1991, representing gearing of about 17 per
cent.
During 1991 the labour force was cut by more than 2,000 to 10,800. Many of
the job losses were in the UK where ECC is in the process of pulling out of
housebuilding.
Earnings per share almost doubled from the annualised 15.54p to 32.59p,
while they advanced 45 per cent on the 15 month 22.48p figure.
Dividend payments on ordinary shares for the calendar years 1990 and 1991
rose from 19.6p to 20p, with a proposed final of 13.4p. The payments for the
15-month period totalled 24.5p. The group said that it expected dividend
payments in 1992, on capital increased by its recent Pounds 209m rights
issue, to be at least equal to those in 1991. The issue was 92 per cent
subscribed.
COMMENT
China clay profits, helped by Georgia Kaolin, rose by almost a third to
Pounds 97.7m between the two calendar years - with the US acquisition making
a positive contribution of about 2 1/2 p to earnings. Building material
profits on the same basis fell 28 per cent to Pounds 24.1m despite an
improved performance in the US. Housebuilding helped by land sales was
virtually unchanged at Pounds 14m. The 18-month rise in the group's share
price, however, has less to do with trading performance and more to do with
improvement in the balance sheet and the more focused approach to the core
businesses of china clay and building materials. Profits of Pounds 125m
would place the stock on a prospective p/e of 14. The shares are worth
keeping.

Novel Enterprises, a Hong Kong garment manufacturer, is taking a 29.6 per
cent stake in Pepe, the USM-quoted jeans supplier.
Novel is paying about Pounds 6.8m, equal to 85p a share, for the stake which
is being sold by Pepe's controlling Shah family. Following the transaction,
the family will retain a 32.2 per cent holding in Pepe. The family said it
is selling the stake to meet other obligations. Pepe will not receive any of
the cash.
Novel is controlled by Hong Kong's Chao family, who have strong links with
the Chinese leadership in Beijing.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson advances to Pounds 6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HARDENING reinsurance rates and steady growth in new business helped Lloyd
Thompson, the London market insurance broker, to increase its pre-tax
profits by 31 per cent in the six months to December 31 1991.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 5.1m) and the group declared an
interim dividend of 1.65p, an increase of some 22 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 23 per cent to 5.7p (4.65p).
The share price, which has increased by about 40 per cent in the past 12
months, closed 3p up at 246p.
Brokerage income grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 13.4m), with
income from marine reinsurance up by 50 per cent to Pounds 5.3m.
Although the wholesale marine account has benefited from increases in rates
for ships and offshore rigs, the benefit was offset by reductions in market
capacity and an increase in the amount of risk retained by some clients.
Revenues were up by 10 per cent to Pounds 7.6m.
Despite continuing soft insurance rates in non-marine classes, the group
expanded revenues by 38 per cent to Pounds 4.2m winning increased business
in both the US and Europe.
Despite declining interest rates, the group benefited from strong cash
balances - as a result of increased business volume - raising investment
income by 19 per cent to Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 2.64m).
Trading expenses increased to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 10.9m), but the group's
expense ratio - commissions as a percentage of turnover - fell by three
points to 79 per cent.
The group remains heavily dependent on the London market, where it places
about 95 per cent of its business, although Lloyd Thompson's dependence on
the Lloyd's market has declined.
About 45 per cent of its business is placed with Lloyd's syndicates.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sea Containers undecided on IoM stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES Sherwood, president of Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based container
leasing, ferries and hotels group, which bid for the Isle of Man Steam
Packet Company in 1990, said that Sea Containers had not yet decided what to
do with its 41 per cent stake in Isle of Man.
However, he said that after the experiences of 1989-90, when there was a
joint bid for Sea Containers from Stena of Sweden and Tiphook of the UK,
that he 'wished to avoid another adventure in the hostile takeover arena'.
Eventually Sea Containers sold Sealink, the cross-channel ferry operator, to
Stena and some of its container assets to Tiphook.
Mr Sherwood made the comments when reporting on a 'dull' final quarter to
1991, breaking even at the net level. For the year, net earnings were
Dollars 32.7m or Dollars 1.95 a share. The 1990 figures are not comparable
since they include large profits from the asset sales.
Mr Sherwood said 'the underlying trend of the company's business was up and
would emerge in 1992 for all to see'. The 1991 figures would be a benchmark
for the future, he said.
Sea Containers is planning a new class of equity, carrying greater dividends
but fewer votes, which, Mr Sherwood said, would give the company 'greater
flexibility in future financings'.

FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Claremont Garments enjoys independence with
initial Pounds 6.21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVING market share helped Claremont Garments, which supplies clothes
to Marks and Spencer, limit the effects of the recession and post a pre-tax
profit for 48 weeks to December 28 of Pounds 6.21m, compared with a pro
forma figure of Pounds 6.42m.
Claremont demerged from Alexon, the womenswear retailer, in July 1991, the
Pounds 422,000 costs of which were taken as an extraordinary charge. The
second half showed an 11 per cent rise in turnover and Mr Peter Wiegand,
chairman, said the improvement had continued into the first two months of
1992.
The second half recovery helped push turnover for the period to Pounds 47.8m
(Pounds 46.3m).
Earnings per share were 14.4p (14.5p), or 15.6p (15.7p) annualised. The
company is paying a final dividend of 3.5p which, with a special demerger
dividend of 3p, gives a total for 48 weeks of 6.5p, or 7.04p annualised.
The pay-out policy is that dividend cover should remain 'a little over two'.
Strong cash flow and a reduction in working capital helped cut gearing from
50 per cent at the time of the demerger to less than 15 per cent, or Pounds
1.96m, at the year end. The interest charge fell from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds
527,000.
The flow of cash into the business has triggered a hunt for acquisitions.
Its ideal target would have a turnover of between Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m.
Claremont expected to announce a deal within six months at the most and
possibly within weeks, said Mr Wiegand.
COMMENT
Claremont was shielded from the worst of the recession by having Marks and
Spencer as a customer, but it also made the most of its position as the
demerger from Alexon allowed management to concentrate on manufacture. It
has done well to increase sales and will probably be cash positive by the
summer. Profits for 52 weeks this year could beat Pounds 7.5m, giving a
prospective p/e of about 13, close to the market. After a good run, the
share price looks to have risen far enough for the time being. With 93 per
cent of sales to Marks and Spencer, organic growth is doomed to be
unexciting. It will probably take a significant acquisition at a good price
for buyers to come flocking to the stock.
