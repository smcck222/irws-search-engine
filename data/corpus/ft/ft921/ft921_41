FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: Black theatre shapes up - The problems facing ethnic
drama companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RISING star of Britain's black theatre community comes to rest next
month on the expensively refurbished Cochrane Theatre in Central London when
its new occupant, Talawa, opens a show there for the first time. By then,
another black company, Temba, will have set off on the first tour of its
20th anniversary year devoid of the grant that has kept it going up to now.
Talawa is the current apple of the Arts Council's eye, while Temba is out of
favour, losing its funding to a couple of younger, smaller companies.
The Arts Council's decision would seem to signal a generational change in a
sector still largely dominated by the people who set it up 20 years ago. The
growing acceptance of multiracial casting, and the eagerness of
traditionally 'white' theatres to seek out new black work, has thrown the
black theatre community back on its haunches. It has responded, not by
seeking out and nurturing new black British writing talent, but by looking
increasingly towards a nebulous repertory of 'world' classics.
Temba's latest production, A Killing Passion, which opened this week at the
Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, is an Asian adaptation of a German story (Thomas
Mann's The Transposed Heads) performed by an afro-Caribbean cast. The same
sort of synthesis has been in evidence at the South Bank, where the
repertory of the Cottesloe could be read as a stock-taking exercise. After
The Coup, which teamed up the West Indian veterans Mustapha Matura and
Norman Beaton in a political fantasy based on Trinidad's history, came
Jatinder Verma's production of the Sanscrit classic The Little Clay Cart and
Yvonne Brewster's transportation of Lorca's Blood Wedding to
pre-revolutionary Cuba - both with mixed race casts.
As a snapshot of current fortunes within the black sector, the impression
left is revealing. Matura, who wrote The Coup, and Beaton, who starred in
it, are its elder statesmen, consistently successful. Beaton worked for the
National first in Measure for Measure 11 years ago; Matura, who co-founded
the Black Theatre Co-Operative in the late 1970s, was writing for the Royal
Court as long ago as 1971.
Verma and Brewster arrive on very different trajectories, as pillars of
their own establishments. Verma's South London-based Tara Arts, one of only
a couple of Asian companies in the country, whose funding was cut off by
Wandsworth Council this year, but has had its fortunes shored up by the Arts
Council. It cannot afford to use its own theatre any more, but has a healthy
touring life and is about to embark on its first co-production with the
Theatre Royal, Stratford East.
Brewster's Talawa is the rising star of the day. Its opening at the Cochrane
after the completion of a Pounds 350,000 facelift, is a resounding vote of
confidence by the Arts Council. Fortune, however, is a fickle thing and
especially when it comes to funding. The grand launch of the Cochrane in
December was observed with ironic grimaces by two directors who have lost
out in the last funding year: Temba's artistic director Alby James, who has
put together a scaled down year's programme thanks to backing from British
Telecom; and Anton Phillips, whose Carib Theatre Company was reponsible for
a splendid revival of James Baldwin's gospel musical The Amen Corner, but
went down last year after the withdrawal of its funding from Brent Council.
While knocking Temba off its books, the Arts Council has held out the arm of
revenue funding to the promising Black Mime Theatre, which appears at the
Young Vic next week, and the Rastafarian ensemble Double Edge. Black Theatre
Co-op is also giving itself a timely shake-up in anticipation of its next
application for Arts Council funding. It is currently looking for a new
artistic director to steer it into the 1990s - though when Temba advertised
for a new director in the summer when Alby James briefly resigned, no-one
could be found to replace him.
Temba has developed a somewhat meandering policy and although still capable
of producing good work, it has neither the radical sharpness of Double Edge,
nor the consistently canny eye for vote-winners that Talawa has
demonstrated. While keeping itself staunchly Afro-Caribbean, Talawa has
veered fashionably towards adaptations of world classics. Its first Cochrane
season opens with well-judged conservatism, with a rediscovered piece, The
Road, from the Nigerian Nobel prize-winner Wole Soyinka.
The installation of Talawa in the Cochrane has inevitably raised hackles in
a community which, at the start of the 1980s, was looking to a multi-million
pound national theatre of black arts at the Roundhouse in North London's
Chalk Farm. The repercussions of that fiasco in which millions of municipal
pounds were poured down the drains of a magnifient engine shed, are still
being felt four years after the project finally failed. It has cast doubt on
the competence of the black theatre community, many of whose leading lights
felt from the start that the Roundhouse project was setting off along the
wrong lines, in the wrong hands, on the wrong side of town.
The basic trouble, according to a longtime observer of black theatre, is the
sector is still so small that if one company goes under, the whole
establishment is rocked. New writing is particularly risky and therefore
particularly badly affected by insecurity. A generation of actors and
directors are moving on to television and film.
It took a couple of Americans, Charles Augins and Clarke Peters, to put
together Five Guys Named Moe, the West End stayer which began its winning
streak at Stratford East. Philip Hedley, the theatre's white director, is
philosophical. 'What has happened is that there has been a breakthrough in
acting talent, followed by some writers and directors. They are just
beginning to bang their head against a ceiling because as yet they don't
have any producers.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: Audiences keep faith - Box office takings for 1991 are
on target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST have been like a rugby scrum on London's South Bank arts complex
last week end. All nine performances at the three auditoria at the National
Theatre were 100 per cent sold out and on Sunday the Hayward Gallery had its
highest attendance ever with over 3,800 people shuffling in front of the
canvases of Toulouse-Lautrec to ensure that box office revenue for the show
topped the Pounds 1m mark.
In the Royal Festival Hall The Nutcracker provided its annual Christmas
treat for children, and the finances of the English National Ballet, with 97
per cent capacity for the evening performance and 95 per cent at the
matinee, ringing up another Pounds 1m jackpot.
So much for talk of the recession hitting the arts. Of course this was a
special weekend and advance bookings in January are ominously blank for many
companies. But against most economic logic the audience for plays and music,
opera and dance, has kept the faith. There is no boom but box office takings
are, in most cases, on target. Indeed they are considerably higher than
during last year's disastrous Gulf War-torn spring, and the lack-lustre,
tourist scarce, summer.
This is especially true of the theatre. When the Society of West End
Theatres finally produces its 1991 figures they are likely to reveal a
decline in audience of around 5 per cent on the record 1990 when 11.3m
people took in a West End show. At the end of August attendances had been 7
per cent down on the previous year. By late October they were 6 per cent
lower and there are signs that the year ended fairly strongly, delivering an
audience just about on a level with 1989.
In fact the West End is in a strange state of suspended animation, a trough
of comparative well being. On average last year 40 West End theatres were
open for business and ten were dark, identical figures to 1990. During 1991,
193 productions raised their curtains for the first time as against 187 in
1990. There were 32 productions of classic plays and revivals as against 31
in 1989 and there were seven new musicals, again no change on the previous
year.
The only sign of caution was a fall in the gamble on new plays, down from 30
to 21. The obverse was the safety first revival of past musical hits, which
doubled to ten. One extraordinary fact, which social commentators might like
to chew on, is that for the second successive year no thriller appeared in
the West End. This is a genre kidnapped by television.
The post-Christmas torpor always kills off a few productions and this year
Noel and Gertie, It's Ralph, and Alan Ayckbourn's The Revenger's Comedy made
premature excuses and left but there are 14 hopefuls waiting in the wings.
Although impressario Duncan Weldon has made a well argued case for the death
of West End theatre, with too many expensive products chasing too few
cautious customers (and there are omens of the Broadway scenario of a few
big hits, mainly musicals, making money while the majority of productions
are certain loss makers), the London theatre is currently alive if not
positively thriving.
This is also true of the subsidised sector, especially the Royal National
Theatre. In the last three months it has made up the money it lost in the
summer when The White Devil and The Miser proved commercially disappointing.
Wind in the Willows did capacity business last month and Alan Bennett's
other contribution, George III, played to 99 per cent audiences. The gamble
on reviving Edward Bond's The Sea has paid off after a slow start and it was
92 per cent sold last month. The RNT is set to score a satisfactory 80 per
cent capacity on its season.
In contrast the RSC had problems in the autumn, notably at its main house in
Stratford where Julius Caesar was scuppered by the critics, but a string of
hits at The Swan and the Other Place produced Stratford attendances of 78
per cent to set against the 70 per cent in London, where the Shakespeare
transfers and Wilde's A Woman of No Importance did well but David Edgar's Dr
Jekyll and Mr Hyde did not deliver the hoped for Christmas box at the
Barbican. Even so overall RSC autumn attendances of 75 per cent are on
target.
It is also better than expected in the concert halls. The core audience  -
 middle aged and middle class - is protected from the worst economic
stresses, and October at the Festival Hall produced the third best
attendance figures for the month in the past 11 years. There is evidence of
horns being pulled in at the restaurants and bars, and independent
impressarios are taking fewer risks, but the South Bank is far from
panicking.
It is a similar picture at the Barbican where box office income is
marginally down. The LSO audiences have recovered after a summer blip but
customer retrenchment was apparent when the annual Christmas performance of
Messiah dropped 10 per cent of its usual capacity. The Barbican, too, is
suffering from the cut backs by impressarios and has unexpected dark nights
in February.
Opera, with the costliest seat prices, is most vulnerable to an economic
downturn. The English National Opera is presenting a safer repertoire after
the gamble of its 1990-91 season, which was completely devoted to operas
written in the 20th century, and it must be glad of its caution. Don
Giovanni and Figaro's Wedding have done the business, although Die
Fledermaus has fallen below target, thanks to sniffy reviews for a fun
evening. Forward bookings are not great but so far this season the ENO is
achieving 70 per cent audiences and is on target to break even.
Audiences, at just over 80 per cent on the year, are higher at the Royal
Opera House but below the levels needed by director general Jeremy Isaacs to
keep Covent Garden in the black. Last season he notched up 90 per cent plus
for both opera and ballet, and planned for the same response. Once again
Figaro is packing them in but Mozart's youthful masterpiece Mithridate has
not turned good reviews into full houses.
Covent Garden took no risks in providing impressario Raymond Gubbay with his
production of Turandot which on Wednesday ended its run at Wembley Arena.
The Opera House received a guaranteed fee and the chance of extra revenue if
the show proved a commercial smash. In the event it epitomised the current
financial state of the arts - satisfactory but not brilliant. Around 80,000
seats were open to offers, and over Pounds 2m committed on the venture. Good
reviews proved the salvation and although a sold capacity of 70 per cent
will not deliver a profit it should provide the lift off to take the
production to lucrative dates in Australia, Japan, and around the world.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: Guaranteed a Good Death - The Grim Reaper treated with
respect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE DAYS we are pretty hot on the subject of the Good Birth, whereas the
subject of the Good Death is guaranteed to cast a pall over the
dinner-table. Ante-natal classes and retirement courses are an expected part
of the learning curve of your average late-20th-century individual. But as
for the death business, the potential market has yet to be tapped.
Universities have been slow to diversify into Pre-Mortem courses and Weekend
FT's plans for a new column called 'Memento Mori' have found little favour
with the advertisers.
Our ancestors, it is well known, took a robust view of death. The Art of
Death at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (until March 22: 071-938-8500)
examines how, from 1500 to 1800, our Protestant forefathers treated the Grim
Reaper. A varied range of objects such as prints and paintings, jewellery,
mourning apparel, death-masks, and coffin-furniture, shows how up front they
were about death in the England of Shakespeare and Dr Johnson.
One of the great virtues of this exhibition is that it constantly invites us
to contrast then and now. Imagine your feelings on finding your seven
year-old daughter stitching this verse in her sewing-lesson:
'The righteous fear
not at their death
but calmly yield
their latest breath.'
To us it seems morbid in the extreme, but the little girl who stitched this
sampler in 1710 might have found it perfectly natural to reflect on the Good
Deaths she would probably already have witnessed in her young life. Was
death less frightening to William Evans, who had his funeral effigy carved
at the same time as his late wife's, and put where he could see it in his
church?
This is an exhibition crammed with objects which tend to be curious rather
than beautiful. However, Van Dyck's haunting portrait of Lady Venetia Digby
on her deathbed in 1633 should not be missed - although if you do, it hangs
normally in the Dulwich Picture Gallery. Before matrimony Venetia had been
something of a good-time girl, and her sudden death left Sir Kenelm, her
spouse, devastated: he became a scholar-hermit. In pre-Reformation England,
he would have had the comfort of paying for masses to be said for Venetia's
soul. But death was now a chillier affair: all the more important, if you
had the money, to have artists, sculptors, and craftsmen, to memorialise the
departed.
My favourite thing in the whole exhibition is an astonishing 17th-century
posthumous portrait from Abbots Ann Hall in Kendal, called 'Sir Thomas
Braithwaite of Ambleside'. It could usefully hang in every solicitor's
office in the land. The anonymous early 17th-century artist has painted a
memorable image of the Good Death of one 'of gentry stock'. Poor Thomas was
only in his thirties when he died, and we see him hollow-eyed in his
nightshirt, leaning against pillows covered in pious texts in English,
Latin, and French - to show he had been no bumpkin.
The point of the picture was also to commend Thomas as one who had made the
proper move in the face of Death: he had made his Will. No one seems to know
who the gentleman is shown proferring the document, but it would be nice to
think it was the chief beneficiary.
There are many quaint and poignant things in this exhibition. I was much
taken by the virgin's paper crown from Hampshire, where it hangs in a church
full of these memorials to girls who kept their chastity. Theatre-lovers
should look out for the mezzotint of Garrick's deathmask, looking amazingly
vigorous, and the invitation to his funeral which shows a weeping willow, a
weeping lady, and the legend 'Ireland. Undertaker' inscribed on a pyramid.
Apparently so many fashionable people attended the great actor's funeral
that the carriages jammed all the way from the Strand to Westminster Abbey.
This information comes from what ought to be a catalogue, but does not
really fit the bill: Nigel Llewellyn's book, The Art of Death (Reaktion
Books, Dollars 9.95: 160pp.) As I said in my FT review last year, this is a
good book, clever and informative. At that time it was something of a
posthumous child because the exhibition, of which Llewellyn is the curator,
had been postponed; it had been billed to open during the Gulf War, but the
museum's trustees decided that was a bad moment to confront the public with
coffins and death's heads.
Unfortunately, the months since publication did not prompt Llewellyn to
think again about how to make his thesis the skeleton of the exhibition. The
text which goes with the show is therefore perfectly dire, with Llewellyn's
interesting ideas squashed into horrid pellets of academic-speak which
spatter the exhibition.
Try this: 'Commemorative art confirmed the image of the 'social body', in
itself unstable and prone to disappear from the collective memory.' I
imagine a translation might be, 'people commissioned works of art to help
them remember the dead.' You might think the point of funeral ritual is easy
enough to grasp. But evidently not: 'The burial service was conducted
according to a rigid code in an attempt to preserve the social structure
undermined by the loss of a member of the community.' So what happened if
someone giggled, or the vicar lost his place in the service-book? Did the
fragile social structure really start to totter like a badly-built
catafalque?
For years I have wanted to see a good death show. Sadly, I find The Art of
Death rather dreary, too limited in scope and squeezed by its scholarly
corset. For all that, it is an interesting show: and someone, one day, will
give this richest of subjects a really good outing.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: Drama from the past - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE Monday, changes in Radio 2 must seem to listeners as appalling as the
changes in Radio 4 last year. I usually think of Radio 2 as the one you hear
but needn't listen to, unless you have asked for a dedicated record. Now
Brian Hayes, noted elsewhere for his abruptness with callers, takes over the
6.30 slot, Good Morning, UK], from Ken Bruce, who moves to 9.30 for a
two-hour stint including Pick of the Hits.
Jimmy Young starts later, at 11.30, but goes on longer, until two o'clock. A
fresh, if by no means unfamiliar, name enters the afternoon at 3.30, Ed
Stewart, with 'the most popular easy music', selected by Gallup. And Derek
Jameson now winds up the day from 10.30 to midnight, no longer on his own
but with his wife, Ellen Jameson. His programme will carry all sorts of
assorted goodies, brain-teasers, phone-ins and so on, but I'd rather reserve
judgment for a while.
On Sunday, Radio 3 (of which jokers say Derek Jameson would like to be
Controller) repeated its 1980 recording of Virginia Woolf's Between the
Acts, as adapted by Liane Aukin. This is set in the grounds of a country
house in the war-threatened summer of 1939. After little evident
consultation with the Olivers, who live there, a pageant is produced for
charity, its theme the sweep of English history. But this is so presented by
the producer, Miss La Trobe, as to reflect to the audience their real
nature. The action alternates what is played on the stage with the conduct
of the Olivers and their guests. The stage comes out better.
Starting with a child representing England, we have parodies of Chaucer,
Elizabethan drama, a Restoration comedy, a Victorian piece like TW
Robertson, and so on. As Miss La Trobe (Sarah Badel) believes us all to be
'orts, scraps, fragments', the reflection is not kind. On the other hand, it
is not unkind enough to anger the upper-middle-class audience. 'Do you get
her meaning?' they ask, which may explain La Trobe's conclusion that the
result was 'nothing, a failure'. The production, under David Spenser,
depended for effect on the playing of the characters, acute but not always
quite free of cliche. It sent me to the library to determine whether this
was due to Woolf or to Aukin. The book wasn't available.
A Matter of Sex (Radio 4, Thursday) was drama of a different kind. Abigail,
played as an old woman by octogenarian Patricia Hayes, as a young woman by
Diane Bull, married James, a handsome young man who spent one night with her
so modestly (and so deceptively played by Anna Savva) that she never
realised he was actually a girl. They remained long married, though he spent
much time away from her, and in the end admitted his real sex. When he died
in hospital after an accident, the truth had to come out.
The tale was largely told through Abigail's affidavit admitting that she had
long known the truth - a process she was driven to by the scandal. Author
Nick Stafford takes this public dislike for granted, though it is said that
Queen Victoria could not believe that there could be love between women,
which is why the anti-homosexual laws applied only to men. There is much old
cockney slang (the marriage was in 1807), and some mock-poetic prose and
comic names - Jimmy Giblet, Tommy Twattle, Colly Mutton - that detract from
the belief we have in the story, leaving it a somewhat empty anecdote
irrelevant to current thoughts. Claire Grove directed.
This week's File on 4 on Tuesday was subtitled Hot Pursuit. It examined how
far the code of practice laid down for police drivers in 1989 is adhered to,
and how much legal or disciplinary action is taken in cases of breach. Three
individual cases were examined, and in each of them the drivers appeared not
to be taking the orders of their controllers as they should.
The examination of such specific cases is likely to lead to wholesale
decisions against the drivers; but with reckless driving by the public so
increasingly common, it is hard to expect the police drivers always to give
in to their controllers, however strict the code of practice.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: 'Cosi' revived
</HEADLINE>

   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE LATEST Royal Opera Cosi fan tutte
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
first shown three years ago, revived for the first time on Thursday - is a
curious and (to my taste) unpleasing combination of knockabout and
sour-tasting pessimism about human nature. The action begins with a super
elaborately falling down drunk, twice, and ends with the lovers resolutely
unreconciled: no purist nonsense about taking seriously the words of the
opera's very last line.
In between, there is much skittishness and tomfoolery, carried out in a
horribly ugly box-set, biscuit-coloured when not Stygian black, which only
becomes bearable in Act 2, when an exotic coloured tent descends to
ameliorate the worst of the decor's eye-straining and voice-dissipating
properties. The producer, Johannes Schaaf, seems to have conceived of the
opera as a dry philosophical proposition argued out in theatrically
semi-abstract terms; the indoor and outdoor physical charms of the music are
slighted, and the overall gain seems little more than a slick
late-20th-century knowingness about human relations which amounts, in the
end, to a failure of emotional understanding.
It is, however, an intelligent, consistent production - however much I
dislike Schaaf's work, I have to admit that he sticks to his guns. And there
can be no question that the 1992 realisation of this Cosi proves infinitely
preferable to the 1989 original. It is sung and acted with no less fluency
and infinitely more dramatic responsiveness; the conductor, Carlo Rizzi,
though as yet insufficiently ready to acknowledge the bubbling good humour -
laughter, even - in Mozart's scoring, times the dramatic unfolding with
whip-cracking alertness and an Italianate fizz that maintains unbroken
momentum throughout Act 2: a notable achievement.
The most startling improvement comes with the Fiordiligi, Margaret Marshall.
Three years ago she showed us a miniaturised character, full of wispy-voiced
'melting' mannerisms; on Thursday she seemed a singer transformed, boldly on
the verbal and vocal attack, confident and commanding. The basic seriousness
of the dominant elder sister and the suggestibility of the flighty younger
(Diana Montague, first-rate after a cloudy start) are beautifully
intertwined. The no less plausible matching of the male pair - Kurt Streit
(Glyndebourne's Ferrando in his house debut), tall, romantic, the most
seductive and stylish of today's Mozart tenors, and William Shimell
(Guglielmo), dark, volatile, his baritone much less stentorian and more
mellifluous than usual - lends the opera a variousness of character and
personality that comes near to balancing Schaaf's fidgety notions.
This time Anne Howells's glorious mature-woman Despina, a perfect gem of
golden wit, elegance and fine timing, is partnered with the Alfonso of
Stafford Dean. Bald-pated, a clubbable English gentleman in frock-coat and
top hat, he gives a subtle, many-layered account of the role, vigorously
sung - the surface all unruffled, smiling good manners, the core hard and
unbending. It is, in sum, an exceptionally well-assorted Cosi sextet; in
this particular production, the many compensatory pleasures it provides are
received with special gratitude.

Chorus. Philips 432 157-2 (two CDs)
SUDDENLY we have three new recordings of Richard Strauss's Salome. Even in
the days of LPs, Ljuba Welitsch's searing account of (just) the final
monologue outdid anything to be heard in a 'complete' version, and there was
rarely more than one of those to be found on record in any year. Among the
ones that came and went, the incisive Nilsson/Solti performance (revived on
Decca CDs) held its ground - too unremitting and ferocious to brook any
argument, but just for that reason not exactly definitive. Neither is any of
the new versions; but 'definitiveness' is a will-o'-the-wisp virtue, whereas
each of these performances has specific virtues of its own.
On Sony, Zubin Mehta's boasts sensible tempi, canny expertise in bringing
out orchestral details (especially the exquisite silvery filigree that
Strauss often sets around the effusions of Salome and Herod), and a staunch
cast which includes Brigitte Fassbaender's scathing Herodias and Keith
Lewis's faultlessly ardent Narraboth. On the other hand, the carefully
realised detail seems to come in separate panels, at severe cost to the
cumulative, 'symphonic' impetus of the score.
This one-act piece was after all not only Strauss's first operatic triumph,
but in a way the culmination of his ideal 'symphonic poem', on a straight
track from Don Juan and Till Eulenspiegel through Ein Heldenleben. If Salome
sounds like a string of colourful episodes, it is wrong. On DG, Giuseppe
Sinopoli achieves a hypnotic continuity of feeling - personal and wilful,
super-silken (though he finds Bergian raptures in all the string-writing, he
plays down Strauss's dry grotesqueries and savage punctuations), and yet
steadily forward-looking. One's attention is held taut, even if the
symphonic muscle of the score is under-exercised.
One of Sinopoli's best assets here is the Deutsche Oper orchestra, which may
not compete with the Berlin Philharmonic in virtuosity but is deeply
familiar with the score. By comparison with Mehta's stolid reading, the DG
performance is fully theatrical, eerie and insinuating. And if Sinopoli's
Narraboth, and his efficiently nasty Herod and Herodias, do not quite equal
their opposite numbers on Sony, he holds trump cards in Cheryl Studer's
heroine and Bryn Terfel's Jokanaan.
Notoriously, Strauss wanted 'a 16-year-old princess with the voice of an
Isolde' - to which his mature first Salome retorted that that was an
either/or. On the kindest diagnosis, Mehta's Eva Marton sounds like a heavy
Isolde, embarrassing to hear after Miss Studer's brilliant, teasing
lightness in repartee and her haunted anxiety later. I doubt that there is a
Salome to match Studer now. For the Prophet, Mehta has Bernd Weikl,
sympathetic and mellifluous but hardly more likely to excite Salome's lust
than Jose Van Dam's weighty senior cleric in the Nagano performance on
Virgin Classics; Terfel's splendid young baritone, passionately committed,
is unbeatable.
The special interest of Kent Nagano's recording is that it is the first to
use Oscar Wilde's own, idiosyncratic French text, for which Strauss himself
adapted his score (with guidance from Romain Rolland). It works rather well,
though there are passages where music designed for strenuous German diction
is awkwardly slow for French, and Nagano's cast is good enough to make it
effective: a nervy young princess from Karen Huffstodt, an unusually sane,
worried Herod by Jean Dupouy (not the hysterical character-tenor we most
often get), an imposing First Nazarene from Jules Bastin.
If the Lyon orchestra doesn't sound perfectly idiomatic in Strauss's music -
more bon gout here than is strictly appropriate - Nagano secures a
creditably intelligent, alert performance. He does particular justice to the
high orchestral writing which gives Salome its neurotic glitter, where
Sinopoli prefers to emphasise the dark undertow at the bottom of the band.
It must be admitted that the French recording is not up to Austro-German
standards: the voices are kept so far forward that they sometimes cover
instrumental details as they never would in the opera-house.
Die Fledermaus, by that other Strauss (no relation), enjoys an all-star
performance under Andre Previn on Philips. Dame Kiri's Rosalinde rises
beautifully to the Csardas, and in Adele's coloratura Edita Gruberova is as
fearless and fetching as you would expect. The baritone Eisenstein (Wolfgang
Brendel) and Falke (Olaf Bar) are all right, not remarkable; Richard Leech
and Fassbaender are more dashing as the indefatigable tenor Alfred and the
louche Prince Orlofsky. Tom Krause is a ripe, winning Frank, and the
opera-producer Otto Schenk makes a rich character of the gaoler Frosch.
Previn knows well enough how this music should go, and there is a decent
degree of verve, if few witty finesses. The Vienna chorus is first-rate
(sumptuous and funny in 'Duidu'). We are spared any trendy interpolations,
and the text is not manhandled, though bits of English are planted in it to
excuse Dame Kiri's not-quite-native accent. In fact the spoken dialogue
rattles along admirably; after the first time round, nevertheless, most
listeners will be pressing the CD button after each musical number to get on
to the next one. It might be easier to wait for the 'highlights' record.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: New Year in the City of Music - The start of
Birmingham's year long festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 1992 Birmingham has been designated Britain's City of Music, the
guinea-pig in the Arts Council's 'Arts 2000' project that intends to
spotlight a different region and a different art form each year until the
millennium. The accolade is being celebrated with 'Sounds like Birmingham',
a year-long festival designed to range across the spectrum from local
community-based performances to the most glamorous international visitors.
With the opening of Symphony Hall last spring and the continued prosperity
of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra Birmingham had already placed
itself at the very centre of our concert life. The new year promises to show
just how the musical profile is to be rounded out, so that the goodies are
not confined to the juiciest programmes from Simon Rattle and the CBSO but
can offer a truly varied diet of events and, one hopes, set the pattern for
years to come. Certainly the omens look promising: in the first ten days of
January, while London music is still struggling to rouse itself from its
seasonal torpor, Symphony Hall has already staged a Rakhmaninov Festival
with Alexander Lazarev and the Bolshoy Symphony Orchestra and an account of
Schubert's Winterreise by Peter Schreier of memorable penetration and
intensity.
Russian orchestras are a very visible part of the hall's roster - the Moscow
State Orchestra visits next month, while the return of the St. Petersburg
Philharmonic is promised for a complete cycle of Tchaikovsky symphonies in
the autumn. The Bolshoy may not on the level of either of those orchestras
but its performances of Rakhmaninov, had spirit and, for good or bad,
lashings of local colour. The symphonies were coupled with three of the
concertos, played by an impressive trio of young soloists - Dmitry Alexeyev
played the Paganini Rhapsody, Mikhail Rudy the Second Concerto and Nikolay
Demidenko the Third.
I caught the second programme, in which Rudy gave an admirably fluent
performance, technically faultless yet surprisingly bland: there were few
idiosyncracies, and few fresh ideas; even a Chopin Nocturne offered as an
encore failed to reveal the expressive personality of this fascinatingly
gifted performer. Lazarev accompanied efficiently enough and his account of
the Second Symphony was similarly uncontroversial, if sometimes a little too
obviously excitable. The Bolshoy has the well-drilled, solid string sound
one has always associated with Russian orchestras and which the St
Petersburg orchestra delivers most thrillingly of all; less appealingly it
has vibrato-laden wind tone. Thin, watery horns may be an acquired taste,
but wavering clarinet intonation is nothing but a positive liability in the
slow movement of Rakhamnonov's Second. In such circumstances one was
grateful for Lazarev's shortcuts through its longueurs. Yet the performance
was rapturously received, and the concerts attracted evidently large,
enthusiastic audiences.
Schreier's recital on Thursday was less crowded, though all but the upper
galleries were full, and the hall managed to convey every detail of his
beautifully focussed sound and minutely studied performance with effortless
clarity. The bloom is starting to fade from his tone nowadays, and there are
indications that artfulness is replacing artlessness in what used to be one
of the most purely sung contemporary accounts of Winterreise.
He seems no longer willing to trust to purity of line and intonation alone
to make his points. Syllables are occasionally stressed to the point of
pushing them out of tune, while abrupt switches of vocal characterisation
and colour are reminders that this tenor is one of the finest Loges and
Mimes of our day. It holds together still because of the intelligence and
absolute security informing his performances; throughout the 24 songs
Schreier takes his listeners into a poetic world from which he never allows
them to escape. He was wonderfully supported here by Graham Johnson, tactful
and responsive by turn; it was in every respect an utterly compelling event.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Arts: Dybbuk comes to town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHALOM ANSKI'S A Dybbuk for Two People is a classic of the Yiddish theatre,
a marvellous, archetypal story of doomed love and demoniac possession
wrapped in the rituals of the Jewish Sabbath. It has become a speciality for
Bruce Myers who, created this English version for the 1980 Avignon festival
and has been performing it with a succession of consorts ever since.
His latest partnership, with Corinne Jaber, a companion from Peter Brook's
Paris company, touched down at the Edinburgh Festival last summer and
arrives at the Hampstead Theatre rather disappointingly set in its ways.
When Myers performed it at Islington's Almeida Theatre with Josianne Stoleru
in 1986, the emphasis fell much more heavily on the thumping good yarn of a
young girl possessed by the spirit of her dead lover. In this incarnation,
the horror has receded, giving pride of place to the sacramental formality
with which the story is framed. The Sabbath rituals are painstakingly
observed by an actor who seems to have become increasingly rabbinical
beneath a shock of grey hair which gives him the look of a slightly batty
Old Testament prophet.
It is as if Myers has become so immersed in the protocol of the piece that
the balance between narrative and ritual has been distorted. So we have a
lengthy preamble of domestic propriety and theological debate, the
intricacies of which are lost on anyone unfamiliar with the doctrines of the
Talmud and the Cabala.
The theatrical meat of the piece - the haunting of a bride on her wedding
day and a failed attempt at exorcism - is relegated to the status almost of
a sub-plot. Jaber has a creepy ability to show the whites of her eyes and
walk like a marionette controlled by a drunken puppeteer; Myers is at his
best when he drops his earnestness to impersonate a queue of wedding
revellers or deliver a rambling nuptial speech.
Part of the problem is that the show does not seem to have found a rapport
with the difficult space of Hampstead Theatre, which allows for no dimension
beyond the small, drab square of family dining-room. Though comparisons are
odious, I cannot help remembering how the lofty brick arc of the Almeida
created a sense of the great beyond, into which ordinary people venture at
their peril. Here, the struggle of the bride and her grandmother to the
cemetery, where dead and living lovers are reunited, is merely a journey a
across dining-chairs. It remains a terrific story, but with too much back
and not enough beyond.

PATRICK GORDON WALKER: POLITICAL DIARIES 1932-1971 edited by Robert Pearce
The Historians' Press Pounds 20, 335 pages
'I DON'T yet know how I'll set about things in Parliament. But clearly
there's no point in going into Parliament unless you have the intention of
becoming Prime Minister. Clearly this is what I must go for. I think I'll
lie low for 5 years or so and get myself well in with the Party.'
So wrote Patrick Gordon Walker in his diary on August 8, 1945. Gordon Walker
had already been lucky and unlucky with by-elections. He was the official
Labour candidate in the famous Oxford by-election in October 1938, but was
forced to withdraw when the Party switched to a popular front candidate, AD
Lindsay, the Master of Balliol. Lindsay lost to the Conservative, Quintin
Hogg.
A former Oxford don, Gordon Walker spent the war working for the German
service of the BBC. He did not contest the general election of July 1945,
but shortly after the result was announced the Labour Member for Smethwick
was killed in a car crash. Gordon Walker stood in the by-election and sailed
in. In just over a year he was parliamentary private secretary to Herbert
Morrison, the deputy prime minister. Within five years he was Commonwealth
Secretary. So much for lying low.
GW, as he calls himself in these diaries, went on to become Foreign
Secretary in Harold Wilson's first government. But there were accidents
along the way, most of them to do with the Commonwealth and by-elections. He
had been instrumental in devising the formula which kept India in the
Commonwealth, but was perhaps best known for his unavoidable involvement in
the Seretse Khama affair.
As a junior minister in the Attlee government, Gordon Walker had ruled that
Seretse should not become chief of his tribe in Bechuanaland once he married
a white woman. It was a horrendously difficult decision. Allowing a mixed
marriage at that level could have upset the entire balance of power in
southern Africa; not allowing it made Gordon Walker look illiberal and
opposed to the multi-racial Commonwealth he was trying to promote.
GW got the worst of both worlds. The Labour left condemned him; much of the
rest of the electorate thought that he was too pro-black in his advocacy of
the Commonwealth and relatively permissive attitude towards immigration. He
records that he told Hugh Gaitskell as early as September 1962 that he might
lose his Smethwick seat as a result. In October 1964 he duly did, just as he
was being appointed Foreign Secretary.
Prime Minister Wilson kept him on and secured an apparently safe by-election
for him in Leyton; Gordon Walker lost that as well, though he won the seat
in the subsequent general election. That was the effective end of his
political career.
His diaries are spasmodic and only occasionally illuminating, but this book
contains an excellent 50 page introductory biographical sketch by Robert
Pearce - a model of its kind. Gordon Walker died in 1980. As Pearce notes,
that was just too early for him to have joined the Social Democratic Party.
GW had already written a critical obituary of Harold Wilson for the Daily
Telegraph in 1969.
At least one diary entry is worth cherishing to show how little Britain has
changed. 'June 20, 1934: The British Government voted in a minority of 4
govts in the International Labour Organisation against the draft convention
of a 40-hour week. And in a minority of one against the amendments against
night work for women.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Books: Behind the myth of Middle Earth - From Nabokov to
Tolkien, the FT critics review the most interesting of the recently
published volumes of biography and memoir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILBO PEERED out from the shelter of Gandalf's cloak. He shivered at what he
saw. Their eagle eyrie high among the crags of lofty Isengard gave an
unrivalled view for many hundreds of miles in every direction. Middle Earth
was under attack from a vast army. An army familiar in form - elves,
wizards, goblins and dwarves were all to be seen - but they were somehow
insubstantial, in sharp contrast to the warriors the hobbit had encountered
on his travels. 'There are so many of them,' Bilbo sighed. 'They'll sweep
away everything, everything.' 'Fear not, little one' the wizard replied.
'Nothing can destroy that which has been forged by the Master. These are
mere reflections of his great creation. Only the true dream will survive, as
your children and grandchildren will see in years to come.'
So might the denizens of his imaginary world view the floodtide of
imitations which have been a commercial consequence of the immense popular
success of JRR Tolkien's literary invention. Now, in the centenary year of
his birth, the fantasy industry has gone into overdrive. But what little is
really known of the man himself?. Two books published to mark the centenary
bear the authentic Tolkien stamp, and provide fresh insight into the man
behind the enduring myths of Middle Earth.
The Tolkien Family Album (HarperCollins, 90 pages, Pounds 12.99), compiled
by Tolkien's daughter Priscilla and his eldest son John, witnesses that the
distinguished Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon was no dry and dusty academic
but a devoted husband and loving father of four. The books which were to
bring him international fame in the most unexpected quarters started life as
bedtime tales for his children, who also proved his sternest critics.
His life was as rich and colourful as that of any of his Middle Earth
creations. He was an eccentric yet loving father and an attentive husband,
whose lifelong love affair with his wife is recorded in the epitaph on their
joint gravestone: 'Edith Mary Tolkien, Luthien, 1889-1971. John Ronald Reuel
Tolkien, Beren, 1892-1973.' It is a reference to his own story in The
Silmarillion of the love between Beren, a mortal man, and Luthien, an elf
maiden.
The spiritual depth of his books and their sub-text of ceaseless conflict
between good and evil reflect the author's Christian faith. He was a
committed Roman Catholic and his religious example perhaps played some part
in the shaping of his son John's vocation to the priesthood.
The Tolkien Family Album offers a uniquely intimate and affectionate glimpse
of the life from which the world-conquering fictions of Middle Earth stem.
John and Priscilla Tolkien have painstakingly sifted a mass of memorabilia,
family photographs and keepsakes to create a warm, refined tribute to the
memory of their father. Handsomely produced, designed in the style of an
Edwardian family album, the volume is striking also for the quality of its
photographs.
Everyday life chez the Tolkiens is brought energetically to life. Many
anecdotes illustrate the love which went into the writing of The Hobbit and
its sequel, and the atmosphere in which both works grew. These insights go
some way to account for the extraordinary excitement which the books still
generate. The Tolkien phenomenon seems to be actually gaining in vitality as
the years pass. Anyone curious about the human context and inspiration for
the mythology of Middle Earth will find that The Tolkien Family Album
provides an indispensable perspective.
Sauron Defeated (HarperCollins, 482 pages, Pounds 20) forms the ninth volume
of the encyclopaedic History of Middle Earth, as drawn up from his father's
papers, by Christopher Tolkien, the sternest infant critic and adult editor
of the Tolkien oeuvre. Each of the book's three sections contains hitherto
unpublished writings by JRR Tolkien, scrupulously copy-edited and annotated.
There is an Epilogue to The Lord of the Rings which finds Sam Gamgee
answering questions from his own children about his epic adventures. The
Notion Club Papers, forming the second part of the book, report the
fictional discussions of a literary society in Oxford. Hobbitomanes
everywhere will not want to be without either of these volumes. As a casual
reader, the chief interest to me of Sauron Defeated is the light it casts on
the Tolkien phenomenon.
By this I mean that Nature once produced a genial Oxford professor who had
only to breathe on any particle of his remarkable imagination to have that
particle live and expand until it became a complex ingredient of an
autonomous 'secondary world'. Fifty and more years later, another man, woman
or child in another country and culture takes up one of his books and is
drawn so completely into that imaginative world that even the least curious
student of human nature must be driven to ask: How?.
The fine content of both these additions to the Tolkien canon only amplifies
that stubborn question, the answer to which may in the end prove as elusive
as the Ring itself. Enough rationalising. Enjoy.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Books: Paris through Moslem eyes - From Nabokov to Tolkien,

A GIRL IN PARIS by Shusha Guppy Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 256 pages
BOOKS WHICH portray the Islamic world through the eyes of a Western
traveller are abundant. Books which do the reverse - looking at the West
through the eyes of a Moslem, Middle Eastern visitor - unfortunately are
not. So Susha Guppy's intriguing memoirs, A Girl In Paris, which tell of her
arrival in Paris in the 1950's as an Iranian student, provide a welcome and
fascinating read.
Torn from a strict Moslem home in Iran - a world vividly described in her
first book, The Blindfold Horse - Susha Guppy arrived alone in Paris at the
age of 17, speaking little French and painfully naive. The culture shock
must have been daunting. As she was thrown into the world of Parisian
student life, Communist politics, French theatre, and then, through a chance
encounter with Jacques Prevert, into a singing career, the Paris she
encountered was swirling with political, sexual and artistic freedoms.
Her accounts of these experiences remain deceptively self-effacing, written
with vividness and a welcome lack of pretension. Her observations on Paris
are not, in themselves, particularly novel, but it is the tales of the
people she encounters, many of whom, like her, are fellow 'wanderers' caught
between a range of cultures, which remain most compelling. A fluent story
teller, she travels through her memories as if she was flicking through a
family photo album, pausing as each new character is introduced to relate
their tale. We hear about the Jordanian Jamila's rejection of her society's
sexual code; her communist friend Jeanette's suicide over an ill-starred
love affair; the Iranian Miriam's secret drinking; her French singing
teacher's attempts to build a fantasy operatic world; her encounters with
Camus and Prevert.
It is a collection shot through with both humour and melancholy. One is left
with the feeling that Susha Guppy is The One Who Got Away - escaping
unscathed not only from the repressions of Iranian life but also from the
West's political and moral confusions. The fact that she has managed to
write of her 'escape' with such humour and wisdom is a commendable
achievement.

VLADIMIR NABOKOV, THE AMERICAN YEARS by Brian Boyd Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
25, 832 pages
FREELY Brian Boyd throws words like genius and perfect at Nabokov. 'In sheer
beauty of form,' he writes for example, 'Pale Fire may well be the most
perfect novel ever written.' He equates him with Kafka and Joyce among the
greatest writers of the century. That is how we Nabokovians speak. You have
been warned.
This second volume of a tower-block biography begins with our hero, his wife
Vera and son Dmitri, sailing in May 1940 from France to America, a step
ahead of the invading Germans. The first such escape had been from Bolshevik
Russia in 1919. Vera was Jewish, and the second escape was another narrow
squeak.
From now on, Nabokov's art was broken-backed. His early books had been in
Russian, which he used to describe as if it were some thoroughbred animal,
docile to his touch. Now it could no longer race away with his imagination.
He had a living to make, and in dollars. Nabokov dropped into English in the
manner of an exotic bird which had never before migrated to these shores.
Erudite and lexicographical as his mastery became, it never acquired the
free flow of someone whose maternal tongue is English. That is part of the
attraction. He honoured and expanded the language, at a time when native
writers were mostly abusing and shrinking it.
Wellesley, then a woman's college, and afterwards Cornell, gave him a job
teaching world literature - and this was someone who waved aside Henry James
as 'a pale porpoise' and thought Dostoevsky a writer of cheap thrillers.
America and Americans come out of this book extremely well for the
generosity and open-mindedness with which they received this unusual man.
The New Yorker became his first literary platform, thanks largely to the
appreciation of Katherine White, an editor there. Speak, Memory, his
marvellous memoir of a Russian childhood, was published there chapter by
chapter. Bemused by the material, the editors comically interfered with his
prose.
His one influential contact was Edmund Wilson, a Janus-headed friend. It is
a surprise to learn how little he actually did for Nabokov. When finally he
attacked Nabokov's translation of Eugene Onegin in what was the cause
celebre of its day, the motive was envy, or so Boyd finds.
Boyd is the first writer to have unrestricted access to Nabokov's papers,
and he received help from Vera and Dmitri. From him can be learnt the names
of the class rooms in which Nabokov taught, the hours involved; also the
type of tins in which he killed the butterfly specimens which he chased with
such passion in spare moments; and which motels and lodgings he stayed in,
and when.
The Nabokovs were indifferent to material possessions and never owned a
home, but they were closely attached to memory. Nothing, no image, no idea,
no fortuitous connection, seems to have been lost or to have been too
fugitive for Boyd. Trivial details rise in towering layers of prose. Think
of the diligence. To the back of the class, Michael Holroyd]
Perhaps a third of 783 pages are devoted to such intimate analysis of the
novels that they have to be read simultaneously. C'est magnifique, of
course, but it is what the universities clamour for. Perhaps an
up-and-coming don like Boyd could not winkle out some other way to do it,
but the reader is certainly put to the test of true love for the subject.
Nabokov, be it recalled, wrote a mere 150 pages on Gogol, in what is the
most original and illuminating biography ever written.
Then there was Lolita. The novel was a long time in the writing, and Boyd
gives his usual full account of it. What with denunciations of immorality
and Maurice Girodias selling it as a dirty book in Paris, the explosion was
bound to be high altitude. In the event, publishers and politicians behaved
quite courageously in seeing the novel through. Unwittingly, the old
fashioned and aristocratic Nabokov may well have done more than anyone else
to usher in democratic standards of anything goes, which he actually
despised. Boyd makes the good point that he became dated in his own life
time, overtaken by feminists and Third Worlders, or what he called 'boring
ethnopsychics.'
The little nymphet made a world celebrity and a rich man out of him.
Unmelted if ever an immigrant had been, he jumped straight out of the
American melting pot back to unregenerate old Europe. In the Palace Hotel at
Montreux, he settled down to be playfully Garbo-esque, with a sub-stratum of
melancholy, I suppose. No less fascinating a character was Vera, by
temperament a Great Man's Wife, which is a very special category all to
itself. Boyd's minute researches have not broken their privacy. One is left
to admire courtesy, and imagination and curiosity about life. What ought to
have been another 20th century disaster about immigration and persecution
turned into a fairy story.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Motoring: Audi offers more than mere size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDI HAS aimed the new 80 range straight at the executive 'user chooser' who
is more impressed by quality and technology than mere size.
The seven models available in Britain have engines ranging from a 90
horsepower 2-litre 4-cylinder to a 174 bhp, 2.8 litre V6.
Five of the new front-wheel driven 4-door saloons are priced below the
Pounds 19,250 barrier at which the company car tax penalty rises steeply.
The cheapest is the Pounds 13,998 entry model called simply the Audi 80. An
ultra-clean, ultra-economical direct-injection turbo-diesel, due here in
early spring, will be Pounds 14,974.
There are two quattros with permanently engaged four-wheel drive.
One has a 2-litre, 16-valve engine putting out 137 horsepower, the other the
2.8 litre V6. Both, unfortunately, cost more than Pounds 19,250. The 2.0 16v
is Pounds 19,998 and the V6, Pounds 21,798.
I say unfortunately because quattro transmission is something one easily
becomes hooked on and may eventually feel naked without.
A friend of mine who switched from a well-loved A-reg. 90 quattro to a Saab
900 still does.
The more powerful the car, the greater are quattro transmission's benefits
in easy control and safety. Obviously, all-wheel drive is seen at its best
in real winter weather when a quattro keeps going in conditions no two-wheel
driven car could cope with. But there is more to it than that.
Putting the engine's power on the tarmac through four tyre contact patches
makes a muscular car better balanced when accelerating hard.
What I enjoyed most about the 80 2.8E quattro was being able to exploit its
eager performance without fear of losing tyre grip. Overtaking in the wet
was quick and confident; on fast corners it was security itself. As a bonus,
it ran arrow straight on the most blustery motorway.
Not all that many of the 80s sold here will be four-wheel driven. The cost
is high; a 2.0 16v quattro is Pounds 19,998 against Pounds 16,798 and the
2.8E quattro, Pounds 21,798 compared with Pounds 19,249. And automatic
transmission (a Pounds 974 extra on most of the petrol engined 80s) is not
available on 80 quattros.
A rather lumpy 5-speed gearshift and too much tyre roar on coarse surfaces
were the only real drawbacks to my test car. A total redesign of the rear
end has given the new Audi 80 a boot as generous as the old model's was
meagre.
Ride and upholstery are firm, though not uncomfortably so. The interior,
though sombre, stops just short of being funereal.

NOW THAT virtually all the geraniums we use for planting outdoors in summer
are grown from seed, it is easy to forget that there is a different and very
important - though much smaller - trade in geraniums grown in the
traditional way, from cuttings.
This is carried out by nurseries, a few of which, such as The Vernon
Geranium Nursery, Cuddington Way, Cheam, Surrey; Fibrex Nurseries,
Honeybourne Road, Pebworth, Stratford on Avon, and Thorp's Nurseries, 257
Finchampstead Road, Wokingham, Berkshire, grow hundreds of varieties. I have
just received the 1992 Vernon catalogue, which is exceptionally well
illustrated and it made me think about the varied types of geranium that are
available in this way.
Taking this catalogue as a reminder, I see that Vernon leads off with
Speckled Geraniums, which means speckled flowers, although there are quite
different varieties with speckled or netted leaves.
I do not know any of the nine varieties which Vernon puts in this class and
cannot say how the speckling arises, but in most of the ivy-leaved or
trailing varieties colour blotching, which can be very bold, is due to virus
infection. This, though not harmful to the plants, can produce variable
results which are not to everyone's liking. Nevertheless an ivy-leaved
geranium such as Rouletta, which combines carmine and white in varying
proportions, is very popular and most striking for hanging baskets, window
boxes and other containers.
Still following Vernon, there are a few finger-flowered varieties, in which
the petals are quilled and the leaves deeply lobed. There are also many
varieties with double or semi-double flowers which I know to be highly
effective. In the way geranium specialists tend to have of making things
rather too complicated they recognise a separate race of double-flowered
varieties known as Rosebud Geraniums which have small, very full flowers
like little pompons. They are pretty but I have found them difficult to grow
as the flowers rot if the air is too moist.
Then there are Irene Geraniums, with big single flowers, although their
leaves can easily get too large and coarse if they are given over-rich soil.
The Deacon Geraniums are yet another double-flowered race and were all
raised by the late Rev S Stringer. Many, but not all, appear to make
exceptionally compact plants.
There is a great class of Single Geraniums, in character similar to most of
those we now grow so freely from seed. Cactus-flowered Geraniums have
quilled petals; the Vernon Geranium Nursery lists 18 varieties of a type
which it calls Stellar Geraniums. They seem to have no common
characteristics except that they all originated from crosses made between a
geranium known as Chinese Cactus and ordinary zonal-leaved geraniums, the
kind we commonly think of when geraniums are mentioned.
A few geraniums have cupped flowers and are known as tulip-flowered. There
are also old varieties with rather thin yet distinctly woody stems that are
called Unique Geraniums, and are close to the Regal Geraniums. Then there is
a big section, known as Scented Leaf Geraniums, which have nothing in common
except the quality of having aromatic foliage which releases its scent when
brushed. Most have insignificant flowers and many have deeply divided leaves
but one, named Pelargonium Tomentosum, has big, heart-shaped, densely downy
leaves that are strongly peppermint scented. Other scents are lemon, apple,
rose, nutmeg and pine.
There is a big class called Golden Foliage Geraniums and another called
Ornamental Foliage Geraniums, some of which have three separate bands of
colour on the leaves. One of the most famous of these is Mrs H Cox, which
combines bands of yellow, red and black with a green centre. It won a First
Class Certificate from the Royal Horticultural Society as long ago as 1879.
There are a great many Dwarf Geraniums and at least as many Miniatures which
are even smaller, just a few inches high. Cascade Ivy-leaved Geraniums are
much grown on the continent and Hybrid Ivy-leaved Geraniums are the result
of crossing ordinary ivy-leaved varieties with Zonals. They are intermediate
in habit and excellent for hanging baskets, window boxes and other
containers.
Regal Pelargoniums are mainly for cultivation in greenhouses and
conservatories though they can be used outdoors. They have large, often
richly-coloured flowers which are produced in late spring and early summer.
They can be stood outdoors when they cease to flower but need to be brought
inside before there is frost in the autumn.
Finally, there are the Angel Geraniums, which are really miniature Regals
and are said to be gaining in popularity.
It is an astonishing variety of plants to be obtained from one genus. Plants
can be purchased as rooted cuttings or as small pot plants for many months
of the year but especially in spring and early summer. They are easily grown
in peat or soil composts but most of the experts seem to prefer peat because
of its open, well-drained character.
They must not be allowed to freeze at any time, although high temperatures
are not necessary. For economy in winter I set my greenhouse thermostat at
7`C and keep the plants rather dry, but it would really be better to have it
three or four degrees higher. The biggest danger in winter is from botrytis
or grey mould fungus, which produces a rapid decay of stems and leaves and
flourishes in cold, damp air. Sulphur is the best remedy, either spray or
dust form.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Gardening: This is the year for planting heavy metal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO DATE, this year's weather has claimed no casualties in the garden: some
of the half-hardy plants are still with us, an unexpected setting for 1992.
In this dry spell, my plans for the year are ambitious, a short cut to early
arthritis.
I want new flower beds, new plantings, new hedging experiments and swathes
of garden where at present there is only muddle.
The experiments are straightforward, but they need some lengths of heavy
metal. Three years ago, I planted a young yew hedge during one of the dry
spring seasons. The soil is stony everywhere, but especially stony where the
yews have to sit: it was hard enough to plant them in holes of friendly
compost and it would have been even harder to put in a barrier to contain
their hungry roots. It seemed cruel to both of us to block them in at any
depth during dry weather. Like the yews, my plans have grown and I have to
correct this short-cut.
In front of the hedge, I want a new border. I do not merely want it: I have
made it and one end is already planted with the recurrent pink rose Jacques
Cartier, a modern Dianthus called Widdecombe Fair and a promising small
sorbus called koehneana which has white berries.
If you want a proper flower bed in front of a yew hedge, you have to curb
the hedge's roots because they will exhaust the soil. The best method is to
take some strips of corrugated sheeting from a rubbish tip or unwanted shed
and bury them about two feet from the yews to a depth of two or three feet.
The yews will grow strongly, but they will be unable to penetrate the border
in front of them. You will realise your photographic dream, a border of
flowers against an ideal background of dark, living green.
Further along, I also want a hedge of roses. They too, need a heavy metal
treatment. Their great vice is that they go bare at the base unless they are
tied down to a length of plain wire, set just above ground level and
stretched tightly between metal uprights. Several of the best old-fashioned
roses will then make a thick hedge if they are planted about three feet
apart and their shoots are stretched ruthlessly sideways on a low wire as
soon as they are planted.
Once again, I have a local boulder problem, but my present plan is to wire
up an old Edwardian beauty called Mrs John Laing and enjoy her continuous
roses of strong pink in a hedge of wires, broken up by small standard
Pteleas, round-headed trees with scented flowers. Expect reports on
progress: the likeliest enemy is the usual black spot which affects roses on
my light soil.
Elsewhere, my plans are for permanencies which ought to have been finalised
three years ago. One of the consequences of making a new garden is the
realisation that the principled advice of books is seldom obeyed in
practice. Authors always tell us to place the long-term features first, but
new ideas intrude and new possibilities emerge as the site is progressively
tamed.
I have long-term designs on a low sweet-scented hedge of sarcocca which
flowers in winter. I want to imitate the wooden pergolas in the French rose
garden at Bagatelle; I want a serious Magnolia which will survive on lime in
the Cotswolds and allow its flowers to hang down like lids on a rare white
dish. The likeliest candidate seems to be Magnolia Wilsonii, which is said
to tolerate lime and is selling locally at a decent height for only Pounds
10.
These features would all have been better placed three years ago, but I had
not realised that I wanted them. It is the same story with one edge of the
lawn which runs into rough grass under trees and now badly needs a garden in
keeping with the rest of the design.
Nothing will happen in 1992 to change my non-green approach to clearing a
wilderness. There is no substitute for sensible use of a weedkiller which
does not affect the structure of the soil: I use Round-up, because it is the
strongest form of killer with glyphosate on the market. On a site which has
been rounded up, I can then think of gardening, beginning with hellebores in
February, flowering Ribes in spring and then forms of shade-tolerant rose
alba in high summer and cyclamen for autumn.
There will also be more room for my latest little-known weapon. In the 17th
century, the double-flowered forms of our native Soapwort were popular in
gardens, but you have to hunt for them hard in your Plantfinder nowadays
under Saponaria. In 1989 I acquired a tiny scrap of the old double white
form. By 1990, it had run all over the place, killing a nearby daphne and
asking to be moved out of a special flower bed as soon as possible. It
belongs in a wild setting where it will spread happily, and continue to
produce double white flowers about a foot high from July until the frosts.
On cool days and in the evening its scent spreads wonderfully, sweet and
rich in an unexpected way. It is much too strong for a small flower bed but
it will be my nap for 1992, weed-proof in a border at that awkward point
where mown grass runs into the undergrowth of trees.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Motoring: Lorry speed limit debate rumbles into centre lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TWO years, lower speed limits for heavy lorries and coaches could begin
to make UK motorways more pleasant and safe for car drivers.
The European Council of Transport Ministers has decided that from January
1994 new lorries weighing more than 12 tonnes and coaches must have devices
fitted which will restrict their speeds: lorries to 56 mph (90 kms) and
coaches to 62 mph (100 kms). Eventually all lorries and coaches will have
these limiters, though not until 1998.
It is a modest change. At present, even the largest articulated lorries are
allowed to use motorways at 60 mph (96 kmh) and coaches at 70 mph (112 kmh).
We all know what some of them, not yet fitted with speed limiters, really
travel at, given half a chance. Talk of 70 mph juggernauts and 85 mph
express coaches has long been fact, not just motorway lore.
Protests from the hauliers and coach operators have been anguished and
predictable. Some lorry men say the lower speed limits will increase journey
times, raise costs and put them out of business. Coach operators say they
will not be competitive with long-distance trains any more.
To which millions of car drivers may well reply: tough]
I could never understand why a 10 tonne coach carrying 50 unbelted
passengers was legal at 70mph (113 kmh) in pouring rain while the driver of
a Jaguar who touched 101 mph (162 kmh) for a mile or so in the dry was a
speed-crazed road hog deserving disqualification. Or why big articulated
lorries, notoriously unstable under hard braking, especially when unladen,
were ever thought safe at 60 mph on busy motorways at all.
Will the new limits be an unmixed blessing for car drivers? My first
reaction was that they must be, but the Freight Transport Association thinks
not. They could, it says, make motorways even more dangerous by widening the
differential between car and heavy vehicle speeds. (I think Germans would
find this argument hard to follow).
If 62 mph-limited coaches are still allowed in the overtaking lane, they
will obstruct 70 mph cars. And if they are to be banned from it, as heavy
lorries are now, then the middle lane will become even busier. That, the FTA
argues, would make it a more alarming place for car drivers who prefer not
to use the third (overtaking) lane. 'They would,' it says, 'find themselves
sandwiched between lines of HGVs (heavy goods vehicles) and coaches.'
In effect, the speed of traffic in the centre lane would be reduced to that
of the slowest common denominator of 56 mph (90 kmh).
I have a feeling the debate has only just started . . .

(Freesia Hybrids)
Various garden varieties and hybrids of Freesia alba and F. armstrongii are
grown for winter and early spring flowering in greenhouses and
conservatories for their very sweetly scented flowers, which are valued for
cutting as well as for house decoration. Colours include white, pink, red,
mauve, lavender, cream and yellow, and some varieties have double flowers.
Seed should be sown anytime in spring in a temperature of 16`-18` C, thinly
in the pots in which they will flower. The plants are supported with small
canes and twine, or with brushy twigs. During the summer, the pots can be
stood outdoors in a sunny, sheltered place, but must come back under cover
in early autumn. After flowering, the corns that have formed during the year
can be repotted in summer and grown for another year, when they will flower
a little earlier.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Property: Values which characterise UK market - Households
which still live in dreamland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DREAM VALUES are not factors that can be found in the professional valuation
tables. The term has no base in a dictionary. Yet this jumbled mix of an
affliction and a blessing ideally characterises the UK housing market at the
beginning of 1992.
The affliction expresses itself as an unwillingness to make a move, quite
possibly a necessary move, because of the sheer power of a dream value.
Once a figure, or a range of values, has become stuck in the mind of a
homeowner it takes either an unusually persuasive sales agent or an
inescapable move to persuade an owner to think in any other price terms.
The blessing of dream values, at least as far as the property finance and
transfer industry is concerned, is clear enough. The vast majority of
homeowners are sitting quietly, confidently waiting for things 'to get back
to normal'.
There have been no mortgage riots; no mass repayment of old home loans; no
general withdraw of deposits from home lenders whose prospects of lending
into the 1990's at the same kind of security as in past decades may be
thinning out.
Dream values that are unchallenged encourage quiescence; and no matter how
bluntly you might say to your immediate neighbour that his or her home could
be worth a third less than at the dreamers' peak of the sales market in
1988, they will not believe you. Indeed, why should they absorb bad news
when it is unnecessary to break the dream?
The 'wealth effect', which helped to fuel consumer spending before the
housing market reverse, depends upon these dream values.
While residential housing values were rising towards Pounds 1,000bn
nationally, any semi-detached owner could afford to enjoy adding several
hundred pounds to his or her credit card bills with a good conscience.
With that personal housing-worth total down to nearer Pounds 600bn, and
either static or still declining, any owner who is not won over by dream
values might be expected to be suffering from the reverse of the 1980s
wealth effect.
In practice, apart from the obvious wealth reversals of repossessions and
forced sales, most owners have merely become significantly more selective in
their spending.
It is the silence of the majority that enables lenders to keep repeating,
without challenge, the belief that no long-term or irredeemable damage has
been done to the principle of owner-occupation.
In a pre-Christmas note on affordability of housing, the Halifax Building
Society's David Gilchrist and Gary Marsh give full weight to the main change
in the economic background to house prices and the effect on interest rates
and inflation of sterling's membership of the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism.
No prospects of runaway inflation mean no equivalent prospects of soaring
property price rises. But these are points that have not yet sunk into the
dream price households.
Even the Halifax recognises that it is less a philosophical certainty and
more the lack of practical accommodation alternatives that enables it to say
that the society research team 'remains confident that the current recession
will end, and that when it does, owner-occupied housing will continue to be
the preference and aspiration of most of the UK population.'
Lenders' confidence looks secure so long as not too manyhomeowners have been
forced to awaken from those dream values before we get 'back to normal.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Property: Marble at all this - Apartment blocks on the Costa
del Sol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU fancy an apartment in the 17-acre Spanish beachside development of
Los Granados, adjoining Puerto Banus marina on the Costa del Sol, it would
be as well to like marble.
The interior and interior facades of the three apartment blocks - 322 units
altogether - are of white marble. Staircases, floors, terraces, even the
flower boxes are of marble. The lifts are lined with the stuff.
So far, one block has been completed. (Some 750,000 sq ft of marble has been
used on this block, with the administration office and beach club.) Marble
'bricks' pave the walkways. In all, when the other two apartment buildings
are finished, some 1,930,000 sq ft of marble will have gone into Los
Granados.
The apartment blocks form a semi-circle facing the sea; they are on four
floors. Rear windows look out at La Concha mountain. Each building has its
own swimming pool and penthouses, and the ground floor apartments have
private pools. There is a choice of units containing one to four bedrooms.
Those at ground level have their own gardens, raised 6 ft above the communal
garden for privacy.
The beach club has a restaurant, gymnasium and indoor heated swimming pool.
There are three tennis courts. The colourful life of Marbella is a few
minutes away, and the Costa del Sol offers 27 golf courses; a number
expected to rise to 40 by 1995.
Prices for Los Granados apartments range from about Pounds 250,000 to Pounds
1m, for a penthouse. Maintenance charges average Pounds 4,000 a year.
The estate is a joint venture between Immobiliaria Espacio (whose parent
company is under the direction of a former Spanish minister of finance), and
Kepro, a subsidiary of Kemper, a Chicago insurance company. (For the
Marbella site office tel: 814353 and in the UK tel: 081-743-5988).
Los Granados sales are said to be improving, but elsewhere it is hard to
detect significant signs of an upturn along the coast. Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley, one of the UK's larger estate agencies, has closed the office it
opened last year at Guadalmina on the Costa del Sol; this has been taken
over by Barbara Wood, who managed the office for KFR. It is now being run as
BD Wood Property Services, in association with Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
It seems that KFR did not envisage a recovery in the market coming quickly
enough - though 'it seems to have perked up in recent months.' KFR will
continue to give Wood the international back-up needed to benefit sales of
higher priced properties. Wood concedes that, at this level, things have
been 'extremely difficult' over the last 12 months. 'However, recently we
have achieved a number of sales between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 1.5m.'
Moving further along the Spanish coastline towards Gibraltar, Hamptons
International is offering the last dozen or so units in the holiday complex
at Alcazaba Beach, Estepona, where prices have been reduced by 40 per cent.
Two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments that came on the market at Pounds
145,000 are now Pounds 89,000. (Tel: 071-493-8222 in the UK.)

   EYE-CATCHING private villas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the kind passed on roads zigzagging up hillsides, or even beside the water
on the Cote d'Azur - may be briefly available to a wider public.
Owners of these lush properties in the south of France could be willing to
let them for holiday use - at a price. An agency specialising in this rental
market says that in high season such properties fetch from Pounds 2,000 to
Pounds 90,000 a month.
The agency, Riviera Retreats, at Mougins, is run by an English former naval
officer, Richard Wolf, and his wife. It represents Argosy Pollet, based in
Guernsey, a company which has been involved in letting on the Cote d'Azur
for 10 years.
A great variety of properties is on its books. In Cannes a villa sleeping 12
(and staff), a few minutes from the fashionable Croisette, rents for Pounds
26,000 in August.
A chateau at Montauroux, set in 12 acres, carries a top rental of Pounds
21,500 a month; an old mill at Grimaud lets for Pounds 10,000. At
Villefranche, near the water, a villa with painted ceilings, chandeliers,
marble floors, gardens, pool and private quay, commands a peak-month sum of
Pounds 90,000
Contrast this with a one-bedroom apartment in Cannes, with sea views, shared
gardens, pool and tennis court, at Pounds 3,500.
A London couple, who let their south of France property for July and August
each year, says the rent covers their costs. But the agency warns that sums
obtained in June and September are 30 per cent less - and owners must expect
much lower figures in the winter period - a property earning Pounds 7,000 a
month in summer may let for only Pounds 1,500 a month in winter. If a villa
is taken for six months in the low season, the rent is about a quarter of
the full summer price, or less.
The value of properties on Wolf's list ranges between Pounds 150,000 to many
millions of pounds; he says there is no clear relationship between value and
rental achieved. The state of equipment in a property, and its decoration,
count for much in letting.
All properties on the agency's list have swimming pools unless otherwise
stated.
Riviera Retreats (telephone number in France: 93 64 86 40) has 120 villas
and apartments on its letting list, nearly 100 managed on a year-round
basis.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Sport: The fools who killed off the Hill - Cricket / The sad
slide of Test cricket in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE used to be a grassy mound more or less opposite the pavilion at the
Sydney cricket ground. They called it The Hill, and for generations of
working class Sydneysiders it was a second home for the five days a year
when Australia met its touring opponents in the Sydney Test match.
By all accounts they were a rough lot on The Hill, but they knew about
cricket. The most famous habitue of The Hill was Stephen Gasgoigne, fondly
known as Yabba, whose stentorian voice carried clear across the ground from
his position under the old scoreboard.
Even Douglas Jardine, England's captain during the 1932 bodyline series, is
said to have smiled when Yabba spotted him swatting bluebottles and roared:
'Jardine, leave our flies alone.' So great was Yabba's fame that Sir Jack
Hobbs sought him out and shook his hand across the boundary fence after his
last Sydney innings.
The Hill was still there 12 months ago, when Graham Gooch and David Gower
nearly batted England to victory over Australia. But it was no longer a
storehouse of wit and colour; sadly, it was infested by drunken gangs of
English yobs whose grimy flags and football chants smacked of soccer fans at
their worst.
The English antics played some part in the end of The Hill, which had become
a source of concern to the New South Wales police and the cricket
authorities, because of the growing number of hooligans it was attracting.
The area was concreted over last winter, and now sports the same anonymous
rows of beige plastic chairs as the rest of the ground.
It remains an institution, if only because a nameplate identifies it as
Yabba's Hill in the same type allotted to the adjacent Doug Walters and
(Bill) O'Reilly stands. And there were plenty of would-be Yabba's there
during the classic Test match against Mohammad Azharuddin's Indians which
finished in a draw on Tuesday.
Fortunately, there was no repetition of last year's boorish English
behaviour, or of the near-riot at the Melbourne Cricket Ground recently,
when spectators in the upper stands threw whatever came to hand at those
seated below. But Yabba would surely have been shocked by the drunken chants
of 'boring' which punctuated even those periods when India were scoring
quickly, and by the ignorance of a large body of spectators - exemplified by
repeated demands for local hero Mike Whitney to bowl after he came on as
substitute.
For their ADollars 20 (Pounds 8.50) a day, the fans on The Hill saw
Australia race to 234-for-4 on the first day, only to slump to 313 all out
after a terrific exhibition of swing bowling from Kapil Dev, Manoj Prabhakar
and Subroto Banerjee, who was brought in to strengthen the bowling after
India's defeats in the first two Tests in Brisbane and Melbourne.
India made 483 all out, thanks to a wonderful 206 by Ravi Shastri, a solid
54 by Dilip Vengsarkar, and an imperious 148 not out by 18-year-old Sachin
Tendulkar who treated the crowd to every shot in the coaching manual except
the hook.
On the last day, Australia collapsed to 173-for-8 as Shastri took 4-for-48
from perfectly flighted left-arm spin on a turning wicket. At the last gasp,
Australia were saved by a captain's innings of 53 not out by Border. Even
so, India could fairly claim they would have won but for the loss of five
hours to rain, mostly on the third day.
How any cricket lover could find all this boring would be beyond
comprehension but for the surfeit of one-day international cricket which now
dominates the Australian summer. More than 50 one-day internationals will be
played in Australia and New Zealand between January and the end of March as
first the World Series Cup and then the World Cup dominate the sporting
headlines.
All guarantee a result, plenty of big hitting and an exciting run-chase in
the final hour, even if the price is several hours of medium-pace trundling
to defensive fields.
The World Series Cup, played in coloured track suits with a white ball under
floodlights, is a particularly inane spectacle to the purist, especially
since there appears to be no reason for its existence other than the
programming demands of Kerry Packer's Channel Nine TV network.
This year the participants are Australia, India and the West Indies. No
doubt one of them will win, but will anyone remember once the lights are
turned off?
The World Cup will be more interesting, if only for the reappearance of
South Africa in Australia after some 20 years. Curiously, they will be
captained by Kepler Wessels, who played more than 20 Tests for Australia
after migrating from South Africa. That will at least remind Australians
that England is not the only country willing to take advantage of South
African expatriates.
Meanwhile, the increasingly arcane world of Test cricket moves to Adelaide
on January 25, and then to Perth on February 1. The Indians showed in Sydney
that they are capable of outplaying Australia in every department, including
fielding, where they appeared to have absorbed the lessons handed out by
Australia in Brisbane and Melbourne.
Then, back in Sydney, the denizens of The Hill will be roaring as the yellow
track-suited Australians struggle to overcome the blue-suited English, and
so on in the World Cup.
It will be an opportunity for a number of great players, including Gooch, to
play a final innings on a great ground. But can anyone imagine Gooch walking
down to The Hill afterwards to shake hands across the fence?

FT  11 JAN 92 / Sport: Tough tests for creaking champions - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST of the year's major championships, the ADollars 6.2m (Pounds 2.6m)
Ford Australian Open, which begins at Flinders Park, Melbourne, on Monday -
if it ever stops raining - will boast the strongest fields in its 97-year
history. Only two men, Andre Agassi and Sergi Bruguera, and two women,
Martina Navratilova and Nathalie Tauziat, are missing from the world's top
20.
The defending champions, Boris Becker and Monica Seles, each have their
problems. Becker came early to Australia to gain match practice at last
week's Hopman Cup in Perth, the mixed team event. Unfortunately, Steffi Graf
went down with a mysterious illness that affected her balance and the
top-seeded Germans lost unexpectedly to Czechoslovakia. Nor could Becker
gain a last minute entry to this week's special event in Adelaide, the Rio
International Challenge, so he will not be match tight.
Seles has been in Australia a week but, in unseasonably wet and chilly
conditions, has had little serious practice. Not only has it rained every
day in Melbourne for the last ten days, to make it the wettest January since
records began in 1855, but the Yugoslav has also been suffering from a
ricked neck - the result, she believes, of sleeping awkwardly on the flight
to Australia.
The draw for this 79th men's championship, completed yesterday, has done
Becker no favours. Seeded 3, he is in the top half and has a rejuvenated
John McEnroe as a prospective third round opponent in a section which also
includes the unseeded Pat Cash, another dangerous floater.
The top seed, Stefan Edberg, competing again after a ten-week break for
injury, has a quiet section. He starts against a qualifier and has Peter
Korda (9) cast as his fourth round opponent. In the quarter-finals Edberg is
scheduled to meet Ivan Lendl (5), who beat him last year in a semi-final
where the Swede served a double-fault on the first of two match points he
held. The loss of that match was a psychological blow that set Edberg back
for about three months.
The only apparent danger to Lendl comes from the other seed in his section,
Derrick Rostagno (12). But Rostagno will have to be at his best to beat Brad
Gilbert in the second round.
Assuming he survives, Becker's quarter-final opponent is supposed to be
Karel Novacek (8) but the big Czech looked far from convincing in Perth
where he lost badly to Rostagno and Becker. It would not surprise me if
David Wheaton (15) emerged from that section. The tall American, a Wimbledon
semi-finalist last year and the winner of the Compaq Grand Slam Cup, is one
of the shrewdest men in the business. He knows exactly how to time his
efforts for big occasions.
The lower half is the place to be drawn this year, although Jim Courier (2)
will have one awkward hurdle in the third round. Three men will fight for
the chance to play him. Jakob Hlasek, who led Switzerland to an impressive
Hopman Cup victory, meets the improving Dutchman Paul Haarhuis in one of the
best opening round matches. The winner will face tough Austrian Thomas
Muster, who has performed well in Sydney this week.
According to the seeding, Courier's opponent in the fourth quarter-final
should be fellow American Pete Sampras (6) who beat him to win the IBM/ATP
Tour championships last November. But Sampras was nursing a shoulder injury
after two Rio matches in Adelaide and is by no means certain to beat Goran
Ivanisevic (10), provided the Croatian survives. He too has a suspect arm
which he injured while winning the Australian men's hardcourt title, also in
Adelaide, last week.
In the third quarter is the German powerhouse Michael Stich (4). Like
Becker, Stich is short of match play because he lost his first match in
Sydney this week. Nevertheless, he should be capable of surviving to face
Goran Prpic (16) in the fourth round. Then he is supposed to meet either the
French left-hander Guy Forget (7), who has had the most wretched luck to
draw his Davis Cup team-mate Henri Leconte in the opening round, or Michael
Chang (14).
However, I believe all of them may fall to the powerful serving of
'Krackerjack', otherwise Richard Krajicek, who is the best young prospect in
the game. This tall 20-year-old Dutchman, born of Czech parents, denied
Lendl match practice by beating him in the first round in Sydney and may be
ready to fulfil his enormous potential which, barring accidents, will one
day take him to the topmost heights of the game.
Spare a thought this afternoon for Jeremy Bates. The British No 1 has come
through two rounds of qualifying and must beat South Africa's Byron Talbot
to earn a place in the main draw. That should not be beyond him.
The seeded women usually perform reliably in the majors. Last year in
Australia the only unseeded quarter-finalist was the German Anke Huber, who
fell to Seles. After a marvellous year which saw her climb from 34 to 14 in
the rankings this gritty baseliner, now 17, finds herself seeded 16 with the
prospect of another quarter-final clash against Seles. First, though, she
must beat last year's beaten finalist, Jana Novotna (6).
In the second quarter, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (4), is scheduled to meet
Conchita Martinez (8) who she beat in a first career meeting in Sydney this
week, but both may be upset by Manuela Maleeva Fragniere (9) who beat
Sanchez decisively in the Hopman Cup.
In the lower half Graf (2) has been dealt a less attractive hand. Fate has
put her Hopman Cup conqueror Helena Sukova (15) in her section with Mary Joe
Fernandez (7) or Judith Weisner (14) next in the firing line - none of them
easy opponents for a player who is clearly out of sorts physically and not
yet restored to the full confidence of that Golden Grand Slam year of 1988.
Also in this half is Gabriela Sabatini (3) who must first dispose of
Katerina Maleeva (10), and then either Jennifer Capriati (5) or Zina
Garrison (11). I would not be surprised to see Capriati emerge here as the
only real threat to Seles. Her win over Navratilova at Wimbledon and her
near-miss against Seles in the US Open were, for me, the two best women's
matches of 1991. Make no mistake, Capriati is ready to explode.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: Why customers end up paying more - Does London offer
a fair deal on accommodation? Nicholas Lander and Michael Skapinker study
the controversy over room rates and VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lanesborough, London's newest hotel, opened for business just before the
New Year, promising guests personal fax numbers and up to seven butlers on
each of the four floors to do everything from shopping to answering the
phone, writes Michael Skapinker.
The hotel, on the site of the old St George's hospital on Hyde Park Corner,
says it will charge Pounds 190 a night for a single room and Pounds 220 for
a double. In fact, guests (who can ask to be given the same fax number every
time they stay at the Lanesborough) will end up paying 17 1/2 per cent more
than that.
The Lanesborough, owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and run by the
Rosewood Corporation of the US, does not include VAT in its quoted rates,
something which irritates hotels like those in the Savoy Group. The group,
which includes the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught, includes VAT and
service when telling guests how much they will be paying.
Peter Bates, the Savoy's sales and marketing director, admits there is
nothing illegal about companies excluding VAT from their quoted rates, but
he thinks customers have a right to know what the final bill will be. He
does not want to see London hotels going the way of those in US cities. He
recently stayed in a New York hotel which says it charges Dollars 200
(Pounds 109.80) a room. An innocent traveller, he says, would be upset to
discover that after the addition of Dollars 26.50 sales tax, Dollars 12 room
tax and Dollars 4 city room occupancy tax, the real cost per night, before
room service and phone calls, was Dollars 242.50.
The number of luxury hotels in London excluding VAT from quoted rates has
increased in the past year, Bates believes. The reason hotels exclude VAT,
he says, is so that they can persuade straitened companies that business
travel is cheaper than they think.
'People are trying to make their rates look more reasonable than they are,'
he says, adding that part of the reason for doing so is the recession and
the drop in the number of business travellers. In addition, the opening of
new London hotels such as the Lanesborough and the Langham Hilton has
boosted competition.
The Lanesborough denied it had anything so devious in mind. It claimed not
to be aware that other hotels quoted rates which included VAT. It said it
had 'no specific reason' for leaving VAT out.
Other luxury hotels in London have given the matter more thought and deny
there is an element of sharp practice in excluding VAT. Indeed, some argue
that it is the hotels which exclude VAT from the quoted rates which are
treating their guests more honestly. Customers have a right to know exactly
how much their rooms cost before the British taxman adds his 17 1/2 per
cent.
Ladbroke, which owns Hilton International, says that in the US it is common
to quote rates exclusive of local taxes. For that reason, when marketing the
Langham Hilton and the Hilton on Park Lane in the US, rates quoted are
VAT-exclusive. In the UK, customers are used to inclusive prices and
Ladbroke says that it includes VAT when quoting rates to British guests.
The Inn on the Park excludes VAT both for foreign and domestic customers. It
says this helps its predominantly foreign clientele in reclaiming the VAT
element in their bills. If customers want to know what the bill will be
after VAT, they can always work it out for themselves, the hotel says.
Paul Dicken, head of policy at the British Tourist Authority, sides with the
Savoy. 'The BTA would prefer it to be very clear to the consumer exactly
what he or she will end up paying,' he says.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: How to save on hotel bills - Does London offer a
fair deal on accommodation? Nicholas Lander and Michael Skapinker study the
controversy over room rates and VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN my colleague Nicholas Woodsworth was recently in Tblisi, Georgia, he
needed an hotel room, writes Nicholas Lander. Bereft of tourists, Tbilisi is
a buyers' market. In the morning he was quoted the official government price
of Dollars 120 (Pounds 66); by early afternoon it was down to Dollars 80; by
evening, Dollars 32.
If the Georgians have so quickly discovered the workings of the free market,
has the same lesson been learnt by their London counterparts? There is no
doubt that today, as a result of recession, over-building and delusions of
grandeur on the part of a number of London's hoteliers, it, too, is a
buyers' market.
To discover how hungry the hotels might be for business, I phoned 15 central
London hotels on behalf of a fictitious American couple who wanted a double
room for two weekday nights, January 23 and 24. I could have made a
reservation in any of them.
What surprised me was not the range of prices on offer but the difficulty in
obtaining terms and conditions. Of the 15 I phoned, only three were prepared
to tell me immediately what their price included. At the Savoy and Durrants
the price included the room and valued added tax; at the Sheraton Park Tower
it was the room but not the VAT.
At all the others it took some probing to discover whether the price offered
included elements which could add another 25-30 per cent to the cost of the
room.
Only the Beaufort and the Swiss Cottage Hotels included VAT, service and
breakfast; the Connaught, idiosyncratically and illegally, adds a 15 per
cent service charge to an amount that already includes a VAT element. And
only one hotel, the Hilton, on Park Lane, offered a deal. There, until the
end of January, a special room rate of Pounds 99 a night is on offer,
exclusive of breakfast, service and VAT.
In an industry which has just survived a difficult year and is entering the
traditionally quiet first quarter, this pricing disparity seems not only
off-putting but unfriendly.
The dividing line, and one that can add 17.5 per cent to the price quoted,
is how the hotels deal with VAT. According to the Sleeping Accommodation
(Price Display) Order of 1977, the range of prices an hotel charges has to
be displayed in the hotel lobby and must include the service charge.
However, although VAT has to be charged, hotels are allowed to quote either
inclusive or exclusive of this 17 1/2 per cent (although all published
prices, in brochures or advertisements, must include VAT).
But what would clients prefer? This issue splits London's hoteliers in two.
One faction, vociferously led by David Levin at the Capital and Peter Bates
at the Savoy, argues that hotels must behave like other retailers and
include VAT in all their tariffs. Nobody buys a watch or a car, they argue,
and then has to pay VAT as an extra.
Their point of view seems to be supported by the legislation governing food
and drink charges, all of which must include VAT. These hoteliers do not
want their guests to be presented with a bill made up of the room rate plus
a series of small but expensive extras such as local taxes or the national
sales tax.
However, this faction is now very much in a minority. Most of the
international hotel chains, led by the large North American corporations
such as Sheraton, Hyatt and the Four Seasons, have made a world-wide
practice of quoting room rates exclusive of local taxes. This policy
obviously makes life easier for the accountants in head office, if more
confusing for paying guests.
This faction's claims have been given considerable support by the work of
Derek Picot, general manager of London's Sheraton Park Tower. Three years
ago he realised that business travellers - they account for 80 per cent of
his clientele - are not the end users as far as the VAT on the hotel room is
concerned. The tax had to be levied and paid but could, quite legitimately,
be reclaimed and repaid to the guest's company.
Picot appreciated the extra marketing edge this knowledge would provide in
wooing new customers and quietly, before his competitors realised, offered a
service reclaiming the VAT incurred on the hotel room.
He also realised that there was no cut-off date for VAT already paid on
hotel rooms and, on behalf of his clients, began to reclaim the VAT they had
already paid. For one major client he reclaimed more than Pounds 45,000.
Picot's discovery is no longer a secret. For any company finance director
keen to reclaim local sales tax, or anyone travelling in Europe on business,
a most comprehensive survey of what is, and is not, recoverable has been
compiled by Ernst and Young, the management consultants. It has published
two small booklets entitled Refunds of VAT to EC Businesses, and Refunds of
EC Vat to Overseas Businesses. They may not be ideal bedside reading but
should be sufficient to persuade London's hoteliers to be consistent in
their attitude to pricing.
The booklets are available from Ernst and Young, Rolls House, 7 Rolls
Building, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1NH. Tel: 071-928-2000.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Why early adopters are going digital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE our toddler destroyed the record turntable three years ago, I
have been agonising over the best replacement. So this week's news that W H
Smith is to stop selling vinyl records came as a relief. I can scratch
turntables from my list and concentrate on the alternatives.
The delay in making up my mind is understandable. The electronics industry
long ago identified a small but influential socio-economic group that will
always buy the newest home-entertainment gadget.
They call them 'early-adopters' and these people (usually men) will pay a
considerable premium for the pleasure of being the first to own
state-of-the-art technology.
I am an eager early-adopter, but in spirit only. Considerable meanness leads
me to read about the gadgets in specialist magazines (gratis standing up in
W H Smith) and then pester early-adopting friends and neighbours to view
their patio-sized Nicam digital televisions and listen to hi-fi systems that
look like the control room from Thunderbirds.
Late-adopters might indeed covet such technology, but what really interests
us is to identify the right time to buy a new gadget.
We want to tender our Visa cards in the smug knowledge that we are
maximising our buying power (electronic hardware always gets cheaper as the
technology ages) and minimising the chance of buying into a dying format.
Now that long-players and turntables are as fashionable as the Gorbachevs -
even compact discs (CD) have lost their new shine - the early-adopters are
looking at digital tape systems.
CDs might have many benefits. The sound, for example, is crisp and you can
skip ghastly tracks at the touch of a button. The discs might not be tough
enough to double as drinks coasters but unlike tapes and vinyl they are
reasonably resistant to physical abuse.
But an ordinary CD player cannot record, which is a great let-down to the
majority of us who like to copy our friends' music collections. Digital tape
systems, however, can both record and reproduce CD-quality sound.
A format called digital audio tape (DAT) appeared in the 1980s, but it never
took off. Now Philips and Matsushita are offering digital compact cassette
(DCC), which is a digital version of the current music tape cassettes.
DCC players (in the UK by the autumn at about Pounds 300) will also play
old-style cassettes but will not record on them.
The future success of DCC is almost entirely dependent on the music business
producing popular recordings on the format. Controlling the availability of
software (the music) for a new hardware (the player) used to be up to that
other fashionable 1980s phenomenon: market forces.
But things have changed quite considerably since hardware makers started
taking control of the software industry.
Philips, for example, owns Polygram and Sony bought CBS Records, now Sony
Music. Both companies are using their software to promote new hardware.
One such development is a technology that not only gives digital sound but
digital pictures, too. This is CD-I, a system that plugs into the television
and the hi-fi.
The pictures will also respond to our instructions, or be what the industry
calls interactive (hence the 'I').
Stick in a disc and you can flip through an encyclopaedia where the dinosaur
actually walks across the screen. Children can colour-in Disney-type
pictures on screen and adults can learn how to play golf.
Welcome, ladies, gentlemen, and especially children, to the wonderful world
of 'edutainment' - marketing and toddler-talk for the combination of
education and entertainment.
CD-I is yet to be formally launched in Britain (available from the autumn),
but early-adopters can buy from some golf shops a Philips player and three
discs (interactive golf, music and colour-in nursery rhymes) in a Pounds 695
set actually called the 'early-adopters' package'.
It is not clear whether there will be sufficient pre-recorded discs exciting
enough to persuade people to spend around Pounds 700 on a player. But the
mere existence of CD-I certainly increases the procrastinatory agony for
late-adopters.
The demise of vinyl might reduce the fog, but the exact technological future
of home entertainment remains rather blurred. However, it does seem probable
that CD-based technology will be around for some time and manufacturers will
only make zippier versions of CD players.
You might not be able to record on to CD, but for me the medium wins over
digital tape because it is marginally more toddler-proof. Late-adopters are
by nature family-oriented long-term thinkers. As a result, I am already
worried about my grandchildren mucking about with my home edutainment.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Wine: Has Champagne's bubble burst? - Edmund Penning-Rowsell
asks if best bubbly is unreasonably expensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YES, CHAMPAGNE is expensive: a luxury product for a special occasion, it
always has been. But is it, as widely thought, excessively dear in the UK?
Several factors have contributed to this belief. Firstly, the rise in the
price of champagne grapes. Secondly, the sharp decline in trade in the
second half of 1990 following the Gulf War. (The restaurant trade, normally
accounting for 60 per cent of UK sales, was badly hit.) Thirdly, after price
rises at the beginning of last year media speculation suggested that
non-vintage brands of the Grandes Marques might rise to Pounds 20 a bottle.
This increased the apprehensions of those accustomed to buying Pounds 11 or
Pounds 12 champagnes from supermarkets. These are made from lower quality
grapes and partly at least from second and third pressings.
Obviously, no industry can ignore price increases in the cost of its raw
materials: more than 13 per cent in 1989 and a further 20 per cent in 1990.
However, as champagne is a blended wine, with, desirably, an age of three
years in bottle before being marketed, the cost of the 1.3 kilos needed per
bottle can be evened out. Also, the big producers of Buyers' Own Brand
champagne that can legally be sold after one year in bottle will save
interest charges on stock of at least 10 per cent a year.
The UK wine trade has to take account of increases in duty and VAT in the
last Budget, so that together they now total Pounds 1.75 a bottle. Yet,
apart from such leading houses as Bollinger and Roederer, whose non-vintage
cuvees were already touching Pounds 20 a bottle by autumn 1990, the majority
of Grandes Marques are still well below this figure: Moet &amp; Chandon NV Brut
Imperial, representing 20 per cent of UK sales, sells for Pounds 17.95:
about 25 per cent higher than in 1989, taking duty rises and VAT increases
into consideration.
Looking on the positive side, the age and therefore the quality of champagne
should now be higher, for stocks have risen. Moreover, the Champenois
realise that increasing world competition from sparkling wines means that
they can only keep ahead by improving quality, and for the last two years a
campaign has been running to improve pressing and fermentation methods.
Nevertheless, with 1991 sales estimated at 200m bottles against an
unexpected large vintage of 276m, both growers and merchants have a problem
that could increase, rather than diminish, in recession. Last year the
officially recommended FFr2 reduction in price to FFr30 a kilo was willingly
paid by the merchants, who after the failure in 1990 to renew the official
contract system of distribution, had to keep faith with the growers with
whom they had made personal three-year contracts to buy their grapes.
Although the co-operatives, particularly those who had been energetically
promoting their own brands, including Jacquart and Nicolas Feuillate, have
suffered severely from the slowdown in sales, the growers have not yet felt
the need to sell more of their grapes to the merchants. The 47 per cent of
the 1991 harvest that the growers' sold was identical with the proportion
sold in 1989 - the last year of the contract system.
Yet, neither the merchants nor the co-operatives can go on buying growers'
grapes on the same scale. Those who make or market champagne under their own
labels are likely to face greater difficulties in continuing to sell almost
half the champagne bought in France. Stocks at the end of the 1990/1991
campaign last year amounted to 795m bottles  - four years' sales stock -
compared with 2.9 years' sales stock in 1989/1990. It is now almost
certainly above four years.
Are grape prices likely to go down for this year's vintage? Those merchants
whom I asked this question had varying replies. Some, on the basis of this
being the last year of the three-year personal contracts, said no. Others
thought that the recommended price might fall by 10 per cent to FFr27 a kilo
for the top village wines and to FFr24 for those on the basic 80 per cent
level. One or two envisaged a franc less. Generally, it was agreed that much
would depend on the size of this year's crop and the state of the world
economy.
A small crop is already being prayed for. Continued recession could bring
grape prices down to FFr20.
Will there be a new contract between growers and merchants that is more
flexible - perhaps omitting the basing of price on the average ex-cellars
cost of bottles in the previous year? The merchants are against a new
officially sponsored contract for the present arrangements suit them very
well: particularly the big groups which can count on adequate credit. They
can argue that Brussels would be against any officially fixed price, as a
restraint of trade.
However the growers form a powerful lobby, some are already nervous about
the future and, if trade continues poor, they might well demand some
guarantee for the disposal of their grapes. No one wants to return to the
inter-war years when growers had to accept miserably low prices for their
fragile produce.
Occasional consumers of champagne may be assured of no price increase of any
note this year. Indeed, there may be some decreases if the vintage is large
and the market still severely depressed. At the lower end some substantial
deals at ex-cellars prices, around FFr50 a bottle, took place before the end
of last year. And, as they have inflation in France too, unchanged prices
mean a real reduction. Although imports here are down by 40 per cent the
fall in consumption is less than half that amount.

FT  11 JAN 92 / This is the season of morosite: As They Say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week it was the Angst-ridden German press, this week the morose French.
Morosite is the favourite word in French newspapers these days. Le Figaro
wrote about it last Monday: 'The President (Mitterrand) beats all
unpopularity records . . . 62 per cent have no confidence in him. Without
doubt the economic crisis, whose causes are not solely French, can in part
explain the general morosite. But it does not excuse the government's
impotence with regard to growing unemployment.'
The same day Liberation looked forward to elections in 1993 and the settling
of accounts with 'the long republican reign: the artifices, the compromises,
the postures - they are all worn out. There remains only brutal urgency.'
As I read these words a handout from the French National Statistical
Institute landed on my desk. It noted that growth had been at 1.5 per cent
last year, exports were up and inflation was 3 per cent. If that was the
situation in Britain, John Major would be certain to win the coming
election.
In Les Echos of Paris, Patrick de Jacquelot examined the roots of British
morosite and thought things could get worse: 'The prospect of a Labour
victory could encourage the markets to get out of sterling in coming months.
It is therefore very possible that the pound will enter a vicious circle: a
sharp fall in the currency will force the government to raise interest
rates.' That would 'cast a further shadow over the government's record which
will increase the chances of a Labour victory and would weaken sterling
still further.'
So, one infers, Labour should promise something profligate to force the
government to raise interest rates.
If you wanted to be really morose, you could have celebrated Christmas last
week in Russia. The papers made the armed forces their Yuletide theme. The
army daily, Krasnaya Zvezda, warned: 'Men with epaulettes are not pawns in
political games . . . The armed forces are the last institution remaining
from our former state which is capable of stabilising society.' But it
concluded that now was not the time to send in the tanks. The paper, like
all Moscow dailies wished its readers a Merry Christmas. The last time that
happened must have been January 1917.
There are islands of good cheer, however. Corriere della Sera of Milan found
one. 'Lombards - the rich men of Europe,' ran a headline. According to an EC
study Lombardy is the richest region in the Community. The Corriere is
really the Lombard Daily News. It said this success had been gained not so
much by rich dynasties (a swipe at the Agnelli-Fiat fiefdom of Piedmont) but
by an 'army of workers. The miracle has been created by the silk workers of
Como, the hosiers of Castelgoffredo . . . all led by the financiers, the
bankers and mega-managers in their Lombard headquarters.'
Another cheerful individual is Johann Georg Reissmuller of the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung. He has made his mark as a sort of unofficial Croatian
government spokesman, in addition to his duties as chief fulminator in
Germany's leading daily. On Monday he wrote: 'Up to now the Serbian
government thought it pointless to keep to any ceasefire. But now the
Belgrade leadership sees that Europe's timidity over Serbia is diminishing.
They think that the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia might be followed by
further steps. So it might be advisable to stick to a ceasefire. Had the
EC-states offered recognition earlier, the Croatian people would probably
have been spared many horrors.'
There is a hostage to fortune, but I hope he is right.
One hundred years ago next Tuesday, Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and
eldest son of the Prince of Wales, died. It was a few days after his 28th
birthday and six weeks before his marriage to Princess Mary of Teck who
comforted herself with his younger brother George and later became Queen of
England. The Illustrated London News at the time argued that deaths of
privileged people could be in the public interest. 'It is well that the
sense of mortality . . . should occasionally temper the less wholesome moral
influences arising from vast differences in worldly station, from birth and
rank, from wealth and luxury, or from the fame of distinguished
achievements. Humanity is more easily reconciled to these apparent
inequalities of position, and is delivered . . . from the evil spirits of
envy and scorn by witnessing impressive instances of the sudden end of a
highly favoured life.'
That brings us back to morosite: perhaps there could be an improvement in
the public mood if more celebrities took the plunge . . . as it were.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Cookery: Puddings for Sunday lunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NOVEMBER and December are the months of the dinner party, January and
February are favourites for Sunday lunch invitations. This is the season for
a more relaxed and informal style of entertaining. An easy mix of age groups
comes into play - great aunts and god-children are welcome - and the seating
plan need not strive to partner every man with a mate, as though going into
the Ark two by two.
With no frantic appointments to keep, Sunday lunch is a deadline-free zone.
Lazing by the fire, wallowing in the newspapers, these are the sort of
unhurried pursuits to put on the agenda.
There is no call for the cook to indulge in any first course fuss.
Time-honoured tradition demands that we stick to a simple menu of roast
meat, cheese, and - what bliss - a proper pudding.
Diehard pudding fanciers will argue that only puddings in the heavyweight
class are good enough for Sunday lunch. Spotted Dick, Treacle Sponge or
Sussex Pond Pudding are the answers for them.
Others may feel the temperature is a mite too mild, and the timing a bit too
soon after the Christmas pud, to do proper justice to such solid offerings.
For them I suggest a steamed chocolate pudding confected with eggs and
almonds but no flour, designed to satisfy greed without lying heavy on the
stomach.
Those who relish the clean sharp taste of fresh fruit will opt for a pie
made with the first - and pinkest and best - rhubarb of the year.
STEAMED CHOCOLATE PUDDING (serves 4-6)
 1/4 lb best bitter chocolate;  1/4 lb butter;  1/4 lb caster sugar,
preferably vanilla sugar; 1 oz best cocoa powder, sifted and mixed with 3 oz
freshly ground almonds; 6 large eggs.
Cream the butter in a warmed mixing bowl. Add the sugar and beat again until
fluffy and light. Add the cocoa mixture and the egg yolks, in alternate
spoonfuls, and continue beating until smooth and creamy. Whisk the egg
whites. Slacken the chocolate mixture with one-third of them, then fold in
the rest.
Turn the mixture into a buttered 3 pt pudding basin, cover with buttered
greaseproof paper and foil. Tie down and steam for 70 minutes, by the end of
which time the pudding should be puffed up and set with a just-molten streak
in the centre. Unmould onto a hot plate and serve straight away with
brandy-flavoured cream.
FORCED RHUBARB PIE (serves 6)
scant 1 3/4 lb forced rhubarb (trimmed weight);  1/4 lb caster sugar; the
finely grated zest of a large orange; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 1
tablespoon cornflour; phyllo pastry; melted butter; a sifting of icing
sugar.
Mix the sugar with the orange zest, cinnamon and cornflour. Cut the rhubarb
stalks obliquely into 1 1/2 inch lengths.
Put the fruit into a shallow baking dish of 9 1/2 -10 inches in diameter
(earthenware, porcelain or ovenproof glass is suitable) sprinkling the
sugary mixture between layers.
Cover with eight layers of phyllo pastry, cutting the sheets to size,
brushing each layer with melted butter and tucking in the ends neatly before
adding the next.
Score the top sharply with a diamond pattern. Add a shake of cold water to
stop the pastry curling and cook on a baking sheet at 400`F (200`C) gas mark
6 for 35 minutes until the quilted pastry lid is crisp and brown.
Let the pie cool for 5-10 minutes before dredging it with a snowy drift of
icing sugar. Then serve with creme fraiche or custard.

FT  11 JAN 92 / How to Spend It: The whole world's up for sale] - Recession
is biting, customers are counting their pennies, and retailers in every
capital are slashing prices. Wherever one looks . . .

The old streetwise New Yorker's motto - never, ever pay full retail price -
has gone global. From Tokyo to Frankfurt, from Paris to London and New York,
you can buy almost anything you fancy as well as lots of things you never
knew you needed at knockdown prices. FT journalists give the low-down on
what is cheapest, and where . . .
LONDON
I DO NOT need to tell Londoners that the sales are on. If it is January, it
must be sale-time. And it is. A time-honoured ritual that no store, least of
all after this most disastrous of all shopping seasons, can afford to
ignore. But this time the sales seem different.
It is not that there are not bargains - there are, and good ones - but
rather that the population at large seems curiously and most untypically
unexcited by them. What this does mean is that ardent searcher for a
specific item - whether it be a designer jacket, a new sofa or a snazzy pair
of shoes - can venture forth in the happy knowledge that they will not have
to don combat gear and scowls. Two arms can be used to search through the
racks, time can be taken to weigh up the sizes and colours, assistants may
even offer to help. Add to that the huge reductions and sales shopping could
actually turn out to be enjoyable.
The biggest reductions of all are at the more expensive end of the spectrum.
Ever fancied a really grand designer number but not felt able to justify the
price? Well, how about a Valentino wool suit reduced from Pounds 1,400 to
Pounds 600? Or an evening dress in silk with a matching jacket (also from
Valentino) for Pounds 1,300 reduced from Pounds 3,250? If that is more than
you can manage then you could get a blouse for around Pounds 150.
At Chanel there is a 30 per cent reduction across the board on all their
clothes which means that you can buy a classic Chanel suit for just under
Pounds 1,000. All those prices may seem a lot of money, but if you had been
eyeing the Chanel suit all season and found Pounds 1,800 beyond your reach,
Pounds 1,000 might just make it affordable.
This is perhaps the time to apply the old fashion editors' maxim - the real
cost of a garment is the price divided by the numbers of time it is worn,
not the price alone. On that basis the most expensive jacket I have ever
bought is also much, much the cheapest - and even that fails to take into
account that on every occasion it also looked much better than its cheaper
versions.
For several seasons now the jacket has been the mainstay of many a
fashionable wardrobe. It teams with leggings, with ski pants, with short
skirts, slips over dresses.
In Paris this week the sassiest of dressers all had similar silhouettes  -
short skirts or tapered legs (leggings or skipants) topped by parkas or
jackets (either curvy or straight and long leaving just about an inch of
skirt showing). These sales offer a first-class chance to buy a marvellous
jacket at a third and possibly 50 per cent less than it cost before
Christmas. At Browns (23-27 and 38-39 South Molton Street W1 and 6c Sloane
Street SW1) you could put the whole look together at sales prices - start
with Gigli leggings (reduced by 30 per cent to Pounds 100) and add G Gigli
(the diffusion line) parkas reduced from Pounds 395 to Pounds 295. When it
comes to jackets Jil Sander, Donna Karan and Moschino are all on sale at 30
per cent to 40 per cent less.
Other good places to get a classy designer look together are Harvey Nichols,
Joseph (who has cuts of 40 per cent),
PARIS
LA FRANCE MOROSE said the headline in Le Figaro last week. 'Remises
Exceptionelles' said the posters: or 'Liquidations de nos collections',
while at poor Louis Beaucaire, a menswear shop in the rue St. Honore, it was
'Destockage definitif avant depart - Moins 50% - 60% - et ADIEU.' If La
France is morose, it would appear to have good reason.
Some of the most esteemed names in the world of luxury goods (companies of
the stature of Morabito, Puiforcat, Chaumet, Karl Lagerfeld and others)
think things are so bad that they clubbed together to take a full page
advertisement in Le Figaro to make a rallying call to patriotic Frenchmen
and women: 'Ne laissons pas la morosite tuer le desir et l'absence de desir
tuer l'economie'.
The by-product of all this is that this season's sales seem different in
mood. Almost everybody seems to sense - or fear - that what we are
witnessing is not just a clearing of the way for another bright new season
of happy shopping, but one of those profound shifts in public attitudes that
are hard to anticipate and even harder to handle.
Paris, like most of the big cities of the world, is over-supplied with shops
and under-supplied with shoppers. The Western world spent much of the 1980s
shopping until its houses were crammed, its wardrobes full and its
cheque-books depleted. Now it seems to have taken stock and looks back on it
all as a kind of collective madness.
As my neighbour at lunch in the Bar des Theatre on the Avenue Montaigne in
the heart of chic Paris put it as she patted her modest haul - two towels at
FFr65 (Pounds 6.60) a piece - from the Christian Dior sale: 'It was like an
illness, like bulimia; it had to stop and it has. All at once people have
come to their senses.' The problem is that the coming to their senses leaves
the economic world in turmoil. If we do not shop, others do not eat.
But certainly what is true is that anybody who still has a taste for le
shopping or a few real needs or desires will find that Paris for the next
couple of weeks is something of a shoppers' paradise.
The only real problem is where to start. Whether you are a man or woman you
will find that bargains are everywhere and those who normally prefer the
Right Bank might as well start there and the Rive Gauche crowd head for the
Left Bank. Discounts and sales are everywhere.
Those who long for designer clothes but normally cannot afford them can take
their choice from almost any designer they fancy. At Nina Ricci you could
snuggle into a shimmering brocade jacket reduced from FFr7,500 to FFr3,750
or buy a striped satin fuchsia evening dress for FFr11,550, reduced from
FFr19,250. As I dropped in there seemed no takers, even with these
reductions.
At Chloe and Montana, at Balmain and Lanvin, at all the grand names, the
sales are on and you could, pick up a wonderful designer outfit at half the
usual price. As always, the richer you are, the better value you can get. A
Chloe coat at about Pounds 500 (reduced from around Pounds 1,000) will be
something to treasure for years to come and a soft wool Boss suit reduced
from FFr5,500 to FFr3,690 would do no end of good to a young chap's
corporate image.
At Chanel's headquarters in the rue Cambon the shop is packed with Japanese
already laden with bags from Hermes, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Chanel's
famous two-tone pumps are down from Pounds 200 to Pounds 130, jewelled
evening pumps from Pounds 300 to Pounds 200 and those finely-pleated cream
silk blouses, drooled over at Pounds 800, do not seem a lot more affordable
at Pounds 400.
From the outside, Dior in the Avenue Montaigne looks its usual august self.
Once inside and you could almost be in Oxford Street on the Saturday before
Christmas. Heads down, elbows flying, you would think these people had never
seen a scarf or a silk blouse before. If you had the stamina and the time
you could come away with something - a towel or a glass, a jacket or a skirt
 -at a bargain price. It was here that I saw the one thing I really wanted
but did not feel justified in buying: a wonderful ruffled black silk organza
evening jacket reduced from about Pounds 800 to Pounds 400 that would have
looked stunning for years.
Trawling the individual couture houses and designer boutiques is an arduous
business. If you have limited time you would probably do better to head for
Galeries Lafayette, where everything in sight seemed to be En Soldes. On its
designer floor everybody from Georges Rech and Yves St. Laurent, from Commes
des Garcons, Yohji Yamamoto, Agnes B and Sonia Rykiel was marked down by at
least a third.
Alternatively, you could do what I did and regain a little sanity by going
to my favourite store, the No. 2 building of La Samaritaine, by the Pont
Neuf. Here, in a wonderful Art Nouveau interior, is a resolutely
old-fashioned department store where there are no sharp elbows and tough
expressions, just comfortable Parisian housewives from the unfashionable
arrondissements buying things they really need.
There are lovely things, such as the plain white linen union sheets from the
Vosges used by the grand hotels (FFr269 for singles, FFr369 double, reduced
by 20 per cent), plain white pure cotton fabric at FFr60 a metre, and
fast-disappearing things like ribbons and mending yarn. Who needs sales when
there is La Samaritaine?
NEW YORK
SALES IN New York are a bit like swimming pools in Hollywood: the depth
varies, but everyone has to have them.
However, whereas once they were seasonal, now they are more or less
permanent. A glut of shops and too few customers mean that there are
significant discounts all year round and the traditional 'holiday' offers
look like continuing all through January.
So where should shoppers start? Well, there are certain products that it is
always worth searching out in Manhattan.
Womens' shoes, for instance, are a perennial winner, combining imaginative -
often Continental - design with more affordable New York prices. Add on the
holiday discounts, and temptation is hard to resist. Time-pressed visitors
could start at the New York branch of Charles Jourdan. Here, plentiful sale
items are as tasteful as the marbled Trump Tower environs are brash. Leather
court shoes sell for Dollars 99 (Pounds 54.30) compared with an original
price of Dollars 225; black suede evening shoes have been slashed from
Dollars 285 to Dollars 169.
Men's shirts are another favourite. Brooks Brothers, now owned by Marks &amp;
Spencer, has average reductions of between 25 and 35 per cent, which means
standard lines are around Dollars 50. But walk a few doors north and you
will find the Paul Stuart store - the carpet is thicker, the service more
gracious, and the discounts posted more discreetly. Prices, however, are
broadly similar.
Among the department stores, Saks Fifth Avenue - not the most useful shop in
normal times - tends to come into its own during sales. Discounts in the
menswear department average around 25 per cent - cutting Dollars 20 off a
Dollars 76 Armani tie, say, or pricing cashmere socks at around Dollars 15.
Up on the womenswear designer floors, the reductions are less predictable
but often more generous. A well-cut pair of Anna Klein evening trousers, for
example, is almost halved to Dollars 120.
True discount-hunters, of course, should concentrate their energies on the
depressingly large number of stores which are in the process of closing.
Once wholesale stock clearance is under way, prices can really crash. Take
Saint Gill, a Madison Avenue boutique, for example: beaded evening jackets,
in glorious technicolour, now sell for under Dollars 300 having once been
priced at over Dollars 1,000.
On a non-fashion note, Manhattan is often a good source of household linens
 -from tableclothes to towels. Ethnically-minded shoppers might try their
luck at Handblock, which has stores on both the Upper East and Upper West
Sides and offers good discounts on upmarket Indian printed cottons.
Hi-fi enthusiasts should simply load up. Compact discs in the US usually
sell at the dollar equivalent of their sterling price, and big retail
outlets, such as Tower Records on Broadway, are currently offering 'special
deals' on selected items as well. Anything from Dollars 10.99 to Dollars
14.99 is standard.
Those not sure of what they want but hoping the perfect purchase will
present itself at the perfect price should target a specific shopping area.
A stroll up Madison Avenue from the mid-forties to the seventies, with
occasional forays into Fifth or Lexington Avenues, is the most obvious.
A similar path can be plotted on the Upper West Side, along Columbus Avenue.
A third option is to head for SoHo, the downtown area bordered by Houston
and Canal Street. Here, designer boutiques and more conventional clothing
chains are liberally interspersed between the declining number of art
galleries.
Finally, it is worth remembering that marked prices often exclude sales tax,
currently 8 1/4 per cent in New York. When you reach the cash register, this
belated realisation may take the edge off the shopper's satisfaction. But
chances are, you have a bargain anyway.
GERMANY
GERMANY rose late from the festive table last weekend, downed an Underberg
and an aspirin, and went shopping. Heads down, elbows out, the population
took to the streets in a full dress rehearsal for the struggle to come.
This is special offer time, a phoney war interlude, when shoppers and sales
assistants perfect their techniques - close-range combat and scowling, and
middle-distance gazing and scowling respectively - to be ready for the sales
proper, which start officially on January 27.
Shopping in Germany is a testing exercise at the best of times. But in the
special offer season protective boots are de rigueur and small children who
cannot be left somewhere safe, like the middle of the autobahn, should be
well padded.
An uncommonly mild weekend in a so-far gentle winter brought out the crowds
and the bargains. On Monday retailers claimed that shoppers had come back to
town after the holiday break - pockets stuffed with cash Christmas presents
 -still spending at pre-Christmas levels.
Bargain-hunters did well in winter clothing departments, where surplus
woollies are marked down by 30 to 50 per cent. Caught out by the climate,
the stores' buyers had started the new year overstocked by as much as 20 per
cent, according to some estimates. Left-over women's party wear, heavily
reinforced with spangles, metal thread and still-obligatory shoulder pads,
offered no competition.
Buyers in the pots and pans departments also appeared to have overdone
things. Six-piece sets of stainless steel cookware, on sale at alleged
discounts of up to Pounds 100, were among the most common offerings.
Since the 'formerly X, now Y' sale-time pricing formula is not common in
Germany, identification of real cuts is tricky, but well-made leather
jackets and wool-mix overcoats at about Pounds 100 apiece would be tempting
 -if the outside daytime temperature in large tracts of the country were not
around 14`C.
Unquestionable best value for money: anything to do with Mozart, and baggy
men's suits with 'living room' trousers.
Wolfgang Amadeus, dead now 201 years and out of the commemoration stakes for
the time being, has left a legacy of special edition and repackaged
recordings, books, and pot and plaster busts littering the shelves of many
shops. Even surplus Mozart Kugeln, the enduringly popular chocolate balls,
could be had for a few pence each from sweet departments clearing the
leftovers from the Christmas and New Year eating binge.
The roomy, relaxez-vous suit, never at its best on tightly-tuned German male
bodies, was formally declared dead just before Christmas by the national
textiles federation, which announced the return of the tailored look.
Whether it was making a fashion statement or cutting its cloth more
economically in the light of forecasts of an economic slowdown this year was
unclear, but for those willing to go against the trend, handsome outfits are
already available for as little as Pounds 100 to Pounds 150 a time.
At this stage shoppers are still being tempted mainly by chain stores
offering own-label clothing, old-hat multi-coloured bedlinen, unidentifiable
frying objects and bottom-of-the range branded kitchen appliances.
Come January 27, appetites should be nicely sharpened and muscles toned for
the great struggle when all the shops join in and the real goodies, big-name
brands and designer clothing beloved of Germans, come up for grabs.
TOKYO
'IT IS 15 minutes to opening, please don't push]' shouts a sales clerk at
the crowd in front of the store. The long queue reminds one of Muscovites
waiting to buy bread, but this is prosperous Tokyo, and it is the first
business day of the year for Isetan, a prestigious Japanese department
store.
New year sales are the shopping event of the year for Japanese. People tired
of over-eating festive foods, fathers cooped up with restless children, and
families having finished their visits to the local shrine all gather in the
new year ritual of bargain hunting.
A pair of old ladies, with matching curls, were bundled up against the cold
in their overcoats and scarfs at the head of the line. They had been waiting
two hours for the 10:0 am opening. 'It's worth it,' said one, obviously
expecting to save lots of money by spending even more.
The store is opened the traditional way - a young woman opens the doors and
gives the crowd a deep and polite bow. The customers bow back, but the
minute she steps aside to allow them in, politeness is left behind and
elbows fly in a mad rush towards the escalators and the bargains.
Most customers head first for the rows of fuku-bukuro, literally 'lucky
bags', which are an important part of new year sales in Japan. They are
stuffed with knick knacks and other goods which, in Isetan's case, are said
to be worth around eight times the cost, normally Y5,000 (Pounds 21.30) or
Y10,000. Shoppers are happy to buy without knowing the exact contents of the
bag, for everybody is supposed to be 'lucky' and find at least one cherished
item.
In the late 1980s when the stock market was booming the contents of lucky
bags boomed, too. Department stores competed to sell glamorous lucky bags
containing such items as French impressionist paintings and jewellery, and
selling for Y100m (Pounds 427,300) and more. These days most retailers stuff
their lucky bags with goods that have not sold well during the year.
Even so, there are many faithful customers. 'It's really a good deal,' says
Akiyo Kitagami, lining up for his fuku-bukuro at Isetan. 'Last year we got a
silk scarf, a sweater, and this watch, all for Y10,000,' he says flashing a
gold-coloured watch.
In contrast to the frenzy in the general sales departments, the boutiques in
a separate corner of the store were calm. They do not bother with lucky bags
at Yohji Yamamoto, the Japanese clothes designer, or at Chanel, or Versace.
Some designer brands have bargain sales later in the year, some none at all,
jealously guarding their high class image among image-conscious shoppers.
But other clothing stores take the opportunity to sell heavy duty winter
clothing ahead of the spring season, and during the first weeks of January
most stores carry 30 to 40 per cent discounts.
For the methodical Japanese shopper, who usually spends hours in a single
department store combing through every floor, the new year sales require a
change of tactics. Those who have enough energy left rush off to other
retailers, while others head for home. A woman and her son walking to the
train station carried 12 bags between them: they were not untypical.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Solving other people's problems -
A company that was built with a screwdriver and a pair of pliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the oil price crashed in 1986, Richard Gibson was home from the Far
East, kicking his heels on stand-by for his oil company. Keith Anderson, who
had been a fellow student of electronics at Newcastle Polytechnic, had
become a senior lecturer there.
The two got together and in 1987 set up their own company, Integrated Design
Techniques, (IDT), with, says Gibson, a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.
Anderson had heard of a couple of possible jobs, and the idea was that they
would work on their customers' premises.
The company's first task was to design a microprocessor-controlled safety
system for offshore oil. Then it got a job for Electrolux cookers.
The problem of demonstrating cookers in showrooms is that they need more
than the normal 13-amp supply. Electrolux cookers' halogen rings could
operate safely inside 13 amps but the oven, grill and ceramic hobs could
not. IDT produced an easily-reset box which cut the power supply if anything
but a halogen ring was turned on. It did this by looking at the wave-form of
the current being drawn.
IDT took a workshop in the Mountjoy centre in Durham and was joined last
year by Robin Jefferson, who had completed a doctorate at Newcastle
University. Meanwhile, Anderson keeps up his lecturing. 'I'm working about
20 hours a day,' he says.
IDT made a big step forward when it persuaded two leading electronic
manufacturers to authorise the use of their ready-assembled boards. These
save the detailed work of assembling individual components and protect the
system against interference.
The boards proved their value when IDT won a contract to design and install
a system for testing lawnmowers made by Flymo at Newton Aycliffe. A factory
is a harsh environment for computerised equipment. Flymo used to suffer
breaks in production when dust and electrical interference caused computers
to crash. The system IDT installed enabled Flymo to beat production records.
Each completed lawnmower goes into a Perspex box where test probes check it
for speed of rotation and electrical characteristics. Each production line
has a test box and test results are displayed instantly in the production
engineer's office. He can see at once if anything is going wrong.
The results of each machine are recorded. If a Flymo is returned by a
customer, the causes of its failure can be checked against the test results.
One Flymo manager said: 'IDT had the confidence to tackle the job and we
felt we would not be able to write the software ourselves. We have been most
impressed by what they did and the support we have had from them since.'
IDT has won a Department of Trade and Industry Smart award for work on
technology which identifies people, animals and goods. Texas Instruments
produces radio transponders in thin tubes about an inch long with an aerial
at one end and an integrated circuit at the other. If one passes a reader,
it gives a signal which can be identified. So a transponder incorporated in
a badge can show where the wearer is on, say, a factory site. The
transponders can also identify valuable goods such as beer kegs or
industrial overalls.
However, readers can be confused if confronted by several transponders at
the same time and IDT is seeking to overcome the problem of identifying
several transponders at once.
Richard Gibson, who once designed a conference control system for a Gulf
States summit meeting and worked as a diver on an Operation Raleigh
expedition, says IDT's turnover in the first year (1988) was Pounds 13,000
and it has at least trebled each year since. They have paid for their Pounds
20,000 investment without borrowing.
Working for themselves, he says, 'we have independent control of our own
destiny and we get to see the whole picture. The Mountjoy centre is
expensive but prestigious. We have a good deal of synergy with other
organisations here: we have worked with High Force Research.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Bloodsuckers discover a
profitable market niche - David Blackwell meets Roy Sawyer, an American with
a passion for leeches who has found a home and a sympathetic business
environment in south Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IF THERE'S anything in the world I hate it's leeches - the filthy little
devils,' cries Humphrey Bogart as he lugs the African Queen through the
swamps.
But Roy Sawyer's picture of the lowly bloodsucker is very different. Leeches
are his lifetime passion and he has created a thriving and unique small
business from both breeding them and putting them to use in modern medical
science.
In 1984 he started Biopharm in Swansea, south Wales, with Pounds 80,000,
including a Pounds 45,000 government guaranteed loan and a Pounds 10,000
loan from the City of Swansea.
While the company is reticent about profits, it has had an average annual
turnover of Pounds 200,000 in the two years to March 31 1991. Most of the
profit is put into research, which has soaked up Pounds 1.5m in seven years,
including grants and and licensing payments.
From a breeding stock of 30 leeches, Biopharm now has 50,000, stored in rows
of tanks in a specially built unit. They are fed only once every three
months on blood sausages made from pig's intestines - the present site of
the farm was chosen partly for its proximity to a slaughterhouse.
'I grew up with leeches and I never lost interest in them,' says Sawyer, who
was raised in South Carolina, in the US, where leeches are common.
He arrived at Swansea University because there was nowhere in the US where
he could study the creatures. His relatives tried to divert his interest and
his US professor talked disparagingly of 'that 19th century biology.'
Sawyer's studies led him to write the definitive three-volume work on the
leech, published by Oxford University Press in 1986. 'I can't imagine anyone
else being so stupid as to devote so much prime time to such a subject,' he
grins.
But it was work on the book which convinced him that the world's 650 species
of leech had a lot of pharmaceutical potential. The company was founded 'to
develop potential drugs which we perceive to be in the saliva of leeches and
other bloodsuckers.'
As he explains, the chemicals in leech saliva are pre-adapted to human
physiology. The problems are how to make them useful and how to get enough
to make a drug?
The sale of farmed leeches (Pounds 7 each) has surprisingly provided a sound
cashflow base for the company. When it started there was a small market in
the universities which was being satisfied by what Sawyer describes as very
erratic and diverse sources. By giving a steady service, Biopharm has become
the chief supplier.
'Our very existence created a market I never dreamt was there,' says Sawyer.
Leeches are also sold to hospitals where they are used to help tissue
reconnect after micro surgery to rejoin severed parts of the body. If a
leech is applied to a wound for 30 minutes the wound will bleed for up to 10
hours. Keeping the blood flowing prevents infection and gangrene from
setting in.
In the company's biochemical laboratories chemicals and enzymes are
extracted from leech saliva and niversities.
The third source of income targeted by the company is the pharmaceutical
market itself. There are possibly as many as 10 potential drugs from leech
saliva, mostly anti-coagulants. A variant of the enzyme hirudin has been
licensed to an Italian company for the manufacture of a drug which stops
thrombosis in potential heart attack victims. Haementin, another enzyme, has
been shown to be a potent dissolver of blood clots.
The company's patent bill is a source of worry to Sawyer. It has already
paid out Pounds 60,000 in patent fees and is expecting the figure to reach
Pounds 100,000 soon.
The cost of taking out patents was met by winning several Department of
Trade and Industry Smart (Small firms Merit Award for Research and
Technology) Awards worth a total of Pounds 260,000, all of which has gone
into patentable products.
Meanwhile turnover has doubled every year and the company was in profit from
the third year of operations. It has moved from its original premises to an
atmospheric Victorian mansion on the outskirts of Swansea and has opened
sales offices in the US and Europe. The UK side employs 11 people.
The business appears to be recession proof. 'I keep thinking it will
plateau, but there's some years of growth yet,' says Sawyer.
While his wife Lorna manages the financial side of the business, he remains
an active managing director. 'I spend too much of my time worrying about
trivial things.'
One distraction has been another unexpected source of income: tourism. He
says people find the leech's obnoxious and repugnant side fascinating. Last
year he opened the premises on Thursday afternoons in the summer and was
overwhelmed at the response.
Now he wonders if he should have designed the farm to exploit the public's
curiosity. 'At the beginning I should have identified the tourism side,' he
says. 'This is such a strange business.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Drive a cheaper car
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM a project manager in the civil engineering industry and I am in
correspondence with the Inland Revenue concerning the use of my own car on
company business. I bought my car for Pounds 16,000 two years ago and during
that time I have used it on company business. I understand that in the first
year in which the car is used for business purposes the writing down
allowance is 25 per cent of the cost/open market value of the car. In
subsequent years the writing down allowance was 25 per cent of the
qualifying expenditure, - ie the cost of the car less the writing down
allowance. Accordingly, I claimed Pounds 4,000 for the first year, Pounds
3,000 for the second year. The Revenue has said the maximum permissible
writing down allowance is Pounds 2,000 per annum. Is the Revenue correct or
if I should appeal?
For an 'expensive motor car', namely a car costing more than Pounds 8,000,
the annual writing-down allowance is indeed restricted to Pounds 2,000 by
section 34 of the Capital Allowances Act 1990 (reenacting the existing
legislation as amended up to 1985). Ask your tax office for the free
pamphlet IR106 (Capital allowances for vehicles and machinery).
The maintenance of the Pounds 8,000 ceiling is probably a fair indication
that the majority of MPs consider that car prices in the UK are too high.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): When do share offers
warrant a tax charge?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Williams offer (three for 20 plus 10 per share cash) for my Racal
Electronic Ordinary states:
'a holder of Racal Elect Ord will, to the extent that he receives cash
consideration, be treated as making a disposal for the purposes of UK tax on
capital gains and may be liable to tax as a result'.
I presume therefore that the share exchange part of the offer is not liable
for CGT.
The Hanson offer (90p cash plus warrants to the value of Pounds 33.5p) for
my Beazer ordinary states:
'The receipt of cash or warrants will constitute a disposal for the purposes
of UK taxation of capital gains and may give rise to a gain or loss for the
purposes of such taxation. Such a gain or loss would arise where the cash
(together with the market value of the warrants) differ from the cost of
their Beazer Ordinary and any under allowance on such cost.'
Why in the Williams offer is only the cash element liable for CGT but in the
Hanson offer the whole value, cash and warrants is liable?
Where warrants are issued on a takeover, they sometimes rank like shares for
rollover and sometimes they do not. It all depends upon what else was
offered at the time. An offer of simply warrants, or simply cash and
warrants, will produce a deemed disposal for a consideration equal to the
quarter-up market value of the warrants (or, in the second case, that market
value plus the cash). On the other hand, if there is a loan-note alternative
to the cash, for example, the warrants will generally be eligible for
rollover like shares, because section 139 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979
says:
'(1) if a quoted option to subscribe for shares in a company is dealt in (on
the stock exchange where it is quoted) within three months after the taking
effect, with respect to the company granting the option, of any
reorganisation, reduction, conversion or amalgamation to which Chapter II of
Part IV above applies, or within such longer period as the Board may by
notice in writing allow - (a) the option shall, for the purposes of the said
Chapter II (under which a holding prior to the reorganisation or reduction
of capital, conversion or amalgamation is to be treated as the same as the
resulting new holding) be regarded as the shares which could be acquired by
exercising the option . . .'
So far as we are aware, nobody has ever produced a convincing explanation
for this arbitrary distinction. As the rule has remained unchanged since
1971, however, it clearly has the support of MPs in all parts of the House.
Before asking your MP for clarification of the purpose behind this odd piece
of tax law, you may like to ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13
(The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT14 (Capital Gains Tax:
an introduction).

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: It may be time to fix the rates on
investments - How to . . . lock in high returns / The various packages which
offer guaranteed income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS may be content with interest rates of 11 per cent or so and inflation
at 4 per cent. But could this be the time to lock in to rates while they are
still in double figures?
The pound's current difficulties mean that the next move in interest rates
may be up rather than down. But the whole idea of joining the Exchange Rate
Mechanism was that its discipline would help both interest rates and
inflation fall over the longer term. It is hard to imagine that interest
rates will still be in double figures in 1995 if inflation does not rise
from current levels.
What options are there for those who would like to fix the rates on their
investments?
Guaranteed income bonds: You invest your money with an insurance company for
a fixed period of time and in return you are paid a fixed interest rate
during that period. The company guarantees to repay you the capital when the
bond matures. Payment of income is usually made annually, though some
insurance companies will pay on a monthly basis.
The returns are paid net of basic rate income tax, which cannot be
reclaimed. They are thus unlikely to be suitable for non-taxpayers. Higher
rate taxpayers will face a further charge when the bonds are cashed in. This
should be slightly less than they would have paid had they held the money in
a conventional building society account.
Baronworth Investment Services recommends Providence Capitol as its best buy
for a five year guaranteed annual income bond of Pounds 10,000 or more. It
is paying out 9.4 per cent on Pounds 10,000 to just under Pounds 25,000 and
9.5 per cent on amounts of Pounds 25,000 or above.
Baronworth's best buy three year bond is from Prosperity. Rates are 9.15 per
cent on Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 25,000 and 9.2 per cent on Pounds 25,000 or
above.
Annuities: You pay an insurance company a lump sum in exchange for a fixed
sum of money paid to you at regular intervals. The annuity will pay you a
high return, sometimes over a specified period (a temporary annuity) or more
usually, until death (an immediate annuity). Effectively, a large part of
the return is the repayment of your capital. This has some tax advantages
but the consequence is that when you die, your estate will have lost the
value of the initial annuity investment.
The nature of annuities is that the insurance company does badly out of
those who live on to a ripe old age. As a consequence, the older you are,
the higher the income an insurance company is prepared to pay. The rule of
thumb is that immediate annuities are not good investments for people under
70.
Rates on annuities vary so it is important to look around insurance
companies for the best deals. The best temporary annuities (nine years) for
a man aged 70 with a down payment of Pounds 10,000, according to Baronworth,
come from Sun Life of Canada with Pounds 2,044 a year and Equitable Life
with Pounds 2,025.40. Best immediate annuities (on the same assumptions) are
also from Sun Life of Canada with Pounds 1,563.24 per year and Co-op
Insurance with Pounds 1,530.40.
The above rates relate to annuities bought 'voluntarily' and not to the
compulsory purchase annuities, which must be acquired with the proceeds of a
personal pension.
There are also more complicated contracts which provide a measure of
inflation-proofing - index-linked annuities increase in line with the retail
prices index, and increasing annuities guarantee to increase their pay-out
by a fixed amount (normally 5 per cent) each year. Both provide lower
initial income as a result.
Gilts: British government stocks may not be the most exciting form of
investment but economic uncertainties have made them popular with some
experts at the moment.
Conventional gilts provide a fixed rate of interest over a specified period,
paid at half-yearly intervals. There are a variety of issues, paying
different interest rates with different redemption dates. The government
repays them at their face value on maturity. As a result, when you buy them,
you are certain of their return provided you are able to hold them till
redemption. This return, called the gross redemption yield, currently varies
between 9.5 and 10 per cent.
Since gilts are bought and sold on the stock market until their redemption
date, their price can rise and fall after you buy them. The price normally
varies in inverse relation to interest rates. As interest rates rise, the
price tends to fall; and vice versa.
If you think that interest rates will fall and that the price of gilts will
go up, then you could buy gilts in the hope of making a capital gain in the
short term. There is no capital gains tax to pay on gilts, though you will
have to pay income tax on the interest.
If you are a non-taxpayer, buy gilts through the National Savings Stock
Register at the Post Office, where the income is paid without tax being
first deducted. Otherwise gilts can be bought from stockbrokers and through
the larger banks.
The type of gilt that you choose depends essentially on whether you want to
make a capital gain or are more interested in the income. If you buy gilts
at prices below face value, a greater proportion of the return will be in
the form of tax-free capital gain, but the annual income will be lower.
Gilts priced above face value will pay a higher income but could face
investors with a capital loss.
National Savings: Apart from gilts, other National Savings products that
offer fixed interest are Savings Certificates, the Yearly Plan and Capital
Bonds.
The 36th issue of Savings Certificates pays 8.5 per cent if held for five
years, equal to 14.17 per cent for a higher rate taxpayer. Each unit costs
Pounds 25 and the limit is Pounds 10,000 per issue. In addition, husband and
wife can each hold the maximum Pounds 10,000 worth of certificates in trust
for each other, and issues can also be held in trust for children. There is
no income or capital gains tax to pay.
The Yearly Plan is a scheme for saving once a month for a year to buy a
Savings Certificate at the end of the year. Savers pay a fixed amount
between Pounds 20 to Pounds 200, by monthly standing order. This means that
the maximum value Savings Certificate that you can obtain through the Yearly
Plan is Pounds 2,400. The certificate must be held for a further four years
to earn the full current return of 8.5 per cent. Savers can hold Pounds
10,000 in National Savings certificates and have the Yearly Plan.
Non-taxpayers may be particularly attracted by Capital Bonds which pay
gross, rather than tax-free, interest which is given automatically to
non-taxpayers. The bonds must be held for five years in order to obtain
guaranteed growth.
Debentures and Convertibles: This is a riskier way of fixing your income.
Debentures are issued by companies wanting to raise money, and are secured
on an asset (typically property). They operate in a similar way to gilts in
that they pay a fixed rate of interest and are repaid at the end of a
specified term.
Convertible bonds can be exchanged into shares of a company at a future
date. This potential for profit means that the bonds tend to carry a lower
interest rate, and the price is more volatile. There are accordingly two
risks.
If the share price of the company never reaches a level which makes
conversion worthwhile, you will almost certainly have been better off
investing in gilts. And if the company goes bankrupt, you are likely to lose
your investment completely; this is an area where it is important to get
good advice.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capel-Cure tops unit trust charts - A
decade of performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEY Income, the unit trust run by Capel-Cure Asset Management, was the best
performing open-ended fund during the last ten years. Investors who placed
Pounds 1,000 in the trust in January 1982 would, if they had reinvested
their income, have seen their money grow to Pounds 7,845.
This week, Capel-Cure sold its subsidiary, Key Investments, to National &amp;
Provincial Building Society. Fund management of Key Income will stay with
Capel-Cure, however, but ownership by N &amp; P should improve awareness and
sales of the Key funds.
The excellence of Capel-Cure's long term investment record is shown by the
fact that two further trusts in its stables, Capability Special Situations
and Capability Income &amp; Growth, are also in the top ten.
UK equity-based funds dominate the rankings, as highlighted by the showing
of UK equity income and UK equity general as second and fourth best
performing sectors over the ten years to January 1 1992.
If one looks back at the same exercise we conducted at the start of 1991,
one can see how slowly the ten year tables change. Seven of the funds in the
current top ten were also in the rankings last year; Key Income has moved
from second to first, while James Capel Income has slipped from first to
fourth place. This year's 'new entries' are Equity &amp; Law High Income,
Capability Income &amp; Growth and Hill Samuel European.
A similar pattern can be found among the sectors with the best three exactly
the same as in last year's list (though the position of International
Balanced is still based on just one fund) and the worst four also being the
same, albeit in a slightly different order.
On a three-year basis, which is the shortest period on which a unit trust
investment should be judged, the tables change more rapidly. Only one of
last year's top ten, F &amp; C US Smaller Companies, is in this year's rankings.
The effect of 1991's stock market performances has, of course, a much
greater impact on three year than on ten year performance tables. Last year,
the performance of US shares, particularly those of smaller companies, was
very strong; whereas the tables had previously been dominated by south-east
Asian funds.
The Far East (excluding Japan) sector is still the best over three years,
followed by North America. But the slim pickings for equity investors in
1989-91 are highlighted by the fact that money market funds have been the
third best sector over three years. Worst over the period have been
financial &amp; property, Japanese and UK smaller companies funds.
The probability is that the short-term performance tables will always be
dominated by the specialist markets. Gilt and money market funds, for
example, led the one year tables of 1990 because stock markets round the
world fell that year.
To date, the long-term performance tables, however, have illustrated the
wisdom of purchasing the less volatile UK equity funds, although admittedly
many specialised funds do not have a ten year record.
The fund management group that comes out best of the three year performance
tables is Framlington. Apart from the highly specialised Health fund, which
is top of the rankings, the group also has its American Smaller Companies
and International Growth funds in the table. The only management group with
a fund in the top ten of both three and ten years is that old reliable, M&amp;G.
Finally, what about that old investment theory, that you should buy the
worst performing trust of last year to get outperformance the following
year? It did not work in 1991. The laggard of 1990, Barclays Unicorn Japan &amp;
General, fell a further 2.6 per cent.
Any diehard believers will have to opt this year for MGM Special Situations
which has turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 705 over one year and into Pounds
402 over three. Alternatively, you could try this very good horse in the
2.30 at Chepstow . . .

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurers' bonus gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JANUARY round of bonus declarations by life insurers has produced some
unpleasant news for investors.
The trend is uneven, but bonuses and pay-outs on with-profits pension and
endowment policies, particularly over ten years, are heading down.
Two reasons are given:
The stock market had a bad year in 1990, and
Many analysts are predicting lower yields for the coming decade. If this is
right, bonuses must come down now, or offices will have difficulty meeting
their commitments in future.
Comparisons between bonuses are unwise, as the structure of reversionary
bonuses, which are awarded annually and cannot be taken away, and terminal
bonuses, awarded when the policy matures, varies from office to office. It
is better to make a straight comparison of final pay-outs made.
The standard industry practice is to quote pay-outs for endowments started
by men aged 29, and paying monthly premiums of Pounds 30.
Norwich Union set the tone last month by announcing it had lopped 9 per cent
off 10-year pay-outs, to Pounds 7,532, and 5 per cent off 25-year pay-outs,
to Pounds 60,073. Others followed suit.
Yesterday, Commercial Union bucked the trend. It cut its reversionary bonus,
but the pay-out on 25-year policies increased 6.3 per cent to Pounds 65,596.
This is the highest so far, and may well remain so. On ten-year policies,
which do not include the strong growth of the late 1970s, CU cut its pay-out
from Pounds 7,645 to Pounds 7,484.
CU attributed its success to the conservative strategy of paying out large
reversionary bonuses. This makes its policies more secure.
Lower reversionary bonuses give investment managers more freedom to take
advantage of big gains in the stock market but mean that final pay-outs can
be over-reliant on terminal bonuses.
The higher the stress on terminal bonuses, the narrower the difference
between 'with-profits' policies and straightforward unit-linked policies.
Last year, terminal bonus accounted for only 29.8 per cent of CU's 25-year
pay-out (compared with 63.0 per cent for Standard Life, last year's top
performer). CU looks like a good haven for the nervous.
Guardian Royal Exchange, which finished bottom in last year's Money
Management magazine survey of 10-year pay-outs, has cut its final pay-out on
a 25-year endowment policy by 4.9 per cent compared with January last year,
while for a 10-year policy the reduction is 7 per cent. Using the standard
assumptions, a 10-year endowment would now pay Pounds 5,479, on total
premiums of Pounds 3,600.
Last year, GRE's 10-year pay-out of Pounds 5,887 was Pounds 641 lower than
the next-worst pay-out of the 49 offices surveyed, and it has cut pay-outs
on 10-year endowments every year since 1986, when a similar policy would
have paid out Pounds 7,196. Past performance, is no guide to future returns,
but it is hard to imagine many independent brokers recommending GRE 10-year
policies.
Michael Auld, of GRE, points out that GRE's 25-year performance is more
competitive, and adds: 'I think there's a move in the market by one means or
another to reward to those who have contributed to the life fund for the
longest time.'

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Simple duties of pensions trustees -
The straightforward but little understood obligations of the UK's 300,000
fund trustees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE responsibility for more than Pounds 300bn of pension fund assets rests
on the shoulders of 300,000 trustees in the UK, yet all too often this vital
function is performed by people who have no clear idea of their legal
duties.
All occupational pension schemes in the UK are written under trust, for
three important reasons:
To separate the pension fund from the rest of the company's assets. This in
theory protects the fund - for example from creditors if the company goes
bust;
To manage money on behalf of others. In this case the money is managed on
behalf of the scheme members who for tax reasons cannot gain access to their
portion of the fund until retirement.
To get Inland Revenue approval to qualify for tax benefits, for example tax
relief on employee and employer contributions and tax free roll up of the
fund.
A trust cannot exist without a trustee who, as legal owner of the fund, is
obliged to look after the assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. In the case
of pension funds the beneficiaries are the scheme members, including retired
employees drawing pensions and ex-employees with deferred pensions. The
dependants of scheme members also are classed as beneficiaries.
It is worth stressing that the responsibility of the trusts is to the
beneficiaries and not to the employer, the trade union or any other group
within the company.
Most companies appoint between two and four trustees. In the case of small
companies the trustees tend to be drawn from the management team, for
example the managing director, the finance director or company secretary.
Larger companies often have works' trustees as well who are elected by
scheme members. Trustees may receive expenses but otherwise they are not
paid for their work except where a professional firm undertakes the task.
Lay trustees are not expected to be pension experts, but to do the job
properly it is vital to understand the main legal and financial duties.
Unfortunately, companies are not obliged by law to provide training and
according to a recent survey carried out by the Alexander Consulting Group,
almost a third of trustees receive no formal preparation for the job. The
same survey found that almost half of the trustees in the UK take no role in
the decision making process of funds.
The real victims of this waste of talent are the pension scheme members who
depend on the trustees to prevent foul play or sheer incompetence on the
part of the employer and professional advisers.
Robin Ellison, senior partners with pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp,
and author of a guide on the subject,* stressed that trustees should not be
deterred by the apparent complexity of the job.
'The job of trustee is a legal one and not actuarial, managerial or
accounting. Providing you are honest, sensible and take proper advice you
can do a lot of good and come to very little harm,' Ellison said.
The trustee's first job is to read and, if possible, understand the trust
deed which, among other points, sets out how the fund is to be invested and
the winding up procedure. The deed also gives guidelines on contributions to
the fund and benefits paid out.
Ellison's guide highlights the five most important clauses for the trustee
in this deed:
The delegation power. This allows the trustee to appoint professionals such
as actuaries and investment managers to see to the fund's day to day
running, although overall responsibility rests with the trustee;
The indemnity provisions. This should exclude trustees from liability and
legal costs if they are sued, provided they can demonstrate they were acting
in good faith. Some trustees also take out individual trustee indemnity
insurance to cover these costs if the employer goes bust and is unable to
pick up the tab.
The trustee's power. It is vital to know where the balance of power lies
between the trustees and the employer in decision making.
Power to resign. The trustee should be able to do this in writing without
having to apply to the court.
Effect of wind-up. To avoid future conflicts between the company and scheme
members it is vital to check the deed is specific about the treatment of
deficits and surpluses if the scheme is wound up.
The art of good pension fund trusteeship lies in successful delegation.
Providing information about the scheme to members, for example, can be
delegated to employee benefits communications experts. Likewise the trustee
will need to appoint lawyers, actuaries, accountants, consultants and
pensions managers. The trustees meet regularly to examine and approve
reports from these professional advisers and to exercise discretionary
judgments where an issue cannot be delegated.
Discretionary powers play an important part in the structure of UK pension
schemes. For example, the trustees can award discretionary increases to
scheme pensioners or they can decide who receives the lump sum benefit when
a scheme member dies and there are several beneficiaries with conflicting
claims. Professional advice can be sought on these issues but the final
decision rests with the trusts.
Training for trustees is provided by unions and many of the large firms of
actuaries and employee benefits consultants. Courses are essential for
beginners but even experienced trustees need to be kept up to date about
current issues.
An important new rule is expected to come into play this month when the
Department of Social Security will introduce regulations which require all
trustees to read a government guide to trustee duties. Details on this new
government booklet 'Pension Trust Principles: the Occupational Pensions
Board Guide for Pension Trustees' will be announced by the DSS shortly.
In view of the Maxwell case, trustees may wonder how far their
responsibilities extend. Alex MacIntyre, national director for the Alexander
Consulting Group, said: 'If it is a question of covert theft, then it would
be very difficult for the trustee to spot that. However, the trustee should
ensure that the investment decisions are not only legal but that they are
also prudent.
'If the trustee has a serious concern he or she should alert the appropriate
authorities, for example Imro (Investment Managers Regulatory Organisation)
or the Occupational Pensions Board. The trustee's ultimate sanction is to
resign and go public with the information,' MacIntyre said.

<TEXT>
THE RATIO of director purchases to sales in December was 3.25:1, almost
approaching the level seen in the autumn of 1990. Conglomerates and the oil
&amp; gas sectors appear as the most heavily bought during the month.
The sale in Vodafone is by Sir Ernest Harrison, the chairman, who also sold
1.5m shares in September.
Sir Ernest is also chairman of Racal Electronics, in which he has invested
several million pounds in recent months.
Sales in J Sainsbury continue a trend noticed over the last 12 months in the
food retailer sector, although these, in particular, are relatively small in
relation to the directors holdings.
The three directors buying in Tarmac are the chairman, the managing director
and the finance director, with the latter two increasing their holdings by a
substantial margin.
Tarmac has appeared here twice of late, with substantial buying by two
non-executive directors.
The sale of 25,000 shares in MB Caradon is by Sir Eric Parker, a
non-executive director, who invested a similar amount of money in Trafalgar
House at its current depressed share price a few weeks ago.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Revenue changes will hit leave pay -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST quarter of 1991 was not, from a tax point of view, a good time for
those expatriates planning to return to the UK.
First, the rules regarding the UK tax treatment of various kinds of lump sum
termination payment were tightened.
Then, in December, the Revenue announced impending changes to the tax
treatment of those expatriates who continue to receive leave pay after
completing their active employment and returning to the UK.
The December changes relate to a relief introduced in 1974 as part of
measures concerning the taxation of overseas earnings. This ensured tax
exemption on remuneration earned in the course of a 'qualifying period'
lasting for 365 days or more, regardless of whether or not a full tax year
was involved.
'Qualifying period' encompasses not only days spent overseas but also
intervening days spent in the UK, provided they do not exceed 62 consecutive
days, or one sixth of the days in the period. The exemption also extends to
any terminal leave immediately following the qualifying period.
The benefit of this legislation has been accorded to UK residents and
non-residents alike, and has ensured exemption from tax of terminal leave
pay. Unfortunately, the December announcement makes clear that for all who
become resident in the UK from and after April 6 1992, days of non-residence
will no longer count towards a qualifying period.
This change will have unfair results. Someone who has worked overseas for,
say, 20 months without becoming non-resident will be exempt from tax on
leave pay, whereas a non-resident of 20 years standing will not.
This could have serious consequences for those with long periods of paid
leave, such as pensionable officers in Hong Kong, for whom leave pay
extending to a year or more is not uncommon.
For years before the proposed changes, leave pay either attracted no
liability or could easily be avoided. Now, avoiding liability will very much
depend on an individual's circumstances.
So, what can you do?
If, following your return to the UK, you have no choice but to draw your
leave pay month by month, you will at first sight be caught by the new
regulations.
But if you are a public sector employee, and you worked in a country with a
full Double Taxation Agreement with the UK, your leave pay may be exempted.
However, if you are a private sector employee, you will have no entitlement
to UK exemption, although you may be able to obtain this from the country in
which you worked. In either case, caution is necessary - not all Agreements
incorporate the necessary provisions.
If you can re-negotiate your contract so that you are paid for leave
entitlement during your active service, the problem will disappear.
Unfortunately, the simple expedient of obtaining payment in advance from
your overseas employer before you return to the UK might not solve the
problem. As a result of the 'receipts basis' of Schedule E, introduced in
1989/90, the payment will be taxable in the year of receipt, even if you
were then still abroad and non-resident. But even in this case liability
might be excluded by a Double Taxation Agreement.
Another option is to ensure that you remain UK non-resident throughout your
leave. This might be less difficult than it would appear since your full
time overseas employment will, technically, be continuing during the period
of your leave.
This means that in deciding your resident status, the Revenue should leave
out of account any available accommodation which you may have in the UK. So
you need only ensure that your UK visits exceed neither 182 days in any tax
year, nor 90 days per annum over any period of four consecutive years.
However, this assumes that you do not decide to remain permanently in the UK
until your final return.
Another approach could be to accept UK residence as soon as possible. For
example, if you arrive in the UK in March 1993, you would normally be
regarded as resident from that point as a result of a concession. If you
decline the concession, you will be treated as resident from the preceding
April 6, thus starting off a qualifying period.
By a regime of judicious absences, (during which you do not have to be
working) you might be able to build up a period of 365 days or more. If you
do so, the leave pay relative to the period will be exempt, as will that
which immediately follows it, even though you are then back in the UK.
Remember that if you become resident in the UK sooner than necessary, there
could be undesirable results on the tax treatment of any non-salary income
and capital gains. Consequently, there is no easy answer: expert advice is
needed.

Sussex.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Play your (credit) cards right - Some
tips for those who live and shop abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU want to go shopping across the globe, but pay for what you buy in the
UK, there are few payment instruments as convenient as a Visa or MasterCard.
A UK Visa credit or debit card holder, for example, can use his or her Visa
card in 9.3m retail outlets across the world.
In addition, most developed countries now have extensive networks of cash
machines from which you can draw money from a UK bank account.
Their obvious convenience means that UK Visa cards or MasterCards are
increasingly used by expatriates as well as tourists.
Barclaycard, the largest UK card issuer with 8m credit cards and 4m debit
cards, says that it has about 150,000 expatriate cardholders. Almost all
these people were existing Barclaycard customers who happen to have moved
abroad to live or work.
'There isn't much advantage for anyone who isn't a UK bank customer to hold
one of our cards, as opposed to that of the bank of the country they live
in, because they would have to pay in sterling and they could have
difficulty getting foreign currency converted,' says a Barclays spokesman.
If you do plan to use a credit card regularly abroad, there are points to
bear in mind. One is that you should have the card before you leave the UK.
If you do not, you may well find it difficult to get one.
An overseas Weekend FT reader writes that he has applied for a card to
several of the UK card issuers who offer low interest cards or those without
annual charges, but they all turned him down.
The main reason why banks would do this is that if you are not already a
current account customer and live overseas, they have little or no hold on
you if you chose not to pay your debts.
'Credit card debt is always the first debt people walk away from,' says one
of the 'Big Four' clearers.
A second reason is that if you are resident abroad, you do not have a recent
UK credit record which will enable a bank to see what sort of risk you are.
You may be able to get over this problem if you are an existing current
account customer of a bank, or if you open a current account and keep a
fairly large sum of money in it.
Some banks - Lloyds, for example - will not issue their credit cards to
people, even if they live in the UK, unless they are existing customers of
the bank.
There can be other problems. If you are resident abroad, you will have to be
periodically issued with a new card and you will of course have to pay your
bills each month.
That means that there must be certain minimum standards of postal
communication between a customer and bank. Even in the advanced industrial
countries this cannot be taken for granted.
You may find it difficult to get a card issuer to send you a card if, for
example, you live in a country with a poor postal service and high levels of
fraud, such as Italy.
Barclays and other large issuers keep lists of 'no-go' countries for the
card business. Lists change from day to day and some UK postal districts are
also on the black list.
You may find it easier to persuade a card issuer to send you some cards
rather than others. Debit cards and gold cards seem, in different ways, to
be more vulnerable to abuse than straightforward credit cards.
Bear in mind that with sophisticated card fraud now worldwide, there are
additional risks. If a dispute between you and your card issuer arises, it
may be harder to resolve from abroad and you may find that legal rights are
affected by overseas status.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: FSAVCs vs. company schemes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Once you have decided to put money into an AVC, you still have to choose
between FSAVCs and a company scheme.
There are no straightforward rules on which will be better for you. The
differences are as follows:
The provider of an in-house scheme is chosen by the employer while the
employee can choose the provider for an FSAVC.
The costs of an in-house scheme can be borne by either the employer or the
employee, although the employer should usually be able to negotiate
discounts. You will certainly bear the full costs of an FSAVC yourself.
Tax relief on in-house contributions is paid immediately at the highest
marginal rate. The relief on FSAVCs is less convenient for top-rate
taxpayers. Contributions are paid net of basic rate tax, which the provider
then reclaims. Top-rate tax relief must be claimed in end-of-year tax
returns.
Contributions into an in-house scheme often remain fixed, and employers can
delay a change in contribution rates for up to 12 months. If you have an
FSAVC, terms vary according to the provider, but they should usually be much
more flexible. Investment options on an in-house scheme are chosen by the
employer. With an FSAVC, it is up to you.
In short, FSAVCs offer much more flexibility and choice, in return for
higher charges and possibly more awkward administration.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Markets: Engineering a way out of the doldrums - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS coming out about engineering companies recently cannot have been
good for shareholders' blood pressure.
The Engineering Employers Federation has said that output continued to fall
in the last quarter of 1991 and no upturn is expected until the end of this
year. About 170,000 of the industry's workers lost their jobs last year,
nearly three times as many as in the previous two years put together.
In the latest edition of the The Engineer magazine, a survey of confidence -
or lack of it - showed that after a breath of hope in the autumn, sentiment
had reverted almost to the 'appalling' levels prevailing in December 1990.
It is little comfort that shareholders should already have been braced for
bad news not only by the general back-pedalling on dates for a UK recovery,
but also by the more engineering-sensitive forecasts from the Confederation
of British Industry: fixed investment in manufacturing down by nearly 20 per
cent in 1991, with a further fall of 4.4 per cent pencilled in for this
year.
In the City, the accompanying round of profits downgrades and deepening
anxiety about dividend prospects have caused the general engineering sector
to have a price-earnings ratio nearly 20 per cent below that of the
FT-Actuaries Industrial Group, while the yield is appreciably higher.
So is it not time for those with strong nerves to start taking a different
view? The comparative cheapness of the sector might make it worth buying for
the profits to be made out of the recovery.
Not necessarily, according to John McGee, an analyst at SG Warburg. He
points to the underperformance of general engineering compared with the
all-share index over the past 15 years, as shown in the accompanying
illustration. 'People didn't make a lot of money out of recovery stocks in
that sector 10 years ago.'
Nor was any compensation gained via the dividend. For most of the last
decade, engineering companies yielded less than the market.
Timing is also difficult. It takes a while for investment abstinence to feed
through to actual workload, or for engineering contracts to be completed,
many companies in the sector were relatively late entrants into the
recession and may also be late out.
For those prepared to take a longer view, however, a much more positive
picture can be painted. Mark Radcliffe, deputy director general of the CBI
and head of its National Manufacturing Council, said the 'massive
restructuring carried out by many companies in the 1980s has made them much
better.' He cites improvements in productivity and the strengthening of
positions in international markets.
As an industrialist, he was quizzical about the stock market's perception of
engineering companies. However, some analysts are also making encouraging
noises about the medium-term outlook.
Jonathan Getz, at Birmingham-based Albert E Sharp, says the UK's attractions
within Europe - illustrated by Japanese investment - include more
accommodating employment laws and relatively low labour costs.
Yet judging the sector continues to be a difficult task because of its
diversity. Mr Sandy Morris, at County NatWest, says: 'It is not quite right
that all engineering companies get tarred with the same brush.'
There is some convenience in the separation of aerospace, motors and metals
companies into their own little sectors, especially as each has its peculiar
problems. Aerospace and metals were among the five worst performing sectors
in 1991, while motors has joined steel in providing analysts with big
dividend worries.
Companies will pay uncovered dividends for one year, but not two, is the
expected rule of thumb.
In the general engineering sector, the companies with the best prospects
include those which have spread their activities overseas. Siebe and TI
Group have strong positions in the US and both showed relatively modest
profit declines in the first half of 1991.
Among those that have weathered this recession much better than the last one
is Weir Group. Rescued by its banks last time, it has kept cash in hand
through this downturn.
Weir raised interim profits by more than a third and it was far from alone
in continuing to make progress. In a cursory glance at the list, some of the
others that raised their last pre-tax figures are: Babcock, BM, EIS, Halma,
Powerscreen, TT and Whessoe.
Those companies which cut their costs in 1991 - IMI, for instance, with
1,200 redundancies - should also have laid the foundations for a better
performance.
Although it is early days for any necks to be stuck out, the scene should be
set for a better share price performance from the engineering companies in
the 1990s.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Markets: Dow continues to let the good times roll - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW LONG can the good times continue? Will Wall Street crack?
Certainly, there was little sign of any big set-back for much of last week.
The Dow Jones has now closed at record levels on eight of the last ten
trading days - representing a near-10 per cent gain since the discount rate
cut took effect on December 20. Two of these all-time highs were scored last
week, on Tuesday and then again on Thursday.
True, the market turned significantly weaker on Friday morning, in the wake
of some ambiguous jobs data.
An increase in December payroll levels took Wall Street by surprise -
although some rumours to this effect had taken the edge off prices late on
Thursday. However, analysts were quick to dissect the figures; within the
overall improvement, they noted, manufacturing employment fell by 32,000,
and in the retail sector, by 16,000.
The main impact of these better-than-expected statistics, therefore, was to
curtail hopes of another early interest rate easing by the Federal Reserve,
rather than boost optimism about a reviving economy. This, in turn, prompted
some speculators to take profits.
But even if there is no further stimulus from Fed action in the short-term,
pessimists on Wall Street are hard to find.
The current level of interest rates already makes equities look attractive
alongside many alternative investments. According to some traders, moreover,
there are still investors who missed the initial surge in share prices and
who seeking to increase equity exposure.
In an inevitable 'virtuous circle,' this weight of money argument provides
psychological support to the market at these levels, and that in turn
encourages more small investors to join the party. Of course, bursts of
profit-taking are inevitable - this affected transportation stocks on
Thursday, for example - but real doomsters are hard to find.
Inevitably, a search for maximum returns has pushed many punters towards
smaller stocks, provoking a wave of gains in high-tech and biotechnology
issues. The Nasdaq index, which measures New York's over-the-counter market,
smashed through the 600-barrier on Tuesday. By Friday morning, it was still
holding around the 612 level.
Such heady market levels have spurred a flood of new issues. On the one
hand, the extremely low level of interest rates has pushed many corporations
towards the debt markets: on Wednesday, for example, a chunky Dollars
5bn-worth was sold by corporations. But equity offerings are playing their
part, too. Among the leading companies who announced new equity issues last
week were AMR, parent company of American Airlines, and International Paper.
To what extent Wall Street's optimism mirrors any genuine improvement in
economy remains a moot point. The corporate reporting season has yet to get
underway in any meaningful sense, although a handful of financial companies
appeared eager to tell the good news last week.
To no one's surprise, J. P. Morgan, the New York banking group, rolled out a
41 per cent earnings gain for the year - underlining the extent to which
parts of Wall Street have prospered while much of Main Street has suffered.
Even so, a slip in trading profits in third quarter levels and complicating
tax benefits, caused the shares to ease Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 67.50.
But the absence of any major rise in non-performing assets at Chemical Bank,
which merged at the end of last year with Manufacturers Hanover, gained a
more sympathetic reaction - in the form of a Dollars 1 1/4 rise, to Dollars
27 1/2 . Chemical's fourth quarter loss of Dollars 420m was largely
explained by restructuring charges, which totalled Dollars 625m.
Conversely, post-holiday news from the retail sector has been generally
grim. Zale, the largest jewellery retailer, still hovers on the brink of
bankruptcy, and two of the largest general/fashion merchandise groups -
Sears Roebuck and Woolworth - both unveiled restructuring plans last week.
At Sears, some 7,000 jobs may be affected as the company struggles to attack
its cost-base and improve automated procedures.
Such efforts notwithstanding, Moody's, one of the large US rating agencies,
still announced a possible downgrade of Sears debt, and signs of another
bout of shareholder agitation also developed. At Woolworth, some 10,000 jobs
may go as a handful of speciality chains within the retail group are
discontinued and other weak areas pruned back.
In short, if oxygen levels are high on Wall Street, the rest of the country
is still catching up. How quickly it can do so will determine the market's
course ahead.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Markets: What will Labour do to nest eggs? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL THE Labour party steal your nest-egg? The Conservative party raised
this spectre this week, creating the inevitable frightening headlines in the
Tory section of the Press.
Labour has made a few firm commitments: to abolish the ceiling on National
Insurance contributions (currently Pounds 390 a week or Pounds 20,280 a
year); to raise the top rate of tax to 50 per cent a year; and to impose a
surcharge of 9 per cent (equal to the NI rate) on those non-pensioners who
receive income from savings of over Pounds 3,000 a year. Funds raised would
be used to increase pensions and child benefits.
Other parts of its policy are less clear and the Conservatives exploited
this confusion by suggesting this week that Labour would have to raise basic
rate tax by 10 percentage points (to 35 per cent) to pay for its promises.
Labour says that, on the contrary, its plans for further public spending
will be financed by economic growth. (As the economy grows, the government's
tax revenues increase.)
Which you believe will obviously depend on which party you are inclined to
support. The cynical might reason that a 35 per cent tax rate would be
politically disastrous and that, even with economic growth, some of Labour's
promises could take a very long time to implement. One should also remember
that, under Margaret Thatcher, the top rate of tax was as high as 60 per
cent until 1988.
Savers should not be led astray by the more enthusiastic of the Tories'
supporters in the media. Contrary to Press reports which have appeared this
week, pensioners need not worry about the possibility of an investment
income surcharge. Labour has made it clear that it will not apply to people
of over the state pension age. Those who retire before the state pension age
will not pay the surcharge on money derived from pension annuities.
For the bulk of the electorate. therefore, it is far from clear that a
Labour government would mean higher taxes, and indeed many would gain from
the higher child benefits and pensions.
Nevertheless, many Weekend FT readers will be adversely affected. Andrew
Dilnot, of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, writing in the FT this week,
estimated the cost of Labour's plans at various income levels. Those earning
Pounds 25,000 a year would lose Pounds 425; on Pounds 30,000, the loss would
be Pounds 875; on Pounds 40,000, it would be Pounds 1,775; on Pounds 50,000,
it would be Pounds 3,765; and those on Pounds 100,000 would face a hit of
Pounds 13,175 per annum.
This estimate does not include the effect on the surcharge on those with
investment incomes of over Pounds 3,000. If you had savings of Pounds 50,000
and earned 10 per cent a year, then the extra tax charge would vary from
Pounds 180 a year (on those in the basic rate band) to Pounds 680 (for those
who fall in the top rate). Those with Pounds 100,000 savings would, on the
same assumptions, face an additional yearly charge somewhere between Pounds
630 and Pounds 1,630.
In addition, Labour is likely to make some, as yet unspecified, change to
Capital Gains Tax. A strong possibility seems to be that the annual CGT
threshold will be set at the same level as the personal allowance for income
tax (currently Pounds 3,295).
Readers will understandably be anxious to avoid these impositions. Some
choices are simple. If you have savings, and have not already opened a TESSA
(Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account), then do so. It pays tax-free interest
if you hold it for five years; if you have to withdraw your money
beforehand, you will be no worse off than if you had left it in a building
society account all along.
The 36th fixed and the 5th index-linked issues of National Savings also look
attractive. The former pays 8.5 per cent tax-free if held for five years;
the equivalent of a gross 20.7 per cent for a top-rate taxpayer under
Labour's plans. The latter pays 4.5 per cent above the rate of inflation
tax-free; whether it is better than the 36th issue, depends on whether
inflation over the next five years is above or below 4 per cent.
None of the above products pay commission, however, so the financial
services industry is concentrating its efforts elsewhere. Personal Equity
Plans, where income and capital gains are tax-free, are being widely touted.
And it will shortly be time for the annual Business Expansion Scheme bonanza
 -investors in such companies can reclaim tax at their highest marginal
rate.
There are dangers, however, in all this enthusiasm for tax avoidance. The
first is that there are worse things in life than paying taxes. You may
resent paying tax but a poorly performing PEP or BES could cost you far more
than the taxman. Beware of investing in something solely for tax reasons,
and while some PEPs are good value, do not invest in the first to send you a
brochure.
The second problem is that higher taxes will dent your income. You may find
it more difficult to make ends meet. Thus you could find expensive savings
commitments an unnecessary burden, and you may be forced to eat into
previous savings to meet current expenditure. If you surrender a PEP
quickly, the charges will have eaten into your savings. If you surrender a
BES before five years, you will lose the tax relief.
Those who will be hit by a Labour tax increase should accordingly make sure
they have sufficient cash in their building society and deposit accounts;
they could need those liquid assets after the election.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol &amp; West Building Society has launched a guaranteed equity bond, which
offers investors the chance to match the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over
three or five years, with a guaranteed base return. The minimum return over
three years is 9 per cent gross, and 25 per cent gross over five years. The
disadvantages are that the investor does not receive any income, and that
any gain on the bond is subject to income, not capital gains tax.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Fry has announced that the Inland Revenue has given it the go-ahead
to use Business Expansion Scheme funds to support a mortgage rescue scheme.
JF's Eighth Super Growth scheme will aim to raise Pounds 5m, which will be
used to pay for houses which have been bought by the Bedfordshire Pilgrims
Housing Association from people who are behind with their mortgage payments.
The BPHA plans to charge the existing tenants a rent for the five years the
BES funds last, and then offer them the opportunity to buy back their
houses. Growth on the scheme, provided the BPHA is able to meet its
commitments at the end of five years, would be equivalent to 16.49 per cent
per annum for a top-rate taxpayer.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Oil prices fall on Iraqi news
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices fell to their lowest level since the end of the Gulf War this
week as traders reacted to the prospect of the return of Iraqi oil to the
market. The price of North Sea Brent crude for February delivery closed down
by over a dollar on Wednesday to Dollars 17.05 a barrel from the previous
day and was down further at Dollars 16.85 yesterday afternoon.
Wednesday's fall was triggered off by talks between an Iraqi delegation and
UN officials in Vienna on the possibility of partly lifting the UN embargo
on Iraqi oil sales. Prices have declined by almost Dollars 6 a barrel in the
past six weeks.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Markets: A week of strange bedfellows - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS hard, in a dull week for corporate news, to tear one's attention away
from the most extraordinary revelation of the New Year: that Zsa Zsa Gabor
lost her virginity to Kemal Ataturk, the creator of modern Turkey.
Since Ataturk is one of the striking figures of twentieth century history
and Gabor, to put it politely, is not, this liaison is about as plausible as
suggesting a shared sentimental history for Stalin and Joan Collins.
Strange bedfellows abound these days, however, a sentiment well illustrated
by the chart alongside. Historically, a weak pound has been good for
equities, since it prefigures, in economic terms, a shift of national income
away from consumers towards producers. For most of the the past few months,
however, in one of those suspiciously neat correlations, the downward trend
in the D-Mark value of the pound has been exactly matched by the performance
of the FT-SE index.
Throughout the autumn, as the pound weakened, the market fell in step. The
reason, of course, lies in the UK's membership of the ERM. While the
currency is falling, the UK's ability to cut interest rates is limited;
indeed at some point a rise in interest rates may be needed to stop the
pound going through its ERM floor. The weakening pound thus carried a gloomy
message for the equity market, and the two fell together.
At the very end of the year, however, the correlation disappeared: the pound
continued to slide, but the stock market followed Wall Street up. The
rupture in the relationship between the FT-SE and the D-Mark is an
illustration of the way in which the London market became decoupled over
Christmas from the UK's economic fundamentals.
This week, with fund managers and brokers' analysts fully back at work for
the first time since December 20, the autumn's relationship has started to
recreate itself. The pound continued to fall for much of the week - it was
DM 2.840 on Friday, compared with the DM 2.855 a week before - and the stock
market also moved downwards, though with a few abrupt reversals en route.
FT-SE closed yesterday at 2477.9, down 26.2 on the week, having touched
2540.1 during the course of Monday. (Nicholas Knight, the Nomura strategist,
immediately highlighted the Monday figure as possibly the market's high for
the year.)
The rediscovery of bad news owed something to sterling, which was close to
its lower ERM limit against the Spanish peseta, the strongest currency in
the system. It also owed something to abrupt downward adjustments of
expectations. Warburg Securities cut its estimate for 1992 gdp growth from
2.0 per cent to 0.8 per cent, with non-oil output rising at only 0.4 per
cent - an economic recovery that looks all too much like the recession the
economy's supposed to be recovering from. And brokers downgraded profits
estimates wholesale.
The gloom over sterling was probably overstated: as Richard Kersley of BZW
pointed out, though there may well be a pre-election wobble for the pound,
this week's developments weren't it. 'This is how the ERM works,' he said.
Until the pound has really tested the lower bounds of its ERM range against
the peseta, and the Bank of England has been seen to intervene,
unsuccessfully, on a large scale, it is too soon to worry about the impact
on interest rates. Moreover, sterling is still well clear of its floor
against the D-Mark - and arguably that is the relationship which really
matters.
The week's economic and corporate news was only partly encouraging.
Household savings rates, reported on Tuesday, indicated that consumers had
lots of cash if only they chose to spend it. Boots the chemists reported
below-target sales over the Christmas season; Ratners the jewellers reported
sales below year-ago levels. Dixons, the electrical retailer, reported much
better Christmas sales. 'There is more consumer confidence out there than
you might imagine,' said Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman. 'Parts of the
country are bouncing with enthusiasm, such as Scotland and the North East.'
Dixons' shares closed at 211p, up 7p.
Ratners had more to announce than just a disappointing Christmas: there
would be a loss after interest and exceptional charges of around Pounds 70m
in the year to February, it said, along with no final dividend and a new
chairman. The shares closed at 21p yesterday, down only 1p on year's high.
Food retailers, which outperformed the market handsomely last year, had a
poor week, haunted by fears that a price war might be on the way. Sainsbury,
which is starting a big price promotion, closed the week at 340p, 19p down;
the sector as a whole lost 2.7 per cent. Fears of a price war were also
evident in the travel industry: Airtours, which rose 426 per cent last year,
fell 72p this week to close at 823p.
Air transport stocks had other influences at work: BA, for example, closed
unchanged at 229p, caught between poor prospects for the world economy and
lower costs: airlines will benefit from the continuing slide in the oil
price. North Sea prices dropped below Dollars 17 on Thursday, a trend to
which traders see no immediate end. Oil shares, downgraded by brokers'
analysts, suffered accordingly: BP closed the week at 282p, down 8 1/2 p;
Shell ended 25p down at 473p.
One other loser was British Steel, which announced the earlier-than-expected
closure of its Ravenscraig steel mill in Scotland, and said it was deferring
expansion plans at its other big mill, Llanwern, which had been seen as the
corollary of the Scottish closure. The move was interpreted as bad news for
an early return to dividends: the shares closed at 64 1/2 p, down 5 1/2 p.

FT  11 JAN 92 / The Long View: A glut of grandparents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UPGRADING state pensions would be one of the immediate priorities of a
Labour regime in the UK, but all over Europe other governments are searching
for ways of reducing their pension commitments. Persuading people to accept
generous pensions is easy enough, and politicians have cannily noticed that
making such promises can win them votes; but finding other people to foot
the bill is another matter entirely, and it is getting much tougher.
In France the government last year issued a Livre Blanc or discussion paper
to find ways of heading off the imminent crises in the compulsory
pay-as-you-go retirement schemes. In Italy, which already spends 14 per cent
of GDP on state retirement provision, the perennially shaky regime seems
unable to impose an orderly reduction of benefits, implying that at some
point in the not-too-distant future the system will crash in a brutal
fashion.
There are simply going to be too many old folk. The UK, fortunately, will be
little affected for a number of decades, but countries such as Germany,
Belgium, Italy and France are grappling with the implications of a fertility
rate seriously below the level of 2.1 children per woman required to
maintain a stable population. The rate in Italy has slumped to just 1.3.
They say that the very last Bavarian will die in about 500 years time. His
pension book, alas, will not do him much good.
Quite why we Europeans have become reluctant to reproduce ourselves is a big
question, and may have many answers, but I shall just look at it from the
point of view of security in old age. In Third World countries a large
family provides the only reasonably reliable guarantee of comfort and
dignity in the declining years. Advanced Western countries have sought to
introduce retirement security systems which provide universal protection.
But such measures cannot obscure the basic truth that the old are dependent
for survival on the younger generations. We have collectivised pension
rights without considering that there may be a clash with the individualised
duty to go forth and multiply.
These issues were discussed at a fascinating conference run before Christmas
by the Brussels think tank, the Centre for European Policy Studies. The
primary concerns for Eurocrats arise from cross-border distortion; the
different pensions regimes obstruct the mobility of individuals, and can
also affect the competitiveness of industries (which is why the British
government is anxious to avoid some of the high Continental social security
costs).
However, the European Commission has abandoned for the time being its
attempt to harmonise the various pension systems because there is so little
scope for flexibility: nobody would pay into a near-bankrupt French scheme,
for instance, if he or she could possibly avoid it. The question is whether
national reforms will make harmonisation more practical.
Pay-as-you-go schemes, such as our own SERPS, pose the biggest immediate
problems. Starting them is like a political dream, because modest
contributions paid by many millions of workers can instantly fund pensions
for the retired. It amounts to a free gift from one generation to the
previous one. But strings are attached, because the contributors think that
the contract also guarantees their own pensions. That postdated cheque will
have to be honoured by a future generation which was not consulted and may
be much smaller in size. The required contributions could swell alarmingly.
But cutting back or terminating pay-as-you-go schemes is a nightmare for
politicians.
The dependency ratio, calculated as the ratio of people aged 65 and over to
those aged 15-64, will double to more than 40 per cent in Germany between
now and the year 2030. There is a similar problem in France, where the
prospect of a doubling in pension contribution rates from the current 16 per
cent or so over the next 30 years is causing the political alarm bells to
ring. As for Italy, the unsubsidised pension contribution rates for the main
private and public sector schemes could rise to 45 per cent of pay by 2010.
Obviously this will not happen in practice, but avoiding such disasters will
be messy. Mass immigration might be one answer, and indeed Germany has
already tried it. But it cannot be certain that immigrants will head for
countries with tottering social security systems and help to balance the
books. Within the context of a Single European Market there might be mass
emigration from such states instead, as workers seek a lower tax
environment. Excessive pension promises could destabilise whole economies.
A shift towards funded schemes, such as are common in the UK and the
Netherlands, but not elsewhere in the EC, may provide certain advantages,
such as in providing more capital where savings ratios are low, or in
diversifying risks. This week the French government proposed reforms to
encourage private pension funds.
If confined to domestic investments such funds cannot really solve the
problem of intergenerational transfer. However, it is possible for a
shrinking country to provide for its citizens' old age by investing abroad.
There are historical precedents, for instance a century ago when the UK
steadily built up external assets which by the eve of the first world war
amounted to 140 per cent of GDP (although these investments were not
formalised as pension funds).
But at that time the UK had the British Empire and the US, with their prime
development regions, to invest in; although there are plenty of investment
opportunities around the world today, few appear to offer comparable
political and legal security, of a quality which would be acceptable for
pension funds. You would not want to rely in your old age on an emerging
markets fund. So the idea that EC pension funds could be used to finance the
redevelopment of Eastern Europe, for instance, seems fanciful.
There is, fundamentally, no way in which the masses of future European
pensioners can escape the economic consequences of their own lack of
fertility. As the years go by people will have to retire later and take
part-time jobs to make their small pensions go further. And they had better
be very respectful to their grandchildren.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Docklands: Will it stay a cut-price ghost town? - As tycoons
and banks grapple with recession, big questions remain over major London
office and business developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A CLEAR July day in 1986 Margaret Thatcher, clad in blue with a white
hard hat, took the helm of a crane and swung the last chunk of granite into
place in the core of the Broadgate office complex on the edge of the City of
London. As the champagne flowed and a band played, the two developers -
Godfrey Bradman, slight and intense, and Stuart Lipton, a large,
softly-spoken figure with a passionate interest in architecture - stood
among the watching crowd of bankers, builders and architects.
They listened to the superlatives: the largest building project under way in
London; the fastest and largest single office development in the EC; and the
largest project in the City since the Great Fire of London in 1666.
The project summed up the spirit of the age. The City's deregulated, 24-hour
global trading blazed a trail for the largest surge in building that London
had ever seen. The boom eventually turned to bust. Bradman and Lipton were
among those who suffered heavy losses.
But in 1986, there was not a cloud in the sky. Bradman and Lipton were on
the threshold of one of the most exhilarating periods in the history of the
property market.
Developers became rich, influential and famous. 'I wake up every morning and
thank God I'm not a chartered accountant any longer, but involved with
property,' said Bradman, who made his first fortune by advising other
millionaires how to exploit tax loopholes in the pip-squeaking era of the
1970s. He turned to property after his ingenious schemes were stymied by the
taxman.
Property men, reviled as rapacious philistines in previous development
booms, inspired adulatory articles in the press. Stuart Lipton, who started
as an estate agent at 17, was acknowledged as a genius on architectural and
construction matters, becoming the first developer to be appointed a Royal
Fine Art Commissioner. David Goldstone, a Welsh lawyer and friend of Neil
Kinnock, who revived derelict inner-city council estates and later built
multi-million pound flats overlooking Prince Charles at Kensington Palace,
also caught the eye of the media. As did the articulate Trevor Osborne - the
first entrepreneur of his generation to float his company on the stock
market.
But the loudest fanfares were reserved for Godfrey Bradman, vegetarian,
teetotaller, fervent anti-smoker, chairman of Friends of the Earth,
confidante of the Prince of Wales and a campaigner on every issue from
homelessness to freedom of information. Friends paid tribute to his modesty,
sincerity and philanthropy; the less-friendly accused him of
self-righteousness and intolerance.
He once burned Pounds 10 notes in front of a dithering agent to demonstrate
how much time he was wasting. He sent every MP a plastic foetus when they
were debating the abortion bill.
Bradman and other lesser-known figures seemed unstoppable. Encouraged by
political rhetoric and relaxed planning rules, they redrew the map of
cities, transforming down-at-heel areas and breaking traditional boundaries.
They built higher-quality buildings than before and used more sophisticated
finance. The established property companies, built by an earlier generation
of tycoons, were often made to look like stodgy rent-collectors.
At the outset, the boom was solidly built on the needs of British business.
Retailers wanted shopping centres, high-tech companies wanted to combine
their operations on green field sites and the aggressive new financial
services houses wanted to swap their poky offices for cathedral-like trading
floors with air conditioning and banks of computers.
The drab office slabs that had been thrown up quickly and cheaply in the
1950s and 1960s were loathed by the tenants. Nowhere was this more true than
in the City of London, where rigid planning controls, high rents and ageing
offices reduced the expanding financial services industry to despair.
This disaffection, coupled with the ambitions of property developers, lit
the touchpaper that would lead to the most significant development of the
era.
In February 1985, Dr Michael Von Clemm, chairman of Credit Suisse First
Boston, went to the Isle of Dogs, a watery wasteland two miles east of the
Bank of England, to look for a packaging plant for the Roux Brothers'
restaurant chain. An enterprise zone had been set up in the area to attract
development, under the leadership of Nigel (now Sir Nigel) Broackes,
chairman of Trafalgar House, in Margaret Thatcher's first administration.
From the barge where he was eating lunch, Von Clemm spotted a disused banana
warehouse. Forgetting the Roux Brothers, Von Clemm started to toy with the
idea of converting the warehouse into a back office for Credit Suisse.
After several more visits he consulted Ware Travelstead, a US developer who
advised First Boston on its real estate investments. Ware Travelstead turned
Von Clemm's idea on its head. He knew that the bank had wasted five years in
trying, unsuccessfully, to obtain a new front office location in the City of
London. The real question, he insisted, was: 'Can we consider Canary Wharf
on the Isle of Dogs as a front office location?'
The question was breathtaking in its audacity, suggesting a 180-degree
reversal of London's pattern of development. For generations, any
institution with wealth or influence has gravitated towards the west of
London, while the east has been associated with poverty, dockyards and
sweatshops.
The idea that companies would move their headquarters to the East End was
credible only if London continued to burst its seams. If so, Ware
Travelstead's idea might save London's future as an international business
centre. If, however, demand died to a level which central London could
accommodate, Travelstead's proposal might be seen as one of the biggest
follies in London's history.
London's established landlords had no doubts. For them, Travelstead's idea
seemed an outright attack on the oldest law of property: 'Location,
location, location'. Only an outsider would imagine that businesses would
leave their contacts and favourite watering holes for an untried spot
separated from the heart of London by some of the poorest council estates in
Britain and linked merely by a small light railway.
But there were precedents, of a sort. The project had echoes of La Defense,
the modernist office complex outside the centre of Paris. It was also
reminiscent of the World Financial Centre, the glittering ziggurat built on
reclaimed land south of Wall Street by Olympia &amp; York, the largest property
company in North America, owned by the reclusive Reichmann family.
The parallels between Canary Wharf and the World Financial Centre grabbed
the attention of Paul Reichmann, the chief strategist of O &amp; Y. His company
had a matchless reputation for bold moves, having bought up swathes of
Manhattan when the city was close to bankruptcy in 1977, and having
established the World Financial Centre at a time when New York was in
recession. He felt his company was ready for its boldest move yet.
His opportunity arose when the consortium behind Canary Wharf started to
fall apart. O &amp; Y stepped in. After just a few weeks of round-the-clock
work, it signed the master building agreement for a Pounds 4bn building
project, Europe's largest commercial development.
Margaret Thatcher was rapturous about O &amp; Y's undertaking, seeing it as the
very spirit of enterprise. Her warm admiration for Paul Reichmann was tinged
with gratitude for his injection of new momentum into Docklands, which was
one of the government's key projects.
The Reichmann family was taking a risk that no UK developer was prepared to
take. Yet Paul Reichmann, a principled, pious man, did not look on it as a
gamble. He predicted that London would be the base for US and Far Eastern
companies wanting to expand in Europe, and his research told him that
companies wanted to consolidate their operations under one roof in modern,
prestigious offices. 'We believe that London will be the best office market
in the world over the next ten to 20 years,' he said.
The comment seemed uncontroversial. But even people who agreed with Paul
Reichmann and admired his long-term view wondered whether his company would
be able to reap the rewards. Was any private company strong enough to
reshape an entire city?
Whatever the doubts about O &amp; Y's faith in Docklands, the Canadian company
was not alone in its conviction that businesses needed modern offices. Nor
was it alone in its belief (to which it had more claim than most) that it
was building the best offices in London. Palaces of marble, glass and steel
were erected all around the capital.
Ironically, the developers' faith in their buildings blinded them to the
coming crash. Although they took note of the growing competition, they
thought that the quality of their schemes would see them through. In any
case, the prospect of a downturn was on nobody's mind in the heady years
after 1986. The economy seemed transformed, making the old stop-go cycles a
thing of the past.
What followed was a property boom to end all property booms. What made it
possible was a banking free-for-all. Money, it seemed, could be borrowed by
anyone, from anyone. Deregulation and the reduction of interest rates after
the 1987 stock market crash encouraged banks to pour money into bricks and
mortar. UK property loans doubled to Pounds 40bn in the two years to 1990:
more than three times, in real terms, the peak of 1974.
The property market was a deal-makers' paradise. Anyone with a sharp eye for
the market could make a turn by buying a building and selling it a few
months later. One master of the art was Tony Clegg, a blunt Lancastrian, who
turned Mountleigh into one of the era's go-go stocks before retiring to
breed highland cattle in Yorkshire. Another was Michael Slade, the
high-spirited boss of Helical Bar, who became the second highest-paid man in
Britain when he made Pounds 1.1m in 1987 on the back of a land sale.
It was not to last. Gradually, interest rates rose, demand fell and the
letting boards piled up, particularly in the City and Docklands.
The developers shrugged their shoulders - and were supported by the experts.
'The UK non-residential property industry is in better financial shape than
at any time since the 1960s . . .' said an economist from Barclays Bank in
August 1989.
By autumn 1989, deals had slowed to a trickle. In September, a firm of
chartered surveyors voiced the unthinkable by forecasting falling City
rents. Property share prices tumbled.
The first clear warning of the impending crash came in February 1990 when
Godfrey Bradman sent tremors through the stock market by asking shareholders
for Pounds 125m to shore up Rosehaugh's balance sheet.
But many developers felt that Rosehaugh had no general lessons for the
industry, arguing that the fault could be laid at Bradman's own door for his
over-ambitious expansion. The tensions that had been building between
Bradman and his partner Stuart Lipton rose to a point where the two would
hardly talk to each other.
Confusion mounted when O &amp; Y, the reputed masters of counter-cyclical
investment, bought an 8 per cent stake in Rosehaugh. Paul Reichmann, who had
already bought a third of Stuart Lipton's company, Stanhope, was signalling
a striking vote of confidence in London.
And then the music stopped completely.
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and business confidence, already fragile,
evaporated. Potential tenants and buyers melted away.
The collapse of the market revealed the flimsiness of the emergent property
companies. The new breed of 'merchant developers' depended on sales to pay
their interest bills. The sophisticated financing used by the young
investment companies assumed ever-rising rents.
One by one the mercurial entrepreneurs of the 1980s saw their companies go
under. They included Iain Shearer, a former airline pilot; Berish Berger,
the scion of one of the UK's largest property-owning families; and Irvine
Sellar, an exuberant dealer who had been known as the 'King of Carnaby
Street' in his former career in the rag trade.
Others struggled to keep their heads above water. Trevor Osborne's Speyhawk
announced that it was unable to pay even its preference dividends - a
predicament made worse by the knowledge that he had been just 16 hours from
clinching the sale of his Speyhawk business the previous summer.
Days after Saddam Hussein's invasion, Nordstjernan, the Swedish bidders
pulled out, citing 'the uncertain world political and economic climate.'
Stuart Lipton's Stanhope and Godfrey Bradman's Rosehaugh announced annual
losses of Pounds 77m and Pounds 227m respectively; and Godfrey Bradman
stepped down from chairman to vice-chairman as the company fought for
survival.
Merger talks between them became bogged down, partly because of the
animosity between the two men. O &amp; Y lost more than Pounds 100m on its
investment in the two companies, adding to the problems emerged throughout
its financial empire.
As the downturn deepened, the mood of the property industry turned to
despair and anger. The developers blamed themselves and the banks; most of
all, they blamed the government. The politicians they once lauded were seen
as short-sighted and ignorant for having set off a gold rush they could not
control.
The length and scale of this downturn is unprecedented. Even the property
crash of the early 1970s, with which it shares many similarities, did not
produce so much empty space. The property companies and their banks are in
unchartered territory, grappling with awesome, unanswered questions.
Will the empty buildings find tenants? Or will the worst-hit areas, such as
the City of London, where nearly one in five buildings is empty, remain
glutted for the rest of the century?
Will this oversupply and the flagging economy force rents to continue to
plummet? If so, it will further undermine the value of commercial property
across Britain, which has already lost some Pounds 70bn, more than a quarter
of its value.
Will the banks continue to support the UK property industry? A handful of
impatient lenders could bring down scores of over-borrowed companies and
flood the market with property.
And what of Docklands, the embodiment of laissez-faire policies, with its
millions of square feet of empty offices, served by an erratic Toy Town
railway? Possibly, it will succeed in becoming London's third business
centre, so breaking the stranglehold of the established landlords and
forever ridding London of the vested interests that made it the most
expensive capital in Europe.
But it is also possible that its disastrous launch has tarnished its
reputation for good. Far from being a prestigious rival to central London,
Docklands may evolve as a cut-price location for clerks and computer
facilities, more akin to Croydon than the City.
The sheer number of empty buildings could well mean that some will not
attract tenants at any price. For years to come, Docklands may remain a
half-empty ghost town - a monument to the hubris of the 1980s.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Russia threatens to halt interest payments on debt
</HEADLINE>

RUSSIA shocked western bankers yesterday when it announced that it wanted a
deferral of interest payments on Dollars 84bn (Pounds 46bn) of debt owed by
the former Soviet Union to commercial banks and western governments.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian central bank, said Russia would
seek the deferral when it met a steering committee representing commercial
banks in Frankfurt on Tuesday.
The committee, chaired by Mr Christian Vonz of Germany's Deutsche Bank, has
calculated that the Commonwealth of Independent States would have to find
Dollars 6bn in order to pay debt commitments from the beginning of December
1991 to the end of March. 'They would need to find Dollars 18bn for the
whole of 1992,' a banker added.
The commonwealth groups 11 of the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union.
Russia has assumed responsibility for most former Soviet debt.
A committee member said he was disappointed that Mr Matiukhin should have
aired the matter in public before talking to the committee. 'The
commonwealth has said nothing to us directly on deferring interest
payments,' he added.
Bankers are unlikely to agree to a formal moratorium on interest payments.
'That would be highly unusual,' a banker said. However, in practice banks
may have no choice.
A German banker said he was surprised at the threat to suspend interest
payments, given that only last week the commonwealth reached an agreement
with 17 creditor nations to suspend principal payments on official debt.
'There was no suggestion then of a problem on interest payments,' he said.
Mr Matiukhin said that, if foreign banks and governments did not understand
the Russian position, it would have to 'declare our Vnesheconombank
bankrupt'. The former Soviet foreign trade bank has been taken over by
Russia.
His comments underscore the gravity of the situation confronting Russian
authorities, struggling to stabilise finances in the face of falling
revenues, trade and currency wars between the republics and rising
inflation.
German banks have the biggest exposure to former Soviet debt. They are owed
more than Dollars 20bn, although only an estimated Dollars 5bn is uninsured
against loss by official agencies. The Bank of England calculates that UK
clearing banks and Moscow Narodny Bank - based in London but owned by the
commonwealth - are owed Dollars 3.5bn, of which Dollars 3bn is insured by
the UK Export Credits Guarantee Department.

FT  11 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking as the account closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency uncertainties continued to unsettle the UK equity market in a
volatile session yesterday. The continued firmness in the US dollar failed
to protect blue chip internationals from profit-taking as the equity market
trading account came to its end.
Share prices were marked sharply higher at first but the early gain of 20
points on the Footsie had been converted into a 20 point loss by the close,
when the downturn was intensified by selling in the stock index futures
market.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,477.9, a shade above the low
of the day. The Index retained a gain of around 2.4 per cent over the two
week account which has seen UK equities encouraged by Wall Street but
concerned by the pound's slide to its lowest permitted level in the ERM
range. Yesterday, the UK Foreign Secretary firmly reiterated the
government's rejection of any sterling devaluation intentions.
Equities opened strongly yesterday morning, with marketmakers taking the
view that the internationally-orientated stocks would continue to respond tp
the dollar's overnight strength. General optimism, as well as the FT-SE
Index itself, received a further boost from hints from other European
markets that Allied-Lyons, the brewery and food group, was about to attract
the long-predicted bid from North America.
Headed by a substantial gain in Allied, shares opened higher across the
broad range of the market. But, as so often in current trading, it was when
the stock index futures opened that the real boost was delivered to
equities. A premium of more than 50 points, later more than 60, on the March
contract on the Footsie, was quickly reflected in a 20.4 advance on the
underlying Index.
These gains were too attractive to leave alone, and sellers soon appeared
both in the futures and the underlying stocks. By mid-session, the stock
market was edging below overnight levels and selling increased after the US
bond market fell following the announcement of the latest US employment
figures.
Somewhat mixed views on the US jobs data brought an uncertain tone opening
on Wall Street which was 17 points down in UK trading hours. Profit-taking
increased in London and in the absence of buyers for the new account, the
stock market ended flat.
Equities were not helped by a gloomy day in the government bond market,
where prices quickly extended early losses as first reports from the US
fixed interest market appeared on the dealing screens. Long-dated British
bonds ended with losses ranging to  3/4 of a point.
Retail, or customer, business in equities, having fallen to very low levels
over Christmas, has shown some improvement this week.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Appointments: New finance directors for Asda and D&amp;N
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Archie Norman, the 37-year-old chief executive of troubled retailer Asda,
has made a quick move since his arrival in early December with the
appointment of a new finance director.
Ron Scott, who has been in the post since 1988, was closely identified with
recent mishaps including the financing of the purchase of the Gateway
superstores in 1989 which left the company heavily debt-laden as interest
rates soared. Scott, 42, leaves at the end of March, but not before he has
to present what city analysts expect to be dismal interim results for the
six months ending October 1991 next Wednesday.
His replacement, 41-year-old Phil Cox, knows something about troubled
businesses after nearly two years as chief executive of the now much
diminished recruitment and financial services company Burns-Anderson. He
left last October after completing his task of disposing of most of the
financial services operations. Hitherto his experience had been in retailing
 -though not food - most recently as finance director of Horne Brothers
before it was acquired by Sears.
Asda's share price drop of 4p to 28 1/2 p yesterday was attributed to
nervousness ahead of Wednesday's interim.
Meanwhile, Tim Redburn, who helped turn round the troubled Hoverspeed
cross-channel hovercraft operator in the mid-1980s, has been appointed
finance director of Davies &amp; Newman, parent of the UK's Dan-Air which was
rescued from the brink of bankruptcy last year.
Redburn, 38, is the first of a number of external appointments made to
strengthen the Davies &amp; Newman board. Wilf Jones, the previous finance
director, quit at the end of 1990 following the arrival of David James, the
company doctor. In the interim the job has been undertaken by Ronald Series,
one of David James' team.
Later this year James is expected to step down as chairman and hand over the
management to a chief executive yet to be appointed.
Although Davies &amp; Newman is between three and four times as big as
Hoverspeed, Redburn says there are 'lots of similarities between the two
businesses'.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Appointments: The arts in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago the then secretary and head of information at BBC Scotland
was in the thick of it. Fellow Scot Alasdair Milne had just been fired as
BBC director general and the police had raided BBC Glasgow to take away
tapes of the Secret Society television series. Now John McCormick (above
left) is about to take over as Controller of BBC Scotland. He has
demonstrated his sure political touch; but he still faces considerable
challenges.
The general election campaign could be particularly bitter in Scotland,
especially in the wake of British Steel's decision to close Ravenscraig;
McCormick will also somehow have to reconcile the growing swell in favour of
devolution with the needs of the rather centralised BBC bureaucracy.
Another challenge is to increase the audience for Radio Scotland, the local
equivalent of Radio 4, which gets between 10 and 13 per cent of the Scottish
audience. 'I am looking forward to leading BBC Scotland through this
challenging period,' is how he puts it.
At least in the battle for his share of the Corporation's scarce resources,
the Ayrshire-born executive starts with an enormous advantage. As the
secretary of the BBC in London for the past four years, he has an intimate
knowledge of all the Corporation's secrets.
Bill Brown, chairman of Scottish Television, is to become chairman of the
Scottish Arts Council from April 1. He succeeds Professor Sir Alan Peacock,
the economist, in the unpaid, part-time post.
Brown, 62, was managing director of Scottish Television for 24 years to 1990
where he was considered an astute businessman. He then handed over to Gus
Macdonald who achieved a coup last year by winning renewal of the franchise
with a bid to the Independent Television Commission of only Pounds 2,000.
The Scottish Arts Council is an offshoot of the Arts Council of Great
Britain but has considerable autonomy, with most decisions being taken in
Scotland by the council - which Brown will chair. He will benefit from an
unusually generous 13.7 per cent boost in next year's Arts Council spending,
taking the budget to Pounds 22m. But he will have to wrestle with the
financial problems of institutions such as Scottish Opera and the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra.
Brown, who lives in Glasgow, has been on the boards of Scottish Opera and of
the orchestra and is a trustee of the National Museums of Scotland. He is
chairman of Scottish Amicable Life Assurance and a director of Sunrise
Television.

FT  11 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was a heavy trading session in stock index futures yesterday, in part
because marketmakers read the trend incorrectly at the opening.
The overnight strength of the dollar, together with an initial spurt of
demand for Allied-Lyons, induced a mark-up in the March contract on the
Footsie, which showed a premium of 54 points before trading had properly
started. Speculative buying pushed the premium to 65 points, against a fair
value premium, allowing for dividend and financing costs, of only 29 points
or so.
Then, as the Allied situation calmed down and share investors took profits
ahead of the close of the equity account, locals in the stock index futures
sector sold March heavily, bringing in the premium to 35-40 points by the
official close; later trading saw March under further pressure.
Traded options were relatively quiet, with total turnover of 24,779 compared
with 32,857. Allied-Lyons topped the active list, with 4,389 lots dealt, as
hints circulated of an impending bid from the US. Option trading was
inhibited by refusal of several leading firms to register as marketmakers in
individual stock options when the market moves to new premises at the
beginning of February.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates stay soft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England again moved early to cap any potential pressure for
higher UK money market interest rates yesterday, in the face of a
substantial liquidity shortage and sterling's continued weakness on the
foreign exchange markets, writes Simon London.
The bank forecast a Pounds 1.8bn liquidity shortage in early morning, later
revised up to Pounds 2bn. The main factor squeezing liquidity was the expiry
of existing repurchase agreements totalling nearly Pounds 900m.
However, following the pattern set on Thursday, the Bank of England relieved
almost all of the shortage with early assistance. The Bank injected Pounds
1.78bn in total, purchasing Pounds 1.312bn paper outright. This comprised
purchases of band 1 and band 2 bank bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent.
In addition, the bank purchased Pounds 468m for resale to the market at 10
7/16 per cent in equal amounts on January 27 and 28.
This early round of assistance immediately took the steam out of pressure
for higher rates. The unsecured overnight money rate fell to below 9 per
cent in the morning session, from 10 - 9 3/4 per cent on Thursday, and the
Bank did not inject additional liquidity in late morning.
In the afternoon session the Bank injected a further Pounds 50m by
purchasing band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds
35m bought the total liquidity injection for the day at Pounds 1.865bn or
Pounds 135m below the forecast funds shortage for the day.
By the close, overnight money was trading at 10 3/4 -  1/2 per cent;
one-month interbank money at 10 -  5/8 per cent; and three-month interbank
money at 10 5/8 -  1/2 per cent, the same level as Thursday.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange traded up to 89.54 during the day but fell back
to close at 89.46, 5 points lower than the close on Thursday. This level
implies base lending rates of 10.54 per cent by the spring, compared to a
current level of 10.5 per cent.
In Frankfurt, call money was steady at 9.40/50 per cent, unchanged from
Thursday, despite the strong rally in bond yields at the longer maturities.
Bond yields fell and the D-Mark weakened on the foreign exchange markets on
expectations that German interests may fall sooner than expected.

FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bull weighs up IBM, H-P offers
for partnership
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE Bull, the loss-making French computer maker, is in the final stage of
choosing between rival offers from IBM and Hewlett-Packard (H-P), the US
computer companies, for a technology and equity investment partnership.
Both potential partners have laid their offers before Bull's management and
the government controlled computer company is now reflecting which one it
should propose for acceptance to the state.
The main ministries involved - finance and industry - will meet next week to
weigh up the offers. As a mark of the great strategic importance of the
choice, the final decision is to be made Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime
minister, with President Francois Mitterrand, say observers close to the
negotiations.
The government wants to promote Bull as an independent partner of both the
world's main technology powers, the US and Japan, reminiscent of the
Gaullist view of how France should balance its defence and foreign policy
between and independently of the superpowers, officials said.
NEC, the Japanese electronics group last year took a 4.7 per cent stake in
Bull and the US partner is likely to take a stake of the same order or
slightly more.
This is the second phase of the reorganisation of the state's high
technology industries, following the plans for a merger of Thomson's civil
electronics businesses with CEA Industry, a nuclear fuel and reactor making
group, unveiled last month.
Bull, which lost a record FFr6.8bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in 1990 and is likely to
record a smaller deficit for 1991, has been seeking a partner since the end
of last year to gain better access to so-called reduced instruction set
computing ' technology, which allows microprocessors to execute instructions
faster.
Bull also needs capital, since its access to state cash is being hampered by
the European Commission's inquiry into FFr4bn worth of government capital
injections, while France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications
operator, has also refused to increase its 17 per cent stake in Bull.
Mr Pierre Barazer, chairman of IBM France, presented his group's case to the
government two weeks ago, followed early this week by Mr John Young,
chairman of H-P. An alliance with Bull, the world's tenth computer maker,
would help both US companies enlarge European market share for their latest
technologies.

with Liaz

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-Benz, the vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, yesterday continued
the wave of German investment in Czechoslovakia, announcing its second truck
production deal in a week.
The German company yesterday signed a letter of intent in Prague with Liaz,
the Czech heavy truck manufacturer, on future co-operation. This follows the
deal signed on Monday between Mercedes and Avia covering light truck
production.
Mercedes, the market leader in Europe and the world's biggest maker of
trucks above six tonnes, said it will form a production network with the two
Czech companies to make vans and trucks. Its total investment in the venture
will be around DM350m (Dollars 233.3m) over five years.
Czech officials said Mercedes would have 31 per cent of the three-way
venture, Avia 49 per cent and Liaz 20 per cent. No figure was given for the
cost of Mercedes' stake. Avia and Liaz will contribute land and production
equipment to the project.
The Mercedes deal is further proof of the success enjoyed by German
companies in forging new investment links with Czechoslovakia. Volkswagen,
the motor manufacturer, is involved with the Skoda car concern, while
Siemens is taking control of both the energy and transport divisions of
Skoda, Pilsen.
Mercedes was not the only company interested in Avia and Liaz. Renault of
France also held talks over Avia, while Iveco (the truck subsidiary of
Italy's Fiat) and Volvo of Sweden were interested in Liaz.
The Mercedes venture is still subject to Czechoslovak government approval.
Mr Jan Vrba, the Czech regional industry minister has criticised the deal,
his objections reportedly centred on tax and trade concessions requested by
Mercedes.
The sites involved in the venture are Letnany, the Prague suburb where
Avia's most profitable plant is located and Jablonec, where Liaz has its
main plant employing nearly 2,000 people.
Mr Horst Zimmer, a director of Mercedes-Benz, said the partners in the
venture wanted to capitalise on the opportunities offered by the east
European market and raise the value of production in Czechoslovakia as
quickly as possible.
The truck models to be produced at the sites will range from vans and light
trucks to medium-sized vehicles and trucks over 10 tonnes.

<TEXT>
BORDEN, the packaging, adhesives and foods group, yesterday announced plans
to cut around 1,300 jobs as part of a corporate reorganisation designed to
pare costs. This will result in the fourth quarter charge of around Dollars
70m before tax.
Borden said that, after the provision, it expected 1991 after-tax earnings
to stand at around Dollars 295m or Dollars 2 a share.
The main impact of the reorganisation will come in Borden's US dairy, food
services and Pacific Rim businesses, the company said. At end-1991,
according to Borden, there were some 15,000 salaried employees among a
worldwide total of 44,000.
Borden's brands range from Creamette pastas to Bravos chips and from Eagle
Brand ice-cream to Elmer's glues and wood-fillers.
It began a major plant modernisation programme in 1989, but efficiencies
have been slow to show through, and there has been competitive pressure in
certain product areas - such as snack foods.

BERLIN Handels-und Frankfurter Bank, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, is
spending Kcs1.4bn (Dollars 50m) to buy a 40 per cent stake in Zivnovstenska
Bank, Czechoslovakia's oldest bank.
This is the first time a Czech bank has been privatised with the help of
foreign capital. A further 12 per cent stake is being sold to International
Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the Washington-based World Bank and the
remaining 48 per cent of the shares in the bank will be offered to the
general public, probably by early summer.
Zivnovstenska, founded in 1868, has two branches outside Prague - one in the
Czech city of Brunn and another in London. The bank has 450 employees and at
the end of last year its balance sheet total amounted to Kcs18bn.
BHF - already active in Czechslovakia as an adviser on privatisations and
provider of project finance - said with its help Zivnovstenska would be able
to develop a full range of merchant banking services, including trade
finance and operations in Czechoslovakia's as yet undeveloped securities and
money markets.
BHF said the investment was a sign of its confidence in the development of
the Czech economy.

CORPORACION Nacional de Leasing, the Spanish investment company controlled
by the Barcelona financier, Mr Javier de la Rosa, has paid around Dollars
30m for a 10 per cent stake in one of Spain's most profitable regional
banks, the Banco de Ibiza.
The CNL purchase marks another step in Mr de la Rosa's evolution as one of
Spain's most powerful individual investors. Until recently, Mr de la Rosa
was best known as the Spanish partner of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO).
Under his guidance, the Kuwaitis built up one of the biggest private sector
industrial and food groups in Spain.
In the past two years, however, he has begun to expand his business empire,
while retaining a key stake in KIO's Spanish operations.
He bid for, and won, 30 per cent of CNL on the stock market last year,
before selling the bank's leasing portfolio to a domestic bank. Earlier this
week he announced he intended to merge CNL with his other investment
vehicle, Tibidabo.
Banco de Ibiza owns half, along with the Instituto San Paolo de Torino of
Italy, of a Catalan bank, Banca Catala.
Banco de Ibiza reported first-half pre-tax profits of Pta801m (Dollars 8.1m)
last year.

FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: Car investment to exceed DM6bn
this year - The company's plans for expansion as it faces growing cost
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of
Germany, is planning to assemble cars in Mexico from mid-1993.
The company will also begin production at its new DM1.4bn (Dollars 933m)
assembly plant at Rastatt, Germany in March with the aim of increasing total
car production capacity to around 620,000 by the mid-1990s. Sales peaked in
1986 at 597,000.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, head of the Mercedes-Benz car division, said investment
in the car operations would rise to more than DM6bn this year from DM5.3bn
in 1991, of which some DM4bn would be capital investment and DM2bn would be
spent on research and development for new products.
The company is planning to launch a new generation 190 range, its smallest
car, in 1993, followed by the renewal of the mid-range 200/300 series at the
end of 1994.
Last year it launched its new top-of-the-range S-Class luxury car and this
week unveiled the S-Class coupe in Detroit, the first time a major product
line for world markets has been unveiled in the US.
Output of the coupe is planned to reach 6,000 to 8,000 a year, while S-Class
saloon production should reach full capacity of 370 a day or 80,000 a year
with full order books for the next 12 months.
Mr Hubbert acknowledged that Mercedes-Benz was facing increasingly stiff
cost competition, chiefly from Japanese car makers such as Toyota and Nissan
with their Lexus and Infiniti luxury car ranges.
He said that the Mercedes-Benz car division was intensifying its
cost-cutting campaign with the aim of reducing its 1991/92 cost base by
DM4bn by the mid-1990s. He said the company's costs had to be reduced by
20-30 per cent to become competitive with its Japanese rivals.
Mr Hubbert said the car operations in future would adhere only 'in
principle' to the concept 'made in Germany'. The company was 'quite open on
all questions of production location.'
Mercedes-Benz cars are already assembled in South Africa, Indonesia and
Thailand and small volume assembly will begin in Mexico next year.
Mr Hubbert said it was planned to produce 500-1,000 a year of its mid-range
200-300 series cars in Mexico with an investment of DM20m. Cars could be
exported to South America from Mexico, but the US market would be
exclusively supplied from Germany.
Production at the DM1.4bn Rastatt assembly plant in Germany would eventually
rise to 300 cars a day or 70-80,000 a year.
The initial DM500m phase to build a new assembly line for the mid-range
200/300 series has been completed and this will be followed in later stages
by the addition of paint shop and body welding operations.
Mr Hubbert said the Rastatt operations would be a model for the extensive
modernisation of Mercedes-Benz's other plants with a new type of work
organisation including flexible production stations.
Mercedes-Benz car sales worldwide fell slightly last year to 558,000 from
561,901 in 1990, with big falls in the US and in the UK compensated by
increases in Germany and Italy.
Mr Hubbert added the company was aiming to achieve sales of some 560,000 in
1992.
Sales in Germany rose by 7 per cent to 271,000, accounting for 48.5 per cent
of total Mercedes-Benz sales, while its foreign sales declined by 7 per cent
to 287,000.
Mercedes-Benz car sales in the US, its most important foreign market,
dropped by 24.9 per cent to 58,868 last year from 78,375 in 1990 and a peak
of just under 100,000 in 1986. The company blamed half of last year's fall
on the luxury tax introduced at the beginning of 1991.
The turnover of the Mercedes-Benz division rose by 13.7 per cent last year
to DM68bn from DM59.8bn a year earlier. Turnover of the car operations rose
to DM40bn from DM35.5bn, while commercial vehicles turnover rose to DM28bn
from DM24.3bn.

DUTCH photocopier maker Oce Van der Grinten expects 1991 net profits of
about Fl 101m (Dollars 32.5m), compared with Fl 85.7m in 1990.
Turnover last year rose 11 per cent to Fl 2.6bn, according to chairman Mr
Harry Pennings, Reuter reports from Venlo.
Previously, the company had said that it saw higher profits and turnover for
1991, but it had not specified any of the figures.
Mr Pennings said that both Oce's drawing room and office equipment divisions
contributed to the profit rise last year, while cost cutting improved
efficiency.
The same factors made Oce positive about its 1992 results, Mr Pennings
added.
Oce will publish its full 1991 results on February 18.

hotel plan

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the real estate developer owned by Toronto's Reichmann
family, has shelved plans to build a 60-storey office and hotel complex in
central Moscow.
The decision is in keeping with a more cautious approach by O&amp;Y in the past
year or two. The Reichmanns made their name in the 1970s and early 1980s by
buying when many others were selling, but they now have their hands full
with a heavy commitment to Canary Wharf in London and the severe downturn in
the North American real estate market.
O&amp;Y said the Moscow development was being deferred 'until the political and
economic environment is more predictable.' The company said it remained
confident that a strong market still existed for North American-style office
and residential development.
The building, with a projected cost of CDollars 250m (USDollars 219.2m),
would have been the tallest in Moscow.
O&amp;Y said, however, that it was pressing ahead with a 450,000 sq ft head
office building for the Hungarian Credit Bank (HCB) in Budapest. It has
called for tenders for the CDollars 100m project, which will include an
underground parking garage, a rarity in eastern Europe. The building will
also serve as O&amp;Y's eastern Europe headquarters.
HCB will have a 50 per cent stake in the 12-storey complex, which will be
located on a central square opposite the National Bank of Hungary. The rest
of the equity will be shared between O&amp;Y and First Hungary Fund, a North
American venture-capital partnership.
With the exception of three small projects in Canada, O&amp;Y has not built in
North America since 1985. It has put off redeveloping a building on Park
Avenue in New York until it finds a substantial tenant and is expected to
wait several years before exercising a right to build the first of three
office buildings for the Yerba Buena project in San Francisco.
The Reichmanns are also actively looking for equity partners in their
projects. According to Mr John Zuccotti, president of Olympia &amp; York USA,
'We're talking to people who are not heavily into real estate and are keen
on getting in.'
Mr Li Kashing, the Hong Kong magnate, agreed last autumn to help refinance
an O&amp;Y building in New York's financial district in exchange for a 49 per
cent equity stake in the project.

Pay-outs on 25-year endowments, which are particularly important as they are

The news followed cuts in equivalent policies of 5 per cent by Norwich
Union, the mutual insurer and 4.9 per cent by Guardian Royal Exchange.
However, CU is not alone in raising pay-outs, as General Accident Life
raised the pay-out on its 25-year policy by 3.4 per cent.

essential refinancing
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN DARBY, chairman of National Home Loans Holdings, yesterday told
shareholders at the company's annual general meeting that he was stepping
down.
At the same time he warned shareholders that refinancing, either via a third
party or a rights issue, would eventually be necessary.
His remarks appeared to confirm the view of some analysts that NHL intends
to seek cash from its shareholders once negotiations with a new backer are
completed.
No replacement has yet been named for Mr Darby, a non-executive chairman who
has headed NHL since it was set up in 1985. His decision follows a
disastrous year for the company in which it plunged to losses of Pounds
47.9m after making bad debt provisions of Pounds 88.7m.
In October, Mr Darby also resigned as chairman of Ultramar, the oil and gas
company, a month before it fell to a hostile bid from Lasmo.
NHL said yesterday that Mr Darby, chairman of Arthur Young, the accountants,
for more than a decade, would not receive any compensation. When he left
Ultramar, Mr Darby received a pay-off of Pounds 680,000.
News of the resignation was announced at a meeting in which small
shareholders challenged the board to account for NHL's misfortunes this
year.
One investor said that he and his wife owned 1.5m NHL shares between them.
He pointed out that in little more than two months, the company's estimate
of necessary provisions had jumped from Pounds 16m to Pounds 88.7m and he
asked whether the increase had been suggested by the auditors.
Mr Darby told shareholders that the company's cash flow was still positive,
though unpaid interest had to be taken into account. The rest of the board
will continue in place.

FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: KPMG resigns as Manchester Ship auditor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has resigned as auditor to the
Manchester Ship Canal after it was issued with a writ for more than Pounds
1m in damages related to tax advice given to the company.
Both KPMG and MSC stressed yesterday that the resignation was to prevent a
conflict of interest as a result of the legal action against the firm's tax
department and had nothing to do with its audit.
But the action leaves the company with little time to appoint a replacement
firm and complete the audit within the legal time limit at the end of
February.
MSC claims that in 1988 KPMG's tax consultants said it was eligible to
receive more than Pounds 8m in tax relief concurrent with the construction
of a building in the Trafford Park enterprise zone in Manchester.
In fact, it could only receive this sum over several years, and it says that
the delayed payment has cost it more than Pounds 1m.
However, KPMG said last night that it would strongly contest the legal
action.
MSC warned KPMG of possible action last April, and issued a writ in October.
The firm hinted that it might resign on December 13 to prevent any
compromise of the audit, and did so on Christmas Eve.
MSC is one of the few companies constituted under the 1845 Companies Clauses
Consolidation Act, rather than the Companies Act. It is obliged to hold its
annual general meeting within two months from its year end of December 31,
and any change of auditors - who must be appointed individually rather than
as a firm - needs to be approved by the shareholders.
The company is convening an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on
January 29 to recommend the appointment of two partners in the Manchester
office of Robson Rhodes as replacement auditors.
The annual meeting is already scheduled for February 27, and shareholders
must receive the accounts at least two weeks before that date.

Shares in Oliver Group, the footwear and leather goods retailer, plunged 17p
to 68p yesterday after the company warned of losses totalling Pounds 12m in
1991 and said that no final dividend would be paid.
The deficit compares with Pounds 2.68m profits in 1990, which had turned
into larger than expected losses of Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 1.37m) at the
halfway stage last June. The interim dividend however, was in effect
unchanged at 0.71p after adjusting for a scrip issue and last year's total
payment was equivalent to 3.88p.
Yesterday's forecast losses included a Pounds 0.5m deficit on the sale of
properties and exceptional charges of Pounds 5.5m from the writedown of
certain fixed assets and other rationalisation and reorganisation costs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPE GROUP, the USM-quoted jeans designer and distributor, said the
recession had caused a significant move by customers towards cheaper brands,
particularly in the UK, writes Andrew Bolger.
Pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent, from Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3.09m, in
the six months to September 29, in spite of a slight increase in sales from
Pounds 81.3m to Pounds 82m.
Mr Arun Shah, chairman, said the year started positively butconditions had
become progressively more difficult. Consumer markets remained weak, and
competition intensified.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 166,000) was incurred from
the rationalisation of the group's French subsidiary, Buffalo, and UK
operations. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 499,000 were made to cover the
closure of the Norwegian operation.
Mr Shah said despite a difficult trading environment, overseas growth had
continued and such sales now accounted for 80 per cent of turnover, up from
75 per cent.
Turnover in the US and Spain rose by more than 100 per cent and 70 per cent
respectively, and profits also showed strong growth. Results in Germany were
below expectations.
Earnings per share fell from 7.8p to 6.2p and the interim dividend is cut
from 2.5p to 2p. The decision on the final will be taken in the light of the
year's results, and the decrease should not be seen as an indication of
future dividend levels.
Overall stock levels had been reduced by 20 per cent over the past year. The
balance sheet was strengthened by aPounds 9.4m convertible preference share
issue in July, although the interest costs benefits would not be seen until
the second half. The interest charge in the first half rose from Pounds
2.42m to Pounds 2.51m. Gearing was down from 90 per cent to 45 per cent.
Trade debtors - despite slower collections as a result of weak markets  -
were also well under control.

for Dollars 37.5m

<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the healthcare company, yesterday settled a long-running
legal dispute with a Californian company for a fraction of the Dollars 96.2m
(Pounds 52.8m) awarded against it by US courts.
The settlement is for Dollars 37.5m, resulting in a net after-tax cost to
S&amp;N of Pounds 14m.
'This removes a big uncertainty for investors and a waste of time for
management,' said Mr John Robinson, S&amp;N's chief executive.
S&amp;N was ordered in May 1990 to pay a Dollars 96.2m damages award to Polteco,
a research and development company. Polteco had claimed that S&amp;N had
misappropriated technical know-how on materials used in artificial joints.
S&amp;N appealed against the award.
Yesterday's settlement will be treated as an extraordinary item in S&amp;N's
1991 accounts.
Mr Mark Brewer at broker Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'Gearing at the end of
1991 was 30 per cent.' He estimated that if S&amp;N had been made to pay the
Dollars 96.2m then it would have risen to 40 per cent.
S&amp;N shares rose 1 3/4 p to 143p, their highest level for more than two
years. This built on the 5p gain made on Thursday following the accidental
mailing of the information on the legal settlement to the City of London
office of Banque Paribas.
'The press release came from the distribution arm of our public relations
consultant,' said Mr Robinson. 'We are still checking the causes.'
The company was forced to say on Thursday afternoon that a settlement had
not yet been reached.
The dispute had its origin in 1987, when Smith &amp; Nephew Richards, S&amp;N's US
subsidiary, signed a Dollars 140,000 agreement with Polteco to research and
develop a longer-lasting material for use on the surfaces of its implant
components.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACDONALD Publishing, the Maxwell Communication Corporation's loss-making UK
publishing operation, was yesterday placed into administration by the High
Court.
The company, which publishes the novels of Catherine Cookson and the Noddy
books of Enid Blyton, owed its parent company MCC, itself in administration,
Pounds 33m.
The flow of financial support from MCC has been drying up and there were
fears that third party creditors would seek petitions to wind up the
company.
A considerable number of significant publishing groups are interested in
buying Macdonald.
Mr Anthony Lomas, an administrator from Price Waterhouse said yesterday: 'I
have got a lot of interest from big players. There is real interest being
expressed either for the whole of the business or parts of the business.'
Mr Lomas said the potential purchasers included Simon &amp; Schuster, Headline
and Orion Books. Orion is the new company set up by Mr Anthony Cheetham who
was forced out of Random House in November. The company has already taken
over Weidenfeld.
The administrator began talking to possible buyers last night and will be
seeking competitive bids either for the whole business or the constituent
parts.
For the time being Macdonald will continue operating as normally as
possible, although it is unlikely that authors would be interested in
signing new contracts at the moment.
'I have some money to oil the wheels and there is enough to fund the company
at least until the end of the month,' said Mr Lomas before going off to
address both the Macdonald staff and directors.
The publishing company is estimated to have been making losses of more than
Pounds 1m on sales of more than Pounds 20m. Macdonald publishes across a

FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: 'Mischievous' to suggest headhunter conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM L GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted'' (January 7),
seems to be special pleading on behalf of the occupational psychologists. It
also denigrates the work done by the many reputable executive search
consultancies which provide a service that is much valued, I can assure you,
by their clients.
Headhunters normally operate at the most senior levels where it is essential
that track record is firmly established. This can be best done by interviews
and market research conducted by experienced interviewers - which is the
technical and judgmental skill which headhunters provide. I think that
nearly all the very senior top managers would resent an occupational
psychological test. They are head-hunted on the basis of their reputations
and their indisputable records.
Of course, as you go lower down the scale, psychological testing has its
place and this is why all headhunters do use psychological tests for those
whose records are less clearly established. You acknowledge that 40 per cent
of head-hunters employ psychological tests.
Surely a more balanced approach is to say that there are proper places for
both the interview and market research techniques employed by skilled
headhunters, as well as the support facility provided by professional
occupational psychologists. This would certainly be our view.
I think it is mischievous of you to suggest that there is a conflict between
the two techniques. They are mutually supporting.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: The link between constitutional reform and Britain's
economic performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY BARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I felt your leader on the honours systems ('An honourable case for
change', December 30) was excellent - excellent, that is, with the exception
of its concluding paragraph, which begins: 'Constitutional reform is not
going to add percentage points to the British growth rate.'
Is Britain's business and financial community really so feeble-minded that
it thinks there is no relation between the country's system of government
and its economic performance?
Just take, for example, the honours system you justly scorn. To paraphrase
it for the sake of those who missed it over the new year, your editorial
argues three things:
First, that the absurd categories and mass of honours should be pruned
drastically; second, as well as being comprehensible, awards should also be
reserved only for those who clearly deserve them. Third, and most important,
'handles would have to go'. Changing people's names and mode of address is
anachronistic, snobbish and open to abuse, made all the worse, your
editorial argues, by the actual powers and influence of the House of Lords.
This is a powerful argument, cogently put. It is bizarre, therefore, that
you should fail to carry it through to its conclusion.
Just imagine a large company that gives special names to some staff and
invests others with life-long influence until they die and does so by means
of a secret committee. Imagine that style, school ties, Oxbridge connections
and connivance all play a part in this. Imagine that while the accountants
get lots of these perks, those who run the warehouse or oversee production
get far fewer and resent it, and have no means to express their resentment
except by 'going slow'.
Yes, you are imagining the civil service. Once, perhaps, it ran well. But
today, when people want to be treated like citizens, when information
technology demands proper training and skills, it is obvious that such a
system - which threatens people's dignity - will lower morale, productivity,
competitiveness and profits.
If no contemporary company could expect to conduct itself according to the
honours system without losing out, is it so difficult to see that a country
that does, also loses out? Anthony Barnett,

FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: Scotland: a fitter engineering industry and
Ravenscraig as an asset in an independent nation (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK KANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Buxton characterises my thinking about Ravenscraig as 'muddled
and romantic' ('Tory prospects in tatters', January 9). There would be no
muddle about the retention of Ravenscraig as a national asset if Scotland
were an independent EC member state - a high-polling voter preference among
Scots strangely absent from Mr Buxton's political assessment.
Your editorial of the same day ('Raven croaks at Motherwell') laments other
European nations' 'subventions' of their indigenous steel industries.
Perhaps the Twelve's lack of 'political will' to depoliticise competition
policy reveals the enduring character of the Community as a confederation of
national economic interests progressively pooled, rather than the abstract
supranational free-market so desired by City Europhiles. It is this
continuing influence of member states in European policy that a politics of
Scottish independence recognises, and which underlies the Scottish National
Party's argument for nationalisation of the steel industry as vital to
national interest in manufacturing.
There is no 'romance' either about the clear market opportunities for a
Scottish steel industry in North Sea oil fabrication over the next 'boom'
decade - a market factor which would also not escape 'politicisation' in the
event of a territorially-constituted Scottish state sovereignty, willing to
present oil and steel to the EC as essential Scottish interests. Patrick

<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD JORDAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was delighted to read in Peter Norman's Economics Notebook (January
6) that Scotland was providing a ray of hope in the economic gloom pervading
the rest of the UK.
My delight came not only from the information but also because someone else
had confirmed what we at Scottish Engineering have been saying for some
time. In the FT on December 17, your correspondent, James Buxton, reported
the optimistic findings of our December Quarterly Review.
I have been saying for some time that the engineering industry in Scotland
is better prepared for this latest recession having, as you explained, gone
through a painful restructuring in the early and mid-1980s. Scottish
companies went into this latest recession leaner and fitter than many of
their English counterparts, and the benefits are now being felt.
Peter Norman's prediction that Scotland will sustain its improvement in
confidence and continue to attract successful businesses is heartening and,
hopefully, correct.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN V C BUTCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Observer wonders ('Thursday puzzle', January 6) why every general
election in the UK is held on a Thursday.
Surely the reason is that, should it result in a change of government, the
new prime minister can go to Buckingham Palace to kiss hands on the Friday
and select his/her senior ministers over the weekend, thus causing the least
disruption to the mandarins who, after all, are the ones who really run the
show.
Let us emulate the continentals and hold our elections on Sundays - so that
school children won't lose a day's schooling.
The mandarins do not need to worry this year - for there isn't going to be a
change of government.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: Average returns and cash flows of pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW BRIDGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a pension fund investment consultant, I would like to take issue with
three points in your article, 'Strong showing for UK pension funds' (January
2), one of which is fairly minor but the other two of which might mislead
the reader.
First, and perhaps I am being a trifle pedantic here, we do not yet know the
average return for 1991 as no returns have yet been calculated for the final
quarter: we can only make an estimate based on actual results to September
30 1991 and index projections for the last three months of the year.
Second, re the statement 'returns on equities alone were a record 20 per
cent', the returns on equities were by no means the best since 1976: UK
equity returns were better in as many as seven of the past 15 years, in
1977, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986 and 1989.
Finally, although managers may claim to prefer strong cash flows - who
wouldn't with fees based on market values - smaller cash flows which
restrict fund managers' investment flexibility may be a blessing in
disguise.
For the past four years, those funds with negative cash flows have
outperformed those with positive flows, by about half a per cent a year.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Last gasp for young fogeys: A species near political
extinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are dark days in the once sunlit world of the young fogeys. With the
passing of the Thatcher era and the emergence of the consensual politics of
Mr John Major, what is arguably Britain's most rarefied sociological
sub-species has been riven by schisms and backbiting.
On Europe, on the Citizen's Charter, on the goal of a classless society,
even on Mr Major himself, the once united front of militant fogeydom is as
bitterly divided as a meeting of Trotskyite International.
It was not always so.
Identified in the mid-1980s as an eccentric faction of middle-class
nostalgists, the young fogey phenomenon was at first dismissed as a purely
aesthetic reaction to the vulgar materialism of the yuppies.
With their tweed jackets and laced-up brogues cocking a deliberate snook at
Next suits, the fogeys took pride in being old before their time. Their
loathing for television, their obsession with the book of common prayer and
their disdain for icons of modernity such as the Sony Walkman, evoked a Toff
Liberation Front steeped in the traditions of the 1950s English public
school.
Ancestor worship was a key element in the mythology. As A N Wilson, the
novelist and critic often cited as the quintessential young fogey, put it
recently: 'The main quality of the fogeys was that they didn't rebel against
their parents' views - they imitated them.'
If fogeyus snobus maximus was a ludicrous figure, fogeyus politicus was
someone to be reckoned with. Mr Charles Moore, one-time editor of the
Spectator, and Mr Frank Johnson of the Sunday Telegraph - still a member of
the species in his mid-40s - were frequent informal visitors to Downing
Street, where other fogeyish figures such as Mr John Whittingdale, the
former PM's political adviser, and Mr Robin Harris, her speech writer, would
provide the tea and scones.
A little more than 12 months ago, the unknown Mr Patrick Robertson, at 21
the youngest of all fogeys, proved that his Bruges group could influence
thinking in a way that, with serious consequences, Sir Geoffrey Howe could
not. In the think tanks, pinstriped fogeys such as Mr Graham Mather,
politically independent director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, and
Mr David Willets, head of the Centre for Policy Studies, provided a well
stocked 'supermarket of ideas' for their mistress's delectation.
Arguably, what most appealed to Mrs Thatcher was the fact that her new
public school-educated cadres dismissed the old noblesse oblige traditions
of patrician Tory figures such as Lord Pym or Sir Ian Gilmour. Instead, they
believed, like her, that government should merely do its best to create the
opportunities for individuals to pull themselves up by their own boot
straps.
So what has changed? The answer is almost everything.
Out, as Mrs Thatcher would put it, has gone the firm stand against the
encroachment of the European Community. Out, too, have gone the doctrines of
rugged individualism and self-help meritocracy. And out have gone the
fogeys.
In their place have come the notion of 'society', deemed not to exist under
the ancien regime, the aspiration to classlessness and the all but
crypto-communist vision of Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, arch-liberal and
advocate of a 'country at peace with itself'.
Even before he took office, Mr Major was reported to have been splenetic
with Mr Moore over what he alleged to be a 'patronising' interview style.
Soon after, Mr Harris and Mr Whittingdale retreated to their fallen leader's
bunker.
In the wake of a public row over unsolicited advice on Europe, Mr Robertson
has now resigned as secretary of the Bruges group to take up a post with the
World Economic Forum in Geneva. A N Wilson has declared that he has now lost
his faith in God and will be voting Labour. And everywhere else the ragged
forces of fogeydom have been beating retreats or taking last stands.
For some, the ebbing of the Thatcherite tide has forced tough choices
between collaboration and resistance. In most of the think tanks,
internecine warfare over Europe has ended with a victory for the
pragmatists. Mr Mather, who always denied the fogey label, has gone even
further, and now advocates a full-blown debate on constitutional reform.
'The fogeys were always full of romantic contradictions,' he argues. 'The
energetic thinkers are not just going to slump in a bath chair and decry the
falling standards of literacy.'
Others, like Mr Simon Heffer, the Spectator's 30-going-on-60-year-old deputy
editor, believe that all is not yet lost with Mr Major. 'He cannot be
entirely antipathetic to fogeyism, as he likes cricket,' he observes.
For some, however, Mr Major's arrival has proved a political Dunkirk. Mr
Johnson - ranting recently about 'the worst display yet' of Mr Major's
concern for others - has chosen the course of outright confrontation. He
argues that the true faithful must hope that the Tories are cast into
opposition at the next election, and then use the time to regroup under a
younger generation of Thatcherites.
The tattered tweed banner of fogeydom will fly again, he promises, but, for
now, Britain is no longer a country fit for our parents and grandparents to
live in. Teatime at Number 10 is indefinitely postponed.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Men in the News: Jewellery innovator and the textile veteran
 -Gerald Ratner and Jim McAdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can never be quite sure with Gerald. Whether it is the occasional glint
in his dark eyes that betrays him or the faintest traces of a smile that
persistently play around the corners of his mouth, you never know whether
the chairman of the ailing Ratners jewellery group is making a serious point
or gently skewering you with his irony.
But Mr Ratner's humour deserted him yesterday as he announced that his
company had experienced a disastrous Christmas trading period and that he
would be stepping down as chairman.
Although he remains as chief executive of the company that he built up from
a loss-making family firm into the biggest jewellery company in the world,
he will now share executive responsibilities with the 61-year-old Mr Jim
McAdam, the former deputy chairman of Coats Viyella.
These developments have come as a severe blow to a man who, until last year,
had tasted nothing but glittering success in his business career. And the
normally effusive Mr Ratner was in subdued mood yesterday. It clearly hurt.
Perched on the corner of his desk with his striped shirt hanging out, a
weary Mr Ratner, 41, mouthed all the proper words expected of him. After
finishing a listless telephone conversation with his cousin and fellow
director, Victor, about how to explain the news to his staff, Mr Ratner
turned and said: 'I am very happy about the decision.'
The unconvincing words hung in the air as he continued: 'I shall continue to
have responsibility for the running of the business on a day-to-day basis as
any chief executive would do, but there will be a load of things that Jim
will be able to deal with. It is more stable.'
Stability, of course, is now the desired order of the day. After swallowing
Pounds 45m of exceptional costs, Ratners is heading for a total loss of
about Pounds 72m and the continuing support of the company's banks is
clearly crucial.
Mr McAdam's immediate role will be keep the bankers sweet, and he has
already begun to have an effect. His very appointment helped clear the way
for the banks to issue an unusual statement of support for the company, but
there will no doubt be tense weeks of talks ahead as the company tries to
straighten out its tangled web of debts.
Mr McAdam will also be intimately concerned with helping to implement the
company's rationalisation plan, which will involve stringent cost control
measures including the possible closure of some of Ratners' branches.
A tough-speaking Scot, he says he is well-suited to such a role, having
spent most of his career working in clothing companies in a highly
competitive market. 'I am battle-hardened from the textile industry in just
this sort of exercise. We have been doing it for a hell of a long period of
time,' he says in his soft accent.
Mr McAdam is a big company man who gained some retail experience from
running the Country Casuals clothing chain. A sincere but jovial Mr McAdam
says he has already developed a 'chemistry' with Mr Ratner, a businessman
for whom he says he has the greatest respect.
But it will not be easy to work at a company which has been moulded in the
image of the Ratner family since Gerald's father opened the first store in
Hendon in 1951.
How the two men work together will be a source of endless fascination. By
temperament, background and outlook they could hardly be more different.
Mr Ratner is very much the self-made man who spotted a market opportunity
and seized it with a vengeance. When he became managing director of Ratners
in 1984 - ousting his father, Leslie, in the process - the jewellery company
had 130 stores and made an annual loss of Pounds 350,000.
But by means of aggressive marketing skills and a hectic Pounds 800m
acquisition spree, Mr Ratner built up the business into an international
group with annual sales of Pounds 1.1bn employing 20,000 people. Last year
he sold more than 27 tonnes of nine-carat gold - sufficient to build three
double-decker London buses.
Mr Richard Hyman, director of the Verdict research consultancy, says that Mr
Ratner himself changed the whole 'body language' of jewellery shops. 'Prior
to his arrival on the scene most jewellers' body language told people: 'Do
not come in unless you really want to buy something. We are only interested
in serious customers'. But Ratner made it accessible to the mass public.'
The ruthless way he ate up the jewellery market could have served as a model
textbook example of how to corner a market and exploit it for all its worth.
But the way he financed his expansion could also serve as an example of what
to avoid.
Mr Ratner had long been regarded as something of an enfant terrible in the
City. Institutional investors had never known what to make of him. Initially
impressed by his persuasive manner and streetwise marketing skills, the City
tended to overlook the brasher sides of his impetuous nature. But by the
late 1980s, shareholders had begun to tire of the seemingly ceaseless rights
issues used to fund the company's dash for growth.
As recession struck, Mr Ratner was left friendless in the City and the
company's share price collapsed.
Mr Ratner's plight was worsened by a now notorious speech he gave to the
Institute of Directors last April in which he disparaged some of his
company's products. He was badly rattled by the furore surrounding his
remarks and has since retreated into a sullen shell. 'I feel very sorry for
my family and especially my cat,' he said after presenting a disappointing
set of interim results earlier this year.
In the same way that Mr Ratner lost faith with the City by making too many
extravagant promises, he has seemingly also lost the confidence of his
shoppers by offering them a series of ever-greater discounts. He will be
hard pressed to woo customers back to his stores - a skill at which he was
previously supreme.
Mr Ratner was yesterday left pondering his strange fate in the company's
ornate office building in Mayfair, surrounded by the fantastic Zales silver
collection and a host of glamorous secretaries.
But his huge office, dominated by a picture of one of Napoleon's generals,
has recently been chopped in half to provide a meeting room for Mr McAdam.
In more ways than one, it seems, the world has now closed in on Gerald
Ratner.

FT  11 JAN 92 / House prices fall 3.5% says Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell 3.5 per cent last year and the market continues to display
few signs of recovery, Halifax Building Society reported yesterday.
A 1.3 per cent fall in prices in December, which is traditionally a quiet
month for the housing market, helped produce the first annual decline since
the Halifax House Price Index began in 1983.
The December fall was 0.8 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis and
followed a revised fall of 0.4 per cent in November.
The figures come a day after the announcement of a small rise in November
housing starts, which was seen by the government as evidence that recovery
in the housing market is beginning.
House price rises tend to lag changes in housing starts by as much as a
year. Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said confidence would
improve as signs of more general economic recovery became more obvious,
leading to increased housing market activity.
This trend would be more apparent in the second half of this year and would
have little impact on house prices until next year. As a result, although
house prices should show some growth this year the increases would be
marginal.
A regional breakdown shows that prices fell slightly throughout the country
in the fourth quarter of last year except in the far north of England and in
Northern Ireland.
The sharpest regional decline in October to December last year was in the
south-east. Prices fell 2.4 per cent, bringing the annual fall to 7.5 per
cent. This was the region's steepest annual rate of decline since the summer
quarter of 1990.
Throughout the south of England house prices have slipped by about 2 per
cent in each of the past two quarters. Halifax said it was difficult to see
this pattern being reversed before there was evidence of increased demand
for homes.
On a brighter note, the quarterly falls of more than 5 per cent that
affected the south in 1989 have ended.
Halifax said the temporary abolition of stamp duty on purchases of houses
costing less than Pounds 250,000 should help the market. Transactions
already being negotiated had been helped along.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Labour tax plan for Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH parliament established by a Labour government would have the
power to require taxpayers in Scotland to pay more than the basic rate of
income tax set by the Commons, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, confirmed
yesterday.
He said legislation conferring revenue-raising powers on the new body would
permit it to vary the basic rate up or down 'by a small amount'.
Mr Smith reaffirmed in a speech in Glasgow that the Scottish parliament
would receive all revenue from income tax and value added tax paid in
Scotland.
He said Labour's proposals would create a sensible, stable and flexible
system of public finance for a Scottish parliament while maintaining the
coherence of UK economic policy.
Mr Smith challenged the Conservative party to make clear whether, in the
event of a Scottish parliament being established, it would seek to change
the basis for allocating funds from the exchequer so as to reduce the sums
available to Scotland.
He said: 'As shadow chancellor I want to make it clear that the next Labour
government will continue to pool resources and to distribute public
expenditure according to need.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL has asked the US to explain why it supported a resolution which
refers to Jerusalem as part of the occupied Palestinian territories.
The resolution, which strongly condemned Israel's plans to expel 12
Palestinians from the occupied territories, was passed unanimously by the UN
Security Council this week. The term 'occupied Palestinian territories'
appears twice in the resolution.
Israel is extremely sensitive to international declarations which cast doubt
on its sovereignty over Jerusalem. Official US policy holds that the status
of the city should be determined in negotiations, but that it should not be
divided.
The status of Jerusalem is expected to be one of the big obstacles in the
Arab-Israeli peace talks. The third round is scheduled to resume in
Washington tomorrow.
According to various opinion polls in Israel, more than half the population
would be willing to make some sort of territorial concession involving the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but only a small minority are prepared to
relinquish sovereignty over Jerusalem.
US officials tried to play down the significance of the wording of the
resolution, saying it was merely a geographical description of the
territories located over the 'green line' - Israel's pre-1967 borders.
Israel annexed Arab East Jerusalem shortly after its capture in the 1967
War.
Israeli aircraft killed at least 12 Palestinian guerrillas and wounded 12
yesterday, in their first raid on Lebanon this year, security sources said,
Reuter reports from Beirut.
The jets bombed bases of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) near Na'ameh, 9 miles south of Beirut,
Palestinians said.
The bases of the PFLP-GC, a radical group opposed to the peace policies of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation, have been frequent targets for
Israeli fighter aircraft and commandos.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Philippines close to IMF agreement

THE Philippines has provisionally agreed with the International Monetary
Fund the main points of its 1992 economic programme, except for additional
state spending following the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano last
year, Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, announced yesterday.
Mr Estanislao said he hoped the IMF would give its approval in February. He
made clear, however, that success depended on the government's ability to
persuade the reluctant Philippines Senate to approve tax reform measures to
increase revenue, permitting the government to meet IMF fiscal targets.
The IMF has suspended payments from a Dollars 900m loan package agreed last
year, and its refusal to endorse the Philippines has delayed other debt
rescheduling agreements.
Mr Estanislao said the approval of at least some tax measures was crucial,
but he suggested that the government would be prepared to cut expenditure in
order to meet IMF budget targets if the Senate refused to back all the
reforms.
He said the IMF had accepted a slight rise in budget expenditure in real
terms for the year, a move which would theoretically leave the overall
public sector deficit at less than 3 per cent of GDP or just under Pesos
39bn (Pounds 800m).
The Philippines has been given a breathing space by a recent improvement in
the economy. Mr Estanislao predicted real growth of 2 to 3 per cent in 1992,
with an acceleration in the rate expected during the second half of the
year. 'Substantial progress has been made in stabilising the economy,' he
said.

FT  11 JAN 92 / Legal filip for Japan's women

A COURT yesterday set an important precedent for equality in the Japanese
workplace by ordering a bank to recognise that women can be the head of a
household and have an equal entitlement to family allowances.
In settling a decade-old dispute, Sendai High Court ruled that the Iwate
bank had unfairly halted family allowance payments to an employee  - a
supplement on salary for spouse and children - after her previously
unemployed husband found a job.
The bank had argued that even though Mrs Reiko Sugawara, 61, had registered
as the household head, it was generally understood among Japanese that a man
is the family head and therefore the payments to her should be stopped.
Under the bank's employment regulations, which are similar to those of many
other Japanese companies, family allowances are paid to a male head of
household regardless of his wife's salary, but allowances are paid to a
woman only if her spouse's salary is less than Y1m a year.
The court ruled yesterday that this distinction is illegal under Japan's
Labour Standards Law and ordered Iwate Bank to pay Y1.3m in back allowances
to Mrs Sugawara.
Outside the courtroom, she said the decision was a sign that Japan is
'headed in the direction of equality', though many companies still routinely
discriminate against women.
Iwate Bank, which had appealed against a 1985 lower court judgment in Mrs
Sugawara's favour.
The Nikkeiren, the employers' federation, said that the judgment appears to
embody the spirit of the Equal Opportunities Employment Act of 1986:
Women account for about 38 per cent of Japan's labour force, up from 32 per
cent in 1975, as the country's labour shortage has encouraged companies to
offer more flexible conditions to married women, who traditionally left the
workforce.

SEVERAL hundred Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) supporters marched chanting
through central Algiers yesterday, despite a ban on marches during election
campaigning, agencies report from Algiers.
The FIS militants chanted support for Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj,
two of the party's leaders detained by the military last June when unrest
forced the postponement of Algeria's first multiparty general election.
The FIS seized a commanding lead in the first round poll last month and
appears set to win a parliamentary majority in the ballot for undecided
seats next Thursday.
The Tunisian government, alarmed at the prospect of an electoral victory by
Algerian fundamentalists has told its security forces to be on the alert and
ready for sacrifice.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Observer: Family line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baron Marcel Bich yesterday put the cap on speculation about the future of
one of France's most secretive family companies by naming his son Bruno to
succeed him as chairman of Bic, the world's largest maker of ball-point
pens.
While the 77-year-old founder will continue to head the French-based parent
company for the time being, Bruno - his second son and the third of his 11
children - is being prepared to take over by promotion to the chairmanship
of the US subsidiary.
The move continues a cherished tradition of father-to-son handovers in
French business. Other family groups which have taken or are taking the same
line include Bouygues, Dassault, Michelin, Hachette, Matra, and Club
Mediterranee. The results do not seem much different from those of
non-family competitors, perhaps because most of the sons involved have
worked their way through the business.
This is certainly true of Bruno Bich, now 45, a former banker who joined the
company two decades ago. The group might even benefit from some fresh ideas,
since the Baron's attempts to seek new sources of growth, beyond its
traditional pens, disposable razors and lighters businesses, have fallen
below expectations. A diversification into perfumes had to be scuppered last
year, while a Bic sailboard business is in the doldrums.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RITE AID, the US drug store chain, yesterday withdrew its reorganisation
plan for Revco, a rival retailer which is in currently in bankruptcy.
In a formal statement, Rite Aid said that it would not seek 'confirmation'
for the plan, which would essentially have involved Rite Aid in acquiring
Revco, at a bankruptcy court hearing next Monday. It claimed that bidding
levels had made the potential acquisition 'uneconomical'.
Rite Aid's decision follows an undecisive ballot among Revco creditors last
weekend over three competing reorgansiation plans - from Rite Aid, from
another retailer, Jack Eckerd, and a Revco-backed creditors plan. The last
of these proved most popular, gaining majority support from four of the
seven creditor groups. The Rite Aid and Eckerd plans were backed by two and
one classes respectively.
Earlier this week, Revco appeared hopeful that the weight of support behind
the creditor plan would encourage the bankruptcy court to force this scheme
on dissenting parties at the confirmation hearing, which was delayed from
January 8 to January 13.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Privatisation 'to go ahead' in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S new minister of privatisation, Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, has taken the
unusual step of publicly declaring his support for Poland's complex and
widespread privatisation programme.
In a move apparently designed to dispel the impression that the centre-right
government led by Mr Jan Olszewski has a lower committment to privatisation
than its predecessors, the minister said considerable attention would be
given to its implementation.
The aim of the programme is to privatise some 200-400 medium to large state
enterprises. Their ownership will be transferred to national investment
funds (managed by international fund managers), whose shares will be
distributed to members of the public.
The previous government, which drew up the plan, was advised by a number of
City companies and banks, including S G Warburg, the merchant bankers, and
accountants Touche Ross.
Before Christmas, Mr Olszewski, the prime minister, had criticised the
former government's economic policies, saying he rejected 'the theory of
building a healthy economy only on the ruins of state enterprises'.

FT  10 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Raine linked to Lovell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in YJ Lovell, the troubled Buckinghamshire-based construction group,
moved up strongly amid suggestions that Raine Industries had acquired a
significant stake in the group.
Lovell touched 23p before ending a busy session 4 ahead at 22p. Raine
Industries fell sharply to close 10 1/2 off at 102 1/2 p, with the market
concerned at the prospect of Raine bidding for Lovell.
Turnover in Lovell as reported by Seaq was 846,000 shares but the trading
screens showed a series of delayed trades carried out at 22p and 24p, which
were expected to be recorded on the Seaq overnight ticker. It was these
trades which were thought to contain a number of big deals.
Earlier in the session there had been rumours that Taylor Woodrow, the
construction group, which acquired a near 5 per cent stake in Lovell in a
market raid carried out last June, was about to launch a full takeover bid
for Lovell.
Lovell shares plummeted late last year after the group, crippled by
deteriorating conditions in the UK and US housing and property markets,
warned of heavy losses, that it would pass its final dividend and that it
would breach its banking covenants.
US buyers of Glaxo
The price of Glaxo continued to rise yesterday, against the expectations of
a number of UK analysts, and reached another all-time high. US buying
reversed early weakness in the shares, finally adding a further Pounds 1bn
to the company's market value.
The stock was off 12 in early trading, discouraged by speculation, later
denied, that Barclays de Zoete Wedd had recommended a switch into SmithKline
Beecham. There was also some talk of a Cazenove downgrade.
Then, the US buyers moved in during the afternoon and sent the shares
rocketing through their chart barrier. They jumped 4.29 per cent or 38 on
balance to close at 923p.
Pharmaceutical group Smith &amp; Nephew attracted attention throughout the day
as confusion reigned over a possible legal settlement in the US.
Traders reacted to unverified reports that the company was close to a deal
to cut damages it was due to pay to US concern Polteco. Suggestions were
that damages would be only around Dollars 37m, compared with the Dollars 96m
formerly threatened, and the shares picked up by around 5 per cent.
However, no announcement appeared on the Stock Exchange information service
and the company said it had not released any statement on the matter and
would not comment further.
Later, the Stock Exchange and Kleinwort Benson, Smith's broker, announced an
inquiry into the leak. The shares rose to 144p before closing almost 5 up at
141 1/4 p, the highest price since November 1989. Turnover of about 12m
shares made Smith prominent in the market's list of active stocks.
Wellcome demand
Strength in Wellcome was helped by a buy note from Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank. The shares, which are traditionally tightly traded,
advanced 35 to 1043p on high turnover of 3m.
Goldman was active after its pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Paul Krikler
improved his stance on the stock to a 'trading buy'. Mr Krikler decided that
the shares had returned to the level at which they stood before recent press
comment on potential Aids treatments prompted an overheated rally. He said
yesterday: 'We believe Wellcome has the strongest earnings per share growth
of the major drug companies.'
Another bout of pronounced weakness in the life assurance sector was
attributed to a bearish note published by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Legal &amp;
General, by far the poorest performer in the FT-SE 100 index yesterday, fell
10 to 365p, having lost 9 in the previous session. Prudential eased 2 to
233p, additionally unsettled by news that County NatWest had removed the
stock from its buy list.
Mr Youssef Ziai, UBS life assurance analyst, said he had shifted his stance
on Legal from buy to hold and that for Prudential from hold to sell. He
cited political uncertainty for the change in stance, arguing that Labour
party policy towards taxation and pensions was a 'significant negative for
the life sector'.
Sentiment in Greycoat improved as the property company contacted brokers to
give assurances that the Pounds 130m financing for its Embankment Place
development would be in place shortly. The shares, which dropped 22 on
Wednesday, ended only 2 lower at 74p. County NatWest yesterday confirmed its
downgrading of Greycoat's net asset value (nav) - wrongly reported yesterday
 -as 250p for this year, down from 301p, and to 200p from 312p for 1993.
Hammerson rebounded on the strength of the dollar following the stock's
steep fall on Wednesday. The group has a large overseas property portfolio.
The ordinary shares picked up 14 to 532p, while the 'A' improved 10 to 464p.
County downgraded Hammerson's nav by 73 to 655p. A stock overhang pulled
Chesterfield Properties down 15 to 410p.
Institutions reacted positively to news that packaging company API had
appointed Mr Moger Woolley, formerly chief executive of the DRG packaging
group, as non-executive chairman. The shares gained 20 to 123p with Credit
Lyonnais Laing (CLL) a heavy buyer.
A series of post-Christmas downgrades by CLL brought significant
underperformance by the food retailing giants. Mr Tony Shiret, food
retailing specialist at CLL, lowered his current year estimate for J.
Sainsbury by Pounds 10m to Pounds 610m, that for Tesco by the same amount to
Pounds 540m, and that for Argyll by Pounds 9m to Pounds 360m. Mr Shiret
said: 'Despite the late run on the food shops pre-Christmas the overall
result disappointed'.
Tesco fell 7 1/2 to 217p on 6.8m, while Sainsbury dipped 4 to 364p on 2m.
Argyll could manage only a minor gain at 287p with 7.5m shares traded. UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew was also thought to have reduced its estimate for Tesco.
There were suspicions that a stakebuilder could have been at work in
Boddingtons, the brewer, after a number of delayed trades which did not show
up during market hours. The shares rose 7 1/2 to 170 1/2 p.
Oil shares extended their recent rally. BP gained a further 9 1/2 to 283 1/2
p on turnover of 11m, with much of yesterday's support said to have come
from Smith New Court after the broker highlighted the stock's yield
attractions and said the market had previously been over-optimistic about
BP's dividend policy.
Smith was also said to have been behind a steep rise in Burmah Castrol after
visiting the company on Tuesday. Mr Nick Clayton at Smith said Burmah shares
were oversold and looked more attractive now than at any time for the past
two years. The stock closed 18 higher at 490p. Shell, where volume reached
7m, added 6 at 476p.
Sheffield Insulation plunged 25 to 85p as one of the big integrated
securities houses was said to have drastically cut its current year
estimates. Sheffield's figures are due at the end of March.
A reported downgrading by Cazenove sent Lucas Group down 5 to 109p.
Cazenove, which acts as broker to Lucas, declined to comment on the move.
Hotel group Forte entered County NatWest's top-30 share list, analyst Ms
Julie Farrar citing an improved room occupancy rate and good recovery
prospects. The shares edged up 2 to 231p. Thorn EMI were also added to the
list of 30 best buys and raced up 15 to 763p.
Nomura became the latest broker to put Granada Group on its buy list, the
shares gaining 6 to 210p in hefty turnover of 6m. Confidence in new chief
executive Mr Gerry Robinson and optimism over BSkyB's chances of recovery
were two other prominent reasons driving the price upwards.
A positive sales forecast from Airbus helped British Aerospace gain 11 to
322p in moderate volume of 3.1m. Traders also said that the shares are still
relatively cheap after their recent battering.

FT  10 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie challenges 2,500 mark again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from the US dollar in the wake of the US and Japanese
initiative on economic strategy drove the UK stock market ahead yesterday.
London advanced slowly at first but the second half of the session saw the
Footsie briefly regain the 2,500 mark as stock markets across Europe
responded to firmness in the US currency and equities.
At the close the FT-SE Index was 30.8 up at 2,497.9 on increased trading
volume described as 'solid and two-way, rather than dramatic'. The day's
Seaq total jumped to 715.6m shares, significantly higher than Wednesday's
505.3m although still behind the 815.3m-share session of December 19.
Stock Exchange statistics show that retail, or customer, business in London
equities has averaged just below Pounds 1bn daily over the past week,
confirming reports that the institutions have been reshaping portfolios
rather than increasing them.
Yesterday's rise in the stock market also reflected a rapid expansion in the
premium on the March futures contract on the Footsie; the March contract was
trading around the 2,540 level at mid-afternoon.
Traders again stressed that the advance in the London market was directly
based on Wall Street, where the Dow Industrial Average challenged its
intraday peak to show a gain of 12 points in UK hours.
International blue chips, with dollar-based sales, moved smartly higher as
the US currency broke through a significant resistance point against the
D-Mark. Although sterling remained a hazard, worries over domestic base
rates slackened as London money market rates eased.
The Footsie benefited from renewed demand for selected stocks in the
pharmaceutical sector which, after outperforming last year, has been widely
recommended as an attractive sector for the 1990s. The shares are regarded
as a safe haven against the domestic recession, as well as well placed to
benefit from economic recovery in whichever national sector it first shows
itself.
The Glaxo share price broke through to a new high as both US and European
investors continued to seek stock, and both SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome
attracted international buyers.
There was a good recovery in some oil issues as several of the UK brokers
who have been sellers decided that the falls in share prices had gone far
enough to offer bargain hunting opportunities. Banks also continued to edge
back into favour after their period in the market's sell lists.
However, gains in the building and retail shares, which have been under
renewed pressure from interest rate worries, were modest. There were a
number of large share deals in some of the non-Footsie stocks, which boosted
share volume without involving significant amounts of institutional money.
Some equity strategists continued to take a cautious view of the outlook for
the UK market. Mr Nicholas Knight, the bearish strategist at Nomura Research
Institute Europe, warned yesterday that the intraday FT-SE 100 level of
2,540.1 reached on Monday could prove to be the high point for 1992.
Analysts at Smith New Court, the London securities house, however, believe
that a Footsie index target of 2,800 at the year-end 'is not unreasonable'.

Wall Street
HELPED BY more good news on inflation which raised hopes for further
interest rate cuts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher to a new
closing record level yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 5.59 at 3,209.53. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, slipped 0.49 to 417.61, but the Nasdaq
composite index of over-the-counter stocks continued its stellar
performance, jumping 9.48 to another all-time peak of 619.80.
Turnover on the New York SE was again very heavy, amounting to 292m shares.
News that producer prices fell 0.2 per cent in December provided an early
tonic for the market. Evidence that inflation is no longer a threat, at
least for the medium term, boosted hopes among investors that the Federal
Reserve would once more ease monetary policy.
Intense activity in the over-the-counter market showed no signs of abating,
with turnover heading for record levels as investors scrambled to buy
smaller, fast-growth companies in anticipation of a recovery in the US
economy by mid-year.
AMR, parent group of American Airlines, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 71 3/8
after the company signalled its intention to sell up to 5m shares (4m in the
US and 1m overseas) to raise money for working capital.
Other big airline issues, which have been at the forefront of the market's
recent rally, also retreated. UAL slipped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 150 1/2 ,
USAir Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 and Delta Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69
1/2 .
Profit-taking also took its toll of JP Morgan, which receded Dollars 2 1/2
to Dollars 67 1/2 in spite of reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings of
Dollars 269m, up 41 per cent on the year. The stock reached an all-time high
of just over Dollars 70 this week, so some sort of downward reaction was
understandable.
Citicorp held firm at Dollars 10 1/2 after announcing the sale of a stake in
Saudi American Bank worth between Dollars 330m and Dollars 450m.
Time Warner climbed Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 94 3/8 as investors reacted
positively to news that the entertainment group's Warner Bros film
subsidiary had 13.9 per cent of the domestic box office in 1991, the largest
share of any movie studio.
Recent winners featured in the over-the-counter rally, with Microsoft
gaining Dollars 3 at Dollars 127 1/4 , Apple Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 62 1/4
and Intel Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 53 1/2 . A rare OTC loser was Adobe
Systems, which fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 63 on disappointing
fourth-quarter profits.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices soared in very heavy trading to register the biggest
single-session gain in more than four years, boosted by a rebound among gold
stocks and strong performances on overseas markets.
The composite index jumped 65 points or 1.85 per cent to close at 3,580.6,
its largest rise since December 14, 1987. Advances overwhelmed declines by
406 to 243 after a volume of 49m shares, against Wednesday's 36.4m. Turnover
was the sixth-highest single-day total in the exchange's history, and the
heaviest since the crash of October 1987.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure remains on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING remained very close to its lowest permitted limit within the
European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, trading just above a floor of
around DM2.83.
However, the UK currency was steady for most of the day against the D-Mark,
suggesting that traders were unwilling to risk being caught by concerted
central bank intervention and were not ready to push sterling through its
ERM floor.
Having closed on Wednesday in London at DM2.8350, sterling moved lower still
in New York and Far Eastern trading, for a time dipping below DM2.83.
However, trading of sterling against the D-Mark is very limited outside of
European markets and the weakness was attributed to the movement of both
currencies against the dollar.
By the European opening the pound had recovered ground to trade at DM2.8385
by mid-morning. During the afternoon session this level was maintained until
a bout of weakness just minutes before the close took it down to DM2.8300.
However, this was short-lived and the UK currency had soon recovered to
DM2.8340 in New York trading.
The dollar continued to gain ground on the D-Mark and the yen, climbing 2
pfennigs in Tokyo trading to close there at DM1.5275, and at Y124.65.
Analysts said the recovery in the fortunes of the dollar was due to traders
covering short positions built up earlier in the week.
The rise of the dollar was also boosted by automatic stop-loss trading
programmes, which caused buying of the US currency once it had broken
through DM1.52.
In European trading the firm tone continued, and the dollar closed at
DM1.5475 and Y125.45 in London, near to the highest rates of the day. In New
York the US unit finished stronger at DM1.5605 and Y125.82.
US producer price statistics for December were seen as neutral for the
dollar. An index of the main prices declined by 0.2 per cent during the
month, in line with most forecasts. The index slipped by 0.1 per cent during
the whole of 1991, against an increase of 5.7 per cent during 1990.
Today, non-farm employment statistics for December are scheduled for
release. In recent months a poor employment figure has been the spur for
monetary easing.
Analysts are expecting an increase in unemployment of between 30,000 and
100,000 for the month. A larger figure, combined with the weak inflation
statistics released yesterday, will be seen as increasing the chances of a
cut in US interest rates. This could undermine the recovery of the dollar
over the past two days.
The Australian currency came under selling pressure following a full
percentage point reduction in interest rates to 7.5 per cent on Wednesday.
The Australian dollar weakened yesterday to USDollars 0.7437 from around
USDollars 0.7560 on Wednesday, prompting intervention by the US and
Australian central banks.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England moved early to relieve pressure in the UK money market
yesterday, resulting in sharply lower rates in spite of continued pressure
on sterling on the foreign exchange markets.
The bank forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.45bn early in the day,
later revised to Pounds 1.5bn, larger than recent shortages due to an
expiring repurchase agreement.
However, the Bank of England quickly moved to relieve the squeeze with an
early round of assistance totalling Pounds 1.359bn.
In a new repurchase agreement, Pounds 830m band 4 bills were purchased for
resale to the market on January 20 at 10 7/16 per cent.
In addition, it purchased outright band 1 bank and treasury bills at 10 3/8
per cent, band 3 LA and bank bills at 10 7/32 per cent and band 4 bank bills
at 10 1/8 per cent. Later in the morning session, the remaining shortage was
taken care of with further purchases of band 1 bank and treasury bills at 10
3/8 per cent, totalling Pounds 150m.
As conditions eased, overnight unsecured money rates came down, trading at 9
3/4 - 1/2 per cent during the morning session and as low as 6 per cent in
the afternoon.
By the close, overnight rates were around 10-9 3/4 per cent, against 10 3/4
 -5/8 per cent on Wednesday.
The key three months inter-bank money rate closed at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent
from 10 3/4 - 9/16 per cent on Wednesday.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange traded up to close at 89.53, the day's high,
against 89.38 on Wednesday. This level implies base rates of 10.47 per cent
by the spring, from a current level of 10.5 per cent.
Money market conditions in Tokyo remained very tight in the face of a Y740bn
liquidity shortage and banking reserves well below target. Rates traded up
to 6 1/2 per cent during the day before settling back to 5 1/2 per cent by
the close, up  3/32 per cent from Wednesday's levels.
Having squeezed rates higher for most of this week, the Bank of Japan had to
relieve the liquidity shortage, lending Y400bn to City banks during the day
to reduce their demand for inter-bank funding. In addition, the Bank of
Japan set a Y600bn repurchase agreement which expires on February 4 and a
Y300bn pact which ends on February 12.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Action threatened on
overfishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Crosbie, Canada's minister of fisheries and oceans, has launched a
bitter attack on Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels operating outside
Canadian waters, accusing them of 'raping' the fish stocks of the north-west
Atlantic.
Canada would be intensifying its efforts to win European Community backing
on the overfishing issue this year, Mr Crosbie said this week. But if that
failed, Canada might be forced to extend unilaterally its 200-mile fishing
zone, introduced in 1977.
'Ultimately unilateral action is a possibility, although we would not adopt
it without being pressed into it. But we are not going to sit by and see the
stocks plundered,' he said.
Canada is also seeking changes in the United Nation's Convention on the Law
of the Sea, adopted in 1982, to take account of the problem of 'straddling
stocks'. Canada claims it is unique in the extent to which important fish
stocks straddle its 200-mile limit, due to the configuration of the
continental shelf, leaving the domestic fishing industry prey to the
depredations of foreign vessels. Canada does not have distant water fleets.
Mr Crosbie will be raising the law of the sea issue at a conference on
international boundaries sponsored by the Royal Institute of International
Affairs in London today.
Canada has been at loggerheads over fishing with the EC, particularly Spain
and Portugal, since the late 1980s. In 1990 the EC agreed to accept quotas
set by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, of which both the EC
and Canada are members, for eight of the key species in the area beyond the
200-mile limit. However, the EC refused to accept the Nafo moratorium on
northern cod, a mainstay of the fishing industry in Canada's maritime
provinces.
Canada also maintains that although EC quotas came down, catches did not. It
was therefore seeking a firm commitment by the EC to observe all the Nafo
quotas, backed by an effective international system of surveillance and
control beyond the 200-mile limit, Mr Crosbie said. Such a system would also
help tackle overfishing by non-Nafo vessels, which often operate under flags
of convenience, and the misreporting of catches.
In the past the EC has challenged the Nafo quotas on scientific grounds,
questioning the degree to which stocks have been depleted.
In addition Canada was embarking on an international information campaign to
alert the public to the overfishing problem and emphasise the importance of
sustainable development.
'Its not going to be easy,' he admitted. 'Cod aren't exactly cuddly
creatures like seals. You can't show the public some Brigitte Bardot-type
figure cuddling cod to her bosom'.
Spanish and Portuguese representatives would be invited to Canada to see the
problems for themselves, he said.
Despite his avowed intention to win hearts and minds to the Canadian
viewpoint, Mr Crosbie was scathing about his Spanish and Portuguese
counterparts. He said: 'The Spanish and Portuguese fisheries ministers make
magnificent speeches. I can enthusiastically support everything they say,
but its not carried out in practice. It's all hypocrisy.'

FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices fall further as glut
fears strengthen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES slipped further yesterday as fears of a glut of oil on world
markets gathered strength. North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery
dropped 30 cents to Dollars 16.85 a barrel in a busy market.
'The price is nowhere near a bottom: we could see another couple of dollars
knocked off Brent without blinking,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the
international energy division at Lehman Brothers.
Oil prices had been supported by traders' anticipation of a colder winter
than usual and a continuing slide in exports from the former Soviet Union.
But this has not materialised and demand has been depressed by the slowness
of recovery of western economies.
US meteorologists point out that in North America the weather has been so
mild that it would take temperatures some five degrees below the normal
level for the next six weeks just to reach the seasonal average.
The market was further depressed by the announcement from Vienna that talks
between Iraq and the United Nations had been extended for another day,
heightening fears that some Iraqi oil could return to the market soon.
Many analysts see oil prices staying weak into the second quarter unless the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries institutes some heavy
production cuts. Smaller producers which want emergency action are losing
their voice against the clout of Saudi Arabia.
Countries such as Algeria and Nigeria, which have called for an emergency
meeting, are in the midst of political upheaval that could result in the
replacement of their oil ministers.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex pulls out of relocation
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy futures market,
has decided to withdraw from a Dollars 450m relocation project with four
other New York-based commodity exchanges.
Late on Wednesday, Nymex's board voted unanimously to pull out of the move
to a new building in New York City.
Its officials cited economic conditions, escalating costs and lack of
progress in consolidating operations with its relocation partners.
The four other exchanges involved in the project - the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, the Commodity Exchange (Comex), the world's largest precious
metals market, the New York Cotton Exchange, and the New York Futures
Exchange - pledged that they would continue with the project.
They said that Nymex's claims about problems with the project were
'unjustified'. In a joint statement, the four exchanges said the plan was
ahead of schedule and that the complaints of a lack of progress on
consolidation were unfounded given an agreement to form a joint clearing
body and work under way to implement it.
Nymex also expressed concern about the cost of leasing space for member
firms. But the other exchanges said that the planned new facility, which was
to alleviate overcrowding at their current site, would accommodate the
requirements of member firms and that this would have no impact on the cost
of the new building.
Nymex's decision appeared to signal that it wished to establish itself in a
separate location apart from the other exchanges. Mr Patrick Thompson, Nymex
president, said that the exchange would develop a new relocation plan in New
York City if feasible. Nymex had preferred a New Jersey site.
The New York Cotton Exchange has announced that it will introduce a new
futures contract for world cotton in the next few months. The contract will
be cash-settled and based on the European world index, or index 'A', which
includes 12 growths and is derived daily by averaging the five cheapest. The
contract must be approved by Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US
futures industry regulator.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe presses for early
decision on options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures Exchange has asked firms to
confirm by today which equity options they plan to make markets in.
A final decision is urgently required to complete technical preparations for
the London Traded Options Market's move to join Liffe at Cannon Bridge at
the end of the month.
The establishment of a viable market-making system is vital to the merger of
Liffe and LTOM in March and to the future of the UK's moribund stock options
market.
Liffe is said to be considering fall-back measures, in case it fails to
persuade enough firms to participate in the planned market-making system,
and the Bank of England has been in talks with the firms involved, in an
effort to help resolve the deadlock.
The merger, originally due this month, was postponed until March, because
not enough firms came forward to make markets in the 67 equity options
traded on LTOM. This was despite a reasonable take-up of last year's offer
of 'D' shares, which entitle holders to trade stock options on the new
exchange. Technical problems also delayed the merger.
Large UK integrated houses such as Smith New Court and Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, which wanted equity options trading to move to a screen-based system,
have taken a large number of seats to trade stock options but have said they
will act as principal traders rather than market-makers.
Liffe is hoping that other firms, such as Hills Independent Traders and
O'Connor Securities will commit themselves to market-making in a broad range
of stocks.
According to market sources, Liffe has developed a contingency plan, in case
it fails to gather an adequate group of market-makers. It appears to involve
a shift to a system of brokers, rather than market-makers, but the idea has
so far met with little support, one head of equity options said. There is
also resistance to suggestions that the number of equity options could be
slashed.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Date set for UK's Ecu T-bill
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST auction of three-year Ecu Treasury notes issued by the UK
government has been set for January 21, the Bank of England said yesterday.
The programme, designed to fill a gap in the range of maturities available
in the Ecu bond market, was announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor, at the Mansion House dinner last autumn.
The Bank will initially tender Ecu1bn of notes due January 1995, and
subsequent auctions will be held on the third Tuesday of every quarter.
Notes at the next two or three auctions are likely to be due January 1995,
to build up maximum liquidity. The amount issued at future auctions will
probably be around Ecu500m, although the Bank has no target. The programme
is not for funding purposes: proceeds will be held as foreign exchange
reserves.
Thirty banks have been appointed as market-makers. The Bank of England will
hold a further Ecu100m of notes that can be lent to the market-makers. This
allows them to borrow notes to cover any short positions, thus encouraging
active trading.
In brisk, when-issued trading yesterday, the notes were well bid at a yield
of 8.58 per cent, around 50 basis points below the three-year swap level.
The programme is seen as a natural extension of the Bank of England's
previous efforts to further the development of Ecu markets in London. Its
Ecu T-bill programme currently has Ecu3.6bn outstanding, and its 10-year Ecu
bond issue is one of the most actively traded in the market. A further bond
issue seems unlikely, however, since there is no longer a lack of paper at
that area of the yield curve.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Strong investor appetite for World Bank
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank's latest global Dollars 1.5bn issue performed strongly
yesterday in the wake of heavy demand from investors.
The 10-year issue, with a coupon of 6 3/4 per cent, was priced at a spread
of 15 basis points over US Treasury bonds - at the low end of the expected
range. However, by late yesterday the spread had narrowed to as little as 10
basis points.
This prompted claims that the issue, brought by Deutsche Bank Capital
Markets and Merrill Lynch, had been priced too generously.
However, it was widely believed that a more significant factor had been
efforts by traders who had gone short of the issue, in the expectation of
the spread widening, to square their positions.
Around three-quarters of the issue is understood to have been placed in the
Far East and Europe, with Far Eastern investors the largest buyers. US
investors were said to be less attracted because of the narrow spread over
Treasuries.
Elsewhere, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development made its
debut for the year with an offering in the Swedish krona sector, swapped
into floating-rate dollars.
Priced at 30 basis points over comparable Swedish government bonds, the
issue was considered tightly priced. However, the small size of the deal,
reflecting the bank's modest current borrowing needs, meant that much of the
issue had been pre-placed.
A keenly-priced Dollars 200m issue from Forte, the UK hotels group, also
failed to set investors alight. The two-year bonds were brought by Goldman
Sachs and J. P. Morgan at a spread of 71 over the US government benchmark at
the re-offered price.
The short maturity enabled the borrower, rated A2 by Moody's and single-A by
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agencies, to offer a coupon of just 5 3/8
per cent.
The two lead-banks, which between them took around 80 per cent of the bonds,
are thought to have sold around half of their share yesterday. The bonds
were held at the fixed re-offer price throughout the day.
Meanwhile, Swiss Bank Corporation International was having a far easier time
with a five-year, Dollars 200m deal for Nestle Holdings.
The issue, carrying a coupon of 6 1/8 per cent and a powerful name for
retail investors, was sold out before the syndicate had been formed.
The spread of 24 basis points had tightened to 20 basis points in later
trading. The food group's US entity also brought a SFr300m, 10-year issue
yesterday carrying a coupon of 6 3/4 per cent.
Ontario Hydro, the Canadian utility, is expected to launch a global bond
offering next week to raise in excess of CDollars 1bn. The company said
yesterday it was planning the offer 'in the near future, subject to
appropriate market conditions.'
The names of the five lead-managers chosen for the transaction were not
named publicly, though they are understood to be Goldman Sachs, Industrial
Bank of Japan, Scotia McLeod, Merrill Lynch and RBC Dominion Securities.
The issue, likely to be at the 10-year maturity, will be the company's fifth
Canadian dollar global issue. It will take borrowings so far this year to
nearly CDollars 2bn, close to half the total projected need for 1992.
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK chemicals group, said it was about to
launch a Dollars 200m 10-year bond issue in the US domestic market. The
bonds, issued by ICI Wilmington and guaranteed by ICI, will carry a coupon
of 7.5 per cent, and are priced at 99.75 per cent. The issue is co-managed
by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, with J. P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley
also acting as underwriters.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Bank sells off tap in rising market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds gained nearly a quarter of a point yesterday, allowing
the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its Pounds 1bn tap issue in the
rising market.
The Pounds 1bn tranche of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007, which has
been overhanging the market, was exhausted in afternoon trading.
The Bank of England has supplied amounts of the partly-paid tranche on
several occasions since it was announced on December 13.
Volumes in the futures market were relatively high, with over 25,000 gilt
futures contracts traded on Liffe. The 10 per cent gilt due 1996 rose from
100 29/32 to trade at 101 1/8 by late afternoon while the benchmark 11 3/4
per cent gilt due 2003/07 increased from 115 to 115 29/32 to yield 9.4 per
cent.
THE European government bond markets gained up to half a point yesterday,
encouraged by the US economic data and rumours of a moderate German wage
settlement. Traders reported strong buying interest in the high-yielding
European markets from Far Eastern, European and US investors, many of whom
are reallocating their portfolios for the new year.
In Germany, trading was mainly futures-driven, with the Liffe bund futures
contract bursting through the technical resistance level of 88.01. The
contract, which started the day at 87.67, climbed as high as 88.22 before
closing at 88.19. The market has tested this resistance level earlier in the
week.
The bund market was lifted by rumours that German steel workers had agreed
to a moderate pay increase of 5 per cent, and by favourable US economic data
and higher-than-expected German unemployment figures.
In France, the government bond market opened firm in response to the release
of weak German employment data and was boosted later in the day by the rally
in US Treasury bond prices.
On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the March bond futures contract
closed at 108.92, up 0.56 from late Wednesday. Volume was well above average
at over 170,000 contracts.
AFTER a bright opening on good inflation news, US Treasury prices fell
across the board yesterday amid increased nervousness about today's
important jobs figures.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 107
1/16 , yielding 7.403 per cent. The two-year note fell even further,
dropping  3/16 to 100 1/2 , yielding 4.714 per cent.
Bond prices had initially firmed after the Labor Department reported a 0.2
per cent decline in the producer price index for December. Separately, news
of a 22,000 jump in weekly unemployment insurance claims had also bolstered
sentiment.
Prices later retreated, however, as dealers trimmed their positions for fear
of being caught long ahead of what some rumour-mongerers said would be an
unfavourable December employment report. The report, due out this morning,
is expected to show a decline in non-farm job payrolls of between 50,000 and
100,000.
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped on opening due to the weaker yen,
but rebounded later to close slightly higher on the day.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.32 per cent and moved in the
range of 5.275 to 5.325 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 5.29 per cent.
At the Finance Ministry's auction of 5.5 per cent 10-year bonds, the average
accepted bid was 100.77, yielding 5.381 per cent, while the lowest accepted
price was 100.65, yielding 5.399 per cent.
Both the average bid and lowest accepted bid were regarded as surprisingly
high by traders. Total bids were Y2,875bn, giving a bid-to-cover ratio, or
ratio of total bids to the amount sold, of 6.08.
The Finance Ministry sold Y472.65bn - or about 60 per cent of the Y800bn new
issue - at auction yesterday and will offer the remainder through the
underwriters' syndicate. The 5.5 per cent coupon is 50 basis points lower
than the coupon on the bonds issued in December.

CITIBANK confirmed yesterday it sold a quarter of its 40 per cent stake in
Saudi American Bank (Samba) last month to two Saudi government-run pension
institutions, writes Patrick Harverson.
The US banking group would not divulge how much money was raised by the sale
of the 10 per cent stake. The full details of the transaction will be
included in Citibank's fourth-quarter results and based on the current value
of Samba shares, the 600,000 shares sold would have been worth about Dollars
336m.
The US bank decided to sell part of its stake in Samba to boost its capital
ratios for the final quarter.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Buoyant AMD reports surge in

ADVANCED Micro Devices, the Silicon Valley semi-conductor manufacturer,
reported a surge in fourth-quarter sales and a 'virtual stampede of
customers' ordering its version of the 386 micro-processor, the chip used to
power many of the most popular personal computer models.
'In an otherwise lacklustre semiconductor market, all of AMD's growth came
from micro-processors,' said Mr WJ Sanders, chairman and chief executive.
Last year, AMD mounted a challenge to rival Intel's dominance of the
personal computer microprocessor market by launching its own versions of
Intel's widely-used 386 chips.
The companies are involved in a series of complex legal disputes over AMD's
rights to produce the microprocessors.
Fourth-quarter revenues rose by nearly 38 per cent from the like period a
year ago. AMD reported record revenues of Dollars 366.2m and net income of
Dollars 106.7m before payment of preferred stock dividends.
After the preferred dividend, quarterly net income was Dollars 1.17 per
common share. Operating results for the quarter included a charge of Dollars
7m in connection with plans to close down one of the company's oldest
production lines in the second quarter of 1992.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Chemical Banking registers
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL BANKING, the big US banking group formed late last year by the
merger of Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Bank, yesterday reported a loss
of Dollars 420m in the fourth quarter after a restructuring charge of
Dollars 625m.
The charge, which had been expected, was taken to cover the costs of a
merger which created the second biggest banking group in the US. Excluding
the charge, Chemical made an operating profit of Dollars 205m in the last
quarter and Dollars 779m for 1991.
The group's operating earnings in the quarter and the full year were buoyed
by lower short-term domestic interest rates, which helped lift overall net
interest income 28 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn. The steady fall in US interest
rates throughout the year boosted profit margins and reduced funding costs,
while interest payments received from Brazil during the year, but not
included in earnings until the final quarter, contributed Dollars 107m.
Trading revenues were also robust during the quarter, rising slightly to
Dollars 126m. On the costs side, non-interest expenses between October and
December, excluding the restructuring charge, were Dollars 1.16bn, higher
than at the same stage of 1990 but down from the Dollars 1,18bn incurred in
the previous quarter.
Provisions for losses totalled Dollars 450m, of which Dollars 104m was for
an addition to allowances for non-Less Developed Country (LDC) loans, and
Dollars 346m for non-LDC net charge-offs. LDC net charge-offs, including
losses on sales and swaps of debt, reached Dollars 524m.
Wall Street applauded the new bank's quarterly figures, which were better
than analysts' forecasts. On the New York Stock Exchange, Chemical's shares
rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 close of trading.
Later this month Chemical will sell Dollars 1.25bn of common stock, using
the proceeds to boost its capital base. The group currently has assets of
Dollars 139bn and shareholders equity of Dollars 7.3bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA Motor, the Japanese car maker, yesterday further slashed its earnings
estimate for the year to end-March in response to weakening sales at home
and abroad.
Honda said its consolidated after-tax profits would be just Y63.1bn (Dollars
505.6m), against Y76.27bn last year and an earlier forecast of Y80.1bn for
this year.
The company said the revised forecast was due to weakening vehicle markets,
the long US recession and the slowdown of the Japanese economy. The results
would also be affected by a rise in the cost of sales due to intense
competition. Sales were projected at Y4,428.4bn, a rise of about 3 per cent.
Japanese vehicle sales and exports for the 1991 calendar year fell by 4.3
per cent to 1.34m and were expected to decline marginally this year.
The biggest area of decline was in Honda's exports from Japan, which fell by
7.4 per cent to 662,409 units. Domestic car sales have held up well, partly
because of the recent successful launch of the company's new Civic model.
Overseas production is expected to pick up from 653,000 units in 1991 to
672,000 this year.
Parent company net profits are expected to fall by 32 per cent to Y35.3bn,
with sales up from Y2,800bn to Y2,917bn.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: J P Morgan soars 41% to
Dollars 269m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. MORGAN, the New-York based banking group, yesterday capped an
excellent 1991 by reporting fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 269m, opening
what is expected to be a strong quarterly earnings season for Wall Street.
The 41 per cent increase in final-quarter income took total earnings for the
full year to Dollars 1.15bn, up from Dollars 1bn in 1990. When extraordinary
gains last year and in 1990 from the early retirement of debt and from
accounting changes are taken into account, however, Morgan's underlying
earnings actually rose 44 per cent in 1991.
A highly favourable interest rate environment, increased trading revenues,
good growth in fee-related businesses and solid corporate finance results
were behind the increase in fourth-quarter profits, the bank said.
The biggest improvement was seen in net interest revenues, which climbed 45
per cent in the quarter to Dollars 419m as Morgan took advantage of lower
short-term US dollar interest rates and the sharp steepening of the US
dollar yield curve.
On the trading front, increased activity in US and foreign debt and equity
markets, and in swaps and commodities, lifted earnings from trading to
Dollars 245m.
Although this was down from an exceptionally strong third quarter, it was
still well above fourth-quarter 1990 earnings and took overall trading
profits for the year to Dollars 1.3bn, up 41 per cent from the previous 12
months.
In other business areas, investment management contributed Dollars 90m and
fees from operational services another Dollars 87m. Although corporate
finance earnings fell 23 per cent to Dollars 74m, Morgan reported a big rise
in revenues from US corporate bond underwritings. Morgan has taken full
advantage of the recent deregulation of US banking laws that has allowed
banks to play a bigger role in the corporate debt underwriting business.
Operating expenses rose 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 629m, a
reflection of both higher incentive-based compensation payouts and increased
investment in new technology.
Non-performing loans fell slightly to Dollars 642m because of previous
charge-offs of Latin American and other country loans, while the bank put
aside only Dollars 10m for credit losses in the quarter.
Although yesterday's figures were above market estimates, Morgan's shares
fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange at close
of trading as investors took profits in the wake of the stock's recent
record high of Dollars 70 1/2 .

<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the large US retailer, has agreed to sell its 2 per cent
stake in Seiyu, the Japanese supermarket chain operator, writes Barbara Durr
in Chicago.
The sale, worth Y6.5bn (Dollars 52m), will raise some needed cash for the
struggling retailer.
The Chicago-based company has been trying to restructure its core retailing
operations for three years and is engaged in a cost-cutting effort.
This week, it announced it would eliminate some 7,000 jobs in a revamp of
its catalogue marketing service. The latest move was estimated to achieve
cost savings of about Dollars 50m this year.
Sears purchased the small stake in Seiyu in 1976 when the two companies
reached a mutual technology transfer agreement.
Sears suffered losses on its retailing operations during the third quarter
last year, and in the December holiday period it reported a 1.8 per cent
drop in its same store sales against those of 1990.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Securicor decline checked by recovery in
second half at Cellnet operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP recovery in second half profits at Cellnet, the cellular radio
network, helped limit the decline in profits at Securicor Group, the
security, parcels and communication company, writes Richard Gourlay.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 fell 36 per cent to Pounds 33m
(Pounds 51.9m). Cellnet, in which Securicor and its sister company Security
Services have a 40 per cent stake, contributed operating profits of Pounds
31.9m (Pounds 38m). Group sales rose 6 per cent to Pounds 565.1m (Pounds
531.8m).
The profit was struck after a Pounds 2m redundancy charge, most of which
arose in the second half when the effect of the recession had been hardest
felt.
Earnings per share fell from 22.5p to 16.7p and the proposed final dividend
is raised to 1.72p, making a total for the year of 2.336p (2.123p).
Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said the result reflected a sharp increase
in profitability at Cellnet. Towards the end of Securicor's year Cellnet had
started to erode what he called the 'traditional 15 per cent greater margin'
which Vodafone, the market leader, enjoyed on its core sales, ending the
year with a 45 per cent share of the market.
This was partly the result of a rapid increase in the number of users using
Cellnet's call back message facility who on average use the ser- vice 30 per
cent more than ordinary subscribers.
The level of user disconnections had increased for both Vodafone and Cellnet
with Cellnet suffering a marginally higher rate in the year to December.
They both finished the year with an average disconnection rate of a little
less than 25 per cent, Mr Wiggs said.
During the year Securicor made its first interest payment, of Pounds 2.46m,
since the 1988 rights issue. Gearing at the year end was 5 per cent.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.58m to cover losses on closure
of the group's motor dealerships in 1991 and the current year.
Operating profits in the security division, the traditional business, fell
from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 6.95m reflecting reduced demand by large
customers.
The packages delivery business suffered a 75 per cent slump in profits to
Pounds 2.37m. Mr Wiggs said large numbers of customers had switched from
premium to economy services which commanded much reduced margins.
Security Services, Securicor's 50.75 per cent subsidiary, made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 36.1m) on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds
511.23m.
Earnings per share fell to 12p (19.7p) and the proposed final dividend is
3.197p giving a total 10 per cent up for the year at 4.488p.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Papers show Maxwell share support scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE illicit operation by the late Mr Robert Maxwell to support the shares of
Maxwell Communication Corporation may have begun as early as October 1990,
documents obtained by the Financial Times reveal.
Price Waterhouse, administrator of MCC, has focused on Corry Stiftung, a
Liechtenstein foundation, and several other secretive offshore and
continental European trusts in its search for more than Pounds 500m in cash
and assets missing from the company. Copies of bank account statements of
Corry Stiftung show that on October 29, 1990, Pounds 319,476 was taken from
its current account, number 247-935-013 with the Private Trust Bank
Corporation of Vaduz, Liechtenstein, to buy shares in MCC, one of Mr
Maxwell's publicly-listed companies.
Bankers and administrators suspect that Mr Maxwell spent some Pounds 150m in
buying shares in MCC without disclosing his interest - which is illegal -
and that he used MCC's own funds to help do this.
Mr David Lee, who is heading Price Waterhouse's investigation into MCC's
missing assets, said that Corry Stiftung was 'a significant debtor' of MCC,
owing it 'considerably over Pounds 20m'.
The funds for the October 29 share purchase came from a high-interest
account in Liechtenstein, but the source of that money is still unclear.
The documents also show that on November 12, 1990, Pounds 38,570 was taken
from the Corry Stiftung current account to buy more shares in MCC. The term
'EFF-KAUF' in the bank statement stands for Effekten Kauf, or purchase of
securities.
A separate transaction on the bank statement shows how Pounds 4.5m flowed
into Liechtenstein on October 17, 1990, and Pounds 4m out the same day to
PH(US)Inc, a Delaware-incorporated private Maxwell holding company. PH
shares its address in Elmsford, New York, with several Maxwell holding
companies and part of Pergamon Press, the scientific journals publisher
which Mr Maxwell sold last year.
A senior tax executive at Elmsford declined to comment on the relationship
of PH(US)Inc to other Maxwell companies or the purpose of the October 1990
transfer.
However, Mr Lee said that Price Waterhouse was also investigating advances
of 'substantial amounts' in 1991 to PH(US)Inc from Macmillan, MCC's main
business.
Titmuss, Sainer and Webb, the London solicitors who credited Corry's account
with Pounds 4,494,675 on October 17, 1990, say that client confidentiality
prevents them disclosing the source of the money. However, they confirm that
they acted for MCC as well as for Maxwell private companies until they
resigned from MCC after Mr Maxwell's death to prevent conflicts of interest.
Speculation that Mr Maxwell met a violent end was dismissed yesterday by Dr
Iain West, a pathologist who examined the body. The French magazine Paris
Match claimed he had been beaten before death. Dr West, who carried out the
examination with Israeli doctors before burial in Jerusalem, said they found
a lot of blood but all agreed it had been caused by the Spanish autopsy.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Chrysler aims to be a star in Motown: New products need to
show the motor group can beat the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler, is hogging centre stage at the
Detroit motor show.
While the financial community in New York was this week underlining the
troubled carmaker's financial fragility by further relegating Chrysler's
debt into the junk bond realm, Mr Lutz was intent on becoming the smash-hit
in Motown.
He has proved a notable survivor as he has jumped from BMW to Ford to
Chrysler. Now he is seeking to pull off the same trick for his financially
beleaguered company, whose survival is again on the line.
Chrysler desperately needs new products to stem the assault by the Japanese.
Last year for the first time it slipped out of its accustomed third place
behind GM and Ford in the US car market to be overtaken by both Honda and
Toyota.
An ill-judged diversification move deprived Chrysler of funds for new
product development in the mid-1980s, and the group is setting out to prove
that it has rediscovered - in the nick of time - its business core. That is
to design, develop and launch new products that are credible even when
measured against the benchmark of world-class Japanese competition.
The enormous funds needed for new product development mean its survival as
an independent carmaker will be on a knife-edge in the 1990s. Further,
raising new finance has been made more difficult by the downgrading of its
credit to below investment status. But Chrysler is making a brave statement
in Detroit this week.
On successive days it has rolled out to public view:
the limited-production Dodge Viper, a no-compromise, exotic, image-building
sports car with an 8 litre, V10 engine capable of 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds and
a top speed of 165mph;
its Jeep Grand Cherokee, a new top-of-the-range four-wheel drive sports
utility vehicle; and most importantly,
a new generation of large executive saloon cars, the result of a Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 806.7m) development programme.
This, the LH project, is one of the most ambitious product strategies ever
undertaken by Chrysler, and marks its first all-new car programme for more
than a decade. The cars, to be launched in the autumn in North America as
the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision, are aimed at
re-establishing Chrysler in the heartland of the US market for mid-size and
full-size executive cars, where it has lost considerable market share. The
range includes the New Yorker, to be produced next year.
The LH project is the most important result to date of Chrysler's planned
spending of around Dollars 16.6bn from 1991 to 1995 on new product
development and the modernisation of its facilities.
By 1995 it is aiming to replace all its car range, introduce the
sports/utility vehicle, a new pick-up, and develop five new engines and five
transmissions.
It is a daunting task for a company which lost money heavily last year - a
net operating loss of Dollars 553m in the first six months - and which, like
its rivals, is in the grip of the US recession, but unlike its rivals has
little compensating presence outside North America.
This week's product launches should show there is more than rhetoric behind
the Chrysler management's oft-repeated claim, that 'we are re-inventing the
way we do business'.
Mr Lutz insists that the company has made significant progress towards
becoming a 'lean' producer and towards matching Japanese levels of quality,
productivity and efficiency, not only in the manufacturing process, but as
importantly in the design, development and engineering of new products.
Chrysler's relationship with its Japanese partner Mitsubishi Motors has been
stormy, but it has been able to learn the benchmark standards set by the
Japanese at first hand.
With the LH car project, Chrysler claims that it has taken a full year out
of the development cycle, going from final clay model to first production in
3 1/4 years. The team of vehicle engineers was kept to a peak of 743
compared with the original budget of 1,400 and what Mr Lutz refers to
disparagingly as a cast of thousands at Ford and GM. Mr Glenn Gardner
however, who led the LH project, accepts that Chrysler is still '10-15 per
cent behind' Japanese efficiency levels.
The new car project has cost around Dollars 1.5bn, an enormous sum but Mr
Lutz claims it is less than half what Ford spent on its Taurus/Sable range
in the mid-1980s, and less than the Dollars 2bn originally budgeted.
Chrysler cut the number of expensive prototype development vehicles by 25
per cent, but Mr Gardner says it must take out another 20 per cent next
time. It was driving prototype vehicles 95 weeks before launch, 30 weeks
earlier than ever before.
Mr Lutz claims that the management revolution at Chrysler has been led by
the creation of 'platform teams' for each new product development. 'We've
brought perestroika to our company. We took our big, traditional,
monolithic, vertically-oriented hierarchies - our design department, our
engineering department, purchasing, manufacturing, sales and marketing - and
broke them apart and reorganised them into lean, nimble, vehicle-focused
platform teams.'
In its fight for survival and with the failed 1990 merger talks with Fiat
behind it, Mr Lutz says that Chrysler is now 'determined to stay
independent. You cannot motivate your people if there is a 'For Sale' sign
on the building.'
It remains to be seen whether the company's bout of perestroika is also
enough to motivate fickle US car buyers to start choosing Chrysler again.

FT  10 JAN 92 / BA and KLM edge closer to merger: Dutch airline optimistic
of agreement over question of landing rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED tie-up between British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
came a step closer yesterday as KLM said a solution to one of the more
intractable obstacles to the deal, that of landing rights, had 'probably
been found'.
Landing rights for flights by airlines between two countries are set in
government-to-government talks. A merger between BA and KLM might jeopardise
such rights if it seemed that a carrier's status as the national airline
would be undermined.
The news came as KLM attempted to play down the impact of remarks by Mr
Peter Bouw, KLM president.
He said KLM might abandon its name in the interests of a 'common structure
and identity'. Mr Bouw said: 'A consequence of co-operation talks is that
parts of your independence must be given up.'
KLM later said Mr Bouw had made 'informal' and 'general' comments that were
then reported in the Dutch press. It would give no details of the landing
rights agreement. The company's shares nevertheless rose Fl 1.1 to Fl 41.6
on the Amsterdam stock exchange in the hope that a merger was close.
Mr Bouw also said the airlines, which have been in merger talks since
November, had made progress on the form of the planned deal. 'The financial
structure is exceptionally interesting. It contains many innovative
elements,' Mr Bouw said.
He added that the initial move towards closer ties had come from BA. BA
declined to comment on KLM's statement.
KLM and BA revealed in November 1991 that they were in talks on a possible
merger. The combined company would be the largest carrier in Europe,
although it would remain some way behind US carriers such as American
Airlines and United Airlines.
Competition is stiff and airlines have seen profits fall in the wake of last
year's Gulf war. KLM might eventually give up its name 'because BA is the
stronger brand', said Mr Tim Coombs, an analyst with London broker County
NatWest. BA is about three times the size of KLM.
Even if the two airlines come to an arrangement between themselves on
landing rights, problems might still remain to be solved. 'Individual
governments would still be able to object,' said Mr Ian Wild, an analyst at
London securities house BZW.
Any solutions that received government approval could set a precedent for
other cross-border airline mergers.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Liberal Democrats launch Pounds 3.3bn job creation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats opened their pre-election campaign yesterday with the
launch of a 'national recovery and regeneration' programme, including a
Pounds 3.3bn plan to get 400,000 jobless back to work within a year.
Their proposed measures, financed by public sector borrowing, would release
more money for Training and Enterprise Councils.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the party was not
offering 'quick fixes or slick solutions'. The Liberal Democrats are the
only party to commit themselves to such a specific outcome from their
economic remedies. Mr Ashdown promised 'positive politics' in contrast to
what he described as the beginning of a campaign by the other leading
parties 'characterised by insults and half-truths'.
The Tories kept up the attack over Labour's plans to remove the ceiling on
national insurance contributions, while Labour's economic team took the
opposition's campaign to the West Midlands.
At a series of meetings with colleagues in Downing Street, Mr John Major
began two days of discussion on the manifesto and campaign tactics in the
run-up to the election.
In Birmingham, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, called on the prime
minister to use the meetings to produce a programme of action for taking
Britain out of recession.
Accusing ministers of complacency, he said that if the government ducked the
challenge of taking action it 'will have been exposed as unfit to carry the
responsibilities of government'.
The Liberal Democrats also used yesterday's launch to unveil a slogan 'My
vote - Liberal Democrat'.
Its aim is to get supporters to stand up and be counted, enabling the party
to overcome the barrier to its electoral prospects caused by sympathisers'
reluctance to vote for it, fearing the waste of a vote.
The theme will be followed up in a party political broadcast next week.
First steps proposed in the Liberal Democrats' paper include proportional
representation for parliamentary elections, a package - in some ways similar
to Labour's - to increase employment, and the granting of independence to
the Bank of England.
Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign manager, said that in the forthcoming
electoral fight it would move constitutional reform up the political agenda.
The Tories will be the largest party in a hung parliament after the
election, according to a computer prediction of Gallup polls conducted over
the last quarter of 1991 published in the Daily Telegraph today. The
forecast puts the Conservatives (40.3 per cent) one point ahead of Labour
(39.3 per cent), with the Liberal Democrats on 15.2 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The perplexing strength of the UK pharmaceutical sector continues. Glaxo,
Fisons and Wellcome went up 4 per cent yesterday, SmithKline Beecham 3 per
cent. Considering Wellcome and Glaxo were also the FT-SE's best performers
last year, this might suggest the UK market is still in defensive mood. But
the FT-SE's top performers this year so far are all bombed-out high
yielders: Lonrho, Trafalgar House and Guardian Royal Exchange.
The paradox may be partly explained by an appetite for UK drug stocks among
US investors. They might perhaps reflect that whereas their own drug sector
outperformed the US market by only 28 per cent last year, the UK sector
outperformed by 50 per cent. This was chiefly determined by the performance
of Glaxo, which accounts for half the sector by value. But Glaxo's strength
last year was partly due to belated realisation of the promise of its new
drug portfolio. The trouble now is that while the clinical potential of
these drugs has become clear, it is too early to assess their commercial
potential, Zofran excepted. It might be recalled that in mid-1983, when the
promise of Zantac was first fully appreciated, the shares reached their
highest ever multiple of 32. They are now on a multiple of 27. Whether Glaxo
can repeat the growth of the early days of Zantac from a vastly bigger base
is open to doubt. It should also be recalled that in the second half of
1983, Glaxo underperformed the market by 30 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With long gilt yields heading down towards 9 per cent, a level seen only
fleetingly in the past decade, the prospects of an ultra-long issue this
year are growing. When the Bank of England resumed borrowing last year it
confined itself to a maximum maturity of 20 years, partly because of the
high absolute level of rates and partly to tap large overseas demand for
10-year paper. A prospective doubling of new issuance in 1992-93 and heavy
corporate borrowing of 10-year funds now suggest the need for a 25 - year or
even 30-year benchmark issue of some Pounds 3-4bn in all, designed to appeal
to domestic institutions.
The question is one of timing. The Bank is not currently under particular
funding pressure. It will also want a rate low enough to avoid the
imputation that it has less than total faith in Britain's long-term ability
to restrain inflation by keeping sterling in the ERM. The risk of exchange
market upsets before the election argues for delay till the summer or
autumn. If Labour wins, however, the opportunity may then be lost, as
institutions could demand an unacceptable premium for long-term money. The
funding constraints on Labour would thus be twofold. Not only would its
borrowing requirement prompt higher overall rates: it might also have to
bunch its funding towards the short to medium end of the maturity spectrum.

FT  10 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: EC airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, yesterday's report that KLM's chairman is prepared to
sacrifice the airline's name in a deal with British Airways seems
extraordinary. The Dutch are perhaps less touchy about sovereignty than
their EC counterparts. But there is no clearer symbol of national pride than
a country's flag carrier, and hence no greater obstacle to the sort of
cross-border industry rationalisation Europe so sorely needs.
It could be, of course, that Mr Bouw's remarks will simply raise hackles
back home and scupper negotiations. But on the assumption that a two-way
tie-up is now much more likely than the much-hyped grouping with Belgium's
Sabena ever was, the question is what the Brussels competition authorities
will make of it. There is, after all, a widespread perception that a merger
bringing together the two private sector heavyweights would ultimately be
blocked.
In fact, it is hard to see why. Any deal would come under exhaustive
scrutiny from the EC and almost certainly provoke hostility from French and
German lobbies. But while the EC's airline policy may sometimes seem
muddled, it has always recognised that further concentration in a global
market place is finally inevitable. A combined BA and KLM, for instance,
would still be smaller than the three big American carriers. No doubt
changes would be required to stop individual route monopolies and smooth the
way for new entrants. But it is worth remembering that London-Amsterdam is
one of the best served routes; nor is competition exactly lacking on the
North Atlantic. While US experience suggests that cost savings from a merger
are as likely to go into lower fares as into shareholders' pockets, the
numbers are impressive - perhaps Pounds 200m for BA alone.

FT  10 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The curse of the car dealers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,497.9 (+30.8)
The Japanese car industry's agreement to double its use of US-made
components looks a folly almost as monumental as the two countries'
semi-conductor pact of 1986. That agreement led to exaggerated US
expectations of the Japanese market, recurring bilateral friction, trade
sanctions and an embarrassing investigation by the Gatt. It did nothing to
reduce Japan's trade surplus with the US.
The safest bet is that the car pact will be equally damaging, especially as
Japanese manufacturers were already warning on US quality and price
yesterday afternoon. There is little prospect of the deal doing much to help
the beleaguered US industry. But it does contain the seeds of more trade
disputes over the medium term, incidentally putting Tokyo under continuing
pressure to tailor its exchange rate and economic policy to Washington's
requirements. Worse still, the US has shoved Japan a further step down the
road to managed trade, the last thing needed by a fragile world economy.
There are implications at the European corporate level, too. The main impact
is supposed to be on procurement by the US plants of Japanese car companies.
But in so far as Japanese imports of US components and, indeed, finished
cars are also supposed to rise, this will be at the expense of European
manufacturers like Lucas, Bosch, Daimler-Benz, BMW and Rover. Awkwardly for
them, Messrs Bush and Miyazawa have used an old trick of making the deal a
'voluntary' industry-to-industry agreement, which puts it outside the remit
of the Gatt.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Row likely over enterprise zone plan: Government and
Brussels head for clash on scheme for Ravenscraig area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT and the European Commission last night appeared to be on a
collision course over ministers' plans to set up an enterprise zone in north
Lanarkshire to cushion the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks later this
year.
In an apparent attempt to pour cold water on the proposal, Sir Leon Brittan,
the commissioner for competition policy, yesterday expressed concern that
'comments at a very high level' - in this case the prime minister - had
created the impression that setting up the zone was a matter for government
decision.
He said any application would be given 'careful consideration'. The
Commission, which must approve the creation of enterprise zones, is
sceptical about them because it believes the 100 per cent capital allowances
available to developers distort competition and encourage tax avoidance.
Companies in the zones benefit from freedom from planning controls and
business rates. Notable developments in such zones include the Isle of Dogs
in east London, the Metrocentre at Gateshead, Newcastle Business Park and
the regeneration of Manchester docklands as Salford Quays.
Any application would represent a U-turn in British policy. The government
declared that Britain's 27th enterprise zone - set up in Sunderland after
months of wrangling between the government and the European Commission - was
'the last' when it was designated in April 1989. The government backed it
reluctantly and is understood to have been embarrassed by having to fight
Brussels to get it approved. It was allowed only because Sunderland had lost
its entire shipbuilding industry.
At the time, the government spread word among developers that it had turned
against enterprise zones because of their negative effect on taxation and
public spending.
In the House of Lords yesterday, Lord Strathclyde, Scottish Office junior
minister, admitted to being 'unsure' about how long it would take to secure
the Commission's approval. 'It will certainly be a considerable period of
some months,' he said.
After making a government statement on the closure, Lord Strathclyde was
criticised from both sides of the House for failing to take earlier action
to encourage new industrial development in Lanarkshire in anticipation of
the closure. He said Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, had been told on
December 20 by Sir Robert Scholey, chairman of British Steel, of the
decision to close Ravenscraig.
There had been no formal consultation in the sense that the government had a
direct role to play. The minister insisted that job losses arising from the
closure were likely to be about 2,500, not 15,000 as suggested. He stressed
that in response to recommendations made by the Lanarkshire working group,
substantial help had already been provided, and a wealth of planning and
activity was geared towards growth.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Bush seeks to dispel anxieties about his health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday dismissed fears about his health and
predicted he would be re-elected this year.
At the end of an Asian tour overshadowed by his collapse at a state banquet
in Tokyo on Wednesday, Mr Bush blamed a severe bout of gastric 'flu and
pronounced himself on the road to recovery.
Still looking queasy, he appeared at a news conference with Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister. Mr Bush sought to dispel fears that
ill-health might force him to withdraw from the election campaign, and came
close to making his candidacy for the Republican nomination official.
Brushing aside his recent slump in the opinion polls, he expressed
confidence that the US economy would recover.
'I believe I have been a good president . . . and I think we have a strong
case to take to the American people. I believe I am going to win,' he said.
Mr Bush, 67, was hospitalised last year after suffering an irregular
heartbeat diagnosed later as a thyroid complaint.
After the shock of watching televised pictures of Mr Bush lying stricken on
the floor in Tokyo, most Americans appeared to have been reassured by the
president's rapid reappearance in public. Having cancelled breakfast and
lunch appointments, Mr Bush last night had dinner with Emperor Akihito.
Mr Bush intends to portray his 10-day Asian tour as a successful effort to
open export markets and create jobs for American workers when he returns to
Washington today.
In the US, assessments of his trip were mixed. Gloomy comments by car
industry executives from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler may fuel
congressional sentiment towards trade retaliation against Japan.
Mr Richard Gephardt, the Democrat who is the House majority leader, was
quick to attack Mr Bush's performance.
Speaking at the North American Auto Show in Detroit, he said: 'The only
thing that counts is action. Promises are not sufficient.' Mr Gephardt has
introduced a bill that would retaliate against Japanese imports if Japan
failed to eliminate its deficit with the US over the next five years.
Mr Richard Holbrooke, a former State Department official responsible for
Asian affairs, said that Mr Bush had made progress in reducing the trade
imbalance, but at the cost of appearing to blame Japan for the US recession.
Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former US trade official and advocate of tougher
dealings with Japan, criticised the president for over-emphasising the
importance of car exports and underplaying new technology.
Conservative analysts said Mr Bush had compromised his previous support of
free trade to protect his flanks against the 'America first' rhetoric of Mr
Pat Buchanan, the TV commentator whom he faces in the New Hampshire primary
next month.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Letter: Removal of agriculture would open way to concluding
Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord TREFGARNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having served as minister for trade in the Department of Trade and
Industry until the middle of 1990, and thus responsible for leading the
British delegation to the various General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
meetings at that time, may I express a view upon progress since then.
It is, I believe, common ground that much has been achieved and a general
consensus reached in almost all of the negotiating groups, numbering 15 in
all, which go to make up the Uruguay Round.
The major problem remains the resolution of the agricultural question, with
current positions even more entrenched than they were a couple of years ago.
It seems that there is now near certainty that the round will founder on
this issue, thus setting at naught the whole range of good things which have
been achieved in the other groups. Nor is it possible to blame one side or
the other.
While I certainly think that the European Community ought to be willing to
go further to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, I equally think that
our American friends ought to be doing something about the 'beam in their
own eye' before rounding so forcefully on us and our partners. The truth of
the matter is that whether we like it or not the US government and the EC
authorities are obliged to accommodate major vested interests in this field
and a compromise position looks like being impossible to find.
So, what are we to do? I would like to suggest that we now seek to reach a
conclusion to the Uruguay Round by simply removing agricultural products
from its application. Overturning the preconception that the various
subjects are indissolubly interrelated, we could then begin to apply all the
remaining provisions which have been so painfully negotiated. These are now
becoming all the more urgent, given the need to lift so much of the world
economy out of recession. Thereafter, and in the fullness of time, the
agricultural issue can be again addressed in new circumstances and with new
faces at the table.
There is also a strong and growing feeling that the time is fast approaching
when some new insight and drive in the conduct, control and direction of
such negotiations from within the secretariat is necessary. Should the
Uruguay Round fail, a change at the helm will be essential if we are to
salvage anything from the breakdown of these discussions. Lord Trefgarne,

FT  10 JAN 92 / Letter: Training fails if there is no strategy to determine
its aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID JENKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reviewed the recent report of the Chemical Industries Association
('Success of flexible working questioned', January 3).
We believe there are wider problems than the report would seem to suggest
concerning efforts to increase flexibility of staff by extending their range
of skills through training.
The report indicates that a big problem has come to light in the discovery
that tradesmen were deficient in their existing (or 'core') skills: and that
this shortfall delayed the implementation of policies designed to extend
their skills.
From our experience, working with some 40-odd firms across a range of
process industries (including chemicals), we have found that many large
firms have been prepared to spend money on the training of tradesmen (Pounds
500,000 is nothing unusual) but that they have secured only a marginal
return on their investment.
The reasons for failure are common to most of these companies:
First, they have sent tradesmen on training courses without having
determined what additional tasks they wanted their staff to be able to do on
completion of their training.
Second, they have made inadequate provision for their staff to practise at
the workplace those new skills they learned during their training away from
the plant. Without this, newly learned skills are lost.
Finally, few firms make sufficient provision for the practical assessment of
the standard reached by staff in the new skills they have learned. Without
this no employer can be sure that a tradesman is competent to apply these
skills safely: he is unable to judge whether he has got value for money
spent on training: and (here our findings mirror those of the CIA) it is
unwise for him to offer extra pay for additional skills unless he has a
system to ensure that each person has first reached the required standard.
In short, our experience suggests that for companies to benefit from greater
flexibility from staff who have received training, they must first devise a
practical strategy that addresses the issues of aims, skill practice and
assessment.

FT  10 JAN 92 / A muffin on wheels: Honda's US credentials are under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounds as American as a blueberry muffin and almost as down-home and
wholesome: 'The amazing new car from Ohio,' runs the advertising slogan,
'that goes around corners, up hills and overseas.'
The car in question is an estate model of the Accord, America's top-selling
car, which is assembled in Marysville, Ohio, by the Japanese company, Honda.
Since the launch of the estate version just over a year ago, Honda has been
using this patriotic sales pitch in an attempt to woo the American public,
saying the wagon is the first Japanese car entirely designed and built in
the US. It is also the first Honda vehicle exported from the US to Europe,
and some of the cars have even been sold to Japan.
The implication is that Honda is a thoroughly admirable US corporate
citizen, busily creating American jobs. It has certainly gained that
reputation in the decade since it became the first Japanese car company to
set up a manufacturing plant (a so-called 'transplant') in the US, back in
1982. It has invested Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the country and now
employs 10,000 people. It says that 65 per cent of its vehicles sold in the
US are manufactured in north America and that these have a 75 per cent local
content.
This benign image is under attack, with US car parts manufacturers claiming
that the domestic content of Honda's cars may be far less than the Japanese
company maintains.
The issue of car trade between Japan and the US has been brought to
prominence this week by the presence of leaders of the US auto industry  -
including the chairmen of the Big Three motor manufacturers, GM, Ford and
Chrysler - on President George Bush's trip to Japan. A crucial feature of
the visit was the president's attempts to persuade the Japanese to buy more
US parts and finished vehicles. In Washington, congressional Democrats have
been pressing for tougher trade legislation against Tokyo, particularly to
restrict US sales of Japanese vehicles. Japanese manufacturers now account
for some 31 per cent of the US car market.
This advance has important implications for US-Japan trade relations. The
auto parts industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the US, with 1990
sales of more than Dollars 100bn, and the automobile sector accounts for
three-quarters of America's Dollars 41bn trade deficit with Japan.
With the US in recession and a presidential election fast approaching,
political pressures are mounting for action on the deficit, particularly the
automotive component of it.
In spite of all the huffing and puffing in Washington, the American public
has an increasing taste for Japanese cars and suspects that many of the US
motor industry's problems, at home and in Japan, are of its own making.
This explains the ferocity with which the US auto parts manufacturers have
turned their propaganda guns on Honda's US operations. If this 'transplant'
pioneer can be shown to be less American than it seems, the case for
restrictive legislation will be that much stronger.
Honda is under fire on two fronts. The first involves a study by the
University of Michigan, paid for by a lobbying body for the US auto parts
industry. The study examined a 1989 Honda Accord assembled in the US and
found that imports from Japan accounted for 38 per cent of the value of its
parts, while a further 46 per cent was from Japanese suppliers which had set
up plants in the US. A mere 16 per cent of the parts came from US-owned
suppliers.
Honda disputes the figures - although it pleads commercial confidentiality
in refusing to give its own - and says that, in any case, they are out of
date and that its domestic content has increased 'substantially' since 1989.
The second controversy concerns the company's manufacture of small Civic
cars at a plant in Canada, using some parts shipped from the US. Many of the
finished vehicles are then exported to the US and, under the terms of the
US-Canada free-trade agreement, must have a 50 per cent north American
content to qualify for duty-free entry.
However, a preliminary audit by US customs officials apparently estimated
that less than 40 per cent of the car was north American and that the
company owed Dollars 20m in duties.
Again, Honda strongly denies the allegation and points out that the US
customs department has yet to lay down formal regulations as to just what
constitutes north American content. The Treasury in Washington, to which the
customs officials report, will only say that the audit is incomplete,
involves 'vastly complicated' legal and political issues, and will not be
finished until February.
Customs regulations apart, there is no requirement - other than political
expediency - for Honda or any other Japanese automobile manufacturer with US
transplants to buy a specific quantity of parts from local suppliers. Nor is
there any requirement that these suppliers be US-owned companies rather than
Japanese parts transplants, more than 300 of which have followed the
automobile assemblers to the US.
However, American critics charge that the assemblers and parts transplants
have simply brought with them the Japanese keiretsu system, involving
extended families of companies linked by cross-shareholders, directorships
and business relationships. It is alleged that assemblers such as Honda,
Toyota and Nissan set the prices for captive Japanese suppliers, some of
which may be dumping parts in the US.
The most vocal accusers also suggest - although they produce no clear
figures to support the allegation - that many of the transplant parts
factories may be relying heavily on parts which are essentially manufactured
in Japan but can be claimed as American by labelling, painting or testing
them in the US.
But a Honda spokesman dismisses the claim as 'political, and made by people
who have never been in manufacturing'. He also points out that Honda is the
only car manufacturer to make small engines for its vehicles in the US,
since even Detroit's Big Three companies now import theirs from Asia.
Nor has Honda been immune from the US recession: the group yesterday
forecast a 17 per cent drop in annual net income, owing to declining demand
in the US and Japan.
Other Japanese companies suggest that many US companies have been unable to
compete on grounds of cost and quality. But Mr Jack Reilly, chief executive
of Tenneco Automotive, a leading US parts maker, and chairman of the parts
committee which commissioned the Honda study, disputes this and says
sarcastically: 'It is incredibly difficult to believe that the world's
largest parts supply base is competitive on cost and quality only on 16 per
cent of the transplant business.'
Whatever the truth, Mr Richard Gephardt, the Democratic House majority
leader, and Democratic congressmen from the automobile manufacturing state
of Michigan, announced just before Christmas that tough new legislation
would be introduced.
The bill would lower the ceiling on Japanese car sales over a five-year
period if Tokyo did not reduce its trade deficit with the US by 20 per cent
a year. The bill also contains provisions designed to push the Japanese
companies into using a much higher proportion of US components in their
vehicles. Mr Gephardt and others complain that while Japanese parts are
flooding the US market, the Japanese market remains virtually shut to
American parts makers, thanks to the keiretsus and the Japanese distribution
system.
But the prospects for the bill are uncertain, not least because the
administration opposes it. The White House argues that negotiation rather
than legislative mandate is the way to solve the trade imbalance.
The Japanese are concerned about the backlash, as demonstrated by their
announcement this week of plans to increase substantially their purchases of
foreign-made parts and cars. But the figures still fall well short of US
demands and will take years to achieve, not least because it is difficult to
change parts suppliers until new vehicle models are introduced. So the US
industry's Japan-bashing is not about to stop.
However, the US position might be stronger if the various departments of the
federal government could agree on what constitutes an 'American' car. For
while customs officers are questioning the provenance of Honda's Canadian
models, other US trade officials have been challenging French claims that
those Accord wagons exported to the European Community from Ohio should be
classified as Japanese vehicles.
Not so, says Washington; they are as American as blueberry muffins.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Kick-starting global growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OF THE plethora of initiatives dreamed up by Japanese and US policy-makers
over the last few days, their joint strategy for world growth is actually
rather tame. Ignore the froth: the world economy is not on the verge of a
depression, and panic measures by worried governments would probably do more
harm than good. Both the US and Japan have already taken the necessary steps
to ensure that their economies will grow in 1992; the 'package' contains
nothing new.
It is the growth-starved countries of western Europe, not the US or Japan,
that need stimulus. It is these countries which are desperately seeking
policies for low-inflationary growth this year. Judged by the negative
European reaction to Mr David Mulford's pleas for them to join the
pro-growth chant, he could be forgiven for thinking that growth in Europe
has become a dirty word.
The US Treasury under-secretary's pleas are nothing new. Washington has been
trying to persuade the rest of the group of seven industrialised countries
to cut interest rates, and use fiscal policy to reflate the world economy,
for the best part of a year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has been
practising what the administration has preached. A succession of interest
rate cuts has reduced US real rates to below 1 per cent.
The US has little room to manoeuvre a fiscal reflation. The joint communique
does confirm that a pre-election US tax package will be announced later this
month. But the size of the US fiscal deficit, and the risk that relaxing
policy might actually raise US long rates, mean that the package will
largely consist of pre-election lollipops.
Play along
Japan has so far been the only country willing to play along with the US.
Its monetary policy has eased steadily over the past year, with the latest
cut in the discount rate coming just before Mr Bush arrived in Tokyo.
Predictable politics; but also precisely the right policy for Japan. Yet
once again, the communique says little new about Japanese policy. The
promise to ease fiscal policy in 1992 is merely the modestly expansionary
budget package announced in December. With a projected general government
budget surplus of around 2 per cent next year, Japan certainly has room to
ease further if it wishes to.
Crude bashing
If it is Europe, not the world, that needs a strategy for economic growth,
crude bashing of Germany, or more particularly the Bundesbank, are not the
answer. High German short-term interest rates, to curb German wage
inflation, have raised the real interest rates of the members of the
European exchange rate mechanism to choking proportions. But the Bundesbank
is no more required to take account of this wider, European impact of its
policies than other ERM countries are required meekly to follow its lead.
One option they do have is to call for an upward realignment of the D-Mark.
But this poses a difficult dilemma. It would probably deliver higher rather
than lower interest rates outside Germany because of the risk that it would
happen again. But, if large enough, it would ease inflationary pressures by
squeezing Germany's export sector, thereby allowing German rates to fall
faster.
Alternatively, a tighter German fiscal policy would further squeeze German
domestic demand, thereby allowing an easier monetary policy. It is Mr Helmut
Kohl, not Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who needs to be lectured on how to be a
good European. Nor is there any good reason why fiscal consolidation in
Germany should not be combined with offsetting fiscal expansion in the rest
of Europe. Certainly France and the UK, though not Italy, have sufficiently
low levels of public debt and budget deficits to afford more public
investment or lower taxes aimed at stimulating private investment.
There is a further element which should be included in any growth strategy.
The failure of the Uruguay Round would do at least as much as slow growth to
raise 'the spectre of world protectionism' that the communique fears. Both
Mr Bush and Europe's farm ministers should act on this before it is too
late.

City analysts tired of lambasting the management of their sector companies
should perhaps beware of trying to do better at the head of their own
business.
Take the example of Douglas Hawkins, who left James Capel as a respected
electronics analyst in 1988 to run Office &amp; Electronic Machines. At the time
fellow analysts thought he was taking on a tough assignment at the
loss-making company which had been beset by managerial chaos and lumbered
with outdated equipment distribution contracts. Now 40-year-old Hawkins has
resigned as executive chairman and chief executive, although remaining
non-executive chairman.
While Hawkins did not return Observer's calls, the share price - which when
he joined rose 38p to 143p and is presently languishing at 41p - tells most
of the story.

Members of the club, limited to former receptionists at London's Savoy

Founder Gastronome Julian Payne, who went on to senior positions at the
Savoy, Dorchester and the Ritz, says the club's first dinner, in 1971, took

eating in its private dining rooms. It has, however, since relented.

Etonians will no doubt be relieved by news from Outer Mongolia that a

he was banged up just before Christmas.
Mongolbank International chairman Sukh-Erdene, who was accorded the neckwear
and dubbed an honorary un-official Etonian two years ago, had been arrested
along with the central bank governor over some unpleasantness concerning
Dollars 82.4m (Pounds 45.2m) allegedly missing as a result of bungled
foreign-exchange transactions.
The incident aroused much excitement in Mongolia. The 31-year-old
Sukh-Erdene is great grandson of national hero Sukh-Bator, who led the 1921
revolution. And the descendant's honorary Etonian status is apparently
regarded as scarcely less distinctive.
It was bestowed on him at a Mongolian Embassy reception after he had
recognised the Etonian tie sported by Nicholas Wolfers, group adviser at
Midland Bank. In Outer Mongolia, they apparently still teach bankers to spot
such key characteristics.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Arts: Sweet Desserts - New End Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE ARMITSTEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last time I went to Hampstead's ever hospitable New End Theatre it was
staging a play about Sophie Tucker and had plates of lip-shaped candies
lying around; for this scrumptious two-handed adaptation of Lucy Ellmann's
novel Sweet Desserts, the foyer is choc-full of naughtiness. Guilt comes, as
guilt does, by the packet or the scoop: by the time the audience is seated
in the theatre, it has slumped neatly into three camps - the binger, the
banter and the effortless abstainer. For the bingers and banters, at least,
it is a treat, unnecessarily repetitive towards the end, but providing
little thrills of recognition while tweaking insistently at those little
hairs at the nape of one's neck.
Ellmann's novel is a stylist's confessional, about growing up and coming to
terms with all the difficult things in life - like siblings and sex and the
curious magnetism of the fridge. In the oversubscribed tradition of
foodie-fantasy it stands apart, belligerently odd in style and structure, a
parody of its own genre, but with an unmistakable ring of truth.
Suzy and Fran are sisters divided by four years and a monstrous rivalry;
united by their taste in food and in men. Charlotte Jones and Elizabeth
Lynton's adaptation embraces the eccentricity of the book with a performance
style that is bouncy, graceful and witty. A loftily staged dance sequence of
sexual postures is typically brought thudding down to earth with the
reflection: 'Hmm. Sperm, how many calories?'
Lynton gives a compelling Fran, small, sharp and ordered in her movement as
in her life, pushing Suzy out from the centre of the story. So absorbing is
the characterisation, that I found myself looking at the taller,
looser-limbed Jones some 30 minutes in and noting with some surprise that
she is not in fact tubby at all.
They must have had as much fun assembling their soundtrack as Ellmann had
pasting in the shards of instruction, poetry and agony-aunt letters that
punctuate her story. For the purgatory of dieting, Mozart's Requiem; for the
death of the girls' mother, throat-catching Tammy Wynette; for the various
men in their lives a Peter and the Wolf-style sequence of signature tunes
ranging from Match of the Day to 'Nessun Dorma'. It is hardly heavy-weight
stuff, but it provides an astute sideways look at what one could dub the
culture of sex and drugs and rocks and rolls.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is no longer enough to mark a composer's anniversary with performances of
one or two works. A recorded edition of his complete oeuvre is the least
that seems to be acceptable and The King's Consort is duly engaged on a
substantial survey of Purcell's music in preparation for the tricentenary of
his death in 1995. The group's concert on Wednesday marked the completion of
its project to record the Odes, which has taken five years. The choral music
is now to follow.
One can argue that a less organised approach by various different performers
would ultimately yield more insight. But where the public gains from these
large complete series is in discovering a lot of very worthwhile music that
is unrecorded and might otherwise remain so.
The Odes were written as occasional pieces, marking the birthday of the
Queen or lauding the King on his return to Court. The poetry is often weak
and embarrassingly fawning by today's standards. But the opportunity to hear
all of the Odes does enable us to judge how rarely Purcell let his standards
slip, even for the least auspicious occasion.
This programme opened with Why are all the Muses mute?, written as a Welcome
Song for King James in 1685. It is not one of the most memorable of the
genre, for it lacks well-made tunes, but Purcell's inspiration is never
dormant: the opening lines are appropriately declaimed by the singers before
the orchestra is allowed to start the Overture and at the end the words 'his
fame shall vanish' provoke a delicious final paragraph that simply fades
away.
Together with Come, ye Sons of Art it gave a good idea of The King's Consort
in action. Robert King is not ambitious for the music, as other Purcell
supporters such as Gardiner and William Christie are in their different
ways, but he directs agreeably stylish performances of good technical
quality. His solo singers add a touch of class and the crowded hall will
have enjoyed James Bowman and Michael Chance together in 'Sound the
trumpet'.
For the larger of the Purcell Odes and Handel's My heart is inditing they
were joined by the Choir of New College, Oxford, confident young singers if
a little light in the bass, while James O'Donnell was the neat soloist in
Handel's Organ Concerto, Op. 7 No. 3. Well, Handel's next anniversary does
not come round until 2059, but with an output as vast as his somebody should
be starting now.

For a week every January, the invaluable Park Lane Group stages pairs of
concerts nightly on the South Bank, with up-and-coming performers in
contemporary music - no longer '20th-century music', since our century is on
its last legs. This year Luciano Berio and Alexander Goehr are the 'featured
composers', along with 46 more: a generally younger bunch than in past
years, and less oriented to the old Darmstadt-Dartington axis. That may have
something to do with this year's programme-committee chairman, the pianist
Andrew Ball, a tireless exponent of new music.
Still, some of the most interesting music has come from the 60-year-old
Goehr. A piano piece he wrote for Peter Serkin in 1988 has acquired four
sibling pieces, collectively entitled  ..in real time because they are
constructed in strict temporal proportions.
Though the set is due for its full premiere at Southampton University in
May, Garth Hall was allowed to give the first piece its UK premiere on
Tuesday, and Andrew Zolinsky to introduce II, III and IV on Thursday.
My ears are not well tuned to Goehr's quasi-neo-classical experiments from
the earlier '80s; but these new studies are original, fascinating and most
un-Goehr-like in their sensuous appreciation of the sound of the instrument.
Furthermore, the lovely transparency of their sound is inseparable from
their ingenious musical means. Mostly the writing is quite spare (though not
undecorated), except in the dramatic and rhythmically elaborate no. III; the
harmony, however, has rich implications which expand the canvas of each
piece. Curiously enough, the piano-music they most often recall is late and
late-middle Skryabin, which must be an accident.
Between them, Hall and Zolinsky also delivered Berio's four studies after
the Four Elements. Hall excelled in Air (which despite its theme echoes
Debussy's 'Poissons d'or' pretty generously), Zolinsky in the spectacular
Fire (here 'Feux d'artifice' was more apropos). Hall dispatched Colin
Matthews' 5 Studies in Velocity neatly, though with a touch of rhythmic
looseness that affected his Samuel Barber sonata too; Zolinsky made
something magical of Karen Tanaka's tiny, refined 'Crystalline', and boarded
Poul Ruders' doughty, obsessive Dante-Sonata with assurance.
There isn't space to sing the praises of Tuesday's sensational
piano-accordionist James Crabb - the 'classical' repertoire for his
instrument is rapidly increasing, luckily - nor of Neyire Ashworth, a
clarinettist of terrific character and imagination. Never mind: their
careers will take care of themselves.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Management: Sharpening up the safety drills - North Sea / A
look at moves to tighten procedures in the offshore oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Sea oil operators have always stuck to a complex set of regulations on
safety.
But since an explosion ripped through the Piper Alpha platform
three-and-a-half years' ago, killing 167 men, the industry has overhauled
its approach to offshore safety.
'The fact that Piper Alpha could happen fundamentally changed the industry's
perception,' said Harold Hughes, director general of the UK Offshore
Operators Association, the industry trade group.
'We thought the systems in place would stop an incident such as that before
it turned into a major conflagration.'
The change in the approach to safety management was embodied in the Cullen
report on the Piper Alpha disaster.
Lord Cullen recommended technological innovations to improve safety, such as
the installation of emergency shutdown valves, and the industry has spent
more than Pounds 1bn on hardware since the report was published. But more
importantly, he urged a revamp in the way safety was managed.
Lord Cullen called for a move away from proscriptive measures taken in the
past, where safety regulations would be laid down in minute detail, to a
more flexible regime which left individual companies to develop their own
guidelines.
'The industry had got itself into the position where it tried to dictate
what to do in every circumstance, said Bob Sheppard, production manager at
the UK arm of Amoco, the major US oil company.
'If everyone just follows the rules without thinking, you have removed one
of the most effective safety checks, and that is individual initiative.'
By the end of this year, all of the companies operating in the UK sector of
the North Sea must hand over their safety management guidelines for review
to the Health and Safety Executive which took responsibility for offshore
safety after the Cullen report.
The Offshore Safety Bill is also expected next month to enshrine many of
Lord Cullen's recommendations into law. But the oil unions have been
critical of the speed of implementation.
Ronnie MacDonald from the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee says that many
of Lord Cullen's safety recommendations are still being ignored.
In their defence, companies point to the mammoth task of drawing up a safety
case for each North Sea installation which must then be checked by the HSE.
For Amoco, that means developing safety guidelines for each of its 32
installations - all of which are based on the company's central management
philosophy but are tailored to the particular risks of the facility.
Sheppard has been working with employees to update the company's safety
procedures for the past three years and stresses the importance of involving
workers across the company from an early stage. 'One of the things we found
is that safety is often perceived as someone else's problem, whereas we
wanted everyone to see it as his or her responsibility.'
After consultations with employees on safety measures and talks with
executives on how these fit into the company's business plan, Sheppard has
drawn up a volume of guidelines on safety management which must then be
communicated to workers across the company.
He says the most difficult thing has been to draw the line between
formulating exhaustive regulations and giving no management guidance at all.
'We want a system that is flexible enough to be easily changed by the
workforce.'
The new approach to safety management tries to address the root cause of any
emergencies that may arise, rather than safety drills and evacuation
procedures which are already well-rehearsed. Sheppard points out that the
procedure for any general maintenance job would, under the old regime, have
been detailed point by point.
'Under the new regime, we are trying to examine the rationale behind that
procedure and whether it gives us a way to spot the hazards and do the work
in a really safe way.'
This approach to safety has been greeted with a certain amount of scepticism
by the company's employees. For this reason, Sheppard stresses the
importance of encouraging workers to come up with new safety ideas and then
acting on them. 'The management must also demonstrate that safety is good
business practice and that the individual will not be penalised if he
decides to close an installation because of a perceived safety problem.'
The system in place on each installation is checked by a series of audits
conducted by competitors as well as the company itself each year.
'This is not an old-style count of the safety hats and shoes, but a look for
suggestions as to where concrete improvements in the system can be made,'
said Sheppard.
But MacDonald suggests that there are improvements to be made even in
counting the safety equipment. He describes a gas leak that took place on
one of Chevron's Ninian platforms in early December. When it came to the
evacuation procedure, there were not enough of the survival suits - clothing
designed to protect workers from a drop into the sea - to go round.
Hughes at UKOOA acknowledges that there could be a problematical period
during the next two to three years as new legislation is still to be passed
and old rules are being phased out. He says that change must be gradual. But
in a business where employees' lives are at risk every day, managers cannot
afford to make mistakes.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Management: When service with a smile is missing by a mile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is it that supposedly excellent service organisations seem to slip up
when my friends, family or I have dealings with them? If it were just
because we are a pernickety lot, then we would presumably harbour the same
complaint about the quality of products.
But we don't: in our experience, products with really good reputations
generally seem to live up to their promise these days.
The reasons usually given for the patchy quality of most services relate to
their supposed intangibility, and to their undoubtedly high reliance on that
most fallible of factors, the human being. But there is more to the problem
than that - as several supposed paragons need to recognise. Take Federal
Express. The air courier company has become the subject of countless
business school case studies on service excellence, and in 1990 it was the
first leading service company to win America's Malcolm Baldrige National
Quality Award.
Yet I have refused to use FedEx ever since the mid-1980s, when I was billed
for months in error for a package sent from New York to London. To add
insult to injury, the company sent its threatening letters from Paris, and
in French] Neither its Paris office nor its UK counterpart ever acknowledged
my desperate protestations to them.
Similar stories from a business acquaintance suggest that such problems
arise not merely from the human errors of a few operatives, but from system
design faults.
Then there are Marriott and Hyatt Hotels, few of whose staff around the
world I have ever found as helpful as they are supposed to be. The Marriott
name has earned a double black mark in my book for supplying food tasting
like disinfectant on successive airline flights from three different
airports a couple of years ago.
Again, individual human error could hardly have been the cause of precisely
the same recurrent lapse in quality - there must have been some sort of
system fault.
Hertz car rental I shall avoid for ever - in America anyway - because of the
chaos of its Boston airport operation one day in 1988, when a
thrice-promised shuttle bus failed to show up, and I then had to queue for
over an hour to collect a pre-booked car.
Which brings us to the most instructive case of all, British Airways. In
almost every respect, the quality and consistency of BA's service improved
immeasurably during the 1980s. One came to expect the sort of dependability
which is praised to the skies - as is that of FedEx and Marriott - in a
useful new handbook on the management of product and service quality by an
American consultant, Richard Whitley.* But then, as the recession tightened
its grip in 1991, things began to slip.
Take just three experiences. First, the number of ticket desks at Heathrow
was pared to the bone, creating long queues of angry passengers.
Second, during the Gulf crisis, my wife's written questions to BA about
apparent security lapses were answered by its customer service staff only
with considerable delay and meaningless platitudes.
Worst of all, BA's upgraded Economy class service on long distance flights -
much-hyped under the 'World Traveller' label since January 1991 - has been
marred by the meanness of its legroom.
Most of its 747s have less space not only than many BA competitors, but also
than the airline's own European flights. What on earth can be the sense of
providing less space on long distance than on short-haul flights?
Whereas BA's inadequate response to the security query was, one hopes, a
single individual's lapse from the normally prescribed level of service, the
ticket desks and seating problems are both system faults: dubious economies
in the design of products which form part of a service.
For my money - which I now prefer to pay to roomier rivals such as American
Airlines, or even shabby TWA - the legroom issue is so fundamental on a long
flight as to rupture entirely BA's much-promoted 'service promise' of
all-round high quality.
In 1990, BA claimed that it could not afford the Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m in
annual lost revenue and engineering costs that the provision of an extra two
inches of legroom would involve. Now, faced with roomier transatlantic
rivals offering much higher service quality than did Pan American and TWA,
it may find it cannot afford not to.
For FedEx, Marriott, BA and their many would-be emulators of 'excellence',
what are the lessons of these lapses?
First, that product and service quality are intertwined in intimate fashion.
Quality service is not merely a question of getting one's front-line staff
to behave impeccably in every one of their hundreds of daily customer
contacts - which Jan Carlzon, the saviour of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS)
almost a decade ago, rightly called 'moments of truth'.
Second, every aspect of the product and service must be designed, produced
and delivered correctly - every time, and ad infinitum. As BA and especially
SAS have found, the people-intensity of a service makes its quality far
harder to sustain than that of a product.
Third, as Whiteley's book argues, companies must adopt more of the
measurement and research techniques which are available to transform many
intangible aspects of a service into tangibles. By measuring constantly
every customer - and employee - attitude in sight, BA has done a more
professional job than most, even if it sometimes turns a blind eye to the
results.
Fourth, service companies must realise that as the pace of innovation
quickens, and as many markets - such as airlines - become liberalised or
simply more competitive - like retailing - last year's 'excellent' service
may be this year's also-ran.
Underlying everything is the fact that customers who now demand a
consistently high level of quality in products - even in low-priced ones -
are starting to do the same in services. Such high expectations are fostered
still further by the sort of hyperbolic advertising campaigns which service
organisations, especially airlines, tend to run.
In the past, customers took such overblown claims with a generous bag of
salt. In future they will be less forgiving. They will penalise
organisations which fail to sustain the promised level of quality. They
will, like yours truly, take their business elsewhere.

physics might be the same, but the technology to tackle the problems has
changed and with it the role of the engineer. They can't afford to have
hangovers.'
The pace of technological change in the concert hall has been dictated by
developments in digital electronics and other equipment for recording
studios. There have also been advances in other facets of the sound process
and, in particular, the attention paid to acoustic technology.
Despite the engineers' metamorphosis, the actual procedure for staging a
concert has changed little over the past decade. All instruments are plugged
into a stage box - an electronic collection point - which contains a
pre-amplifer to boost the signal. The signal is split, one half going to the
main 'front of house' mixing desk and the other to a smaller mixing console
which serves the performers on stage. At the main mixing desk an engineer
processes the sound through filters, effects and the main amplifier. The
level of sound is then set and the signal passes to the main PA (public
address) speakers.
Concert sound quality of all musical persuasions in the 1960s, 1970s and
early 1980s was dictated by the size of the amplifiers, small by today's
standards, which were frequently turned up to full volume and carried
consequent distortion. Further sound quality was eroded by the use of
traditional electronic components like copper wires, valve technology and
the poor siting of speakers.
But in the early 1980s developments in digital technology began to filter
their way into the recording studio. Before long, artists had begun to
demand the same equipment live to reproduce their studio performance.
Most mixing consoles still use analogue technology, but augmented by an
increasing amount of digital equipment, particularly in effects units,
amplifiers and transformers. Technicians have also concentrated their
development efforts on nearly every other aspect of the production process.
'While there hasn't really been a great leap forward in any one direction,
there has been a great amount of fine tuning in most areas,' says Steve
Spencer, sales manager at Britannia Row, Europe's leading concert equipment
hiring organisation.
Speakers, for example, are being made lighter and more responsive by using
ceramic instead of alloy magnets. Harder kevlar cones are replacing
traditional paper ones. Many of the developments are being achieved by
small, independent companies specialising in one or two areas of the
production cycle.
Turbosound, for example, a Sussex-based company which has become a leading
supplier in the world concert market, has developed a bullet-shaped horn and
phase plug which sits at the face of the speaker cone, concentrating the
energy from the speaker and producing a crisper sound.
Other areas have also advanced. The stage box is now a complex centre of
active electronics, the sound signal boosted by a digital amplifier and
split electronically rather than simply by a division of the carrying cable.
The cables themselves are starting to benefit from fibre optics, replacing
the heavy copper wiring and producing a clearer defined signal.
Amplifiers have also benefited from development. 'The improvement in
amplifiers in the last 10 years has been quite considerable,' says Jon
Lemon, an engineer who has worked most recently with the Pet Shop Boys and
Level 42. 'They're now producing a sharper, cleaner sound with much greater
power due to better components.'
Technological developments are only part of the story. Griffiths, who works
for Travers Morgan, one of a growing number of acoustic consultancies, says
there has also been a change in attitude by production staff to the physics
of concert quality. 'Engineers are looking at acoustics much more. It's not
enough to have two stacks of speakers at a venue pointing at the audience
and hope the sound will be alright, because often it won't, even with the
most advanced system.'
The concept driving better quality is 'line array', which determines the
coverage pattern of the speakers and gets the best coverage of sound to a
particular area. To achieve this, engineers employ an Audio Spectrum
Analyser (ASA) which measures the depth and level of sound across a given
area. It divides the concert hall space into octaves in the range of 20Hz to
20KHz.
Pink noise - made by a sound generator and reminiscent of the hiss of
compression brakes - is generated through the speakers. Microphones,
connected to the ASA at strategic points in the auditorium, measures the
amount of pink noise. An LCD display then tells the engineer which areas of
the hall need compensating.
It is in areas such as sound compensation where the development of digital
technology, and in particular digital signal processing (DSP), has made
itself felt. DSP works by converting sound signals into a digital data
stream which is fed through computers and manipulated by the engineer.
Spencer reckons that a modern sound system for a major concert tour will
cost in the region of Pounds 750,000 - twice as much as it did a decade ago.
But there have been major savings along the way. 'Smaller and lighter
equipment has meant a considerable saving on transport and labour costs,' he
says. 'A major tour today will use just one articulated lorry for the sound
equipment where four would have been needed a decade ago.'
One effect of the improved quality has been the demands of performers. All
want the top-of-the-range, state-of-the-art systems at their concerts. 'Iron
Maiden and Frank Sinatra both used the same system on their last tours,'
says Spencer. 'Ten years ago one would have approached the problem of their
sound needs differently, but not any more.'

<TEXT>
Interior lighting and air conditioning, two elements of cars which usually
receive little promotional attention from manufacturers, have been the
subject of intensive development by research engineers at Nissan.
Their results provide another example of how Japanese manufacturers are
prepared to probe into unlikely nooks and crannies of product development in
search of market advantage.
The interior lighting comprises a computer-controlled system with an array
of functions which 'welcome' occupants aboard and make it easier, for
example, to find small objects which often roll under seats.
The air-conditioning system has the ability to simulate a natural breeze,
while taking account of weather conditions outside the car.
Nissan claims to have spent three years developing its interior lighting
system, which uses 21 light sources scattered around the car. It has been
designed according to two criteria: to facilitate activities such as map
reading, and to create a comfortable ambience.
Aircraft-style roof spotlights are provided for driver and front passenger.
Because such concentrated light over a small area can produce eye strain,
soft bands of 'fill-in' light can be projected on to the roof lining from
the pillar areas. The floor and under-seats are illuminated by indirect
lighting.
The air-conditioner, which is fitted in Nissan's new CIMA Type 3 luxury
saloon, blows air into the interior using a fan and four ducts. The fan is
micro-processor controlled both to vary its speed, apparently at random, and
to adjust itself in response to temperature changes and sunlight.
The four ducts are covered by motor-driven louvres. These can change the
direction of the impelled air and its 'focus' from highly concentrated
'spot' delivery - used when occupants first get into a hot car - to a more
diffused type, with the air flowing gently back and forth across the car.

PROVING yet again that the simplest ideas are the most effective, a French
company has combined a spirit level with a line winder to produce a tool
which could benefit even the most clumsy do-it-yourself addict.
The Filabulle, marketed by Rauh, of Paris, allows one person to check
surfaces of up to 50 yards. A hook at the end of the line winder - a length
of string which unwinds like a tape measure - fastens the line to the
surface to be checked. The line is then unwound and the small spirit level
slides along the cord. If the surface is not horizontal, the correct plane
can be found by raising or lowering the line winder.

The 16.5-inch screen uses thin film transistor technology in which each of
the pixels (picture elements) that make up the screen is controlled by three
transistors - one for each primary colour. The latest Sharp picture has more

SPENDING on R&amp;D in the US in 1992 will grow in real terms by less than 1 per
cent over 1991, according to the annual forecast from Battelle, the
Columbus, Ohio-based research organisation.
Battelle predicts that annual spending will reach Dollars 155.9bn (Pounds
85.6bn) this year, an increase of just 2.8 per cent on the Dollars 151.6bn
that the National Science Foundation estimates was spent on R&amp;D in 1991.
When inflation at 2 per cent is taken into account, this reduces the
increase to less than 1 per cent - compared with the 3.3 per cent average
annual increase in spending between 1981-84.
Industrial funding will account for 51.6 per cent of the total, says
Battelle, with federal funding accounting for 43.3 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SEWAGE sludge is a problem most people try to ignore. But with legislation
to be enforced in the EC in 1998 which forbids the dumping of sludge at sea,
European water companies are not looking at alternative methods of disposal.
One that promises to bring economic as well as environmental benefits turns
the sludge into a medium fuel oil, similar to diesel, which could be used to
drive low-speed engines, fire furnaces or even generate electricity.
The 'oil from sludge' process involves heating dried sludge to 450 deg C in
the absence of oxygen, which vaporises 50 per cent of the sludge. These
vapours are then mixed with the char residue which converts the organics in
the sludge to saturated hydrocarbons, the main ingredient of all liquid
fuels.
Promoters of the technique say it costs up to Pounds 32 per tonne to dispose
of the dried sludge, compared with at least double that amount for
incineration. Capital and running costs are also reduced.
The first plant incorporating the technique will be built in Canada this
year. In the UK and Ireland Acer Consultants, of Guildford, and the
Australian company Campbell Environmental, are providing engineering
services for plants using the technology.

NEC, the Japanese electronics company, has developed a virtual reality
network system to enable designers in multiple locations to work together in
real time, designing three-dimensional objects, writes Steven Butler.
The company has written software for the design of a car body which, when
goggles are donned, appears in three-dimensional space on a high-definition
computer screen. The parts of the car can be manipulated and reshaped by
moving hands inside gloves attached to sensors. On the screen, what appear
to be disembodied gloves actually move the objects about.
The breakthrough, say NEC scientists, came in reducing the information flow
between remote computer terminals so that the exchange could be handled by
ordinary engineering work stations. Designers working at any terminal linked
together can each reshape objects on the screen at the same time.
NEC admits the system is still fairly primitive and is unlikely to have
commercial applications for several years. The level of detail on the screen
is low, and the gloves are still not sensitive enough.
One goal will be to increase the size of the system so that objects, like
cars, can appear in three dimensions at full size.

<TEXT>
THE UNIT Trust Association, in an effort to stem a wave of resignations by
its life assurance company members, has agreed to add a statement of the
life companies' views to a controversial submission to the Securities and
Investments Board.
Last month the UTA angered life company members by describing the industry's
sales abuses in unusually harsh terms and criticising the life assurance
sales commission structure which, it said, urged unsuitable products on an
unsophisticated public.
Prudential, Legal &amp; General, Guardian Royal Exchange, Scottish Provident and
Allied Dunbar have resigned from the UTA in protest, cutting the trade
group's revenues by 10 per cent.
The UTA yesterday met 31 of its 50 life assurance company members which also
have unit trust interests.
The submission to the SIB argues that the sale of unit trusts should be
'de-polarised'. Currently unit trusts and life products are 'polarised' -
sales agents must either sell only the products of one supplier or sell the
products of all suppliers.
The companies which resigned said they had done so over the criticism of the
industry, not the stance on de-polarisation, though the life assurance
industry opposes de-polarisation for unit trusts.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush will address the British nation next Monday night -
not as a world statesman but as the star of an upmarket television
commercial designed to sell America to holidaymaking Brits, Gary Mead
writes.
The commercial shows Mr Bush against a montage of stunning US views. 'So
what are you waiting for, an invitation from the president?' he asks in the
rousing finale, adding: 'America. Yours to Discover,' which is the slogan
for a Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.6m) promotional campaign that will run well into
April.
Mr Bush's drive is backed by a coalition of more than 35 US tourist
companies. Alongside the TV commercial - showing in London and the
south-east, Glasgow and Greater Manchester - advertisments will run in all
national newspapers.
Foreign tourists spent some Dollars 53bn in the US in 1990 and perhaps
Dollars 58bn last year, according to Mr Edward Brook, president of the
Travel Industry Association of America. British tourists account for about
10 per cent of that.
Ms Paula Saint-Armour, a senior vice-president with American Express, said
the new advertising campaign, to be extended across Europe, was kicking off
with Britain 'because of its size and because its potential for increased
visitation is staggering'. She added: 'The number of visitors from the UK
increased 160 per cent between 1985 and 1990, and is now at over 2.2m. From
a marketing perspective, we want to fish where the fish are.'
Mr Bush says in the commercial: 'There's never been a better time to visit
America.' What he doesn't say is that the US economy has rarely been in
greater need of the boost which more tourists would give.

FT  10 JAN 92 / GPs' pay system 'seriously flawed': Institute of Geographers
Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS in London are receiving too much money from the government's GP
deprivation payments system compared with those in the north of England, the
Institute of British Geographers Conference in Swansea was told yesterday.
Mr Martyn Senior, from the University of Salford, said the Department of
Health's system for allocating money had serious statistical flaws. He said
that if the calculations were made fairly, nearly 5 per cent of the Pounds
26.3m spent last year on deprivation payments would be distributed
differently between electoral wards throughout England.
Deprivation payments were introduced for GPs in April 1990 to compensate for
heavy workloads in particular parts of the country. They are based on an
index of eight variables devised by Professor Brian Jarman of St Mary's
Hospital Medical School, London.
The index takes no account of the different sizes of population in the
electoral wards used to calculate it, which vary from 56 people to 41,875.
This can skew the deprivation rating of each ward.
Mr Senior said: 'The Department of Health has not seriously investigated the
technical difficulties. A good statistician needs to go through it.'
The main regions to lose payments under Mr Senior's recalculations would be
Greater London and Walsall. The largest gains would be to Salford and
Liverpool.
The index currently uses 1981 census data. Mr Senior said that when the
Department of Health updated the index with 1991 data, it should also change
how the index was calculated.
Women in rural areas are prevented from taking good jobs by traditional
attitudes as much as by a lack of opportunities, a study in three English
counties for the Rural Development Commission has found.
Nearly a third of the women questioned were not using their qualifications
in their current jobs, which were typically low-paid and often part-time, Ms
Jo Little told the conference.
The study of 350 women in Cornwall, Derbyshire and Wiltshire found lack of
childcare meant many women who worked had to rely on informal help from
friends. They feared this would damage their image as a mother, which
remains a significant factor in rural areas.
Wales is the most European of all parts of the UK and is by-passing the
government and forging direct links with other European Community regions to
help its future growth, the conference was told.
Mr Phil Cooke, of the University of Wales at Cardiff, said that an elaborate
process of 'networking' with key institutions in four other European regions
was helping to revitalise Welsh industry. The regions were working together
to establish joint ventures and collaborate on innovation and technology
transfer.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Housing starts offer flicker of hope to building industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday welcomed statistics showing a small rise in housing
starts in November as evidence that the housebuilding industry is beginning
to recover.
According to provisional figures November housing starts were 12,500,
compared with 11,900 in the same mopnth a year before. This helped lift
housing starts during September-November last year to 40,600, 7 per cent
higher than the same period in the previous year.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said the figures provided 'clear evidence'
that housebuilding starts were recovering from 1990's levels.
He said: 'Starts in the second half of 1991 are running significantly ahead
of the same period in 1990 in both the private enterprise and housing
association sectors.'
The housebuilding industry, however, is likely to require much more evidence
before pronouncing the end of the housing recession.
In spite of the rise in November, starts in September-November were still
down 2 per cent from the previous three months. Private enterprise starts
fell 5 per cent while housing association starts rose. Overall, starts edged
up during the summer but later slipped back.
Yesterday the Building Employers' Confederation said the 'jury was still
out' on prospects for housing starts, and it was not expecting a sustained
rise until spring.
Housing starts are gen-erally seen as a leading indicator of activity in the
economy. They tend to precede house price rises by as much as a year.

<TEXT>
LOCAL train services on the Ivanhoe Line between Leicester and
Burton-on-Trent are to be restored, the Department of Transport announced
yesterday. Services were halted in the 1964 Beeching railway cuts.
The reopening of the line to passenger traffic is part of a Pounds 16m
railway expansion that involves the resumption of local passenger services
on the line between Loughborough and Leicester and a new station on the
Birmingham-Derby line to serve the emerging Toyota car plant at Burnaston,
Derbyshire. Fifteen other stations will be opened or re-opened.
The initiative for the services came not from British Rail but from
Leicestershire and Derbyshire county councils, which see better
communications as a means of boosting economic development in an area hit by
the closure of coal mines.
Leicestershire County Council applied to the Department of Transport for
funding more than a year ago and expected a response before Christmas.
The timing of the transport department's announcement appeared to be
designed to deflect criticism of the latest British Rail fare rises and
leaked plans to cut some InterCity services after privatisation.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, said the Ivanhoe Line project
was 'another demonstration of the government's faith in rail as a means of
local transport'.
The government is meeting Pounds 5m of the cost of the services.
Leicestershire council, in whose area most of the new services are located,
has been given approval to spend Pounds 9m and Derbyshire council Pounds 1m.
A further Pounds 1m will be sought from the private sector, and there will
be no charge to BR.
The transport department said that since 1982 24 BR routes had been opened
or re-opened to passenger services. Further expansion of local rail services
depended on applications from local authorities. Each would be considered
individually and requests for funding would be examined in the light of the
resources available.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Steel closure will cost Clyde Pounds 4.4m revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to close the Ravenscraig steel plant in Lanarkshire was
described yesterday as a 'very serious blow' by the Clyde Port Authority,
which gains a third of its Pounds 12m revenue from steel-related business.
The announcement has affected the bid to acquire the port which is being
submitted today by a management-employee team under the privatisation
procedure for trust ports.
Mr John Mather, Clyde Port's managing director and leader of the team, said:
'If we had finalised our bid before we heard the news we would have had to
amend it. We only completed it today.'
Mr Mather said he was shocked by the 'speed and swiftness' of British
Steel's decision which came a year earlier than he had anticipated. It had
created a 'very serious situation'.
Part of British Steel's closure of Ravenscraig will be the shutdown of the
ore and coal unloading terminal at Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde, which
contributes Pounds 2.4m revenue to the port authority. Also to stop is the
exporting of steel slabs from Glasgow, which is worth Pounds 2m in revenue.
The future of the port's Pounds 1.2m-a-year dredging programme for the river
Clyde is uncertain because of the expected fall in revenue.
Mr Mather said: 'We will have to change the dredging pattern to see if it
can be done more economically.'
Today is the last day for submission of indicative bids for the port, which
covers the Clyde estuary where traffic has fallen drastically in recent
years. No other bidders have declared their hand.
The closure of Ravenscraig will also affect British Rail's freight
operations in Scotland. The 35 trains which run to and from the plant every
week earn its Trainload freight business about Pounds 20m a year, and
directly and indirectly employ about 200 people.
Ravenscraig accounts for 40 per cent of all Trainload operations in
Scotland. The trains carry coal and ore to Ravenscraig, bring other raw
materials from England and transport steel slabs to south Wales.
British Rail said: 'It is too early to say what will happen to the jobs
involved. We were thinking Ravenscraig would close in 1994.'
ScottishPower, the electricity company, will lose further custom from
British Steel as a result of the closure but says it has already obtained
alternative business.
In 1990 British Steel plants in Scotland accounted for 561GWh (gigawatt
hours) or 8.1 per cent of ScottishPower's industrial unit sales. However,
that was expected to be cut by 60 per cent to about 225GWh with last year's
closures.
ScottishPower's flotation prospectus said further steel closures could
reduce unit sales by up to a further 150GWh a year, but because of discounts
to British Steel the fall in revenue would be less. Lord Williams of Elvel,
deputy Labour leader in the Lords, yesterday accused the government of
'hiding behind' privatised British Steel while it took difficult decisions,
Ivor Owen writes.
He asked if British Steel would be required to offer to sell the Ravenscraig
plant to another private-sector operator as an alternative to closure.
He urged that such an offer should be kept open until after the coming
general election so that an incoming government could 'explore the
possibilities'.
Lord Strathclyde, Scottish Office junior minister, said designation as an
enterprise zone would bring significant economic benefits to north
Lanarkshire, with estimated net additional expenditure of Pounds 50m over 10
years bringing 7,500 extra jobs.
He added that British Steel's undertaking to keep the Ravenscraig complex
open had been 'subject to prevailing market conditions'.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Fierce start to battle for Oracle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies are planning to bid against each other for the UK's
commercial teletext franchise.
Oracle runs the present ITV teletext output of news and information. It is a
wholly owned subsidiary of the ITV companies and is working on its own bid
for the franchise.
But Oracle, which has a turnover of about Pounds 10m and pre-tax profit
approaching Pounds 3m, is to be opposed by a consortium being put together
by Independent Television News, which is also a wholly owned subsidiary of
the ITV companies.
Anglia and Yorkshire are believed to be seriously considering backing the
ITN bid. Scottish Television has been approached but is considering its
position.
To add to the complexity two of the new franchise winners are planning bids.
Carlton Communications may bid with Intelfax, which provides the information
for Channel 4's teletext service.
MAI Broadcasting, the company behind Meridian, winner of the franchise for
the south of England, is also considering involvement in a bid, as is TV-am,
loser of the commercial breakfast franchise.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Rapid growth found among consultancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL management consultancies and market researchers have been among the
fastest-growing businesses of the past few years, the conference heard
yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr John Bryson, of Cambridge University and the Small Business Research
Centre, said increasing specialisation of production and the growing
international complexity of operations had boosted prospects for
information-intensive businesses.
The number of management consultancies created grew 114 per cent from 1985
to 1990 while the number of all companies grew 3.5 per cent. The number of
market research companies doubled between 1980 and 1990. Only draughting and
computer science companies grew more quickly.
Mr Bryson analysed 120 consultancy and market research companies in London,
the south-east and the north of England.
The average company had 6.5 staff and most were founded by people deciding
to start their own business rather than by those made redundant.
More than 70 per cent had large companies as clients and two-thirds of their
work came from repeat business. Much work was also derived from personal
contacts.
Two-fifths of their work came from manufacturing clients and 20 per cent
from other business services. About 70 per cent of sales came from beyond 20
miles of the business's location.
Only three of 159 companies contacted for interview had closed in 1990 and
1991. Mr Bryson said most had survived the recession by reducing the amount
of work handed to sub-contractors.

<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of business failures notified to Trade Indemnity, the trade
credit insurer, fell in the fourth quarter of last year, confirming the
company's earlier view that the recession is bottoming out, Richard Lapper
writes.
According to provisional figures business failures in the three months
ending December 31 totalled 1,953, 7 per cent less than the 2,100 in the
third quarter.
The overall level of failures is still 49 per cent higher than in 1990.
Business failures for the year as a whole were 72 per cent higher than in
1990.
Mr Charles McCartan, Trade Indemnity associate director, stressed that
failures figare a lagging indicator of recovery.

FT  10 JAN 92 / G-Plan closes factory with the loss of 600 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX HUNDRED jobs are to be cut with the closure of a G-Plan furniture
factory in High Wycombe, Bucks.
The move comes as part of a retreat from cabinet-making by G-Plan's owner
Christie-Tyler, a subsidiary of Hillsdown Holdings which bought G-Plan in
1989.
Negotiations are under way to sell two other G-Plan factories, at King's
Lynn, Norfolk, and Ashford, Kent, to The Cabinet Makers, the Bath-based
group which will manufacture cabinets to be sold under the G-Plan name.
Christie-Tyler announced yesterday that Spring Gardens factory at High
Wycombe will be run down over the next six months.
Mr Richard Willan, managing director of Christie-Tyler, said the
cabinet-making side of the company's operations had been particularly badly
hit by the effect of high interest rates on consumer spending and the
housing market.
He said 30 per cent of furniture sales were related to home moving and were
vulnerable to stagnation in the housing market.
Furniture manufacturing is one of High Wycombe's traditional industries, and
one of the town's three largest sources of employment. Other manufacturers
in the area include Ercol and Parker Knoll. G-Plan is the first factory
closure, but other companies have announced redundancies.
The loss of 600 jobs will hit the local economy hard - unemployment in the
town stood at 11,182 in November, almost treble the figure for October 1990.
The High Wycombe Jobcentre said that very few jobs were being advertised in
other furniture factories.
Mr Richard Cummings, chief executive of Wycombe District Council, said: 'It
is a severe blow to Wycombe, which has always been at the heart of the
country's furniture trade.'

FT  10 JAN 92 / EC threat of court action over projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS likely that Britain and other EC members will be taken before the
European Court for failure to carry out environmental impact assessments on
large construction projects, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment
commissioner, warned last night.
'It seems to me likely that it will fall to be resolved by the European
Court of Justice at the end of the day,' he said.
He added that the European Commission was proposing to extend the use of
such assessments to cover proposals and policies put forward by EC
governments.
An announcement on the new proposals extending the principle to governments
will be made in two weeks' time, he said. At present the directive applies
only to large individual projects.
'It is now clear that this is not enough. It is essential that policies,
plans and programmes are also subjected to environmental impact assessment.'
He envisaged that this would also apply to EC policy at a later date.
Mr Ripa di Meana renewed his strong criticism of the British government for
pressing ahead with large schemes which he had asked to be suspended because
environmental assessments had not been properly made.
The reaction of the British government and some parts of the British media
'have left a bitter taste in my mouth,' he said. 'There has been absolutely
no victimisation of the United Kingdom, no singling out to the exclusion of
other member states.'
UK schemes that have been criticised include the Channel tunnel rail link,
the east London river crossing and the M3 extension. Britain and other EC
states have argued that projects in the pipeline when the directive came
into force in July 1988 should be exempted.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Loser in ports bid challenges Rifkind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EMBARRASSING furore over the first trust port privatisation grew
yesterday as another of the frustrated bidders for Tees &amp; Hartlepool
protested to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, about the outcome.
Maritime Transport Services, which operates the Thamesport container
terminal on the Isle of Grain in Kent, has written to Mr Rifkind saying it
does not understand how it lost to a rival bidder when it offered the
highest price.
Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority, which refereed the auction, astonished the
ports industry last month by selecting Humberside Holdings, the second
highest bidder, instead of either the highest bidder or the hotly tipped
management-employee buy-out team.
A cross-party delegation of MPs led by Mr Stuart Bell, the Labour MP for
Middlesborough, is seeking a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister,
claiming that the port authority's evaluation of the bids was defective.
One of Mr Bell's concerns is that Humberside Holdings promised the port
authority's board a seat on the new company's board if its bid succeeded. Mr
Bell feels this could lead to a conflict of interest.
Mr Geoffrey Parker, MTS's chairman, said yesterday that a meeting with
Department of Transport officials had 'increased rather than defused the
confusion felt by the company and its backers', which include County
NatWest, the merchant bank, and Legal &amp; General, the insurer.
'Our original reaction of being gracious losers in a fair fight has since
been transformed into concern and dismay that the evaluation process now
appears to have borne little relation to the published criteria,' he said.
MTS's stance increases the pressure on Mr Rifkind to overturn the port
authority's decision. The buy-out team has threatened to seek a judicial
review if he fails to do so.
The issue will come to a head in the Commons next week when MPs are asked to
approve an order pro-viding for the government to claw back a proportion of
any property profits made by Humberside Holdings after the sale.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Labour attacks compulsory council tendering plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's plans for extending compulsory competitive tendering to
professional local authority services are seriously undermined by a
previously secret report published yesterday, Labour has claimed.
Releasing the document - a study for the government by PA Consulting -
Labour called on the government to drop its proposals to widen compulsory
competitive tendering (CCT) as set out in the Local Government Bill,
currently before the House of Lords, and in a consultation paper released in
November.
The bill would give ministers powers to impose CCT with the addition of a
'quality threshold' in local authority services beyond those such as refuse
and street cleaning.
The government plans to reverse a Lords' decision that the quality threshold
should apply to all CCT.
The PA report says voluntary competitive tendering in corporate services has
produced very little evidence of clear financial benefits and warns of
higher costs from contracting out legal, accountancy and secretarial
services.
It points to danger that CCT could reverse moves to decentralisation of
local government services and says there are difficulties with introducing
these changes while local government is being reorganised.
To meet this point, it suggests a differential timetable with areas not
affected by the reorganisation, such as London, going first.
Though the report says areas such as corporate strategy production,
committee administration and services to council members are not good
candidates for CCT, the government's consultation paper says some aspects
could be carried out by private consultants, even though it does express
reservations if these are 'substantially' contracted out.
Similar recommendations and reservations applied in the case of financial
planning, where PA sees a risk of compromising statutory duties.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, Labour's local government spokesman in the House
of Lords, criticised the government for rejecting the proposals in the PA
study recommending an 'integrated package' of measures to include looser
rules allowing local authorities to trade with each other across boundaries.
This was intended to deal with the problem caused by the lack of a strong
external market in some local authority professional services.
The Association of Direct Labour Organisations, representing 165 authorities
opposed to privatisation, condemned the government's 'hypocrisy' in keeping
the report secret.
The Department of the Environment said local authorities that took part
asked that the report remain confidential.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Reserves in UDR on full call-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PART-TIME soldiers of the army's Ulster Defence Regiment were called out
yesterday for full-time duties in Belfast for the second time in two months
to try to stem a spate of terrorist violence.
The measure, which follows demands for army reinforcements after recent IRA
bomb attacks in the city, affects several hundred soldiers belonging to two
UDR battalions in the greater Belfast area.
Twenty-four hour road checkpoints will be reintroduced in the city.
Yesterday's move is aimed at containing the latest violence by redeploying
forces in Northern Ireland before resorting to reinforcements from the
mainland. Officials said troop requirements were 'constantly under review'.
There are 10,800 regular British troops in Northern Ireland plus 6,100 UDR
members, of whom about half are part-time.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday he hoped that
emergency provisions legislation which came into force last August would
lead to the successful prosecution of the 'godfathers' of terrorism in the
province.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): New and old factories adopt similar
practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKING practices at established manufacturing plants in north-east England
tended to converge with those set up in the region by inward investors
during the 1980s, according to a report, Chris Tighe writes.
As inward investors adapted to local conditions and long-established
companies re-evaluated practices, there was a shift away from demarcation
and bonus systems, an increase in flexibility and innovation and a growth in
the importance of the supervisor.
But in research commissioned by the Department of Employment, Dr Ian Stone
and Dr Frank Peck of Newcastle Polytechnic also identified differences
between the attitudes of the two groups of employers over unionisation,
consultation and recruitment.
Long-established companies, they found, were more likely to work through
unions to achieve change, more likely to use informal methods of recruitment
and less likely to use formal attitude testing of applicants, and
'attitudinal development' in training.
Dr Stone and Dr Peck approached all 105 inward-investment manufacturing
plants with 20 or more employees which set up in north-east England in the
1980s. By August 1990 these plants had directly generated nearly 15,000 jobs
 -5 per cent of the region's manufacturing jobs.
A third of plants came from UK investors. Far East investors accounted for
19 per cent of plants but 40 per cent of jobs created.
The report found complaints from long-established companies about poaching
of skilled workers by newcomers.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Code urged for training contracts with
Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMBERS of commerce, which are among the largest providers of training for
the unemployed, have urged the government to introduce a code of conduct to
regulate contractual relationships between training organisations and
Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs).
The chambers believe such contracts are often seriously flawed.
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, which represents 106
chambers, more than half of which provide training to the adult unemployed
and young people, has written to Mr Robert Jackson, the employment minister,
asking for urgent action.
The association wants the government to set up a working party 'without
delay' to produce a code of conduct which it hopes could be universally
adopted by Tecs.
There has been widespread discontent about contracts among the thousands of
organisations contracted to the 82 Tecs in England and Wales.
Contracts vary, but generally they are for 12 months and can be terminated
at short notice in spite of the fact that contractors have to make long-term
commitments, including capital outlay on premises.
Tecs can technically negotiate longer contracts with training providers, but
because the government gives them money only on an annual basis they must
bear any risk. One provider was recently told by a Tec that its contract to
supply training to unemployed people had been terminated three weeks
previously.
The association said there were examples of Tec contracts that were 'unduly
onerous, seriously flawed and, most important, allow the buyer to impose
arbitrary and significantly deleterious changes without adequate notice'. It
added: 'These are far from the commercial norm.'
The call by the chambers, which include those of Leeds, Sheffield and
Coventry, builds on similar demands made by the Bridge Group, which
comprises 15 non-profit-making training providers including Community
Industry.
The Department of Employment said the establishment of a working group would
be investigated and a reply made in due course.
The GMB general union is today launching a call for immediate government aid
for west Cumbria, which is suffering a wave of job losses, Chris Tighe
writes.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, visits the area today. He is urging
the government to restore assisted area status to the borough of Copeland,
to provide additional resources for Cumbria Training and Enterprise Council
and to allow local authorities to create construction work in the area.
The GMB has more than 15,000 members in west Cumbria.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Disney offers 1,000 Britons jobs in
Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 1,000 Britons are being offered the opportunity to help bring
fantasies to life when Disney's theme park opens outside Paris in April.
Based on US models, the park is set to become Europe's biggest leisure and
tourist attraction. Its size is being matched by the company's recruitment
drive.
Euro Disney will hire a total of 12,000 European staff, including the 1,000
from Britain.
The jobs available are in catering, hospitality, housekeeping, merchandising
and attractions operations.
The Europe-wide recruitment tour will stop at four cities in the UK and one
in Ireland this month and next.
A team of 20 specialists from the Euro Disney human resources department
will examine about 10,000 applicants for traces of 'pixie dust'.
According to Ms Vanessa Aves, a Euro Disney official publicist, this is the
quality which will ensure hopeful applicants a job offer. The special team
can tell instantly whether applicants have the required Disney magic, said
Ms Aves. 'You can more or less tell as soon as somebody walks through the
door whether they are a bright person.
'It is the smile and the way they say hello. The initial impression is very
important.'
Recruitment Disney-style is as saccharine and, the company says, as
successful as the cartoon characters.
Successful applicants - irrespective of their jobs - will find they have
been cast in roles following auditions rather than offered jobs after
interviews.
Ms Aves said: 'We will see anybody over the age of 18 who has some
conversational French. They need to be outgoing, enthusiastic and must have
a positive approach to working with other people in a service-related
environ-ment.
'We are looking for people who exude warmth and courtesy.'
The recruitment tour will stop in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh
and Dublin. Applicants need only turn up, preferably with details of
previous jobs and a photograph.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Worrying cracks in Belfast confidence: This week's bombs may
have damaged more than just buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS As Usual signs pasted over boarded-up shopfronts greet 1992 in
Belfast's city centre.
Shoppers glance upwards with curiosity at windowless office blocks as
workmen scoop up piles of shattered glass with shovels from the pavement and
rip out warped window frames with crowbars.
The year started with two explosions in the heart of the city. Between them
they are likely to cost the British taxpayer Pounds 10m in indemnity
payments.
The two IRA bombs which devastated two Inland Revenue buildings and damaged
scores of shops, offices, restaurants and bars at the beginning of the week
have created a scene reminiscent of the worst periods of the city's history.
The manager of one large retail chain store said: 'It is amazing how people
have not been put off by the bombs. Staff have come in, rolled up their
sleeves and started the clean-up with a determination to get business back
to normal as quickly as possible.'
But behind the doughty resilience of this city's population, now accustomed
to the tribulations caused by 22 years of IRA bomb damage, there is growing
concern about the government's security policy and its response to the
renewed IRA bombing campaign - which its leaders have warned will intensify
this year.
The area manager of Guardian Royal Exchange, whose offices were extensively
damaged in Monday's blast, said: 'There is a feeling in the business
community that the security forces could do a little bit better and that it
is time to take the initiative and go after these guys.'
Unionist leaders called this week for stricter security at Republican
strongholds within the city. Criticism has been levelled at the army for
withdrawing 500 troops just before Christmas. They were brought into the
province one month earlier in response to the renewed campaign.
That criticism is thought to be shared at senior levels within the Northern
Ireland Office (NIO), the government body which is responsible for the
administration of Ulster and foots the bills for the IRA attacks. Insurance
companies stopped providing cover for bomb damage in the 1970s.
Those bills have been rapidly mounting. Last December the NIO announced a
moratorium until next April on capital spending in the province in order to
meet the cost of clearing up after firebomb attacks. A bomb badly damaged
the Europa hotel and the Grand Opera House in the city centre on December 4.
The manager of a leading glazing firm in Belfast said: 'That bomb caused
some Pounds 5m in damage, about 20 per cent of it in glass.
'What we are seeing is as bad as we had in the 1970s, although it was more
continuous then.'
In the 1990-91 fiscal year the NIO paid out Pounds 22.7m in indemnities for
property damage in Northern Ireland. The damage from the bomb attacks in
Belfast's city centre in the past month alone is unofficially estimated at
Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m.
Mr Richard Needham, the NIO's minister for economic development, remains
optimistic. There is no intention to change the NIO's policy on
indemnification, which amounts to an open-ended commitment. He views the
bombing campaign as an opportunity to reconstruct Belfast's city centre.
The issue of improvements has been one of the wrangles between businessmen
and the NIO. Until now the NIO has been prepared to pay only the costs of
restoring the damage, and not to pay for improvements. That may change soon.
The process of compensation is slow, however. Joxor's bar and restaurant,
just around the corner from the Europa hotel, has had its windows blown out
three times in four weeks. Its owner says the total cost will come to about
Pounds 20,000 and that on past experience it will probably take up to two
years before the NIO compensation is paid in full. He smiled and said: 'The
bank manger has been very sympathetic. He's had his windows blown out as
well.'
Close to Joxor's is Windsor House, the tallest office block in Ireland and
home to the Inland Revenue as well as the European Commission in Northern
Ireland and numerous private offices. The building, which houses about 1,000
workers, was extensively damaged in the earlier Sunday blast. Plywood eyes
now stare out over the city where the windows once were. Piles of paper
litter, blown off desks and out of filing cabinets, lie in sodden heaps on
the pavement in the wintry rain.
The general manager of the Europa, Mr Michael Williamson, said only 50 of
the 200 rooms in the hotel were in use, one month after the Opera House
bomb, and he thought it would be two to three months before the hotel was
operating normally again. His compensation claim would 'probably be in
excess of Pounds 1m'.
In spite of the disruption there remains an air of determined optimism. Mr
Williamson said: 'We are not going to let it force us out.' His view is
seemingly shared by most businessmen in the city. Christmas trade was better
than expected for most, and the NIO's indemnification policy allows
tradesmen to view their reverses with a detached black humour.
Nevertheless, should the bombing campaign continue, as threatened by the
IRA, many businessmen fear there would be a decline in trade. They say
intensified security checks, causing traffic congestion, often cause more
disruption than the bombs.
Mr Needham believes the IRA's latest campaign is an act of desperation and
that the tide has turned against it. 'They cannot hope to win power as they
once did, with the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other.
Their support is falling.
'They are terrified of a schism in their ranks. If they give up what can
they bargain with? Their alternative is to carry on with a policy knowing
they cannot win.'
Is Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, hoping to bomb its way to the
negotiating table then? 'There is no possibility of that while they continue
to support violence,' said Mr Needham.
When asked about statements made this week by Mr Martin McGuinness, a Sinn
Fein leader, who said that his party will 'make it as easy as possible' for
the British government to open a path to the negotiating table, Mr Needham
replied simply: 'We are living in interesting times.'

FT  10 JAN 92 / Engineers' confidence seen to have fallen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE has fallen again in the UK engineering industry, according to The
Engineer magazine, Andrew Baxter writes.
The magazine's latest quarterly survey finds that after a slight rise in
confidence during the autumn, prompted by hopes of an end to the recession,
engineering companies are about as unhappy as they were in June and
sentiment is not far off the 'appalling' levels of December 1990.
The fall in optimism is most evident in large companies. A total of 40 per
cent of senior managers in companies employing more than 500 people are
pessimistic about their company's prospects in the next 12 months, against
35 per cent expressing optimism.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Minister rejects safety legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has rejected proposals to make named company managers and
directors personally responsible for workplace deaths and accidents, the
construction union Ucatt said yesterday
After a meeting on safety with Mr Eric Forth, the employment minister, Ucatt
leaders said: 'Eric Forth took the union by surprise by saying that he felt
that the prosecution of management for health and safety violations was not
productive and, in fact, amounted to a misuse of resources.'
Unions and pressure groups have recently campaigned for changes in the law
to increase the accountability of company directors and make corporate
manslaughter charges easier to bring to the courts.
Construction has the poorest safety record of all sectors, with deaths
running at five times the rate among workers in manufacturing. One building
worker is killed every three days.
Ucatt said it was 'shock-ed' by Mr Forth's comments.
The Department of Employment said Mr Forth told Ucatt that prosecution of
managers was 'not always the best way forward and that there may be better
ways of using resources'. He had 'listened intently' to the union.
In a statement Mr Forth said: 'My key message is that managers and workers
themselves have primary responsibility for making their own construction
sites safer.'
Separately, Mr George Henderson, national construction secretary of the TGWU
general union, called for the resignation of Mr Stephen Moon, a senior
official of the Building Employers' Confederation.
Mr Moon had written to BEC member companies saying there was nothing to stop
contractors allowing the EETPU electricians union on to sites traditionally
dominated by Ucatt and the TGWU.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Bush in Japan: Motor industries still on collision course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Japanese motor industries are still on a collision course, in
spite of promises by Japanese manufacturers to increase their purchases of
US parts and to market in Japan more vehicles made by the US Big Three -
General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler.
The agreements were hailed yesterday by President George Bush of the US and
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister. But Japanese executives
resented the pressure on them to give assistance to their US competitors,
while American executives were angry that more had not been done to 'open'
the Japanese market.
Mr Bush, who has made the motor trade the main bilateral economic issue of
his visit, praised the agreements, saying they would mean more US car parts
and cars coming into Japan.
However, Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford, said that, though progress had
been made, the Japanese industry's proposals were 'inadequate'. Mr Jack
Reilly, president of Tenneco, the motor parts group, said progress was
'definitely insufficient'.
A spokesman for Mr John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, said that Japan's promise to buy 20,000 US-made cars amounted to
'one afternoon's production' for the US auto industry.
Mr Fred Bergsten, head of the Washington-based Institute for International
Economics, told a Congressional hearing that Mr Bush had made a tactical
mistake in focusing on the auto sector instead of trying to co-ordinate
economic fundamentals such as exchange rates and interest rates.
Japanese industry leaders said the targets they had set were the highest
they could manage and would be difficult to achieve. Mr Yutaka Kume,
chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, said consumers
decide what make of car to buy.
The Japanese concessions came in two forms: commitments by manufacturers to
increase their purchases of US parts and their sales of US-made vehicles,
and promises by the Japanese government to assist US parts suppliers in
finding Japanese customers and to ease technical certification requirements
for imported vehicles.
A joint 'action plan' also contains a series of less painful promises by the
US government, including a commitment to 'an economically viable US
automotive industry'.
Those programmes include a budget allocation next year of Dollars 1.5m
(Pounds 825,000) to help US parts companies establish ties with Japanese
companies at the design stage of vehicles, and tax concessions for companies
opening facilities in Japan. The Fair Trade Commission, an anti-monopoly
body, is also conducting a study on competition in the auto parts sector.
To the annoyance of US executives, the agreement does not specify targets
for imports to Japan of finished vehicles. Japanese car companies resisted
an overall target, arguing it would be very difficult to predict how many
cars consumers might buy.
Instead, individual companies have made separate - and modest - commitments.
Toyota Motor promised to increase imports of US-made Toyotas to 20,000 by
the 1994 financial year and to talk to GM about the possible import of 5,000
GM cars. Nissan pledged to import a mini-van jointly developed with Ford and
other Ford cars to a total of 3,000 a year.
Honda Motor plans a sharp rise in US-made Hondas from 14,000 last year to
27,000 in 1994, plus a rise from 424 to 1,200 in imports of Chrysler jeeps.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Bush in Japan: Small gains for Bush from mishandled tour -
Economic initiative likely to gain momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush heads home today after a sobering trip to Asia which
fell short of its inflated goals.
However irresistible the symbolism, the sight of Japanese Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa cradling a stricken American president proved no more than a
diversion. Although Mr Bush still looked queasy yesterday, he appeared well
on the way to a recovery from 'Tokyo tummy'.
Far more revealing was the way in which Mr Bush allowed misguided advisers
to turn his four-nation Asian tour into a domestic political exercise.
Spooked by criticism that he was spending too much time on foreign affairs,
Mr Bush said his trip to Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan was
about 'jobs, jobs, jobs'.
The pitfalls of this approach soon became apparent. In Australia, Mr Bush
decried protectionism but enraged local farmers by refusing to scrap
subsidies for US wheat exports. 'We've never said we're totally pure,' said
Mr Bush, with a straight face.
In Japan, he turned from master diplomat to car salesman. Accompanied by 21
corporate executives, the loudest being the chairmen of the three Detroit
car makers, Mr Bush retreated steadily from his support of free trade, to
fair trade, before finally embracing 'managed trade'.
This retreat was underlined by the mixed success the chairmen of Ford,
Chrysler and General Motors enjoyed in efforts to negotiate specific numbers
for Japanese imports of US cars and car parts.
Mr Bush could point to a commitment from Japanese car makers to double the
number of US car parts from Dollars 7bn last year to Dollars 15bn in fiscal
1994; but most of the 20,000 US-made cars which Tokyo will import will come
from Japanese manufacturers already based in the US, not the Big Three.
Mr Richard Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian
affairs, said yesterday progress in shrinking the two countries' annual
Dollars 40bn trade imbalance came at a price. 'An impression has been
created that Japan is the cause of the American recession, that Toyota is
the cause of General Motors' decline, and that's just not true,' he said.
Mr Bush must bear some of the blame; but so too must Mr Robert Mosbacher,
the outgoing commerce secretary who has just been appointed chairman of the
Bush-Quayle re-election campaign. The Texan multi-millionaire's main skill
is raising money. His forays into diplomacy or domestic politics have more
often than not landed the president in trouble.
By several accounts, it was Mr Mosbacher who persuaded Mr Bush to take
corporate executives on the Asian trip. The idea was to use public/private
sector pressure to prise open markets, play tough with the Japanese and bill
the tour as a jobs mission to boost the US economy and bolster Mr Bush's
standing in the polls.
This completely undercut the original purpose of the trip. As originally
timed, for last November, it would have preceded the 50th anniversary of the
Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor with a grand declaration of reconciliation
in which the world's two most powerful economies could join in a new global
partnership in the post-Cold War era.
The wider message has been drowned out - with one important qualification.
Before he fainted at the banquet on Wednesday, Mr Bush agreed with Mr
Miyazawa on a joint initiative to promote world economic growth. Although
short on details, the two sides gave a commitment to a fiscal stimulus to
their economies and urged other countries, particularly Germany, to do the
same.
This initiative is likely to gather momentum in the coming fortnight, ahead
of the president's State of the Union address on January 28, in which he is
expected to announce a growth package involving a capital gains tax cut and
help for first-time home buyers. Already, the US Treasury is sounding out
European allies on the idea of presenting a plan to Group of Seven finance
ministers meeting in the US on January 25.
The campaign for global reflation to head off recession is an effort to
revive the international economic co-operation successfully pursued by the
US in the mid-1980s.
Mr Bush has shown this week that he is a politician running for re-election,
ready to pander to a domestic audience with the best of them. This is
certain to continue, if the November election looks tight. As he told David
Frost in an interview: 'I will do what I have to do to get re-elected.'

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Bundesbahn to buy Spanish rail wagons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN state railway monopoly, the Bundesbahn, yesterday signed a
document of intent to buy 114 Spanish railway wagons for Dollars 80m (Pounds
42.7m) to mark the first time that Spain has been able to export its unique
Talgo railway technology.
The deal, which the chairman of the Bundesbahn, Mr Heinz Durr, was due to
sign in Madrid last night, was triggered by Spain's decision in 1988 to
award a Dollars 350m contract for 75 high-powered locomotives to Siemens.
The Talgo wagons are produced by a joint venture between Renfe, the Spanish
railway monopoly, and a privately-owned Basque group. Talgo (the Spanish
acronym for the Goicoechea-Oriol light articulated train) is a technology
developed more than 40 years ago by a Basque engineer, Mr Alejandro
Goicoechea, and financed by the Oriol family during the Franco dictatorship.
Franco had ordered Spain's railway gauge to be wider than the conventional
European gauge in order, it is said, to deter invasions.
Thus, one characteristic of Talgo is a wheel arrangement enabling it to pass
from the Spanish to the French gauge without stopping.
The Bundesbahn plans to use the Talgo trains on overnight routes between
Berlin and Basle and Munich and Zurich. Talgo's manufacturers claim that
because it is so light it saves on engine energy and that its carriages are
connected in such a way that they do not jolt.
Essentially, Talgo technology is based on the fact that each wheel has its
own axle, placed between and not under the carriages, and which can be
independently manipulated. This places the suspension above the point of
gravity on each wagon, enabling it to achieve high speeds with reduced
lateral movements.

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Washington seeks 'quiet talks' with Gatt
chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, yesterday said she would bring
US concerns about the draft of the Uruguay Round text to Mr Arthur Dunkel,
the Gatt Director-General, for 'quiet consultations' after all the members
of the multilateral trading organisation had met to 'appraise' the paper
next Monday.
However, she indicated that the number of changes sought in the 451-page
paper, prepared by Mr Dunkel, must be minimal. 'If all 108 Gatt members want
to renegotiate, it will all unravel,' she said.
Mrs Hills emphasised that the 'fairly positive' Dunkel draft was not final
and her 1,000 private sector advisers were being consulted.
She acknowledged that many US groups 'have their disappointments' but, in
the end, they will have to weigh the improvements to the world trading
system provided by the proposed reforms against the current system.
One of a number of private sector groups to weigh in against the Dunkel
draft yesterday said it would get 'little or nothing' from the proposals.
The American Soyabean Association said the US should either press for 'a
better Gatt agreement or end the round of negotiations without modifying the
rules of trade.'
Mr Steve Yoder, the Association's first vice-president, said the failure of
the Gatt to resolve effectively a US-EC dispute of the Community's oilseed
programme called the entire system into question.
'If the US accepts the Dunkel paper, it will be tantamount to accepting the
EC's system of higher internal support for oilseeds,' Mr Yoder said.
He joined the textile producers, American Motion Picture Association, the
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and others in their opposition to
the Dunkel draft.
Opposition also began to surface in Congress, where Congressman Ron
Marlenee, a Montana Republican and member of the House Agriculture
Committee, complained that Mr Dunkel had taken 'a little slice of pie from
one proposal, then a little scoop of ice cream from another nation, and then
added a little fruit in an attempt to give everybody a little bid of
dessert.
'That's not the way good, solid trade relations are built.'
Another Republican committee member, Congressman Steve Gunderson, complained
that the Dunkel draft would not achieve 'the level playing field in terms of
the international dairy market.
'Europe will be able to continue to subsidise their exports or dumping of
their diary products in the world market at a higher rate than will the US,'
he said.

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Trade News (GATT): EC unmoved by Dunkel doctrine -
David Gardner on dismay in Brussels at an obstacle to farm reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARTHUR Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt), is not a popular man in Brussels just now. The majority view
in the European Commission, and within the EC's 12 member states, is that
his doctrinaire attitude towards liberalising farm trade is putting a new
world trade order beyond reach - as well as queering the pitch for radical
reform of the Community's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
On December 23, the 12 said Mr Dunkel's blueprint for farm trade 'is not
acceptable, and therefore has to be modified'. Little different can be
expected from today's EC council of foreign, farm and trade ministers,
called to pronounce on the Swiss diplomat's draft conclusions to the Uruguay
Round before the 'crunch' meeting in Geneva on Monday.
Then, all 108 participants in the five-year trade talks are to respond to a
package designed to liberalise trade not only, or even primarily, in
agriculture, but to set new rules in sectors such as services and
intellectual property rights. But the EC, to the frustration of most of its
members, looks trapped by the agriculture chapter.
Prospects of a farm trade breakthrough had brightened after six weeks of
hard, bilateral bargaining between the EC and the US, but on December 19,
when only 4m tonnes of EC wheat exports appeared to stand between a
Washington-Brussels deal, the negotiations imploded.
No cogent explanation has emerged as to why this happened. But Mr Ed
Madigan, the US agriculture secretary in charge of the horse-trading with Mr
Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, seems to have been reined back from
concessions he was prepared to make. What detonated the failure was the
re-opening of the arcane but core 'green box' issue.
The EC's planned CAP reform envisages direct payments to farmers to
compensate for deep cuts in farm support prices. These cuts exceed Gatt
targets: cereals prices, for instance, would be cut by 35 per cent over
three years, rather than the 20 per cent over six years Mr Dunkel wrote into
his 'final act' of the Uruguay Round. The Gatt target would require the US
to cut internal subsidies by little more than envisaged in its current farm
bill.
Export subsidies, however, would under the Dunkel schema be cut by 36 per
cent, and the volume of subsidised food exported by 24 per cent. The EC
wants no formal volume restraints, but could in practice deliver them, on
cereals at least, the main commodity of the row. The EC compensation
payments are calculated on the area sown in a past reference period, made
contingent on land being taken out of production, and therefore cut the most
direct link between price support and ever-expanding output. The CAP plan
could take 17m tonnes of EC grain off world markets.
The absolute condition is that the direct compensation to farmers be
categorised as 'green box', that is subsidies that do not foment production
and therefore distort trade. Mr Dunkel's paper rules this out. The EC says
in that case it cannot make the cuts, much less sell them to farmers.
The Dunkel plan 'is asking us to crucify our farmers, for absolutely no
benefit at all to the world market for farm produce', complains one senior
Commission official.
EC officials regard any Gatt failure as a strategic setback for CAP reform.
Gatt has been one of the levers Mr MacSharry has used to prise assent to the
thrust of his reform from a council of farm ministers which a year ago was
unanimously opposed to it. But worse still, failure to enact the reform
could paralyse Community policy in other areas.
In mid-February, Brussels will present a new financial plan for 1993-97,
designed to increase resources and funnel more of them to laggard
member-states, to help them adapt to the single market and prepare for
currency union. No overall decision is possible without agreement on a
reformed, at first more expensive CAP, which without a Gatt deal would seem
to offer less of a pay-off.
Moreover, an unreformed CAP would complicate enlargement and any coherent
policy towards the post-communist democracies of eastern Europe requires
greater access into the EC for their agricultural produce. An unreformed CAP
blocks this.
The least bad outcome, one Brussels official argues, would be for the 12 to
restate their opposition to Mr Dunkel's agriculture proposals and to mandate
Mr MacSharry to try to get him and the US to budge on the crucial 'green
box' definition. The risk otherwise is that the package as a whole could be
re-opened.

US DOLLAR for credits of up to five years 7.09 (7.52); for credits of over
five years 7.49 (7.92).
These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally around
the middle of each month. They apply to all export credits. However, on
those to middle-income and poor developing countries the OECD matrix rate

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Major, Kohl seek early accord

<TEXT>
MR Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, and Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, yesterday discussed the stalled world trade talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in a 35-minute telephone
conversation, and agreed it was essential to reach an early conclusion.
Their talk, arranged before the Christmas holiday, comes on the eve of the
two-day European Community ministerial meeting in Brussels opening today,
and involving foreign, trade and farm ministers.
'The aim is to get a positive message (from the ministerial meeting) on
Saturday,' a German official said yesterday. 'We need a positive message for
Geneva to conclude the talks in the early spring.'
A British spokesman in London said there was 'a shared determination on the
part of not only Mr Kohl and the prime minister, but also US President
George Bush, to reach agreement.'
In Bonn, a somewhat irritated chancellor's office, where the conversation
had been assumed to be confidential, simply confirmed the British statement.
The issue of the Gatt negotiations remains extremely sensitive in Germany,
where a strong free-trade lobby, headed by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the
economics minister, has been campaigning against the equally entrenched
agriculture lobby, headed by Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the agriculture minister.
In spite of claims from the Mollemann camp that the battle has been won, Mr
Kiechle last year won a firm pledge from the cabinet that whatever farm
subsidies were lost in the form of high and protected prices would be
replaced in the form of income support.
Chancellor Kohl is also mindful of the need not to offend France, his
closest ally in the EC, which is the largest agricultural exporter in the
Community and therefore by far the most affected by the proposed Gatt farm
trade liberalisation.
'Now is an unfavourable moment to go against France,' one foreign policy
commentator said yesterday. 'There are many problems with the Franco-German
relationship, including Yugoslavia. But Chancellor Kohl also knows he cannot
have it both ways any longer.'
German officials said yesterday that the compromise proposals put forward by
Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director-general, were 'not enough,' but still a
'useful basis' on which to take the negotiations forward.
'Even the British are not satisfied on agriculture,' one senior official
said. 'The key question is: what will replace price cuts?'

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S embattled Socialist government yesterday launched a jobs package in
the hope of stemming rising unemployment before it reaches the politically
damaging level of 3m.
Unemployment has risen steadily since 1990 to a record 2.8m, or 9.8 per cent
of the workforce. It has become the overriding issue in the run-up to the
regional poll in March and general elections next year.
The measures are aimed at long term unemployed - mainly the young and the
over 50s - which represent nearly a third of the total. They will offer
18-month subsidised training schemes for young people who have been out of
work for more than six months and cannot get an apprenticeship.
A poor outlook for the French economy this year adds to the pressure on the
government to be seen to be taking action.
This is the third round of job-creation proposals since Mrs Edith Cresson
became as prime minister last May. Unions and employers yesterday gave a
cool reception.
Mr Marc Blondel, general secretary of the Fource Ouvriere union, said the
plans were 'muddle headed.'

The Commission has written to 76 European cement producers and organisations
claiming breaches of competition law in the 1980s. In line with EC rules,
the producers have two months to provide explanations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's policy of high interest rates could bring economic disaster
to east Germany, leading economists warned yesterday. Mr Lutz Hoffmann,
president of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin,
said a strangling of Germany's economic growth by high interest rates could
cause an expected economic upswing in east Germany to collapse.
Mr Heiner Flassbeck, also of DIW, accused the Bundesbank of following a
monetary policy which amounted to 'recession'.
He recommended that the central bank adhere to a steady expansion of the
money supply of between 5 per cent and 5.5 per cent instead of between 3.5
per cent and 5.5 per cent.
Christopher Parkes adds from Bonn: Around 500,000 people will join German
dole queues this year, according to Mr Heinrich Franke, head of the federal
labour office. By mid-year there would be 1.35m unemployed in the east,
about 400,000 more than at the same time last year. Numbers in the west, hit
by the economic slowdown, would rise by 100,000.
The tightening labour market and looming recession are having some effect on
this year's pay negotiations. Steel workers, offered a 4.54 per cent
two-stage pay rise in talks on Wednesday night, dropped strike threats and
agreed to resume talks.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Airbus partners' problems put new airliner in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERE financial and mangement problems among the three main partners in the
European Airbus Industrie consortium are jeopardising the development of a
new airliner.
Although Airbus trebled its operating profits to a record Dollars 300m last
year, Mr Jean Pierson, the managing director, said the consortium risked
being destabilised by the problems at Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche
Aerospace and British Aerospace.
As well as the development of the 120-seat A319 narrow-bodied airliner,
derivatives of the consortium's new A330/A340 wide-bodied aircraft may also
be threatened.
The consortium's vulnerability to the difficulties of its partner companies
is one of its biggest handicaps in the cut-throat commercial airliner
business. The present problem has also highlighted the need to turn Airbus
into a more conventional corporate entity distinct from its principal
shareholders and its national governments.
It is the cash-strapped French company, Aerospatiale, which has triggered
the latest crisis.
Aerospatiale, which has a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus, is understood to be
opposed to developing the A319, itself a derivative of the A320
narrow-bodied airliner. However, the other main partners - BAe with 20 per
cent and Deutsche Aerospace with 37.9 - say they are ready to support the
Dollars 300m (Pounds 165m) development.
The fourth Airbus partner is CASA of Spain with 4.8 per cent.
Deutsche Aerospace at first opposed the A319 for fear that it would compete
with a family of 100 to 120-seat regional airliners which it was planning to
build. But the German group has since scaled down its programme to the
90-100 seat range so as to make it compatible with the A319.
Mr Pierson said yesterday the Airbus board had to decide on the A319 by the
end of March. But Aerospatiale's management evidently feels hamstrung by
anxieties about the financing of its share of the programme.
It is facing a cash squeeze because of declining defence business and heavy
outflows to finance the build-up of production at its new Toulouse facility
for the A330/A340 programme.
The company also faces considerable uncertainty about its future status.
The French government, which recently launched a restructuring of the
state-owned nuclear and consumer electronics industry, is considering an
analogous reorganisation of its state aerospace and defence assets. This
could eventually entail a regrouping of Aerospatiale, Thomson CSF, and
perhaps the Dassault military aircraft group.
BAe and Deutsche Aerospace have their own problems. BAe is in the midst of a
far-reaching restructuring after its management crisis last year. Deutsche
Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, is seeking to establish
its identity as a leading company in the sector and is expected to undergo
further restructuring.
Apart from the A319, Airbus is studying whether to develop stretched and
smaller versions of the A330/A340 wide-bodied airliners. The timing of these
programmes risks being compromised unless there is agreement between the
Airbus partners.
Mr Pierson did not disclose figures for operating profits, but industry
analysts put the operating surplus last year at about Dollars 300m, compared
with just over Dollars 100m in 1990.
Airbus won 101 new aircraft orders last year, which was 44 short of its
target of 145 for 1991, and sharply lower than the 404 orders it won in
1990.
Mr Pierson said the target this year was about 150 new orders. Airbus
turnover this year should total about Dollars 7.7bn, similar to the sales
level last year.
Airbus delivered 163 aircraft last year and expects to deliver about 160
this year.

PROSPECTS for a negotiated solution to the civil war in Yugoslavia flickered
back to life last night as Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, said
a European Community blueprint to provide self-government and minority
rights guarantees for Serbs in Croatia was 'adequate'.
Though the Serbian leader raised hopes of a breakthrough by expressing
similar sentiments on this crux of the conflict last October 4, a senior EC
diplomat last night expressed hope that 'this time the movement looks more
solid'.
Mr Milosevic was told by the EC that 'he has to move now or risk total
isolation', an senior EC diplomat said. After Tuesday's killing of five EC
monitors, when their unarmed helicopter was shot down by a Yugoslav air
force jet over Croatia, Serbia would 'have nowhere to turn unless it comes
to terms', he added.
The Yugoslav army yesterday blamed poor co-ordination and mistakes in air
traffic control for the shooting down of the helicopter. But the interim
report, delivered to the EC monitoring mission in Zagreb, did not explain
why the Yugoslav pilot shot down the EC helicopter and forced another to
crash land.
Mr Ed Koestal, an EC monitor from the Netherlands, said when he returned
home yesterday after three months based in Zagreb that the shooting down of
the helicopter was unlikely to have been a mistake caused by poor air
traffic control.
'Croatia does not have an air force. The only aircraft that could operate in
that area were EC planes and they were clearly marked,' Mr Koestal said.
Four of the five dead were Italians, who were buried with full honours
yesterday after a service in which Pope John Paul lamented the 'agonising
tragedy' of Yugoslavia's war.
Polityka, a pro-Serbian daily paper with close ties to the military, carried
the army's explanation, saying the EC helicopters had been in closed air
space, and federal military authorities had not been told of their incoming
flight from Hungary.
The Hungarian authorities had informed the air control centre in Zagreb of
the flight, but the Mig pilot had been in contact only with air control in
Belgrade.
Yesterday's movement on the diplomatic front came at the EC-sponsored peace
conference, which reconvened in Brussels after a two-month suspension due to
Serbian intransigence and the escalation of bloodshed in Croatia.
The conference was attended by Mr Herbert Okun, a senior aide to Mr Cyrus
Vance, the United Nations special representative, emphasising to the
presidents of the six Yugoslav republics that the EC peace process and UN
efforts to send a 10,000-strong peacekeeping force to Croatia formed part of
a single strategy.
Lord Carrington, the former UK foreign secretary who chairs the conference,
stressed that the seven-day-old ceasefire and the UN decision to send a
50-strong advance guard to Yugoslavia, plus the prospect of the EC
recognising republics which fulfilled a list of democratic conditions, had
transformed the background to the talks. 'For the first time it really does
look as though the ceasefire will hold,' Lord Carrington said, but he
cautioned that 'it would be an exaggeration to say the way is entirely
clear' for a settlement.
However, Mr Milosevic, who left the Brussels conference after a visibly
cordial discussion with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in the courtyard
of the Egmont Palace in Brussels, insisted Serbia would demand the right to
remain at the heart of a reduced Yugoslavia.
Lord Carrington stressed that 'Mr Milosevic has made clear that if (EC
proposals on self-government and minority rights) are accepted, as far he
was concerned this was adequate protection for the Serbs in Croatia.'
He praised Mr Milosevic for the 'very stern steps' he had taken to condemn
Mr Milan Babic, leader of Serbian irregulars in the Krajina enclave of
south-west Croatia, who has threatened to resist the entry of UN forces into
his self-proclaimed autonomous republic.
The issue was further complicated yesterday when Bosnia's Serbs declared an
autonomous Serbian republic in the region and said they were prepared to
defend themselves.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEPENING crisis in the former Soviet states is forcing up trade
barriers and triggering strikes by workers and resignations by officials.
Russia will ban from today the export of some 60 commodities in short supply
to those republics which have erected trade barriers against the export of
goods to Russia in the past. The principal target is Ukraine, which is
rapidly assuming the status of a hostile country in Russian eyes.
A decree, signed on December 29 by Mr Genady Burbulis, the first deputy
prime minister, includes food, alcohol, tobacco, electrical appliances,
building materials, cameras and bicycles. The move appears to reflect a
determination by the Russian government to punish enemies and reward friends
among its neighbouring states.
Mr Peter Aven, Russian minister for foreign economic relations, said in an
interview yesterday that the prices republics would be charged for Russian
goods would depend on how closely they followed Russian economic reform.
At the same time, the Council of Independent Trade Unions warned the Russian
government to pay promised social compensations for the price rises, and to
'reconsider' - and presumably extend - by next Thursday the list of goods
still sold at subsidised prices.
Miners in Kazakhstan, the third largest of the former Union's coal areas,
and producing 100m tonnes of coal a year, have struck in support of a demand
to double their pay to Rbs4,700 a month - a sum which would have been an
average yearly wage less than a year ago. Workers in industries in the
capital, Alma Ata, are also reported to have been on strike since January 6,
when prices were freed.
The Moscow City administration yesterday announced its collective
resignation, following a prolonged struggle with Mr Gavriil Popov, the
mayor, over privatisation of houses.
Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow city chief executive, said last night a new
administration must include 'special teams' addressing themselves to
economic reform, social protection, the city's economy and development and
territorial administration. The Estonian government yesterday ordered food
rationing and sacked managers of state-owned companies as shortages
threatened to cripple the capital, Tallinn.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Bush hails mission to Japan as a success: Some US
businessmen sceptical of bilateral trade agreements
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE BUSH yesterday announced a series of bilateral economic and trade
agreements between the world's two most powerful economies.
The US president, whose Asian tour turned into an exercise to counter his
falling popularity at home, sought to portray his trade mission to Japan as
a success. 'I think we have created jobs,' the president said, declaring
that his message had 'been received'.
Mr Bush - shrugging off his collapse at a Tokyo banquet on Wednesday night -
and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, also pledged co-operation in
a Tokyo Declaration, a statement intended to symbolise a strengthening of
their relationship.
In the declaration and an accompanying action plan, the leaders acknowledged
that Japan and the US, as the two largest market-oriented economies and
democracies in the world, had a special responsibility for shaping the new
post-Cold War era. They reaffirmed their bilateral security alliance and
pledged to work together on global issues, including the reconstruction of
the former Soviet Union.
They also promised to co-operate in achieving a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round trade talks and welcomed the recent paper by Mr Arthur Dunkel,
the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which
laid out the outlines of a possible agreement on trade liberalisation.
Mr Bush, who ends his trip today, pronounced himself well on the road to
recovery from the gastric 'flu which he blamed for his collapse. He came
close to making official his candidacy for the Republican nomination for
this year's presidential election. 'I think I'm going to win,' he said.
The friendly words between the two leaders could not disguise the fact that
the bilateral trade agreements which accompanied the declaration contained
little substance. While the president claimed success, some of the US
businessmen accompanying him were sceptical. The trade deals also drew
criticism in the US from congressional Democrats with ties to the car
industry.
The agreements were the subject of tense negotiations, completed only hours
before the declaration was published. Japan promised to improve access for
foreign companies to markets including glass, paper, legal services and
computers, as well as cars and car parts - the main sticking point.
The US secured a promise from Japanese motor groups to increase their
planned purchases of US-made components from about Dollars 7bn (Pounds
3.8bn) in the 1990 financial year to about Dollars 15bn in 1994. That
includes imports and parts supplied to Japanese factories in the US.
Japanese companies promised to import more US-made cars - although the total
will be only about 40,000-50,000 and most will be Japanese-brand vehicles
made in the US.
Mr Bush described the agreements as 'a significant but interim step' and
pledged to accomplish more.
US motor industry leaders accompanying Mr Bush re-frained from criticising
him. But Mr Harold Poling, Ford Motor chief, said the Japanese carmakers'
proposals were inadequate.
Japanese car chiefs said the published documents represented the most they
could do to help the US industry. They resent being bullied by the US and
their own government.
Mr Lee Iacocca, the Chrysler chief and an outspoken critic of the Japanese
car industry, left Tokyo without comment. He plans to make his views known
in a speech today at the Detroit Motor Show.
Mr Bush and Mr Miyazawa also confirmed their promise, made in a declaration
on Wednesday, to promote world economic growth and seek to persuade other
industrialised countries to do the same.
The leaders pledged to aid developing countries and eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. They said they would co-operate in arms control,
environmental protection and science.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Russia and Ukraine vieto control Black Sea fleet
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUGGLE for control of the Black Sea fleet assumed the proportions of
an inter-state crisis yesterday as Russian politicians demanded that
territory be seized from Ukraine if it took over the nuclear-armed navy.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, told workers at an aerospace plant
in Ulyanovsk, in the Urals: 'No one, not even (Mr Leonid) Kravchuk will take
the Black Sea Fleet away from Russia . . . (it) was, is and will be
Russia's'
Mr Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, told Ukrainian officers yesterday that
Russia was now 'testing our resilience' over the naval dispute. On
Wednesday, he declared that the fleet would be taken over by Ukraine from
July. He said that he was not in breach of accords signed in Minsk last
week: 'As an independent state Ukraine has the right to have its own armed
forces.'
Ukrainian officials have also taken over a key communications facility
linking the central military command with 300,000 Ukraine-based troops,
including those in charge of tactical nuclear weapons.
Western concern about the spread of such weapons, and the technology to make
them, was voiced again yesterday in London by Mr Dick Cheney, US defence
secretary, who warned that it might be impossible to prevent new
nuclear-armed states emerging as a result of the Soviet break-up.
Russian politicians of various hues yesterday joined an increasingly bitter
war of words against Ukraine. Mr Sergei Baburin, leader of the hardline
Russia faction in the Russian parliament, called on Mr Yeltsin to abrogate
the 1954 decision which ceded the formerly Russian region of Crimea - in
which Sevastopol, the fleet's headquarters, is located - to the Ukraine, and
to allow 'any region outside the Russian Federation to enter Russia as
independent subjects'.
The leadership of the centrist Democratic Party of Russia said in a telegram
to Black Sea Fleet personnel that the takeover of the fleet by Ukraine
'could result in tragic consequences for the people of the Commonwealth.'
Although Mr Yeltsin said that 'we cannot quarrel with Ukraine' because of
the presence of 11m ethnic Russians in that republic, he is under growing
pressure to confront Mr Kravchuk on this issue.
Naval shipyard workers in Sevastopol have asked to be taken under Russia's
protection if Ukraine continues to demand control. Naval officers in the
town demanded that the fleet remain under control of the Commonwealth of
Independent States - the grouping which succeeded the Soviet Union, and of
which Russia and Ukraine are founding members.
Mr Yeltsin has instructed Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, head of the Soviet
navy, to tell Black Sea commanders they are under the protection of Russia,
and must not take the oath of allegiance to Ukraine now being required of
them if they wish to continue to serve in the fleet.
He himself has signed a decree introducing a military oath of allegiance to
Russia, which blurs the line between a Russian and a Commonwealth army by
obliging the recruit to serve 'in any place inside or outside the Russian
federation' where he is sent.
Admiral Chernavin, in an interview yesterday in the conservative newspaper
Sovietskaya Rossiya, said Ukraine had never been a naval power, and would
only be allowed to operate a small force to protect merchant ships and deter
smuggling. He said the entire navy was a 'strategic' force, in that it
guarded strategic shipping lanes.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Doctors sniff at 'flu epidemic warnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS reacted angrily yesterday to reports that Britain could be on the
brink of a 'flu epidemic which could severely hit companies already
suffering from a recession, writes Jimmy Burns.
The Royal College of General Practitioners, the medical body which monitors
'flu cases in England and Wales, said that there was 'no evidence' that the
country was on the brink of an epidemic.
One of the bodies warning of a serious outbreak - the Influenza Monitoring
and Information Bureau - is a public relations business funded by four drugs
companies: Evans Medical (a subsidiary of Medeva), Duphar UK, Merieux and
Servier.
Responding to reports that the 'killer' virus was heading for London, Mr
Richard Kenyon, the bureau's spokesman, said some reports had distorted its
remarks. But he insisted there was little chance of the capital escaping the
outbreak.
Medeva's shares rose by 6p to 239p on the London Stock Exchange yesterday.
Shares in other big pharmaceutical companies rose by between 3 and 4 per
cent. The rises are largely due to a general demand for drugs stocks but
reports of a 'flu epidemic have given dealers an additional reason to mark
up prices.
Figures to be published today by the Royal College will show an increase in
'flu cases, but well below the level at which health experts begin to become
concerned.
The CBI appeared unimpressed by suggestions that the A-Beijing 'flu virus
could soon bring London to a halt. An official said: 'I'm not aware of it,
in this building at least, and no member has failed to turn up because of
it.'

FT  10 JAN 92 / Bank may act after sterling falls below ERM limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the Bank of England to help the pound intensified last night
after the currency closed for the first time in London below its effective
floor in the European exchange rate mechanism.
A late fall in the currency was triggered as US investors switched money out
of D-Marks and into dollars. This movement, prompted by concerns about a
slowing in the German economy, weakened the pound in its cross-rate against
the D-Mark.
However, it also led to speculation that Germany might soon lower interest
rates, reducing strains in the ERM and opening the way for a cut in rates
across Europe.
As the pound's slide took place after 4pm, the London time at which ERM
operations end, the development failed to trigger any immediate official
intervention that would normally be required to prop up sterling's value.
Continuing weakness would force the Bank of England to act in support and
buy the pound, or even to raise UK interest rates.
At the London close, sterling stood at DM2.83, half a pfennig down on the
day and roughly a quarter of a pfennig below its effective ERM floor of
about DM2.832.
At the end of ERM trading the pound had been comfortably above the limit at
DM2.84. The pound's late fragility was exacerbated by sterling sales in New
York by traders worried about the outlook for the UK economy. However it
picked up to finish at DM2.8358 in the US.
Sterling's decline was in contrast to the view evident on the London stock
market where investors pushed the FT-SE 100 index 30.8 higher to a close of
2,497.9 on optimism about UK growth prospects and a strong opening on Wall
Street, which closed up 5.59 at a record 3,209.53.
In London last night, the dollar closed against the D-Mark up more than 3
pfennigs at DM1.5475, while against the US currency the pound lost nearly 4
1/2 cents, finishing at Dollars 1.8285. In New York the pound fell further
to finish at Dollars 1.816.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Appointments: Lep links at an end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Read, deposed as chairman and chief executive of Lep Group after a
boardroom coup in November, has resigned as a non-executive director of
Govett Strategic Investment Trust. His departure ends a long association
between Lep, the troubled distribution and security group, and what used to
be the flagship of the John Govett investment trust stable.
Govett Strategic used to specialise in taking strategic stakes in vulnerable
companies and replacing the management but more recently has come under
attack itself because of its poor performance. Govett was instrumental in
getting Read appointed chairman of Lep in 1982 and until October 1987 it had
a big stake in Lep.
Read went on the Govett Strategic board in 1985, and his links with the fund
manager also led to his appointment to the board of the Macarthy chemist
chain.
William Govett, a former chairman of John Govett and a director of Govett
Strategic since 1975, resigned as a non-executive Lep director in June after
eight years on the board.
Meanwhile, John Read may soon lose another job - his non-executive
chairmanship of Macarthy - if the Monopolies and Mergers Commission gives a
green light to either of two rival bids.

Prudential, which last month quit the Unit Trust Association after a very
public tiff, has appointed Jonathan Mindell to the new post of marketing
director in its unit trust operation.
Mindell, who moves from the post of marketing director of the now-defunct
Town and Country Building Society, co-ordinated the launch of Marks and
Spencer Financial Services into the unit trust and Personal Equity Plan
market. His task at Prudential will be to strengthen the company's existing
marketing of unit trusts in the UK as well as examine plans to develop
similar products for sale in Europe.
The UTA is urging that unit trusts, unlike life insurance, be 'de-polarised'
so that they can be sold through more sales outlets. Prudential, like the
rest of the life insurance industry, opposes the move.
If unit trusts are de-polarised, will Mindell be responsible for exploiting
the new marketing opportunities as well? 'We'll cross that bridge when we
come to it,' says the Pru.

FT  10 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an early interest rate cut led to volatility in financial futures
yesterday, and strength in the derivative markets acted as a subsequent spur
to the underlying cash market, writes Peter John.
Belief that the US would cut its discount rate and the hope that this would
relieve pressure in Europe encouraged buyers of the March contract. Dealers
noted strong early buying from a Japanese house.
The interest ensured that March, which had been coming closer to its fair
value - the premium which allows for dividend flow and financing costs on
the underlying Footsie stocks - moved upwards and, at one stage, was some 49
points above cash or 20 higher than fair value.
A number of dealers had been going short and were squeezed by the steadily
rising price of the contract. March reached the day's high late in the
session but then a seller brought it back to 2,542 for the official close.
On the LTOM, turnover leapt from recent desultory volumes to a respectable
32,800 contracts, above the market's perceived break-even point of 30,000.
Late dealing ensured that Grand Metropolitan was the most heavily dealt
stock option with turnover of 2,694 lots.

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: March plan for Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S stock exchange, shut down since Iraq's 1990 invasion, will probably
reopen in March, Reuter reports.
Economists say that other measures to revive trading, including giving
foreigners access, could limit falls in some pre-war share prices to between
10 and 20 per cent.
Mr Hisham al-Otaibi, the director-general of the bourse, said officials were
awaiting audited financial reports from the 56 companies which were listed
prior to the invasion.
He expected the government to buy about Dollars 20bn of domestic bad debt
from commercial banks and investment firms to boost confidence, and to
provide support for shares in banks, the bourse's most active sector.
Kuwait's exchange, once the liveliest in the Gulf, had an annual turnover of
around Dollars 3bn before its closure.

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Seoul finally lets the foreigners in -
But tight liquidity has caused some frustration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the start of this year, and after a prolonged wait, foreigners have
been allowed to invest directly in the Korean stock market.
But for many, the liberalisation of Asia's fourth-largest stock market has
been frustrating so far.
'Foreigners have been faced with very tight liquidity and great difficulty
in executing orders,' says Mr Philip Smiley of Jardine Fleming, one of two
foreign companies which have been approved to trade Korean shares. Mr Duncan
Ross, manager of Baring Securities' Seoul branch, says that on most days
less than 10 per cent of orders have been executed.
Liberalisation has, however, added some vigour to one of Asia's worst
performers. Yesterday the index stood at 637.1, up 4.5 per cent so far this
year. But the market still languishes more than 35 per cent below its 1989
peak of 1,008.
There are two reasons for the tight liquidity. On the one hand, the strength
of foreign demand has caused many shares to rise by the maximum daily amount
 -generally about a 5 per cent increase in the share price. Faced with such
strong demand, and in the expectation of further price rises, the number of
sellers has been limited.
At the same time, the limited nature of the market's opening has also caused
bottlenecks. Almost 50 of the shares on the market have reached the limits
allowed for foreign ownership - about 10 per cent of a company's outstanding
shares.
There has been some improvement. The fall in the market after the first few
days of trading has eased the pressure and the volume of orders executed has
correspondingly risen.
Whereas just Won6.87bn of foreign orders were concluded successfully on the
first day of trading, daily executions are now in excess of Won20bn,
according to the Securities Supervisory Board, a government agency. The
total value of foreign investment this year is now more than Won50bn.
Brokers and foreign investors complain that the procedure for investment is
still far from smooth. 'The technical side of things is proving complex and
frustrating,' says Jardine's Mr Smiley. He cites frequent failures of the
computer system, which co-ordinates orders and executions, and complex tax
requirements as some of the bigger problems.
Most of the foreign investors who are enduring the teething trouble of
liberalisation are long-standing players in Korean Euromarket instruments
and have a commitment to the Korean market. 'What we have seen so far is a
lot of buying pressure from Korea enthusiasts,' says one broker in Seoul.
As this initial demand is satisfied, the pressure of foreign buying is
likely to recede. 'I do not think we will see really substantial foreign
investment until the economic fundamentals improve,' says one analyst. With
domestic interest rates continuing to be very high, and with Korean
exporters still having difficulties in overseas markets, this may take a
while.

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on late
index-linked buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX-RELATED buying linked to the expiration of January options prompted a
rebound in the Nikkei average in the final hour of trading, writes Neil
Weinberg in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 398.64 up at 23,113.64. The finish was just off the day's
high of 23,114.54 while the low was 22,544.34. First section volume slipped
to 170m shares from 192m.
Although the Nikkei was higher, declines led advances by 479 to 459, with
162 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained
6.02 to 1,699.41 but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 5.89 at
1,277.32.
The market saw early bargain hunting after Wednesday's 3.6 per cent Nikkei
drop, but it retreated later on a fall in stock index futures prices. The
Nikkei then surged 372 points in the last hour on arbitrage-related buying.
Automakers, banks and brokerages were among the day's losers. Honda weakened
Y60 to Y1,420 on a downward revision of its earnings forecast for the year
to end-March, while Industrial Bank of Japan declined Y110 to Y3,100.
On the positive side were credit and leasing companies, food groups and
insurers. Ajinomoto rose Y30 to Y1,420 and Tokio Marine Y30 to Y1,300.
Many of the factors which have supported share prices in recent sessions,
including the yen's gains against the dollar and lower interest rates, have
been discounted and investors are now biding their time in the absence of
fresh news, dealers said.
In view of the market's lack of direction, there was relatively heavy
trading in smaller capitalised issues and speculative shares. Nippon Piston
Ring, a component in the Nikkei average, climbed Y100 to Y766 and Nippon
Carbon Y140 to Y2,070 on strong turnover.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 84.91 to 24,031.66 on volume of 26.4m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y120 to Y4,720.
Roundup
TRADING IN the rest of the region was mostly light, influenced by local
factors.
TAIWAN finished higher, spurred by the central bank's widely expected cut in
its rediscount rate. The weighted index closed 30.90 ahead at 4,803.51.
Turnover was TDollars 38.4bn, against TDollars 42.2bn.
HONG KONG closed marginally lower. The Hang Seng index eased 3.13 to finish
at 4,334. Turnover contracted to HKDollars 1.44bn, from HKDollars 1.66bn.
China Light moved forward 60 cents to HKDollars 24.10 on news of an
agreement with the government to allow it to report some of its profits from
electricity sales to China.
SEOUL recovered from early weakness to close higher. The composite stock
index added 11.26 at 637.11 on turnover of Won340bn.
Listed subsidiaries of the Hyundai Group fell by their daily limits for the
third successive day, because of lingering worries over credit. The group
and its main banker have denied rumours that it is facing a politically
motivated credit freeze.
AUSTRALIA ended slightly easier. The All Ordinaries index softened 1.4 to
1662.0. Newly listed West Australian Newspapers closed at ADollars 1.70, a
70 per cent premium to the offer price. It also topped the volume list with
more than 15.3m shares traded. A total of 113.4m shares worth ADollars
244.6m changed hands.
MANILA consolidated for the second day after recent upward moves. The
composite index receded 19.30 to 1,208.09. The index set a 25-month high of
1,241.48 on Tuesday.
NEW ZEALAND rose modestly, but low turnover exaggerated price gains. The
NZSE-40 Index ended 9.23 firmer at 1,519.56.
Fay, Richwhite &amp; Co rose 10 cents to 92 cents. The stock has climbed 51 per
cent in the last six sessions. Interest in the stock appeared to be linked
to publicity surrounding New Zealand's challenge for the America's Cup
yachting contest, starting soon in California. Sir Michael Fay, one of the
partners of a controlling stake in Fay Richwhite, heads the consortium
challenging for the Cup.
BANGKOK was supported by aggressive buying of Bangkok Bank shares, which
jumped Bt34 to Bt520, with Bt1.19bn worth changing hands, one-quarter of
turnover. The SET index put on 1.74 to 725.70 in turnover of Bt4.19bn.

FT  10 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Beregovoy boosts Paris by 2.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE took the spotlight yesterday following comments from the Finance
Minister Mr Pierre Beregovoy, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS rose 2.7 per cent after Mr Beregovoy said that the government planned
to encourage long-term savings, either through company pension funds or
personal equity plans. He also said that he was considering further
exemptions from the bourse turnover tax.
The CAC 40 index rose 48.22 to 1,833.86 in heavy turnover of FFr4.2bn.
Goldman Sachs was reported to have been an active buyer over the past two
days.
Peugeot jumped FFr27 to FFr657 on a favourable newspaper report, though
analysts said that it did not reveal anything new. The auto components
maker, Valeo, gained FFr38 to FFr615 while its main shareholder, Cerus,
surged 14.2 per cent or FFr13.70 to FFr109.90.
The insurers continued to climb, with UAP up FFr35 at FFr540 and GAN rising
FFr45 to FFr1,560.
Weak oil prices pushed Elf down by FFr13 to FFr364.50 in the day's heaviest
volume of 744,000 shares but the refiner, Total, rose FFr17 to FFr1,019.
FRANKFURT heard that a pay offer to steelworkers - 4 per cent for seven
months and 5.3 per cent for the next five - had been rejected. But talk,
originating in London, of a new offer of a little over 5 per cent pushed
bund futures higher and steel shares went with them, led by Thyssen which
rose DM8.50 to DM210.
Deutsche Babcock enlivened the engineering sector with a DM7.40 rise to
DM156.40, leaving the shares 13.6 per cent higher this year against a gain
of less than 1 per cent for the DAX index in the same period. A new
management and better-than-expected profits last year were listed by Mr
Horst-Kaspar Greven in Dusseldorf as Merck Finck's reasons for recommending
the shares.
The DAX index closed 11.03 higher at 1,589.76 after a 2.07 rise to 645.33 in
the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM4.1bn to DM4.7bn. Among retailers
Kaufhof rose DM18 to DM448 and Asko by DM15.20 to DM627; but Douglas fell
DM14 to DM628 when it indicated that a 17 per cent rise in 1991 sales would
not bring a commensurate increase in profits.
MILAN rose for the fourth day in good trading, with both foreign and
domestic investors seen buying. The Comit index added 6.56 to 523.52 in
turnover estimated at L90bn after Wednesday's L73.5bn.
Fiat rose L108 to L4,928, though analysts were bemused by the rise. Industry
data released yesterday showed a 12 per cent fall in Fiat's share of the
Italian car market last year. Fiat is due to report its 1991 results on
January 22.
ZURICH rose 1.9 per cent, the Credit Suisse index closing 8.6 per cent
higher at 462.1, on signs of lower interest rates. MADRID matched this on
strong overseas buying, the general index ending 4.83 to the good at 253.21.
AMSTERDAM also rose 1.9 per cent on hopes for lower interest rates. The CBS
Tendency index rose 2.20 to 115.6.
Nordic rallies included a STOCKHOLM gain of 1.9 per cent as the
Affarsvarlden General index rose 17.8 to 946.2 on leaks from the government
budget proposals due today, one of 1.5 per cent in HELSINKI with the Hex
index put on 12.28 to 811.90, and 1.2 per cent in OSLO with the all-share
5.08 higher at 429.54.

CANADA'S FORESTRY industry has mounted a broad-based campaign in Europe to
counter increasingly virulent criticism of its environmental practices.
The pulp and paper producers have been stung by articles in, among others,
The Observer and National Geographic magazine, as well a critical letter
sent by Greenpeace last October to German buyers of Canadian forestry
products.
The companies, supported by the Canadian and British Columbian governments,
hope that their efforts will forestall protests and boycotts such as those
that crippled the Canadian fur industry in the 1980s.
Mr Howard Hart, president of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association (CPPA)
in Montreal, said yesterday that 'we recognise the potential for regulations
and public attitudes on environmental matters to become significant trade
barriers'.
Mr Allan Sinclair, vice-president of British Columbia's Council of Forest
Industries, said that producers were receiving 'occasional questions' from
customers who 'want reassurance that forests are being well managed for the
long run.'
The counter-measures range from visits by customers, journalists and
parliamentarians to forests and mills in Canada, to a welter of publications
putting the forestry companies' case. Canfor Corporation of Vancouver
recently sent its chief forester to Germany on a speaking tour, and
MacMillan Bloedel is considering a similar initiative.
The CPPA has set up a task force, headed by the chief executives of Scott
Paper and Fletcher Challenge Canada, to suggest further measures. The
options include an environmental 'code of ethics', with compliance signified
by a stamp on Canadian products.
Criticism of the Canadian companies centres on their tree-cutting practices
and on the toxic effluent produced by pulp mills.

THE GOLD price on the London bullion market yesterday continued the rally
sparked by the oversold situation reached in Monday's sharp dip to below
Dollars 350 a troy ounce. Dealers said the stronger tone was underpinned by
good physical demand as the price advanced Dollars 3.45 to Dollars 353.75 an
ounce at the close. And afterhours trading saw a further rise to Dollars 355
an ounce as dealers responded to early gains in the New York futures market,
prompted by heavy US investment fund and Middle Eastern buying. The platinum
market was also firm, in response to news of a strike at Impala's Bafokeng
North mine in South Africa. The price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars
338.25 an ounce, up Dollars 2.65. Nervous short-covering continued to affect
the London Metal Exchange aluminium market, where the cash position closed
Dollars 11 up at Dollars 1,130.50 a tonne. But the rise had been trimmed as
a rise in the dollar dampened hopes of increased consumer demand. The firmer
dollar was a bullish factor for the sterling-denominated copper market,
where the cash position ended at Pounds 1,155 a tonne, up Pounds 30 on the
day. Traders noted, however, that when currency factors caused such big
movements it tended to make markets thin.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Negotiations to reopen on
Kambalda nickel mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN MINING Corporation, the Australian mining group, yesterday said it
planned to reopen negotiations with the Australian Workers' Union on the
future of its Kambalda nickel operations in Western Australia, which the
company has threatened to scale down.
WMC also said it had withdrawn about 100 redundancy notices due to take
effect today to demonstrate good faith in advance of a discussion of
unspecified 'initiatives'. A further 50 redundancy notices expected to be
issued today will be delayed.
The group said in November that it would not proceed with a proposed
ADollars 105m expansion of the Kambalda operation because of the refusal of
the union to accept proposals for continuous mining. However, it is believed
to have agreed to reopen negotiations after managers had a meeting with Mr
Ian Taylor, the deputy premier of Western Australia, earlier this week.
WMC wants to increase deep mining at several mines in the Kambalda area,
where it produces around 35,000 tonnes of nickel a year. The project was
part of a ADollars 400m (Pounds 160m) spending programme intended to
increase the group's total nickel output to 65,000 tonnes a year from
53,000.
However, the group says expanded deep mining cannot be competitive unless it
is accompanied by seven-day working, which it has been trying to introduce
for more than a year. The company claims the union is responsible for
'months of obstruction, strikes and divisive behaviour' at Kambalda.
The project appeared to be progressing well earlier this year when WMC was
given approval by the Induistrial Relations Council to move from five-day to
seven-day working. However, it was postponed last month after the state
government delayed the implementation of changes to the Mines Regulation Act
needed to allow continuous working.
WA is the only Australian state where continuous seven-day working is
forbidden by law.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean copper output forecast
to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S COPPER output is forecast to rise to almost 2m tonnes in 1992 after
reaching 1.8m tonnes last year, according to the Chilean Copper Commission
(Cochilco).
La Escondida, the giant open-pit mine which started production in December
1990, was almost entirely responsible for the 13 per cent increase. The
mine, which is owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ and a consortium of Japanese
smelters, produced the equivalent of 294,000 tonnes of copper in the form of
concentrates.
In its first year of operation, La Escondida surpassed El Teniente to become
the second biggest copper mine in the world after Chuquicamata, also in
Chile. La Escondida says it will produce the equivalent of 340,000 tonnes of
copper this year.
The current global shortage of smelting and refining capacity, which has
sharply raised treatment charges, will not affect La Escondida because
long-term supply contracts were clinched with smelters in Japan, Germany,
and Finland before the mine came on stream.
Apart from La Escondida, the other main source of Chile's increased copper
output in 1992 will come from Exxon's Los Bronces mine, which has just
completed an important expansion programme.
Codelco, the Chilean state copper company, remains the world's biggest
producer with an output of 1.12m tonnes in 1991. It's production, however,
has been falling since 1989 and is unlikely to recover in the near future.
Codelco's mines were hit by mid-year strikes and El Teniente, its
second-biggest division, has been plagued by rock-bursts in a section of the
underground tunnels that contains most of the mine's remaining reserves.
Despite Codelco's declining importance, the Chilean Copper Commission
estimates that the country's overall production will rise steadily due to a
number of large private-sector projects that will come on stream in the
mid-1990s. It forecasts that output will reach 2.18m tonnes by 1994.
Mr Holger Bannach, Chuquicamata's general manager, will be leaving the mine
in March to take up a post with a Codelco subsidiary in Germany, the company
announced this week. Mr Bannach was deeply unpopular with Chuquicamata's
miners, who accused him of running the mine with an authoritarian hand. His
dismissal one of the workers' demands during a three-week strike in July.
Although Codelco backed its general manager during the stoppage, Mr
Bannach's move is being regarded as a gesture to improve industrial
relations at the Atacama desert mine.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian Wheat Board makes
record CDollars 740m loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN Wheat Board has blamed the US-EC subsidy war and bumper crops
for a record CDollars 740m loss on grain sales in the 1990-91 crop year.
Last year's loss, which is only the third since the board became the sole
marketer of prairie wheat in 1943, will be financed by the federal
government. This subsidy will bring total government payouts to Canadian
farmers to about CDollars 5.5bn this year, with the bulk directed at
hard-pressed grain producers.
The board, which accounts for about 20 per cent of world wheat exports, said
it has made every effort to concentrate sales on the few remaining
'commercial' markets not targeted by US and EC subsidies. But only an
estimated 21 per cent of world wheat trade was not directly influenced by
export subsidies last year. In any case, the board noted that 'as subsidies
increase, competition for the remaining non-subsidised markets becomes more
intense'.
It said that US discounts for milling wheat under the Export Enhancement
Program were as high as USDollars 64.55 a tonne last year. EC export
subsidies reached a peak of USDollars 191.50 a tonne.
The wheat pool ended the year with a deficit of CDollars 673.4m, compared
with a CDollars 208.2m surplus the previous year. The board fixed initial
payments to producers before the start of the season at CDollars 135 a
tonne, but selling prices fell short by an average of CDollars 30.34 a
tonne.
For durum, the shortfall was CDollars 69.6m, or CDollars 20.36 a tonne. This
is the first time that the durum pool account has been in the red. The
barley account suffered a CDollars 1m loss, although the board reported a
CDollars 27m profit on malting barley sales.
This season's initial payment to wheat producers is CDollars 95 a tonne. In
an effort to match producer prices more closely with volatile market
conditions, the board now announces its prices just days before the season
starts each August. The 1990-91 prices were announced in May 1990.

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government has given the go-ahead for offshore oil
exploration in the Otway Basin, 200 km (125 miles) south-west of Melbourne,
in spite of threats of sabotage by environmental activists.
Mr Alan Griffiths, the federal Resources Minister, said Broken Hill
Proprietary would be allowed to drill exploration wells in the area under
strict environmental supervision. However, Mr Griffiths said it was 'in the
national interest' for BHP to start exploration quickly, without carrying
out the environmental impact study which is usually required.
The announcement follows growing pressure on the government to speed up the
approval process for major projects to help reduce unemployment, which
stands at a post-war record of 10.5 per cent. The government said BHP had
agreed to observe a strict environmental management plan, which would be
supervised jointly by the federal government and the state government of
Victoria.
BHP said the plan would ensure the protection of the marine environment in
the basin, which is an important breeding ground for the Southern Right
Whale between April and October.
Greenpeace, the international environmental organisation, said the decision
was 'appalling,' and threatened direct action to prevent drilling. The group
used rubber dinghies to disrupt BHP's seismic survey of the area last year.
'It (is) absolutely appalling that this decision has been made without any
environmental impact statement,' said Mr Rick Humphries, Greenpeace national
liaison officer.
Federal government officials suggested the field could contain more than 3bn
barrels of oil, compared with Australia's existing reserves of about 1.9bn
barrels. The biggest producing field, in the Bass Strait, contains about 1bn
barrels.
However, BHP said the area was 'assessed to be frontier exploration, and as
such has a relatively low probability of (containing) major hydrocarbon
accumulations'.

THE CANADIAN province of Nova Scotia expects to raise CDollars 400m by
privatising Nova Scotia Power Corporation, the provincial power utility,
writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The government said yesterday it planned to offer shares in NS Power by the
end of June. No single shareholder would be allowed to own more than 10 per
cent of the shares, and foreign investors as a group would be limited to a
25 per cent stake.
NS Power earned CDollars 24m net income in the last fiscal year from
revenues of CDollars 636m.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange is being asked by its membership to restore
the controversial practice of dual trading.
Dual trading, which was restricted by the CME last May, is when brokers can
trade for their own as well as for customers' accounts. It is widely
considered by regulators and the US Congress to make fraud easier in the
commodities markets. Legislation pending in Congress would curb dual trading
in US futures markets.
The CME, the first exchange to curb the practice, is under pressure to
reconsider its policy after several hundred floor brokers and traders signed
letters in recent weeks demanding its return. The CME's board of governors
was to hold a meeting on the issue late yesterday with the exchange's full
membership.
Members were expected to express their desire to overturn the restrictions
on dual trading.
These currently ban the practice for futures in which a daily average volume
of 10,000 contracts has been achieved for six months. Consequently,
two-thirds of all trades at the exchange, including its stock index,
currency and Eurodollar futures, are covered by the ban.
CME brokers and traders complain that market liquidity has been negatively
affected and that customers were suffering from poorer prices for their
orders. Profits for the brokers and their customers were reportedly down.
A decision on the policy could come at the next CME board meeting on January
22. If the board does not act, it could face a petition for a referendum on
the rule change from the floor.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Citibank confirms Samba stake
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIBANK confirmed yesterday it sold a quarter of its 40 per cent stake in
Saudi American Bank (Samba) last month to two Saudi government-run pension
institutions.
The US banking group would not divulge how much money was raised by the sale
of the 10 per cent stake, but it said reports that Dollars 467m had changed
hands bore little resemblance to the truth.
The full details of the transaction will be included in Citibank's
fourth-quarter results and based on the current value of Samba shares, the
600,000 shares sold would have been worth about Dollars 336m.
Taking advantage of a sharp rise this year in Saudi share prices, the US
bank decided to sell part of its stake in Samba to boost its capital ratios
for the final quarter.
Troubled by huge doubtful real estate loans and massive operating losses,
Citibank has instituted a restructuring programme aimed at cutting costs and
bolstering its weak capital base.
The US bank said yesterday the sale would not undermine its long-term
commitment to Samba, and it would continue to provide the bank with
management expertise according to a longstanding agreement with its partners
in the joint venture.
Citibank's links with the Saudi kingdom, which go back to 1980 when it took
a 40 per cent stake in Samba as a joint venture with several Saudi
institutions, were strengthened a year ago when a prominent member of the
Saudi royal family, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal bought Dollars 590m
convertible shares in Citicorp, the bank's parent group.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCED Micro Devices, the Silicon Valley semi-conductor manufacturer,
reported a surge in fourth-quarter sales and a 'virtual stampede of
customers' ordering its version of the 386 micro-processor, the chip used to
power many of the most popular personal computer models.
'In an otherwise lacklustre semiconductor market, all of AMD's growth came
from micro-processors,' said Mr WJ Sanders, chairman and chief executive.
Last year, AMD mounted a challenge to rival Intel's dominance of the
personal computer microprocessor market by launching its own versions of
Intel's widely-used 386 chips.
The companies are involved in a series of complex legal disputes over AMD's
rights to produce the microprocessors.
Fourth-quarter revenues rose by nearly 38 per cent from the like period a
year ago. AMD reported record revenues of Dollars 366.2m and net income of
Dollars 106.7m before payment of preferred stock dividends.
After the preferred dividend, quarterly net income was Dollars 1.17 per
common share. Operating results for the quarter included a charge of Dollars
7m in connection with previously-announced plans to close down one of the
company's oldest production lines in the second quarter of 1992.
The results also included a net gain equivalent to 52 cents per common share
from sales of assets, primarily the sale of 3.5m shares of Xilinx, another
US chip maker.
In the fourth quarter of 1990, AMD reported revenues of Dollars 265.9m and a
net loss of Dollars 43m, or 55 cents a share, after dividend payments.
The loss included a charge of Dollars 27.7m, for an adverse judgment in
patent litigation with Brooktree. AMD is appealing the court decision.
For fiscal 1991 AMD reported revenues of Dollars 1.2bn, up 16 per cent from
Dollars 1.1bn in 1990. Net income for the year was Dollars 145.3m, or
Dollars 1.53 per common share after preferred dividends.
This compared with a net loss of Dollars 53.6m, or 78 cents a share, after
dividends in 1990.
'In the final quarter of 1991, we more than doubled sales of Am386 products
to over Dollars 145m,' said Mr Sanders.
'AMD expects continued double-digit growth in the current quarter, driven by
microprocessor sales. I expect the remainder of AMD's business will be
essentially flat, reflecting the continued sluggishness in the economy,' he
concluded.

Texas-based gas maker
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON SANSO, the Japanese industrial gas producer, is to pay Dollars 90m
for Tri-Gas, a Texas-based gas maker, which is likely to become part of the
Japanese company's growing US network of companies supplying the
semiconductor industry.
Early last year, Nippon Sanso faced US Justice Department opposition to the
purchase of Semi-Gas, a leading US maker of gas equipment for
semiconductors, but a court ruled in March that the acquisition did not
violate anti-trust legislation.
Nippon Sanso said Tri-Gas, with a staff of 320 and annual sales of about
Dollars 70m, produced oxygen, nitrogen and other gases for steel, chemical
and other US industrial companies. However, the Japanese company said that
it would eventually form part of its 'total gas centre' network supplying
the semiconductor industry.
'We don't expect any problems with this acquisition. At the moment, the
company is simply a supplier of general use gas,' a Nippon Sanso spokesman
said. 'We want to link its capability to that of our other US companies.'
The opposition to the Semi-Gas purchase became a symbol of US concerns about
foreign acquisitions of high-technology companies. The inter-agency
Committee on Foreign Investment approved Nippon Sanso's bid, made through
Matheson Gas Products, an earlier acquisition by the Japanese company, but
the Justice Department attempted to block the purchase.
Nippon Sanso said that Tri-Gas was purchased in the expectation that demand
for industrial gas would generally increase with a recovery in the US
economy, and that demand from high-technology companies for special gases
would inevitably expand.
In the Japanese market, Nippon Sanso, the largest producer of oxygen, has
been hurt by rising materials and transport costs, with the country's labour
shortage causing a general increase in transportation charges. The company
also has a joint venture in Malaysia, and a facility in Singapore.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Company News: Italian banking finds a new
force / A look at a three-way Roman bank merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S banks have been known for strange moves over the centuries, but sex
changes have not been among them. Not, at least, until now.
That is what will happen to Banco di Roma, the big Rome-based bank until
recently controlled by the IRI state holding company. It will become part of
three-way banking merger under way with Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, the Rome
savings bank, and Banco di Santo Spirito, another sizeable Roman bank, also
formally owned by IRI.
The product, to be called Banca di Roma, will be Italy's second biggest
financial institution, with total assets over L130,000bn (Dollars 113.2bn)
and some 1,100 branches by end-1992.
Although the difference in connotations between a Banco and a Banca may be
lost on most Italians, let alone foreigners, the new name will be a small
but significant sign of changes in the country's creaking banking system.
The three banks fit well together. The Rome Cassa is concentrated in Rome
and Lazio; Banco di Santo Spirito is also strong locally, but has nationwide
branches, too. And while Banco di Roma has no particular local roots, it
offers a sizeable national and international network.
Their skills are also complementary. Banco di Roma's dependence on
relatively volatile interbank funds will be counter-balanced by the
established local deposit base of its two partners. But Banco di Roma will
also provide many of the international banking skills, particularly in
capital markers, which the other two lack.
IRI's willingness to sell stemmed partly from the fact that both Banco di
Roma and Banco di Santo Spirito have reputations which are more illustrious
than their earnings. In 1990, Banco di Santo Spirito's net profits amounted
to L92bn. Net profits at Banco di Roma were L159.2bn on total assets of
L75,052bn.
By just changing one letter, the new Banca di Roma should capitalise on the
strong national identity and international familiarity of its almost
eponymous predecessor. Yet the switch from masculine (banco) to feminine
(banca) will also provide a newer and more modern gloss, according to Mr
Cesare Geronzi, director general of the Rome Cassa.
Whatever the semantics, investors may be well-advised to remember the name.
Under the complex merger, IRI now has 35 per cent of holding company
controlling the three banks.
However, IRI's current financial problems mean it may end up with much less
before the new bank takes shape.
Mr Geronzi will not say whether or when IRI might float its shares. But many
analysts believe that private investors, rather than IRI, will eventually
form the second biggest shareholding group in the new bank after the
foundation which controls the Rome Cassa itself.
The investment could be appealing. Banco di Roma, which until last year was
the only member of the trio to be quoted, has hardly been a star; only in
1991 year did it resume dividend payments after a five-year gap.
By contrast, Mr Geronzi forecasts the new Banca di Roma will have operating
profits of L1,800bn in 1992. That will represent a full year's contribution
from the Rome Cassa and Banco di Santo Spirito, and six months' earnings
from Banco di Roma, which will be integrated by next April.
His optimism is indirectly confirmed by some bankers' astonishment that the
deal has been allowed to go through without running into anti-cartel
barriers.
Although the new bank will have a virtually uncontested position in central
Italy, Mr Geronzi denies that a monopoly will be the primary motor for its
profits. 'When we thought this up it wasn't to create the biggest bank in
Italy but to create a unit able to fight growing competition and retain its
market share, and then go on to win more,' he says.
Earnings may also be limited by Italy's powerful bank unions and strict job
protection laws, which will hamper large-scale rationalisation. Even Mr
Geronzi talks of staff transfers rather than cuts.
That may be partly explained by the fact that the new bank still has room
for organic growth. In the 20 towns where the Rome Cassa and Banco di Santo
Spirito have overlapping branches, closures have been avoided by moving one
branch to another part of town. The market could sustain both branches, and
closing one would only have opened the door to a competitor, he explains.
The Rome Cassa will also continue its strategy of taking minority stakes in

a third due by the year-end.
Eventually, Mr Geronzi would like to extend such deals as far north as the

lot of talks with other local savings banks under way,' he says.

The move, subject to approval by the US Federal Reserve Board, comes a
little more than a year after SBC invested SFr90m (Dollars 69.2m) in an 80

SBC said the proposed acquisition was aimed at improving the bank's

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Company News: Decline in cross-border deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of cross-border mergers and acquisitions fell 55 per cent last
year to Dollars 51.9bn, according to management consultants KPMG Peat
Marwick. That is the lowest level since KPMG began recording deals in 1988.
The number of deals fell less sharply to 1,793 from 2,725 the previous year.
There were only five deals worth more than Dollars 1bn each, compared with
23 in 1990.
For the first time in four years, the European Community overtook the US to
become the most popular target region for takeovers. Cross-border sales of
EC companies totalled Dollars 23.3bn, compared with sales of US companies
worth Dollars 18.7bn.
The US remained the single most popular target country, followed by Britain,
where sales totalled Dollars 9.1bn, compared with Dollars 20.4bn in 1990.
Cross-border purchases by British companies fell to Dollars 6.3bn from
Dollars 20.6bn the previous year.
The strongest activity last year was in the final quarter, when the
worldwide value of deals reached Dollars 15.1 bn. However, KPMG said that
was less than half the level a year earlier, and did not signal a recovery
in the cross-border M&amp;A market.
Nonetheless, KPMG cautiously forecast increased cross-border M&amp;A activity
this year in several sectors, including food, drink and pharmaceuticals. It
also expected foreign purchases of UK media companies to increase.

unit to Henkel

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOBEL Industries, the Swedish chemicals and defence group, is selling its
consumer goods division to Henkel, the German chemicals group best known for
its range of washing powders.
The divestment will mean an increase in Nobel's own capital of around
SKr2bn, with a net profit of SKr150m (Dollars 27m) from the transaction.
Mr Ove Mattesson, chief executive at Nobel Industries, said the sale would
improve the Swedish group's own financial position and was in line with
Nobel's stated policy of concentrating its activities in those sectors with
the best long-term growth possibilities.
The company made a SKr1.5bn loss for the first eight months of 1991, mainly
because it was forced to write-off SKr1.8bn of its equity in the finance
company Gamlestaden, which collapsed last August.
The consumer goods division achieved a SKr2.6bn turnover last year which
accounted for 9 per cent of Nobel's group sales and for 14 per cent of its
SKr1.04bn profits (after financial items). It is involved mainly in the
manufacture of chemical-technical products for cleaning and polishing as
well as hygiene care.
Mr Mattesson said Nobel lacked the financial resources to carry out the
structural changes and expansion within the consumer goods market but he
added Henkel would be in a good position to improve its growth.
The German group, which employs 42,000 workers had a SKr47bn turnover last
year. It is strong not just in Germany but also in Italy, France and Spain.
The acquisition of Nobel's consumer goods gives it a first foothold in the
Nordic market.

FT  10 JAN 92 / International Company News: French to reform pension schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government will this spring produce proposals for the creation of
new private equity plans and to reform corporate pension schemes as part of
moves to expand the use of private pensions, a move which could have
significant consequences for France's financial markets.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, yesterday told a Paris conference
that he planned to launch a tax-efficient private equity plan. He also said
he would in early April unveil proposals for the fonds salariaux, corporate
pension schemes used by a small number of senior managers.
The French stock market rose on the news. The main Paris bourse index, CAC
40, ended the day 2.7 per cent higher at 1,833.86.
At present, almost all French pensions are administered by the state, with
the exception of the fonds salariaux, available only to a minority of the
workforce. The system is administered by the Caisse de Retraite, which acts
as a cash manager by paying for pensions from the money received from those
in employment.
This system is coming under strain as the French workforce grows older. By
the year 2020, France is expected to reach a demographic 'crunch' whereby
there are more people living off pensions than there are in employment to
pay for them.
As a result, the French government has been considering ways of stimulating
the use of private pensions, a politically sensitive subject given the
opposition of the powerful trade union lobby.
The expansion of private pensions has important implications for the French
financial sector. First, it provides a potentially lucrative new market.
Second, it could produce a sorely-needed source of investment for the stock
market thereby helping to improve liquidity.
'At present, we don't know exactly what the French government plans to do,'
said Mr Robin Hubbard, European economics analyst at Paribas in London. 'But
the development of private pensions would be good news for both equities and
bonds.'

ROCHE, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, said in a preliminary statement that
consolidated sales in 1991 increased by 19 per cent to SFr11.5bn (Dollars
8.2bn) and it expected 'a gratifying improvement' in profits.
All divisions contributed to the increase, which was only 15 per cent in
local currencies. Sales of the pharmaceutical division, accounting for over
half of the total, were up 23 per cent to SFr5.9bn. The antibiotic Rocephin
and the anti-rheumatic Tilcotil were notable contributors to the growth.
Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals, 24 per cent of the total, grew 14 per
cent to SFr2.7bn, due partly to growing acceptance of the prophylactic
benefits of beta-carotene.
Above-average growth rates were achieved for flavours and chemicals sales,
but demand for fragrances in the luxury perfume sector declined. Division
sales rose 22 per cent to SFr1.3bn.
Sales in the service laboratory business in the US were weaker but the
diagnostics division as a whole had an increase of 8 per cent.

CLARKE FOODS, the invest-ment company turned ice cream manufacturer headed
by US businessman Mr Henry Clarke, will today announce a rights issue to
raise some Pounds 7m to help pay for the acquisition of Lyons Maid from
Allied-Lyons, the food and brewing group.
The purchase of Lyons Maid - believed to be for some Pounds 12m - will
propel Clarke into Britain's number two ice cream manufacturing slot, after
Unilever. Clarke will also pay for Lyons with cash and a Pounds 3m term
loan.
The cash call is expected to be pitched at a price modestly above the
share's suspension price of 54p. The group said that trading in its
USM-quoted shares - which have been suspended pending completion of the
Lyons deal - would be resumed today.
Clarke also announced pre-tax profits for the year to October 31 25 per cent
ahead to Pounds 1.13m on sales of Pounds 11.2m. Earnings rose from 4.7p to
5.7p and the final dividend is 1.5p (1.25p), for a total of 2.25p (2p).

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Agent orange and the cash bandits - The
security companies' continuing battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN ONE of Securicor's engineers had his van stolen from a public car park
recently it was about as embarrassing as a weather forecaster being soaked
in a rain storm.
But after contacting his office, the engineer was able to call the police
not only to report the theft but also the location of the stolen van, thanks
to Securicor's Datatrak radio tracking system which is fitted to most of its
vehicles.
The device is one of the latest weapons in an armoury which cash carriers
like Securicor employ to foil the gangs bent on diverting some of the Pounds
190bn moved around the country each year.
Despite the recession and the growth of credit card use, there is more cash
in circulation than ever before. Although the golden age of pay-roll heists
has passed the movement of this amount of cash remains a magnet to
increasingly professional gangs.
Last year the number of attacks fell as did the amount successfully stolen,
according to the British Security Industry Association. Provisional figures
suggest there were 7 per cent fewer attacks and about 45 per cent less cash
lost compared with 1990. However that year was the worst year on record, the
Association says.
Securicor was, however, the unlucky one last year. It suffered a 33 per cent
increase in attacks, according to Mr Roger Wiggs, its chief executive.
Carrying about Pounds 100bn of cash a year in 1,500 armoured trucks,
Securicor is by far the largest carrier with a 56 per cent share of the
cash-in-transit market which has total sales of about Pounds 240m.
Over the past two decades the number of attacks on all carriers has grown
sharply. Securicor faced only one-a-month in the mid 1970s but by 1987
attacks hit an annual peak of 376. And last year a Securicor van was
attacked on average once every working day.
But Securicor is foiling far more villains. The one third increase in
attacks last year has been matched by a rise in the failure rate to about 50
per cent.
Not surprisingly Mr Wiggs sounds like a general marshalling his 'troops' in
an endless quest to second guess what techniques the 'bandits' will make use
of in their next strike.
Mr Wellwood Grierson, sales director of Security Express, which with its
associate, Armaguard, is the second largest cash carrier having about 23 per
cent of the market, is not complacent following the apparent targetting of
Securicor.
He is aware that the gangs tend to rotate their targets and that his company
could be worse hit next year. As it is 45 of the 60 attempted robberies on
his vans were successful last year.
The gangs appear to pick what they see as that month's softest target. Four
years ago, for example, there was a perception that Group 4, the third
largest carrier, was the softest touch. It tightened its procedures and the
gangs' attention appears to have swung away from Group 4 following a heavy
investment programme, industry sources say.
Group 4,a subsidiary of Australia's Mayne Nickless, refuses to give
information about how much it carries and how much it loses.
As the market has matured, the carriers have sought to diversify. Securicor
has moved into the delivery of credit cards in high risk areas like London,
Manchester and Glasgow, and fills the automated teller machines for many of
the building societies.
As banks increasingly try to reduce their handling of cash to turn their own
premises into shops for financial services, cash storage centres
increasingly hold, sort and distribute cash on their behalf.
Securicor is understandably coy about just how much is stored in these
super-high security vaults. There is, on average, one attempt a year on the
vaults, all of which have failed.
In addition Securicor is trying to tempt the small corner shop trader to use
the services of smaller armoured vans for the movement of relatively modest
sums of cash to and from banks.
As the bandits have become more sophisticated, so the security companies
have developed increasingly more fiendish tactics in an attempt to foil
them.
Securicor's Datatrak is one technique, using terrestrial radio technology
developed with Wimpey, the construction group, from offshore navigation
technology. Once a Securicor van veers from its appointed route, the control
centre is immediately alerted.
In a recent raid on a van in Harlesden, north London, the police had been
alerted and were on the scene within eight minutes. Group 4 and Security
Express/ Armaguard use similar techniques.
Another invention restricting the scope for the professional gangs is the
'exploding' cash box which is designed to prevent attacks at the point of
greatest vulnerability as cash is carried across the pave-ment.
Here the carriers have redefined catching a thief red-handed. Should the
cash box be taken more than a certain distance from the armoured van, it
will emit a cloud of orange powder which covers everything, including the
robber, within its immediate vicinity.
Just for good measure, the heat from the 'explosion' reduces the notes to an
ugly unusable mess.
The bottom line for the cash carriers is to cut the loss rate, to cut
insurance premiums and the amount of each loss they have to swallow. As
prevention across the pavement and in the banks themselves improves the
gangs are increasingly turning to kidnapping and extortion from families of
security guards.
None of the major companies believe keeping pace with the criminals while
improving margins in a highly competitive and mature market is going to be
anything but a continuing battle.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Missing Maxwell funds include Scitex
proceeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS have dis-covered that Pounds 107m of the funds missing from
the Maxwell pension funds are the proceeds which should have been remitted
from the sale of a 15 per cent holding in Scitex, the Israeli manufacturer
of electronic typesetting equipment.
The shares were sold in October. However, the proceeds were taken by Robert
Maxwell Group, one of the big Maxwell private companies, according to
confidential documents prepared by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the
accountancy firm which carried out the first investigation of the collapse
of the Maxwell empire.
The disclosure that the pension funds had owned the Scitex shares is a
surprise.
Mr Maxwell always implied that he had made the investment with his own money
and was feted in Israel for having made substantial investments.
In October, he announced the sale of the shares on notepaper headed 'Robert
Maxwell Group'. In the press release, he said that the shares had been
bought originally by Robert Maxwell Group in 1989 and the clear implication
was that Robert Maxwell Group was also the seller.
The press release refers to the disposal of a 19 per cent stake in Scitex.
Arthur Andersen, the accountants acting as administrators to the Maxwell
private companies, said yesterday that between 70 per cent and 80 per cent
of those had been owned by the common investment fund of the Maxwell pension
funds and not by Robert Maxwell Group.
Mr Maxwell had secretly sold the shares to the pension funds in June 1990.
But pensioners never learned of the deal, because the most recent annual
reports they received covered the funds' activities in the year to April 5
1990.
The disclosure that Mr Maxwell was using pensioners' assets to make his
Israeli investments - and not his own money - may affect Mr Maxwell's
reputation in Israel, where he was buried in a ceremony worthy of a national
hero.
Mr Maxwell also used pension fund money to acquire a stake in Teva, an
Israeli pharmaceutical company. These Teva shares, worth Pounds 44m, were
also transferred out of the pension funds.
Coopers' report says the shares were pledged as security against the Maxwell
private company's loans from National Westminster, the UK clearing bank,
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, and Credit Suisse, the Swiss Bank.
The pension funds are trying to reclaim the Teva shares and may resort to
legal action.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: MCC pension confusion persists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAXWELL Communication Corporation pension fund is in such a mess that no
sensible estimates are yet available on its financial status. It is not even
clear precisely who is covered by the fund although the total is believed to
be about 4,600 people, writes Raymond Snoddy.
The confusion has been increased by the number of bulk transfers of
pensioners from one fund to another as the late Mr Robert Maxwell bought and
sold companies within MCC and reorganised its structure.
The Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the investment trust company called in
to MCC on December 10 to sort out the debris, is now trying to find out what
should have been in the pension fund. Auditors are due to report by the end
of next month. Work is also being carried out on what the future liabilities
of the fund are expected to be and the activities of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, the company in the Maxwell private empire which managed most of
the fund's assets.
It may be several months before a clear picture emerges of the present state
of the fund.
All the Law Debenture Trust could say yesterday was: 'We are determined to
see the scheme is put back into funds.'
Ordinary MCC pensioners will continue to receive their pensions but a range
of restrictions have been imposed on the scheme for the time being.
No new applicants are being accepted into the fund and there is a moratorium
on bulk transfers in or out of the scheme.
Members retiring now are unable to take part of their pension as a tax-free
lump sum because this would amount to a preferential call on what could turn
out to be limited resources.
MCC was Mr Maxwell's main quoted vehicle with debts almost certainly greatly
exceeding assets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The hostile offer for AmBrit International from Pittencrieff, the oil
production and communications group, lapsed yesterday with Pittencrieff
having received acceptances in respect of just 3.4m shares (5.2 per cent)
and Pounds 436,102 nominal of the loan stock (48.6 per cent).
Together with its existing holding, Pittencrieff now has a total of 23m
AmBrit shares (35.1 per cent).
On Wednesday United Energy, the USM-quoted oil and gas group, made an agreed

Pittencrieff expects to profit significantly from its offer as its holding
in AmBrit at United's cash alternative of 9p per share should realise a
gross profit of about Pounds 685,000.
Pittencrieff's shares rose 12p to close at 202p yesterday.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Improved severance for Cityvision board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Cityvision voted to improve their own severance terms about the
time they were holding talks with US-based Blockbuster Entertainment Company
about a recommended bid, according to Blockbuster's offer documents.
Blockbuster made an offer to acquire Cityvision on November 22 1991 in a
shares and cash deal valued at Pounds 75m. Shareholders have been urged by
the company's management to accept the offer.
An official at J Henry Schroder Wagg, adviser to Cityvision, said that the
talks had actually broken down by the time the enhanced terms were approved.
However, Blockbuster's offer document says that representatives of the two
companies met on several occasions in the late summer of 1991 'to discuss
whether Cityvision would consider possible types of business combinations'.
The document notes that the talks were inconclusive and ceased on September
6.
The document also notes that on August 30 1991, three of the four directors'
contracts were amended to increase the amount of severance they would
receive from 2 times annual earnings to 2 1/2 times. The contracts were also
amended to allow the directors to earn severance if they left voluntarily
following the acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in Cityvision - up from the
previous level of 10 per cent.
Mr Beverley Ripley, Cityvision chairman, earns an annual salary of Pounds
116,640 while Mr Terry Norris, managing director, earns Pounds 110,160. Mr
RG Prime and Mr GM Brown, directors, earn Pounds 64,800 and Pounds 100,980
respectively.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles at Pounds 17m and outlines
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the highly-geared management buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food
stores, outlined a three-pronged retailing strategy aimed at moving the
group towards reflotation, as it lifted pre-tax profits for the half year
ended November 9 to Pounds 17m against Pounds 700,000.
At his first results ann-ouncement, Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, who took
over as chief executive last September after the sudden resignation of Mr
David Smith, the man who engineered the unfortunate Pounds 2.1bn buy-out in
1989, said the objective remained 'to get to the stock market as fast as
possible.'
Reflotation could happen between one and three years from now, depending on
market and trading conditions, said Mr Ernest Sharp, chairman.
The group's retailing strategy is to target all sectors of the market
through its high street locations. To this end it will accelerate the
programme for increasing the up-market Somerfield stores while continuing to
develop middle market Gateway stores and gradually increasing the number of
outlets of Food Giant.
No new Gateway outlets are to be opened and it expects to have between 50
and 60 Somerfield stores by April of next year. The Food Giant stores were
profitable, while Somerfield had put in a better performance than Gateway.
The success of the strategy will be crucial to the longer-term viability of
the group, still burdened with borrowings of Pounds 1.3bn. Interest payments
totalled Pounds 85.3m (Pounds 99m) and were covered less than 1.5 times by
operating profits of Pounds 102.3m (Pounds 99.7m).
The group is confident that it will be able to meet a capital repayment of
about Pounds 100m due in April next year even without a sale of Herman's,
its loss-making sporting goods retailer in the US. Mr Sharp expressed
optimism for the sale as he expected substantial efforts would made to boost
the American economy in an election year.
Although pre-tax profits were up on the Pounds 3.6m made in the year to
April 27, turnover for the six months was down to Pounds 1.6bn (Pounds
1.67bn). After the below-the-line Pounds 13.1m loss mainly from Herman's,
there was attributable profit of Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 12.3m loss).

The agency has cut the rating on Ratners' Amps from BBB to B and is keeping
the shares on its Creditwatch list, meaning the rating may either be lowered
or raised depending on future developments. S&amp;P is soon to meet the company
to review its financial health.
S&amp;P said: 'The rating reflects the near-term uncertainties relating to the

FT  10 JAN 92 / Apple to move into consumer electronics
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE COMPUTER plans a big thrust into the consumer electronics market from
the second half of this year in a bid to expand its sales. The group's plans
include the launch of consumer versions of its personal computers and the
development of a range of electronic products which it calls 'Personal
Digital Assistants'.
Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive, said the company would
begin by establishing its presence in consumer electronics sales channels in
the US later this year.
He said Apple's entry into the consumer business would be 'additive and
complementary to its core personal computer business, and is part of the
company's phased approach to expanding its markets'.
Apple plans to introduce new versions of its Macintosh personal computers
with built-in compact disc players offering video, as well as sound,
graphics and text. Mr Sculley said these 'multimedia' systems were expected
to be available in the US for the 1992 Christmas selling season.
From the end of the year Apple also plans to offer the first of its new
Personal Digital Assistant products. Mr Sculley said these products would
have specific consumer applications, unlike general-purpose personal
computers.
He said products Apple envisaged launching over the next few years included:
electronic books, display telephones, interactive 'multimedia players'
offering high-quality video, sound, graphics and text, wireless
communicators combining telephone and computer technology, and personal
organisers that could fit in the palm of the hand.
Alliances with established consumer electronics companies would be a key
element of Apple's strategy to enter the field, Mr Sculley said. Apple was
building such relationships with several companies, he added.
'New products base on Apple-created software technologies will be introduced
in 1993, both under the Apple brand and also by several other companies
under their own labels,' he said.
Although Mr Sculley declined to identify Apple's new partners, they are
expected to include several of Japan's leading consumer electronics
manufacturers.
He added: 'We are interested in playing an important role in creating
easy-to-use devices for digital-based consumer information services.'

FT  10 JAN 92 / The land of the share-owning couch potato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE MOST affected by the recession might not recognise the picture, but
Britain is a highly prosperous society en-joying unprecedented wealth.
An official government handbook, published yesterday and used by British
diplomats to sell the country overseas, reveals a country with record
amounts of leisure and holiday time and a growing number of homeowners and
shareholders.
The reference book, Britain 1992, published by the Central Office of
Information, is intended to paint the country in the rosiest light, and
little mention is made of the effects of the recession or the impact of
rising unemployment.
It nevertheless presents a comprehensive contemporary picture of British
political and social affairs and gives an insight into changes over the last
decade and more. The overall impression is of a nation of leisured couch
potatoes whose life is governed by the acquisition of consumer durables. In
1989, for example, 91 per cent of full-time manual employees were entitled
to more than four weeks' paid holiday, while in 1961, 97 per cent were
entitled to only two weeks.
The number of share owners has risen to one in four of the population in
1990 from one in five three years ago and one in 13 in 1979. and the number
of people owning their own homes has risen nearly four-fold compared with 40
years ago. Home ownership in 1990 stood at 15m com-pared with 4m in 1951.
However, the average size of households has fallen from more than four
people in 1911 to 3.09 in 1961 to 2.46 in 1990 as more people live alone.
Television easily remains the favourite pastime, followed by listening to
the radio, do-it-yourself, reading and gardening. More than nine in 10
households had colour television and almost 25 hours a week on average was
spent in front of the set.
The 480-page glossy handbook, the latest of 43 annual editions, shows there
has been little change in alcohol consumption in the past decade.
However, big changes have been recorded for cinema admissions, which have
increased by 84 per cent since 1984, mail order purchases, up from 16m in
1981 to 20m a decade later, and car-related crime, which accounts for 25 per
cent of all crimes compared with 10 per cent in 1957.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Letter: The politics of taxation in boom and in recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID FITZSIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It has often been said that the electorate gets the government it
deserves. I wonder, however, what we, in our collective wisdom, have done to
saddle ourselves with an administration which reduced taxation at the height
of an unsustainable boom and may now face the real possibility of a Labour
government promising higher taxation in the depths of a recession.
A sure way for Labour to achieve the necessary 10-point lead in the polls to
have a realistic chance of winning the next election requires John Smith,
the shadow chancellor, to admit that his party's taxation plans are no
longer appropriate (if they ever were) to Britain's current economic
circumstances. His policies run the risk of being the last straw which
finally breaks the back of consumer confidence.
The chances of such a public change of heart, however, are remote. Labour,
therefore, deserves to lose the next election. The problem for us
long-suffering voters is that the Conservatives barely deserve to win.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Personal View: More power needed in electricity competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID NEWBERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extensive restructuring of the English and Welsh electricity supply
industry in March 1990 was meant to make the industry more competitive. With
growing public antipathy to the replacing of public monopolies with private
ones - as with BT and British Gas - the government was under pressure to
design a more competitive industry.
Now, against the wishes of the Central Electricity Generating Board, England
and Wales have 12 private regional distribution companies, two private
generating companies and the publicly owned Nuclear Electric. The
distributors jointly own the National Grid Company (NGC), which in turn owns
the transmission system and co-ordinates the generators. The regional
distribution companies are closely regulated by the Office of Electricity
Regulation, as they are natural monopolies, but the two private generators,
National Power and PowerGen, are not regulated.
Together with Nuclear Electric, they submit price bids one day ahead for
each power station to the NGC controller. The controller computes the
least-cost combination of stations to meet demand, informs the companies
which plants to hold ready for despatch and then, on the day, despatches
power to meet the varying demand. The 'pool' price for each half hour is
then normally the price of the most expensive plant to be called on to meet
demand in that period.
This practice of generators bidding against each other was presumably the
argument for not regulating them, as they would be induced to undercut one
another. If they failed to compete aggressively, new suppliers might enter
the market with combined cycle gas turbine plants. These are cheap, quick to
build, and more efficient than existing coal and oil-fired generators.
Upon privatisation, the generators were fitted with a set of contracts for
the supply of coal to the generators, and for the sale of electricity to the
distributors. While these contracts remain in force, they have a powerful
effect on electricity prices; in the first few months of privatisation, pool
prices were rather lower than expected. Recently, however, as some of these
contracts have expired, prices have edged up by about 20 per cent since last
year, although demand and fuel prices are both lower.
What is likely to happen when the generators come to renew their contracts?
What should we expect to happen to the price of electricity in 1993, when
the present price caps are relaxed? Electricity consumers are unlikely to
sign contracts at prices much above pool prices, and generators would be
imprudent to sign contracts below the expected pool price, so future
contract prices are likely to approximate the expected pool price.
To predict the pool price without contracts, we have built a simple model*
of the pool to see whether the generators are compelled to behave
competitively, or whether they can exercise market power.
At low levels of demand, both generators will bid close to fuel costs to
ensure that their base-load plant is despatched, but at higher levels of
demand it becomes profitable to bid a price that leaves a larger margin over
fuel costs. In periods of very high demand, National Power, the largest
generator, knows that the demand cannot be satisfied by the remaining
suppliers, and so it has a monopoly in this residual market. If National
Power bids in its more costly plant at a very high price, it may not be
called until demand is high, but then it will be highly profitable.
PowerGen, observing this, can afford to raise its bids. The pool will be in
equilibrium if each generator has no wish to change its bids, given the
schedule of bids of the other. In such an equilibrium, raising bids would
mean lower supply and profits, while reducing bids would mean higher supply
but lower prices and profit.
What about the threat that such high prices would tempt new generators to
enter? This does reduce the temptation for the generators to raise their
prices. The best strategy for National Power and PowerGen results in an
average pool price about 35 per cent above variable costs, but this is still
sufficiently high to attract some 8GW of entry by 1994. At these prices,
National Power and PowerGen together have an operating surplus more than
twice as high as in their last year under public ownership.
How might the privatisation have been better managed? If the fossil-fuelled
stations had been divided into five equal-sized companies, each would have
had a well-balanced set of power stations.
The effect would have been dramatic. The incentive to raise prices would
have been almost eliminated and, looking to 1994, competition between the
five would have kept prices low enough for no extra entry to take place. The
average price in 1994 would have been 10 per cent lower than with the
duopoly, but the main saving would have been on the extra investment cost of
unnecessary new capacity. The country as a whole would be Pounds 250m better
off each year. The profits of the generators would be slightly lower (by
about Pounds 100m), but the consumers benefit by Pounds 350m.
Put starkly, there are two ways to increase competition. The best way would
have been to create an initially competitive industry. Failing that, entry
by new companies will achieve similar results, but at the cost of
unnecessary spare capacity and higher prices. If our predictions are
correct, consumers have further price rises to look forward to as contracts
are renegotiated, all because of a failure to get the original structure
correct.

FT  10 JAN 92 / From tight corner to high wire: The chancellor is beginning
to prepare his Budget under heavy political pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British chancellors of the exchequer do not usually attract much sympathy.
The person responsible for taxing the nation must also cultivate an aura of
aloofness and gravity to reassure financial markets.
But it is difficult not to feel sorry for Mr Norman Lamont as he sets off
today for a two-day meeting with Treasury ministers and senior officials at
Chevening in Kent to start preparing his second Budget in March. Decisions
made before the chancellor's appointment in November 1990 give him little
scope to revive Britain's depressed economy, even though its plight is
central to campaigning for the general election that must be held by July.
Mr Lamont is boxed into a very tight corner.
Britain's membership of the European Monetary System has placed monetary
policy largely in the hands of the Bundesbank. The sharp increase in German
interest rates before Christmas and sterling's position at the bottom of the
EMS exchange rate mechanism mean that he has little hope of repeating last
year's feat of cutting interest rates before the Budget.
The chancellor's scope for fiscal action - already limited by the move back
into budget deficit this year - may be further constrained following his
admission that the growth forecasts in last November's Autumn Statement were
'over-optimistic'. That implies lower tax revenues and higher benefit
payments and is bad news for the government's finances in 1992-93.
Unlike previous Conservative chancellors since 1979, Mr Lamont must draw up
his Budget during a fierce election campaign. The 1983 and 1987 Budgets were
announced before it was clear that there would be an election in those
years. The prime minister's decision to leave polling day until the final
year of this parliament raises the already strong political pressures on the
chancellor.
Mr Lamont has also excluded various policy options - in part to reassure
financial markets and partly from political conviction.
He has rejected devaluation of sterling in the EMS, even in the context of a
broad realignment of member currencies.
He has ruled out emergency measures to give the economy a boost, even though
the government has powers temporarily to lower value added tax and so
stimulate consumption.
The chancellor has insisted that the government's pre-Christmas move to
abolish stamp duty on most house sales until August does not presage a more
active fiscal policy.
At a meeting this week of the National Economic Development Council he
stressed the government's commitment to a balanced budget over the medium
term and rejected calls for emergency state spending on training and
infrastructure.
In the face of continuing bad news about the economy and pressure for the
government to 'do something' to boost activity, Mr Lamont has stuck to his
belief that lower inflation, rising real incomes, healthier corporate
finances and last year's fall in bank base rates to 10.5 per cent from their
previous 15 per cent peak will bring recovery this year.
In a normal year, Mr Lamont might have pursued his interest in tax reform in
the Budget. But this is unlikely in 1992 because of the election.
To some, Mr Lamont seems more like a harassed technocrat than a holder of
one of the great offices of state. 'By having made the decision to join the
EMS, it is questionable whether we need a chancellor,' scoffs Mr Jim
O'Neill, head of capital markets research at Swiss Bank Corporation.
However, the limitations on the chancellor's freedom of action do not mean
that his weekend in the elegant ancestral home of the Earls of Stanhope will
be limited to enjoying the food and listening to Treasury officials play
woodwind instruments.
Budget Day is, after all, one of the great events in the British political
calendar. If the Conservatives are to win the election, and so save the
careers of the prime minister and Mr Lamont, they must make it a success.
The political pressures on the chancellor are already apparent. Mr Lamont
was to be found this week in front of a large billboard in south London,
helping to launch the Conservative party's onslaught against Labour's tax
policies. Although he has so far ducked all questions about his own tax
plans, the Conservative campaign risks building up expectations of a tax
cutting Budget among ordinary voters and party activists that may have to be
disappointed.
Whether the government's finances can meet such expectations will be high on
the Chevening agenda. Here, the outlook may not be as bleak as implied by
the sluggishness of the economy.
of government gilt-edged securities have been strong in recent months,
suggesting that this year's public sector borrowing requirement will be
funded with ease, even if it exceeds the Pounds 10.5bn Autumn Statement
forecast. Although a bigger question-mark must now hang over the PSBR for
1992-93 (which is already expected to rise to around Pounds 20bn), the City
seems to have overcome its earlier fears that the UK might be heading for
several years of chronic deficit with the Conservatives in power.
Mr Lamont will therefore be studying some tax-cutting options at Chevening.
One of the most politically attractive must be cutting the basic rate of
income tax by one penny from 25 pence in the pound. This would inject funds
into the economy, mark out the Conservatives as the party of lower taxation
and put Labour on the spot by challenging the opposition to raise taxes
again, should it win the election.
However, a one penny tax cut would be expensive - costing Pounds 1.95bn in
the coming financial year. Its electoral appeal is uncertain. An opinion
poll for the Independent newspaper and BBC television's Newsnight programme
this week suggested that most voters would prefer higher spending on public
services.
Another option could be to raise the thresholds at which income is taxed by
more than the statutory rate of inflation. Such an increase in personal
allowances would have the advantage of taking some lower paid voters out of
taxation altogether. The cost to the Treasury of changing all main
allowances by 1 per cent would be Pounds 210m. With inflation at about 4 per
cent, it would therefore be relatively cheap to increase the allowances by,
perhaps, twice the rate of inflation. However, such an approach to tax
cutting has less political impact than a simple tax rate cut.
The Independent/Newsnight survey found that voters would prefer a lowering
of value added tax from its present 17.5 per cent to a cut in income taxes.
But VAT changes are expensive - a 1 percentage point change in the VAT rate
would cost Pounds 1.73bn in 1992-93. Any cut would also look like a
climbdown by Mr Lamont because he raised VAT in last year's Budget.
Like all chancellors, Mr Lamont has come under pressure from lobbying groups
to help industry by introducing tax incentives for investment or, in the
case of the motor industry, by abolishing the special car tax. The Treasury
has always been hostile to the first idea because it would undermine the
corporation tax reforms of the 1980s, while the car tax move would be
expensive, costing about Pounds 1.3bn.
A more imaginative approach for helping business has been put forward by Mr
Andrew Dilnot, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He suggests
easing the burden of the uniform business rate. This is levied on companies
whether they are making a profit or loss. The valuations underlying the rate
were based on the boom conditions of the late 1980s and are now hurting many
businesses, particularly in the south east, which have suffered declining
property values during the recession.
However, it is unlikely that Mr Lamont will make any final decisions about
taxes at Chevening. What is certain is that the meeting will mark the start
of a difficult period for the chancellor. On Sunday, Mr Lamont said: 'I am
determined to do everything I can to help the Conservative party to win the
election, but what I'm not prepared to do is take risks with the economy'.
His is a high-wire act, which the voters will judge later this year.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Letter: Dividends and retained profits not of equal value in
UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R A HAMMOND-CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The statement in your leading article, 'Dividends in recession'
(January 4) that 'Economic theory suggests that the market should put an
equal value on retained profits and dividends, except to the extent that the
tax system favours one against the other', should be contradicted.
It is not so. the value of retained profits is uncertain and depends on the
return made on their investment in the future. In Japan and Germany, where
retained earnings have as a generalisation been well invested, retained
earnings are highly regarded. In the UK - and other Anglo-Saxon countries -
they have not been so well invested; quite naturally, therefore, investors
in the UK prefer the rather more certain value of dividends.
When corporate UK proves to its shareholders that profits are better used by
the companies for the benefit of the shareholders themselves, then investors
will put a higher value on retained earnings - higher, possibly, than on
dividends.

AGGRESSIVE UNILATERALISM: America's 301 Trade Policy and the World Trading
System
Edited by Jagdish Bhagwati and Hugh T. Patrick
Harvester Wheatsheaf, hardback Pounds 35 (Dollars 66.95); paperback Pounds
10.95 (Dollars 17.95)
THE FAIR TRADE FRAUD: How Congress Pillages the Consumer and Decimates
American Competitiveness
James Bovard St Martin's Press, hardback Pounds 17.60 (Dollars 24.95)
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?' Any
right-thinking American congressman would have no difficulty in finding the
politically correct reply: US trade policy is perfectly fair. Unfairness
elsewhere explains the overall US trade deficit, bilateral trade deficits
with Japan, the recession and almost any other ill to which the American
economy is deemed subject.
Uruguay Round outcome or none, American aggressive unilateralism is here to
stay. One need only look at how Mr Bush has turned his visit to America's
most important trade partner, Japan, into a sales promotion trip. A
blatantly discriminatory agreement on the sale of American auto-parts is the
most obvious result.
Mr Bush probably knows better. But he has to respond to the pressure back
home, where Congressman Gephardt has introduced a bill attempting to turn
Japan into a planned economy. Not that he would put it that way. But how
else is Japan to comply with demands that it reduce its trade surplus with
the US by 20 per cent in each of the next five years?
What is wrong with this orgy of American self-righteousness? These books
address different aspects of the question, the first in a scholarly, the
second in a blisteringly journalistic manner. The two accounts, both
excellent in different ways, are complementary and their conclusion clear:
neither in its assumptions about US rectitude, nor in its likely
consequences can unilateral US pursuit of the holy grail of 'fairness' be
justified.
The notion of 'fair trade' is pervasive in modern trade policy, but it is
Section 301 of successive US trade acts which gives the idea its aggressive
force. The post-1988 Section 301 does two things: first, what is usually
called 'regular 301', which gives the US administration the power to
retaliate in support of US rights claimed under the GATT; second, 'super'
and 'special 301', which enjoin retaliation in support of complaints that
involve foreign behaviour deemed 'unreasonable'.
The book edited by Jagdish Bhagwati and Hugh Patrick is concerned entirely
with this piece of legislation. In what must be the classic article on its
legal implications, Professor Robert E. Hudec takes as his provocative title
'Thinking about the New Section 301: Beyond Good and Evil'.
Professor Hudec concludes that under both aspects of Section 301,
GATT-illegal action is possible. But he argues that disobedience of the GATT
could sometimes be justified as a way of strengthening what is, for all its
successes, a defective legal process.
Professor Hudec's defence of the new Section 301 only makes his ultimate
conclusion the more damning. 'The heart of the problem is that the law is
based on an outrageous premise - namely, that the commands of Section 301 do
not apply to the US.' The US is to be judge and jury of a law it does not
apply to itself.
Such a stance must reduce international trade law to the law of the bully.
But Professor Bhagwati demonstrates that aggressive unilateralism also makes
little economic sense. 'Just as the belief that import restrictions will
cure the trade deficit refuses to die, . . . so does its flip side: that
lowering foreign trade barriers will cure the trade deficit.'
Some powerful countries must take the US on. Equally important, however, is
to assail the fevered rhetoric of 'fair trade'. Professor Bhagwati points
out, for example, that 'if everything becomes a question of fair trade, the
only outcome will be to remove the possibility of ever agreeing to a
rule-oriented trading system'. He is right. What must also be stressed,
however, is that under the hypocrisy and the whingeing, one finds, in James
Bovard's words, that 'the most common foreign 'unfair trade practice' is
producing a better product at a lower price'.
'When politicians speak of unfair trade, they do not mean that buyers and
sellers did not voluntarily agree,' says Mr Bovard, 'but that US government
officials disapprove of the bargains American citizens choose to make.' And
why do they disapprove, asks Mr Bovard? For a simple reason: their
paymasters say they should.
Neither the bleats about 'fair trade' nor aggressive unilateralism can be
justified. What explains both is a mixture of confusion, greed, the search
for scapegoats, and good old-fashioned hypocrisy. The results are damaging
to trade, the trading system and, not least, the American economy. So the
next American congressman who looks at the mirror should remember what
happened to Snow White's wicked stepmother.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Educating the majority
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL TESTING reaches state secondary schools this year, with most
14-year-olds due to sit pilot tests in mathematics and science in June.
English and technology will be added next year, when the tests become
compulsory, and history and geography will follow in 1994.
The tests are welcome, and should help to monitor and stimulate pupils'
progress at a time crucial to their prospects of succeeding in public
examinations. Less satisfactory, however, is progress in two other vital
areas in 11-19 education: the creation of an effective 'vocational route',
and reform of A-levels.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, dismisses as 'a myth' any belief
'that the education system across the rest of Europe is somehow perfection
compared with our own'. Lump school-leavers together with sixth formers, he
told a Commons committee last month, and 'we are absolutely in line with the
crowd for 16-year-olds', with almost 90 per cent in full or part-time
education or training.
Perfection is not to be found in this life, and there is no such place as
'the rest of Europe'. It is not, however, a myth that Britain's record in
post-16 vocational education lags well behind that of France and Germany, to
take concrete countries. And however you play the numbers game, Mr Clarke's
90 per cent is achievable only by lumping in all Youth Trainees (barely half
of whom gain any qualifications at all), and that proportion falls
dramatically among 17 and 18-year-olds. Put bluntly, British education
abandons most school-leavers of average and below-average ability.
Lightweight
Britain's failure to develop institutions akin to Germany's Realschulen
(technical high schools) and Berufschulen (vocational training schools) is
at the heart of the problem. The government's current reform of vocational
qualifications, particularly its promotion of new general vocational
qualifications, are steps in the right direction. But early indications
suggest that many of the new qualifications will be lightweight and far too
job-specific. And since ministers refuse to countenance any compulsion on
employers to train young employees, those in work will benefit little from
them.
For 16-year-olds able to jump clearly through the GCSE hoop, prospects are
far brighter, with small A-level classes and a broad range of degree courses
and universities all before them. But if A-levels are indeed, as Mr Clarke
told the same committee, 'about the one bit of the system which works at the
moment', it bodes ill for the rest. For few now believe that three
single-subject A-levels make for a satisfactory post-16 curriculum.
More challenging
More does not necessarily mean worse. A broader post-16 curriculum,
including English, maths and a foreign language as compulsory courses,
should prove more - not less - challenging to students than the status quo,
and make the illiterate engineer, innumerate historian and monolingual
everything figures of the past. The International Baccalaureate is an
excellent and proven model: IB students study six subjects (including the
above), three at a higher level and three as subsidiaries, and their final
grade depends upon performance in all six.
Some wish to see a single baccalaureate as the goal of both 'academic' and
'vocational' students. But that is a lesser issue, except for those who
believe that parity of esteem can be imposed by fiat. The priority is to
promote reform on both fronts, without exacerbating fears that the A-level
'gold standard' is to be debased in the process.
In any case, a greater barrier to mobility between the two routes lies in
the division of post-16 students between sixth forms (offering only A-levels
and GCSE re-sits) and further education colleges (many with poor academic
records but catering for BTECs and other vocational courses). Pupils need to
be more aware of choices open to them at 16 - which is why, of all the
education cuts of recent years, those in local careers services are among
the most damaging.
This is the third in a series on British education policy.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Arts: Peter Grimes - Bavarian State Opera, Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Jonas's appointment as the next intendant of the Bavarian State Opera
is already bearing fruit. He was able to offer Tim Albery's ENO production
of Peter Grimes to the Munich company, after its own well-advanced plans for
a Peter Hall/John Bury staging were scuppered by defects in the stage
hydraulics. The ENO Grimes, designed by Hildegard Bechtler, does not require
complex scene-changes, and the designers of this season's other new
productions in Munich have had time to adapt their ideas to the reduced
technical capacity. But the hydraulics problem has forced the State Opera to
modify its existing repertory - Gotterdammerung, for example, can only be
played as a concert performance and November's revival of Penderecki's Ubu
Rex was cancelled. In August, the theatre will close for at least half a
year - possibly for the whole of the 1992-3 season - so that the hydraulics
can be sorted out. All this comes only two years after the last lengthy
closure for backstage modifications.
But it's an ill wind . . . Peter Grimes has handed the company one of its
biggest triumphs of recent seasons. When the production was first seen in
London in April, Max Loppert praised it here as eye-and ear-opening, with
visual qualities of a north European, expressionist hue. Munich offers a
very different context. German audiences are no strangers to expressionist
art or the language of Brechtian theatre, and have none of the performance
tradition or wealth of associations which their British counterparts bring
to Grimes. Yet the production's merits are no less striking.
Albery treats Grimes in a way no German director would dare to do. He brings
the drop-curtain down during the interludes, preserving the integrity of
Britten's graphic sound-pictures. He dispenses with incidental details of
the borough and its personalities, depriving the Munich audience of the
work's quaint English colouring (which most German productions like to
stress). Instead, his abstract, anti-realist approach - particularly telling
in the shadowy chorus personality - focuses on Grimes as one of the great
tormented figures of 20th century opera, battling in vain against the
destructive forces in himself, in society and the elements. Albery deserves
credit for communicating his ideas so successfully to the Munich cast, who
sang the work in English and made every word understandable (Mrs Sedley's
'I've never been in a pub in my life before' raised a good laugh).
But this was just as much a musical triumph, thanks to Andrew Davis'
idiomatic command of the score and ability to inspire the best from all
around him. Choral and orchestral responses were crisp and full of
conviction. Davis, who will also conduct the work at Glyndebourne next
summer, lets the music speak simply and directly, supplying the quiet tragic
grandeur and detailed characterisation that is missing on stage. Like the
rest of the packed, enthralled house on the night I attended, I had never
imagined this music could be so moving.
Rene Kollo brings to the title role an unexaggerated humanity and
considerable stage presence. His Grimes is neither brute nor visionary: he
is lonely, unpredictable, heroically courageous. Kollo, balding and craggily
dishevelled, cuts a striking figure. The sustained top notes are a strain,
but he has not forgotten how to sing quietly, delivering the great mystical
solo at the Boar with precentor-like purity. Pamela Coburn's Ellen radiated
feminine sensitivity and goodness. Donald McIntyre's Balstrode was the
perfect old sea dog.

Television is into the retro business in a big way, re-cycling material
which was not at the top of the popularity stakes in its own day, but was
always cultish and has maintained a dedicated fan following ever since. BBC2
begins its evening schedule with an episode from Thunderbirds, the 1965
series in which Captain Troy Tempest and International Rescue fought the
cold war in a puppet version of James Bond.
That series (6.00) seems to appeal to the same sort of eternal teenagers who
love 'Flash Gordon' and also Doctor Who which follows on at 6.50. This
particular story, a 4-parter, is set in 1066 but was also made in 1965 with
William Hartnell, the original, starring as the time-travelling doctor.
Then at 8.00 BBC1 begins a 'new' series which had its genesis in 1973. Grace
And Favour is a new title but the cast (Mollie Sugden, John Inman, Frank
Thornton, Wendy Richard) starred in 'Are You Being Served?' Set in a
department store, this sitcom featured Mrs Slocombe's famous pussy and
Inman's catchphrase 'I'm free'. In the new series they are running a country
hotel instead of a shop. Expect little that is otherwise different.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Arts: Drawn to conclusion - The cream of the Courtauld
collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to the gospel that the best art is spontaneous and inspirational,
drawings should reveal artists at their most creative and the more swiftly
executed they are the better. Any subsequent polishing represents a watering
down and loss of the initial divine spark.
Drawing may indeed be the automatic writing of art, yet the first draft is
not invariably the last word. The sequence of 80 sheets on show at Somerset
House which represents the cream of the Courtauld collections, serves as a
reminder that drawings were also conceived as stepping stones in a process
leading to the creation of a fresco, panel, canvas or print. On occasion
they were deemed finished works of art in their own right. Here is abundant
evidence that drawings may be finished without being dry, polished but not
pedantic.
The sheets on view veer towards the highly finished and reflect the tastes -
as well as the generosity - of the Courtauld Institute's great benefactors.
All the early Netherlandish and Italian drawings - like the ethereal Hugo
van der Goes, the minimalist, almost Rembrandtesque Fra Bartolommeo
landscapes in pen and ink, Durer's Wise Virgin and an extraordinary Giovanni
Bellini - were bequeathed in 1978 by Count Antoine Seilern, along with the
Rubenses, Parmigianinos, the Tiepolos and Watteau.
Sir Robert Witt spent the more modest means at his disposal acquiring then
unfashionable Guercinos, and highly decorative 16th and 17th century
Northern landscapes. The short but spectacular run of English watercolours -
including JR Cozens's infinitely subtle view of the Castel Sant' Angelo -
came from William Wycliffe Spooner. Anthony Blunt gave Bernini's
unacceptably Baroque project for the east facade of the Louvre.
The Courtauld drawings, far less well known than their painted cousins, are
remarkable by any standard. This celebratory show was originally planned to
coincide with the opening of the new galleries in 1990, and to inaugurate
the Institute's first proper drawings gallery. That proved impossible, and
the show was postponed until this winter. Sadly the event seems to be
slipping by almost unnoticed; the gallery was forlorn and silent. It will
probably be another decade before these or any comparable selection of
masterpieces are shown again.
Immediately striking is how many artists are seen at their best.
Parmigianino's 'Conversion of St Paul' is exceptionally large and
elaborately wrought but also thrilling. The chaos and terror of the moment
as Saul falls from his horse blinded by heavenly light, is captured in
quick, nervous lines, and the drama heightened by the contrasts of brilliant
white bodycolour and sepia washes.
Guercino is represented by a study from everyday life of two girls drying
their hair by the fire; Piazzetta by characteristic large black chalk heads.
Tiepolo illustrates his inimitable verve and vitality in pen and ink and
wash; Turner his virtuoso watercolour technique with two grand English
landscapes.
These artists are justly admired but prolific. The collection is remarkable
for its rarities, the sheets from an earlier period when drawings were not
valued or collected and tended not to survive. Giovanni Bellini's Nativity
of the 1470s, carefully built up with a web of hatched strokes, for
instance, is one of only three or four pen and ink drawings by the artist.
He has endowed his Bethlehem with a skyline reminiscent of his native
Venice. Ox and ass kneel to worship the Christ Child and warm him with their
breath. Another handsome rarity is a compelling Holbeinesque portrait
drawing by Lorenzo Lotto.
Most celebrated of all the Courtauld drawings, however, is Michelangelo's
challenging allegory of 'The Dream of Human Life' which, like so many of his
presentation drawings, may have been given to his beloved Tommaso de'
Cavalieri. It has been described as one of the finest drawings in the world,
and as a technical miracle.
Such is Michelangelo's mastery that the sculptural central male nude seems
less to have been created out of black chalk than confected out of thin air.
Michelangelo chooses to bring to the fore and fully model Man, who leans
against a trumpeting angel. In the surrounding arc the ethereal vices seem
distant and dreamlike and as if carved in low relief. This is evidently not
a first draught, but it is the last word.
Master Drawings from the Courtauld Collections, sponsored by Toray
Industries, continues at Somerset House until January 19.

FT  10 JAN 92 / The Property Market: Canada's coastal splash-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North America's property slump was not in evidence when 100 apartments in
the Park View tower went on sale in Vancouver last November. Although the
25-storey building is still just a hole in the ground, every unit was
snapped up within 10 days, at prices from about CDollars 225,000 to CDollars
750,000 (Pounds 105,000 to Pounds 350,000) apiece.
Park View marks the first stage of Pacific Place, Canada's biggest real
estate development. The ambitious CDollars 2.5bn project on the southern
fringe of Vancouver's business district is designed to turn the
now-flattened site of the Expo 86 World Fair into a residential and
commercial complex, sprawling over more than 200 acres.
If all goes to plan, the waterfront development will include 9.2m sq ft for
42 residential buildings and 3m sq ft for shops, offices and a 400-room
hotel.
The sponsor of the Pacific Place project is Concorde Pacific Developments, a
company controlled by Mr Li Kashing, the Hong Kong magnate. Cheung Kong Real
Estate, another Li Kashing company based in Hong Kong, sold about half of
the 100 Park View units to investors in the Far East, while the Park View
development is being financed by Hongkong Bank of Canada, a subsidiary of
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, of which Mr Li is deputy chairman.
The response to the Park View offering might have been less enthusiastic
were it not for a widely held perception that Vancouver is on the verge of a
period of explosive growth. Property developers compare the future of
British Columbia over the next decade or two with California in the 1950s
and 1960s. The population of Canada's most westerly province is already
growing faster than in the country's other 10 provinces, rising 2.7 per cent
in 1990 and by about 2.6 per cent in 1991.
Many of the new arrivals are from eastern Canada, drawn by the more
temperate weather and easygoing lifestyle. But there has also been a huge
influx of immigrants from Asia, especially Hong Kong, in the past five
years.
Far Eastern money has already left its mark on the Vancouver skyline. Three
quarters of the city's hotels and dozens of office buildings, shopping malls
and apartment buildings are owned by Asian investors. Hong Kong and Japanese
developers have been the most active, but Mr Jon Markoulis, vice-president
of Concorde Pacific, says there has been growing interest recently from
Singapore and Taiwan. He estimates that foreigners currently account for
25-30 per cent of all property sales in the city.
Mr Li and his partners bought the Pacific Place site from the British
Columbia government in 1988 for CDollars 320m. Concorde Pacific made a down
payment of CDollars 50m, with the rest to be paid between 1994 and 2003.
Bank of Montreal has promised construction finance for the second
residential tower. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is among the minority
shareholders in Concorde Pacific.
Development of Pacific Place is scheduled to take 10-15 years. Construction
of the first building is six months behind schedule, but Mr Markoulis blames
a complex municipal planning approval process, rather than a soft market. He
says that Concorde Pacific's plans for the project as a whole have not
slowed down at all.
Pacific Place is separated from the central business and shopping district
by almost a mile of rundown warehouses and light industry. But Mr Markoulis
rejects any comparison with London's Canary Wharf. He describes Pacific
Place as an 'in-fill' project, rather than one stranded far from the city's
existing hub. A commuter rail station built for Expo 86 is adjacent to the
site of the proposed hotel and the project's commercial core.
Overall, Vancouver has not escaped the downturn in the North American
property market. According to Colliers Macaulay and Nicolls (CMN), a large
real estate broker, the downtown office vacancy rate is 14 per cent. While
nominal rents for prime space are around CDollars 25-CDollars 30 a square
foot, inducements (which can total as much as three years of rent on a
10-year lease) almost halve the effective rate.
'There has been a decided cooling towards investment in office properties,'
says Mr Ray Ahrens of CMN's office leasing group. The commercial component
of the Pacific Place project is unlikely to be built before the mid-1990s.
Optimism is high, however, that the recovery, especially in the residential
market, will be more vigorous in Vancouver than in most other parts of the
continent. Even now, the white and yellow signs which advertise developers'
re-zoning applications are as eye-catching in the downtown area as the 'for
sale' and 'for lease' notices.
Across town from the Concorde Pacific project, a Canadian developer,
Marathon Realty, is in the final planning stages of an 82-acre development
known as Coal Harbour. Marathon received zoning approval in early December
for the first phase of the project, consisting of six residential towers
spanning three city blocks.
Coal Harbour, most of which used to be a railway marshalling yard, has the
advantage of a spectacular view across Burrard Inlet to the snow-capped
mountains which dominate the Vancouver skyline. Marathon expects to start
selling fully serviced sites next year and, barring a further weakening in
the market, construction is due to start towards the end of 1993 or in early
1994.
No buildings have yet sprouted on the desolate Expo 86 site, but Pacific
Place has already become a magnet for other developments. Eight blocks of
flats are going up nearby, and the Vancouver city council has decided to
move the main municipal library to a site adjacent to the project. Rundown
warehouses in the vicinity are also gradually being transformed into
restaurants, design studios and upmarket shops.

R v MONOPOLIES AND MERGERS COMMISSION, EX PARTE SOUTH YORKSHIRE TRANSPORT
LTD AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE TRANSPORT AUTHORITY
(FT, December 6)
The South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority owned the entire share
capital of South Yorkshire Ltd which was a public transport company
providing local services in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Derbyshire,
Nottinghamshire and Humberside. Although acquisitions of other transport led
to a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, at first instance,
it was held that there had been no merger situation qualifying for
investigation on the ground that the reference area was not a 'substantial
part' of the UK. Upholding that decision by a majority, the Court of Appeal
stated that, in context, 'substantial part' had quantitative and qualitative
connotations, used in a comparative sense, the comparator being the whole of
the UK, Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 'Important', 'special' and
'significant' though the reference area might be, especially for those who
lived and worked there, there were many other such areas in the UK and the
reference area did not qualify for the description of 'a substantial part of
the UK'.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BY THE RELATION OF YORKSHIRE DERWENT TRUST LTD AND OTHERS v
BROTHERTON AND OTHERS
(FT, December 10)
The action was between the owners of land in Yorkshire through which the
River Derwent flowed and the defendants concerned to protect any public
navigation rights on the river. On a preliminary issue in the action, the
question was whether section 1 of the Rights of Way Act 1932 applied to
public rights of navigation. Mr Justice Vinelott had answered in the
negative but his decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. Allowing the
landowners' appeal, the House of Lords stated that section 1(1) referred to
'user' by the public and of the way being 'actually enjoyed' and 'dedicated'
as a highway. It was clear that what was being referred to in 'a way . . .
upon or over land' was the physical site on which the feature described as
'the way' ran. An ordinary English reader would not consider that 'a way
upon or over land' was apt to refer to the permanent feature of a lake or
river running through land, or would think of 'land' as referring to the
surface of the water.
THE MOTOR VESSEL P
(FT, December 11 1991)
The buyers had agreed to buy the P from the sellers by a sale contract in a
memorandum of agreement (MOA) form but, by the completion date, the parties
were at loggerheads over the ship's condition. The buyers obtained an
injunction to give the sellers notice 'forthwith' but that the order should
not take effect until payment of the purchase price and/or delivery of the
vessel. When the injunction was obtained it was believed the court had
jurisdiction to make a Mareva order when the buyers, under an MOA were about
to pay and take delivery, but they also wanted to make sure that a
sufficient part of the price would remain in London. The Court of Appeal had
since held that no such jurisdiction existed (see Veracruz 1, FT, November
19 1991). Further, the buyers were not justified in making the application
ex parte because they had nothing to lose by giving advance notice.
DEUTSCHE BANK AG v IBRAHIM AND OTHERS
(FT, December 13)
In order to secure a loan, the defendant offered the plaintiffs' bank the
title deeds to two flats in London. Neither of the leases was granted to or
registered in the name of Mr Ibrahim. The tenants and registered leasehold
proprietors of the flats were his two daughters. In the present proceedings
the bank claimed a declaration that it had valid equitable mortgages of the
two leases while the daughters counterclaimed for delivery up of the leases.
Dismissing the bank's claim, Mr Newberger QC, sitting as a deputy Chancery
judge, held that where a father provided purchase money for property for his
children, there was a presumption of advancement that the property was not
held in trust for him but beneficially vested in the children in whose names
they had been acquired. However, even though the evidence showed that the
daughters had authorised the deposit of the title deeds with the bank, they
could defeat the bank's claim because they could rely on the absence of any
written memorandum by them sufficient to satisfy section 4 of the Statute of
Frauds 1677 so as to answer for the debt of another.
UNION TRANSPORT plc v CONTINENTAL LINES SA AND OTHERS
(FT, December 17)
between the defendant shipowners, domiciled in Belgium, and the charterers
who commenced proceedings in the Commercial Court claiming damages because
the shipowners had failed to nominate the vessel to lift the cargo. The
charterers contended that 'the place for performance of the obligation in
question', namely the shipowners' contractual duty to nominate a vessel, was
in London. Therefore under Article 5(1) of the Brussels Convention the
shipowners could be sued in the UK. The shipowners argued that since the
obligation to provide a vessel was not to be performed in England, the
charterers could not found jurisdiction under article 5(1). They therefore
applied to set aside the writ and service but their application was
dismissed. The Court of Appeal dismissed the shipowners' appeal, who now
appealed from that decision. Dismissing their appeal, the House of Lords
stated that the obligation in question was the obligation to nominate a
vessel, and that the place for performance of that obligation was in London.
Accordingly the English courts had jurisdiction under article 5(1).
BP OIL DEVELOPMENT LTD v INLAND REVENUE COMMISSIONERS
(FT, December 18)
In 1985, BP agreed to transport and process pipeline liquids from a field
owned by the Marathon Oil group by pipeline that was owned by Marathon and
then connected to the BP's pipeline in Scotland. Section 6(1) of the Oil
Taxation Act 1983 provided that in computing assessable profit or allowable
loss the positive amounts (price received for oil won) included 'tariff
receipts' attributable to that field. By subsection (2) the tariff receipts
were the aggregate of the amount of consideration received by the
participator in respect of '(a) the use of a qualifying asset; or (b) the
provision of services or other business facilities'. BP appealed to the
special commissioner against the assessment to PRT, claiming it was entitled
to separate tariff receipts allowance in respect of each of the qualifying
assets which it made available for use by the Brae Field. Dismissing BP's
appeal, the House of Lords stated that the amount of qualifying tariff
receipts to be reduced under section 9(1) was the whole of the qualifying
tariff receipts - not particular discrete amounts of qualifying tariff
receipts derived from the use of particular assets.
ITALIA EXPRESS
(FT, December 20)
Mr Ventouris claimed Dollars 4m against Mr Mountain as a representative of
Lloyd's underwriters under a war risks insurance policy for the vessel,
Italia Express. The underwriters contended that the loss was caused by Mr
Ventouris's alleged wilful misconduct, and the mainstay of their case was
the evidence of Mr Georgis Dimitrios Ventouris (GDV), his first cousin. The
court was asked to rule on the admissibility of a large number of tape
recordings under the Civil Evidence Act 1968 made by GDV in conversation
with divers and others alleged to have arranged for the sinking of the
vessel. The underwriters submitted that the statements on the tapes were
statements made in a document 'admissible as evidence of the facts stated
therein, of which direct oral evidence by them would be admissible' under
the Act. Refusing the application, Mr Justice Hirst stated that the
principle objects of Part I of the Act (sections 1 to 10) were to ensure
that all first-hand hearsay statements were admissible provided certain
conditions were fulfilled, and to allow second-hand hearsay to be received
if contained in a record. It would be highly anomalous if the principle,
clearly enshrined in section 2(3), that oral statements should be first-hand
did not also apply to documentary statements.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Business failure figures show final-quarter fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of business failures notified to Trade Indemnity, the trade
credit insurer, fell in the fourth quarter of last year, confirming the
company's earlier view that the recession is bottoming out.
According to provisional figures, business failures in the three months
ending December 31 totalled 1,953, 7 per cent less than the 2,100 reported
in the third quarter.
The overall level of failures is still 49 per cent higher than in 1990.
Business failures for the year as a whole were 72 per cent higher than in
1990.
Mr Charles McCartan, Trade Indemnity associate director, emphasised that
figures for business failures are a 'lagged' indicator of recovery. He said:
'It was three years after the end of the 1980-81 recession before we saw a
significant reduction in business failures.'

MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, has urged Western Isles council to
consider a substantial increase in its poll tax in order to maintain
services after losing Pounds 23m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
The islands' poll tax this year is only Pounds 26, after the government's
Pounds 140 cut. Mr Major suggests the council should bring it closer to the
Scottish average of Pounds 282.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the weather: Birmingham city centre was hit by flooding amid wintry
conditions that brought chaos to many parts of country. Up to 6in of snow
fell in mid Wales and rivers burst their banks in the West Country. The
village of Ewyas Harold in Hereford and Worcester was cut off by floodwater.
Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire were among the worst affected areas,
with many roads impassable. The River Avon burst its banks at Clay Coton in
Northamptonshire and the A5 was closed by flooding at Towcester.
The Severn Bridge was closed to high-sided vehicles because of strong winds,
while storms disrupted Sealink's Irish Sea ferry crossings. Sailings out of
Holyhead and Fishguard were cancelled or delayed.
The A470 main route over the Brecon Beacons was blocked by snow, with
drifting caused by strong winds making other roads dangerous.
In Gloucestershire several main roads were closed by floodwater. One of the
main routes into Cheltenham was blocked when the River Chelt burst its
banks. In Scotland a combination of flooding and ice forced the closure of
roads near Gateside in Fife.
The worst of the conditions were expected to have cleared by this morning.
Most of the country can look forward to several days of cold, dry and sunny
weather.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Infighting starts for Oracle franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies are planning to bid against each other for the UK's
commercial teletext franchise.
Oracle runs the present ITV teletext output - the news and information
service broadcast on spare lines in the television picture. It is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the ITV companies and is working on its own bid
for the franchise.
But Oracle, which has turnover of about Pounds 10m and pre-tax profit
approaching Pounds 3m, is to be opposed by a consortium being put together
by Independent Television News, which is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the ITV companies.
Anglia and Yorkshire are believed to be seriously considering backing the
ITN bid. Scottish Television has been approached but is considering its
position.
To add to the complexity two of the new franchise winners are planning bids.
Carlton Communications may bid with Intelfax, which provides the information
for Channel 4's teletext service.
MAI Broadcasting, the company behind Meridian, winner in the battle for the
franchise for the south of England, is also considering involvement in a
bid, as is TV-am, the loser of the commercial breakfast franchise.
Some ITV managing directors believe the situation is 'totally dotty'. Others
suggest that by mounting more than one bid they will have a better chance of
winning.
The government decided that the commercial teletext franchise should, like
the ITV franchises, go to the highest bidder.
Bids are due in at the Independent Television Commission by January 20.
The prospect of some ITV companies apparently bidding against themselves
seems to stem from the new imperative at ITN to make a profit. ITN provides
the news elements the Oracle service, at a cost estimated at Pounds 1m a
year. It receives a fee of about Pounds 50,000.
Oracle, it is believed, was planning to go to a new supplier of news after
being asked by ITN for the full cost of news provision plus a profit.
In return ITN decided to try to get the business for itself with a number of
ITV com-panies.
Teletext is available in more than 40 per cent of British homes. The
proportion is likely to increase as television sets are replaced.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Full-time call-out for UDR after violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PART-TIME soldiers of the army's Ulster Defence Regiment were called out
yesterday for full-time duties in Belfast for the second time in two months
to try to stem a spate of terrorist violence.
The measure, which follows demands for army reinforcements in response to
recent IRA bomb attacks in the city, affects several hundred soldiers
belonging to two UDR battalions in the greater Belfast area.
The army said the troops would be used 'as and when required' to support
police operations. The tightening of security in Belfast includes
reintroducing 24-hour road checkpoints.
Yesterday's move is aimed at containing the latest outbreak of violence by
redeploying forces in Northern Ireland before resorting to reinforcements
from the British mainland. Officials said troop requirements were
'constantly under review'.
There are 10,800 regular British troops in Northern Ireland, plus 6,100 UDR
members, of whom about half are part-time.
The two UDR battalions affected were also involved in the November call-out,
which covered 1,400 UDR part-timers and was the first such measure since
1988.
No major long-term reinforcement from the mainland has taken place since
1986 when two battalions were sent in response to mortar attacks on police
and army bases.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday he hoped that
emergency provisions legislation which came into force last August would
lead to the successful prosecution of the 'godfathers' of terrorism in the
province.
Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, he said the government was
committing 'the necessary resources' to Northern Ireland.
The search goes on: one of the new 24-hour check points
on the Falls Road in West Belfast yesterday

Hong Kong has almost doubled its labour importation scheme to 25,000 foreign
workers in an attempt to deal with the colony's labour shortage, writes
Angus Foster in Hong Kong. The decision was immediately criticised by trade
unions and liberal politicians who claim the policy will keep wages down
when inflation in Hong Kong is still above 11 per cent. The scheme, which
brought in 13,800 workers from China and elsewhere in Asia in 1991, is for
general occupations but does not cover workers for the colony's new airport.
A separate scheme for the airport will be launched once construction begins
next year.

FT  10 JAN 92 / US dollar peg 'hobbles attack on HK inflation': Simon
Holberton on a debate among the colony's economists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLS in US interest rates have raised doubts among economists in Hong Kong
about the wisdom of its fixed link with the US dollar, which limits the
government's freedom to attack a stubbornly high inflation rate.
The government, however, recoils at suggestions for change. It aims to deal
with inflation as best it can, without altering the exchange rate regime.
Officials say maintenance of the peg is vital to financial and political
stability in the run-up to 1997 when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty.
The peg, established in October 1983 at HKDollars 7.8 to the US dollar, has
ensured that the external value of the Hong Kong dollar has remained stable
and that it has been relatively immune from the colony's favourite pastime:
financial speculation.
But it prevents the monetary authorities from responding to the upward
pressure on domestic prices by increasing interest rates. This would lead to
distortions of the domestic money supply and could create a divergence
between free and official currency rates, undermining the peg and financial
stability.
Inflation, though below its highest levels, is still running at about 11 per
cent and, economists say, is expected to fall only to about 10 per cent by
the end of this year.
A cut in Hong Kong's interest rates - three-month money is currently trading
at about 4.65 per cent - is widely expected after recent reductions in US
interest rates, including a full-point cut in the Federal Reserve discount
rate to 3.5 per cent.
However, a fall in Hong Kong rates could further exacerbate asset price
inflation, most visible in the property and stock markets. Property prices
have risen in some areas of Hong Kong by 40 per cent over the past year and
rents have gone up by 30 per cent.
Banks have moved to cool speculation in the property market by tightening
lending, and the government plans to impose stamp duty on sales and
purchases of property worth more than HKDollars 2m (Pounds 145,000).
Some economists believe inflation is high because of structural changes
under way in Hong Kong as more of its manufacturing shifts to southern
China, where labour is much cheaper.
Hong Kong's economy is increasingly based on services and demand for these
is growing rapidly, pushing up prices and demanding greater and more
expensive skills from the workforce.
Hong Kong will have high inflation for some time, according to these
economists. Others see the root cause in the government's maintenance of the
fixed link with the dollar.
'The government has totally lost its monetary autonomy,' says Mr Benjamin
Chan, chief economist with the Bank of East Asia, an opponent of the peg.
'Inflation is in double digits but interest rates are declining. I don't
think the government wants to lower interest rates but it has no choice. I
think it's a major problem; the government can't fight inflation because it
does not have any tools.'
However, the government's belief that the US dollar peg is essential for
stability finds support among some private sector economists. They believe
that Hong Kong's exchange rate system has served the colony well, and argue
that inflation is due to the structural changes in the economy.
Mr Enzio von Pfeil, economist with British brokers Smith New Court points to
the rapid transfer of manufacturing capacity from Hong Kong to the bordering
Chinese province of Guangdong, where labour costs in some industries are 20
per cent of what they are in Hong Kong.
'This is very important for Hong Kong's competitiveness because the material
content of a lot of its exports come from Guangdong. Hong Kong companies can
get away with 17 per cent pay rises for their workers here because materials
costs are so low in China.'
Economists point out that the integration with southern China has meant that
Hong Kong's inflation has not fed through to its international
competitiveness. Mr John Greenwood, chairman and group economist of GT
Management (Asia), a fund manager, says that annual growth in the prices of
exports from Hong Kong has been at a stable 3 per cent a year despite
inflation at nearly four times that level.
Mr Greenwood points out that Hong Kong is going through a transition from an
economy based on manufacturing and services to one based more and more on
services alone. He does not expect importing labour to have much effect on
the inflation rate.
'What Hong Kong is selling is cheap goods made in China and expensive
services in Hong Kong,' he says. 'The price of non-traded goods in Hong Kong
can grow much more rapidly here than in the US because productivity in the
traded goods sector is growing much faster than it is in the US.'

FT  10 JAN 92 / Palestinians seek to build on Israel's unpopularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAMIS ANDONI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Palestinians, who have succeeded in securing international condemnation
of Israel's deportation policy, are trying to build on this gain by moving
to the offensive in the next round of Arab-Israeli talks in Washington next
week.
Delegates will press for separate representation and the inclusion of
Palestinian national rights on the agenda.
They believe that unless the agenda is expanded to address national rights,
the outcome of the talks will be reduced to administrative arrangements
falling short of ending the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and
block Palestinian national sovereignty.
According to the letters of the invitation, forwarded by the US and (now)
Russia, co-sponsors of the talks, the Israeli and Palestinian delegations
were to focus on arrangements for Palestinian self-rule during an interim
period which would be followed by negotiations over the permanent status of
the occupied territories.
The Palestinians hope that the suggested five-year interim period - which
they want to reduce to two years - will lead to the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state, a goal opposed by Israel and not endorsed by
the US.
The Palestinians fear that unless self-rule is linked to a final settlement
involving an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
interim arrangement will turn into a permanent status.
The co-sponsors have asked both sides to present their own models of
Palestinian autonomy. Palestinian negotiators do not expect the Israelis to
present a more advanced form of their previous proposals.
The Palestinians will put forward a self-rule plan based on United Nations
resolutions that call for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and the fourth Geneva convention which is aimed at forcing Israel to
stop activities that might alter the identity of the occupied Arab
territories, such as building of settlements and deporting Palestinians.
They are unlikely, however, to start the battle over the agenda and
self-rule in the coming round unless the issue of Palestinian representation
is resolved.
(In the last round of talks, the Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians spent
six days in the corridors of the State Department because they could not
agree on a formula for separate talks between Israel and each of the two
halves of the joint delegation.)
Israel suggests that negotiations over Palestinian self rule should be held
between technical sub-committees from the Israeli and the joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
The Palestinians see the Israeli proposal as marginalising the Palestinian
political role and has pressed Jordan practically to speak on behalf of the
Palestinians. Jordan, which fears that such an arrangement will substantiate
claims that Jordan is the substitute homeland for the Palestinians, has
backed the Palestinian position.
Ironically, the Palestinians derived new strength to press the demands when
Israel's campaign to curb Palestinian resistance temporarily backfired when
the UN Security Council strongly condemned Israel's orders to deport 12
Palestinian activists earlier this week.
They are apparently hoping for Arab backing and that Israeli policies will
lead to its isolation and will drive a wedge between Israel and its ally the
US - three hopes that in the past have failed to bring them very close to
their goals.

The commission, to be headed initially by Mr Manuel Camacho, the capital's
mayor, will include five cabinet ministers, the governor of the state of
Mexico, the director of Pemex, Mexico's oil monopoly, and local ecologists.
It will start with a budget of the equivalent of Dollars 165m (Pounds 91m),
half of which will be financed by the World Bank and the Japanese
government.
The new body has been created to avoid the inter-ministerial rivalry
hampering the design and implementation of the existing pollution programme,
costed at Dollars 4.6bn. Mr Camacho had been at odds with Mr Manuel
Bartlett, who recently vacated the education portfolio, over a possible
change of the school calendar. Pemex had fought unsuccessfully to keep
prices of unleaded petrol substantially above those of leaded petrol until
the oil company was able to meet demand through domestic production, rather
than imports.
Mr Salinas ordered the commission to draw up a plan in 30 days to outline
how all public vehicles and taxis could use natural gas. This would reduce
pollution levels but would probably increase Mexico's gas imports. Pemex has
not the capacity to meet expected demand.

FT  10 JAN 92 / White House seeks health care overhaul
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHITE House officials have proposed to medical and employer groups measures
for overhauling the US health care system. This is part of an attempt to
produce a reform package before President George Bush's State of the Union
address on January 28.
Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, has met the American Medical
Association to discuss ideas in the president's health care proposals. They
include a refundable tax credit to help families pay health insurance
premiums, and incentives for people covered by the federal Medicare and
Medicaid systems to join more cost-effective managed care plans.
However, some analysts believe that managed care programmes, such as Health
Maintenance Organisations, produce a one-off gain when people join, but no
long-term curb on the 10 per cent a year increase in medical costs. The
administration also wants to restrict malpractice lawsuits so as to control
the rise in the insurance premiums that doctors must pay in case of
malpractice suits.
Other proposals include higher premiums from high-income families for
Medicare, the federal health programme for the retired. Medical costs in the
US have risen by more than 10 per cent a year for the last five years, to
total an estimated Dollars 817bn (Pounds 449bn) this year. Yet, more than
34m people have no medical insurance.
The administration's proposals still fall well short of several broad,
controversial reform packages proposed by the Democrats. These include a
'play or pay' scheme where employers would have to choose between providing
health insurance to their employees and paying a tax to fund an expanded
Medicaid.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Wilder quits Democrat contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Douglas Wilder of Virginia has bowed out of the race for the
Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
Mr Wilder said he was withdrawing from the race this year for the same
reason that Governor Mario Cuomo of New York has decided not to run: in
order to concentrate on the budget problems that face his state.
It was plain, however, that the Wilder campaign had not caught fire. He was
expected to fare poorly in New Hampshire, which is to hold the first primary
on February 18, and his fund-raising had lagged behind that of other main
Democratic contenders.
By the end of 1991, his papers at the Federal Election Commission showed he
had raised less than a quarter of the total money raised by the Democratic
front-runner, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Mr Wilder, the first elected black governor in the US, has not based his
political success on an appeal to a monolithic black vote. However, such an
appeal had come to seem the only course for a man who remains largely
unknown outside his own state.
A feud with Mr Jesse Jackson, the black activist leader who won seven states
in the 1988 Democratic primaries, hampered Mr Wilder's efforts to gain
support from some black organisations - nor had the other Democratic
candidates conceded black votes to Mr Wilder.
The governor's withdrawal means that, for the first time since 1980, the
Democratic candidates can compete for black voters without facing a major
black opponent. So, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa could gain votes,
particularly among urban blacks in the north and mid-west. Senator Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska is also expected to step up his efforts in these
constituencies.
The principal beneficiary, however, is likely to be Mr Clinton, who has won
many black votes in his five campaigns for the governorship of rural,
southern Arkansas. He was always expected to be the front-runner in the
southern states which will dominate the Super Tuesday primaries on March 10
 -now Mr Wilder's withdrawal should make it easier for him to achieve a big
victory.
Mr Clinton has begun to gain momentum in New Hampshire, too, and is
consecrated as the man to beat.
Pundits generally place Mr Kerrey in second place, just ahead of Mr Harkin,
who started well but has slowed in recent weeks.
Mr Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, a former senator, is expected to do well
in next-door New Hampshire, but would need a win or a strong second place to
develop enough momentum to carry his campaign into other states, where he
remains little-known.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Carla Hills, the US trade representative, yesterday insisted that
President George Bush's trade mission to Japan had not changed US free trade
policy 'one iota'.
Defending the president's controversial trip, Mrs Hills said the US policy
had been 'to expand exports and create jobs. We have been quite consistent.
There has never been any deviation.'
However, the president is being widely criticised in the US press for
embracing the 'fair trade' rhetoric of his opposition and the numerical
goals of 'managed trade' in response to his declining popularity. On Capitol
Hill economists yesterday were testifying against the new US-Japan 'action
plan' which Mr Bush insisted would 'translate into jobs for American
workers'.
'The likelihood is that the real economic impact will be negligible and that
it will do little to create jobs in the US of A,' said Mr Jesper Koll, an
economist at SG Warburg Securities (Japan).
Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics,
said that in the long run US trade gains 'will depend on sharply improving
the underlying competitiveness of our economy'. To boost US exports to
Japan, Mr Bush should have sought an agreement to boost the Japanese
currency against the dollar, he said.
Mrs Hills denied that the president had resorted to 'managed trade'.
Specific numbers had been agreed on Japanese purchases of US motor parts not
to guarantee market share but 'to identify problems and as a benchmark to
correct those problems.
'To name a number would undercut an industry,' she said. 'It is better to
remove the barrier. We would much rather open markets than reduce our own
imports.'
Mrs Hills said she had not not accompanied the president to Japan because
'this was an export enhancement trip. The Secretary of Commerce went and
that is his portfolio.' However, negotiations on the trip had been conducted
by Mr Michael Moscow, her deputy, and she had been in hourly touch with him.
The administration's trade policy has been a success, she said. It has
boosted exports to Japan by 45 per cent and to the rest of the world by 30
per cent. 'Our jobs connected to exports are on the increase. Exports have
halved the rigours of the economic slowdown,' she said.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Bush in Japan: Trade surplus remains a source of friction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE smiles, the handshakes, the Global Partnership and the Tokyo Declaration
may be intended to convince a US audience that President George Bush has
prised open a 'closed' Japanese market, but they do not mean that bilateral
trade friction has come to a sudden end.
Japanese officials said last night they had addressed 73 of 86 trade-related
complaints formally lodged by the US. But 'addressing' does not necessarily
meaning resolving to the long-term satisfaction of the US.
At the heart of US-Japan trade friction is Japan's Dollars 40bn (Pounds
22bn) trade surplus with the US, the most obvious target for US congressmen
looking for an apparent indicator of unfairness. The often obscure details
of the particular items in dispute are of less political significance.
That surplus has been on the rise in recent months, with demand for Japanese
products increasing in tandem with the erratic stirrings of recovery in the
US economy, and Japanese government officials fear it will continue
increasing. If that is the case, last night's warm exchanges will soon be
replaced by heated argument.
Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, addressing a luncheon on
behalf of Mr Bush, said: 'Japan's trade surplus is too high and its market
access too limited.' He warned that the health of the broader relationship
depended on reducing trade tension by 'eliminating barriers to trade and
investment'.
'We have waited a long time, but now the time has come for equal access.
Fair play is in both our interests,' Mr Brady said.
But Mr Robert Mosbacher, commerce secretary, was not as certain that the
time has come. Asked if outstanding issues had been resolved to his
satisfaction, he replied: 'We always have trouble making agreements with the
Japanese, but we are making progress.'
Progress was made on the issue of computer procurement by the Japanese
public sector.
Tokyo has agreed to lower the purchase figure triggering a public tender for
computer procurement, and to ensure that various quasi-government bodies
abide by the purchasing guidelines. But, like a few of the other concessions
seemingly made in the past three days, the new regulations were essentially
agreed on last year.
The two countries have agreed to 'reinvigorate' the Structural Impediments
Initiative (SII) talks, which began two years ago and were designed to
remove 'structural' obstacles to bilateral trade, for example, by demanding
that Tokyo increase public works investment. Japan has resisted US demands
for a fresh round of negotiations, but the countries agreed yesterday to
make 'new commitments' to improve the business environment.
On the imbalance in direct investment between Japan and the US, Tokyo
restated its intention to encourage foreign companies by extending the tax
carry-over period for losses from five to seven years, and allowing an
acceleration of depreciation charges.
Several of the Global Partnership provisions will depend on the outcome of
investigations by Japan's Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body. The
commission will investigate whether Japanese companies are unfairly
excluding competitors in the paper and glass industries.
But Tokyo was unable to convince the country's politically influential
lawyers to give way to US demands for greater access to the legal market and
could only offer to 'redouble its efforts to resolve the issues'.
Japanese officials were relieved that they were not forced to make a
specific commitment to open the rice market, though Japan yesterday formally
recognised the importance of 'tarification', the replacement of existing
trade barriers with a tariff regime.

US WHOLESALE prices fell last month, indicating that inflationary pressures
are continuing to abate, the Labour Department reported yesterday, writes
Michael Prowse in Washington.
The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.2 per cent in December
compared with November, and by 0.1 per cent in the year to December.
Financial markets had expected no change in prices last month.
The annual decline in the index for finished goods was the first since 1986,
when a halving of oil prices temporarily depressed inflation.
Prices for crude and intermediate goods - products at an earlier stage of
production - fell by 11.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively last year,
indicating that a further moderation of factory gate prices is likely.
Analysts said the apparent absence of inflationary pressures increased the
Federal Reserve Board's scope to combat recession by cutting interest rates.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Japan refuses finance for Brazilian debt deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has refused to provide finance for a debt-reduction deal by Brazil and
its bank creditors until the government has agreed a three-year economic
programme from the International Monetary Fund, unlikely this year.
This will force the Brazilian government to seek innovative options to break
a stalemate in negotiations, which are to resume this month, over reducing
the Dollars 52bn in medium and long-term loans extended by creditor banks.
Although Brazil is due to obtain agreement for a Dollars 2bn stand-by IMF
loan this month - it is to be discussed by the fund board on January 22 -
the Japanese have said they want to see a three-year Extended Fund Facility
before providing finance for a Brady debt-reduction deal.
This suggests Brazil will have insufficient resources to provide guarantees
of both principal and interest to banks that agree to reduce their claims on
the country.
Brazil has less in resources for these so-called enhancements than provided
by Mexico in its 1990 debt-reduction accord, and has more debt.
Japan supported the Mexican agreement but Tokyo seems to have doubts about
the long-term commitment of Braslia to reform.
Brazil's chief debt negotiator, Mr Pedro Malan, said yesterday: 'We have no
doctrinaire objection to rolling interest guarantees but, frankly, we don't
have the resources. We cannot put up much from our reserves so we depend on
Japanese help or multilateral institutions.'
He added: 'We are trying to think of innovative schemes related to the
volume and timing of enhancements.' He said that banks taking up the
new-money option, for example, would be asked to allow a proportion allotted
to the enhancements. Bankers say another option would be to introduce the
enhancements in stages as finance became available.
A senior official at a large creditor bank yesterday said he did not expect
many banks to be lending new money to Brazil. He described some banks as
being 'hung up on a Mexico-style deal for Brazil'. He believed that, if
creditor banks genuinely wanted a deal, they 'will have to do some talking.'
One option, he said, might be to concentrate on converting a large part of
Brazil's floating rate bank loans into fixed-rate debt, so as to take
advantage of the current low levels of US interest rates.
Braslia has embarked on a new offensive to resolve its foreign debt problem.
External negotiations have taken high priority since Mr Marclio Marques
Moreira took over as economy minister last May. Mr Moreira now wants to
consolidate this with concrete results - deals with the IMF, the Paris Club
of creditor governments and commercial banks by mid-1992.
Providing the IMF deal goes through this month, the government hopes to
reach a quick agreement over its Dollars 20bn debt with the Paris Club,
which comes up for discussion in February. Mr Francisco Gros, Central Bank
governor, will be in France and the UK early next week to present Brazil's
position to his counterparts. Talks with commercial banks are expected to
resume on January 20.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN is about to reform its aid programme to the developing world by
insisting recipient countries prove their commitment to democracy, the
defence of human rights and the creation of free market economies before
they receive bilateral financial assistance.
Action will also be required by the recipients to stamp out corruption and
to make sure aid reaches those who need it.
The shift in Swedish foreign aid policy will be announced today when the new
non-Socialist government presents its first budget. However, Sweden will
retain its commitment to provide the high level of 1.0 per cent of its gross
domestic product to development assistance.
It remains only one of four countries in the world that has met the United
Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP. The others are Holland, Denmark and
Norway.
In the last financial year the Swedish government allocated just under
SKr13bn (Pounds 1.24bn) for aid.
The present government's aid programme planned for the newly independent
Baltic states will be funded separately.
Traditionally, Swedish aid was focused on a number of countries such as
Tanzania, Mozambique, Vietnam, Cuba and Angola, who were viewed
sympathetically by the ruling Social Democrats for ideological reasons.
However, the non-Socialist government has less political sympathy with many
regimes once favoured by Sweden.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, has urged governments taking part
in the Uruguay Round negotiations to accept his draft package of accords as
a basis for continuing talks, leaving open the possibility that some aspects
be reopened.
The 108 countries involved are due to give their reactions to the package,
finalised on December 20, at a meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations
Committee next Monday
Alarmed that objections to the agriculture deal could open the floodgates to
every country dissatisfied with this or that proposal, Mr Dunkel yesterday
summoned senior officials from the main trading nations to urge provisional
acceptance of the draft package and to set a timetable for further talks
designed to conclude the Round by April 15.
It was always envisaged that once the draft package was agreed there would
need to be some weeks of detailed bilateral negotiations on market-opening
measures for both goods and services, as well as some 'fine-tuning' of the
legal language. These bilateral deals, 'multilateralised' by Gatt's
non-discriminatory most-favoured nation rule, will be an integral part of
the final Uruguay Round accord.
Unless EC ministers change tack when they meet in Brussels today and
tomorrow, the Community looks set to demand renegotiation at least of that
part of the package dealing with farmers' compensation payments. Mr Dunkel's
concern will be to create scope for a limited number of changes necessary to
bring all participants on board.

<TEXT>
THE Yugoslav army yesterday blamed poor co-ordination and mistakes in air
control for the shooting down of a European Community helicopter by a
military jet and the killing of five EC monitors on board.
The interim report, which came as EC-sponsored peace talks resumed in
Brussels, did not explain why the pilot attacked the first helicopter and
forced a second one to crash land. The report was received by the EC
monitoring mission in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
Four of the five dead were Italians who were buried with full honours
yesterday after a service in which Pope John Paul lamented the 'agonising
tragedy' of Yugoslavia's war.
Polityka, a pro-Serbian daily paper with close ties to the military, carried
the army's explanation, saying the EC helicopters had been in closed air
space, and federal military authorities had not been told of their incoming
flight from Kaposvar in Hungary.
The Hungarian authorities had informed the air control authorities in Zagreb
of their flight, but the MiG pilot had been in contact only with air control
headquarters in Belgrade which did not know of the helicopters' flight path.
The Yugoslav conflict was further complicated yesterday when Bosnia's Serbs
declared an autonomous Serbian republic in the region and said they were
prepared to defend themselves.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbian community, said creation of
the republic would depend on whether European Community countries recognised
the independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina next week. Such an action could lead
the Bosnian Serbians to unite with neighbouring Serbia, he added.
The 4.3m strong republic is divided between Moslems (43 per cent), Serbs (32
per cent) and Croats (17 per cent), which make up a coalition government.

FT  10 JAN 92 / France's mega-merger mandarin: The man to lead Thomson-CEA
Industrie group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE has picked an outstanding but little-known product of the public
administration to put together and manage its project for a world-beating
electronics-to-nuclear energy group.
He is Mr Jean Syrota, 54, a mining engineer who runs Cogema, the
state-controlled nuclear fuel company, based in an industrial suburb of
Paris. He has kept well out of the public eye, and likes to relax by
collecting 19th century first edition books - he is especially fond of
Balzac - or by doing a spot of handiwork around the home.
The quiet, bespectacled Mr Syrota is charged with resolving the French
electronics industry's massive problems as it struggles against Far Eastern
competition and runs into European Commission resistance at every attempt to
raise fresh capital from the state.
This rigorous intellectual is well qualified for the job, as a product of
the Ecole Polytechnique, the training ground for generations of civil
service elite and a former mandarin at the environment and
telecommunications ministries.
Mr Syrota has had little time for home handiwork since being called to Prime
Minister Edith Cresson's office on December 7 and asked, to his surprise, to
take on master building on a huge scale. His task is to prepare the merger
of the loss-making civil electronics businesses of Thomson, mainly
televisions and other consumer goods, with CEA Industrie, the parent company
for Cogema, plus Framatome, France's monopoly supplier of nuclear reactors,
and a handful of electronics and medical businesses.
He has been asked to: report on progress in February; form the group - which
he estimates will have annual sales of between FFr75bn (Pounds 7.6bn) and
FFr90bn - by the middle of the year; and become its chairman.
Mr Syrota defends the project as a legitimate attempt by the state to
re-organise its shareholdings more rationally, to enable the electronics
industry to raise more cash - though not directly from the nuclear group's
coffers - and to help the nuclear industry to continue diversifying as
France's demand for new reactors begins to run down permanently.
'These are decisions which the state has taken not as public authority but
as the owner of shares in these companies. The group will be managed like
any other, all the more so since it is present in these competitive sectors
across the world,' he says.
Mr Syrota's first task, not yet complete, is to choose a bank or banks to
value the various businesses, and to change - by government decree - the
statute of CEA-Industrie, which groups the industrial businesses of the
Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, the atomic energy authority. This would
make it directly state-owned, rather than 100 per cent controlled by the
CEA, as at present.
The outline plan - subject to change, stresses Mr Syrota - is for CEA
Industrie to buy the state's 100 per cent direct shareholding in Thomson,
and for the electronics group to sell to the state its 60 per cent stake in
Thomson-CSF, its defence arm. The resulting group, Thomson-CEA Industrie
(TCI), will be 51 per cent state-owned and 30 per cent held by the atomic
energy authority. The new group would also issue new shares, to
privately-owned industrial partners as well as to the state, to provide the
cash its electronics activities so badly need.
His main challenge will be to stem the losses of Thomson's consumer
electronics businesses. Here Mr Syrota does not yet have a clear recipe to
offer, beyond pointing to the complementarity between Thomson and some of
CEA-Industrie's subsidiaries' interests in flat-screen technology,
electrical connectors and medical scanners.
'The nuclear side works on the long term, with a product life of say 10
years, while electronics works on the short term, with product lives of more
like a year. So there is no reason why they should both hit the bottom of a
cycle together. That allows a certain amount of risk sharing,' he adds.
The benchmark Mr Syrota says he will use to measure whether he has won or
failed is whether TCI can achieve a net profit-to-sales ratio of the same
order as Cogema itself, which made FFr1bn (Pounds 100m) from sales of
FFr21.4bn last year, a margin of nearly 5 per cent, as against the FFr2.7bn
loss at Thomson Consumer Electronics in the same period.
'The day when there is a comparable profitability ratio for Thomson CEA
Industrie, I will be content,' says Mr Syrota.

FT  10 JAN 92 / Two players take the stage after Georgia's one-man band bows
out: Neil Buckley identifies the new centres of power in Tbilisi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fighting may have stopped, but those who hoped President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia's flight from Georgia on Monday would end the republic's
problems have been disappointed.
Recent demonstrations in the capital, Tbilisi, have shown that support for
the president remains, and with the new military council resorting to force
to disperse them twice in the past week, it is clear that Georgia faces an
uphill struggle to re-establish democracy.
The military-political situation is, in true Georgian fashion, colourful,
complex and possibly dangerous. The republic is in effect being run by two
people: the leaders of the military council. Both are supported by their own
armed groups.
Mr Tengiz Kitovani, 52, a classmate of Mr Gamsakhurdia and previously a
close friend, is a former sculptor and dissident. He later became chairman
of the state defence committee in Mr Gamsakhurdia's government and created
the Georgian national guard last year. He commands remnants of that guard
who refused to obey Mr Gamsakhurdia's order to disarm during last August's
attempted coup in Moscow.
Mr Jaba Iosseliani, 65, was a member of a Georgian partisan movement in his
youth, and later a professor of dramatic art. Three years ago he founded the
Mkhedrioni, or Knights of Georgia, a shadowy group claiming to defend human
rights and ethnic minorities. The Mkhedrioni are believed to have provided
the masked gunmen who twice fired into crowds of Gamsakhurdia supporters in
Tbilisi.
This violence has damaged the reputation of the military council, as has
continued speculation about the two leaders' criminal records. Mr Iosseliani
and Mr Kitovani claim these contain only political charges in disguise. But
it is believed
There are two more armed groups, both commanded by former deputy defence
ministers.
The four militias have been united by their defeat of Mr Gamsakhurdia, and
the military council hopes to merge them into a new Georgian national guard.
Whether that can be achieved, given a history of mutual suspicion and
conflict, remains to be seen.
In civilian politics, the most important figure is Mr Tengiz Sigua, a former
engineer who was Mr Gamsakhurdia's prime minister until resigning last
August. He has been named caretaker prime minister by the military council
and has appointed a provisional government of 10 ministers.
The military council leaders have promised to hand over power to Mr Sigua's
government once stability has been achieved, and play no further part in
political life. They have not said how long that process might take.
Contradictory statements by Mr Sigua and the council, and his insistence on
holding separate press conferences, have led to speculation about friction
between them.
Certainly, the two sides envisage different routes towards new parliamentary
elections.
Mr Sigua has called for the old parliament to be reconvened by January 15 to
prepare for new elections. Mr Iosseliani has declared that parliament dead,
and talks of a transitional political forum containing invited
representatives of all parties.
This would include the two groups that Mr Gamsakhurdia represented but would
probably be less supportive of the ousted president than a reconvened
parliament.
There are two jokers in the pack. One is Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, former
first secretary of the Georgian Communist party and then Soviet foreign
minister. Both the military council and opposition deputies have said he
could be of great assistance to Georgia, but they are unsure how he would be
greeted by the people. Mr Shevardnadze is detested by Gamsakhurdia
supporters as an 'agent of Moscow'.
The other is Mr Jorge Bagration, descendant of the Georgian royal family
that ruled until 1807, who has been trying to contact the opposition leaders
after they spoke of a possible constitutional monarchy. It is not clear,
however, how Georgians might react to the idea of a Spanish-born racing
driver as king.

MR RICHARD CHENEY, US defence secretary, warned yesterday that it might be
impossible to prevent new nuclear-armed states emerging as a result of the
break-up of the Soviet Union. Speaking before talks with Mr Tom King, his UK
counterpart, Mr Cheney said that former Soviet nuclear scientists might help
other countries develop weapons.
The US and its allies had to take account of this in planning for military
contingencies. Developing defences against ballistic missiles was 'more
important than ever'. Mr Cheney is due inGermany today.
Russia, meanwhile, sought to reassure the west about the danger of chemical
weapons proliferation, for some in Nato an even greater concern.
Mr Sergei Batsanov, Russian ambassador to the UN Disarmament Conference in
Geneva, said the former Soviet Union's chemical weapon stocks and production
facilities had for some time been located exclusively on Russian territory.
Russia had sole responsibility for their control and eventual destruction,
he said. But it currently had no facility for destroying them. Destruction
was supposed to start this year under the terms of a 1990 US-Soviet accord
But both sides acknowledge this is now impossible and that the accord will
need renegotiation.

FT  10 JAN 92 / UK likely to face court over big projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS likely that Britain and other EC members will be taken before the
European Court for failure to carry out environmental impact assessments on
large construction projects, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment
commissioner, warned last night.
'It seems to me likely that it will fall to be resolved by the European
Court of Justice at the end of the day,' he said.
He said the European Commission was proposing to extend the use of such
assessments to cover proposals and policies put forward by EC governments.
An announcement on the new proposals extending the principle to governments
will be made in two weeks time, he said. At present the directive on impact
assessments applies only to large individual projects.
'It is now clear that this is not enough,' he said. 'It is essential that
policies, plans and programmes are also subjected to environmental impact
assessment.'
He envisaged that this would also apply to EC policy at a later date.
He renewed his strong criticism of the British government for pressing ahead
with large schemes which he had asked to be suspended because environmental
assessments had not been properly made.
The reaction of the British government and some parts of the British media
'have left a bitter taste in my mouth', he said. 'There has been absolutely
no victimisation of the United Kingdom, no singling out to the exclusion of
other member states.'
UK schemes include the Channel tunnel rail link, East London river crossing
and M3 extension near Winchester.
Britain and other EC states have argued that projects in the pipeline when
the directive came into force in July 1988 should be exempted. But the
commission rejected this. He said the commission had opened proceedings for
breach of the directive against 10 governments, including Britain, and
proceedings would soon start against an 11th.
Mr Ripa di Meana's speech was made in London on video to a Green Magazine
awards ceremony.

</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government may not survive unless it gets rapid help from the
west in pushing through bold market reforms, according to Mr Peter Aven,
Russia's new foreign economic relations minister.
Mr Aven warned yesterday that unless Russia obtained further debt relief,
the west could soon be dealing with a communist regime again, but a much
tougher one.
He said that even after the deferral of principal payments on medium- and
long-term loans finalised with the Paris Club last week, Russia and the
republics have to pay Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.9bn) to creditors this year.
None of the other republics have so far honoured a pledge to share
responsibility for foreign debt obligations.
Mr Aven said Russia wanted a Dollars 4-Dollars 5bn stabilisation fund to
make the rouble convertible at a pegged exchange rate this year. It was also
seeking balance of payments loans, more direct food aid credits, and a
lifting of western trade barriers - for instance to sell uranium on the US
market.
The 36-year-old economist displayed all the cheering characteristics of
Russia's first post-communist government: youth, intelligence, ability, and
self-confidence.
He said, however, that many westerners were still nostalgic for 'the older
friendlier government bureaucrats' who were swept from office with the
collapse of the union. Another problem was westerners' lack of knowledge
about the severity of Russia's economic crisis, partly because 'we have a
great tradition of lying to the west about how great this country is, and
about how many tanks and gold we have'.
Mr Aven hoped the stabilisation fund advocated by Professor Jeffrey Sachs,
architect of Poland's shock therapy and now part of a team of western
economists advising the new government, would be forthcoming in March or
April. By then the government would have freed the domestic price of oil and
stabilised prices.
With a western stabilisation fund behind it, the government wanted to
introduce a stable exchange rate. Mr Aven said the rate was bound to come
down from its current rate of around Rbs100 to the dollar - he hoped to
between Rbs15 to Rbs35 to the dollar.

   YEKATERINBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Tamara Katsishevskaya, a pensioner in the Russian town of Yekaterinburg,
scraped the remains of a meal off her plate into a jar, and slid it into her
shopping bag.
'I can't eat it all now, but I'll eat it later at home. It's the only chance
I get to eat a proper meal,' she confessed as she sat in a dingy cafeteria,
recently converted into a soup kitchen for Yekaterinburg's pensioners and
invalids.
The soup kitchen represents an increasingly desperate attempt by the
authorities in this huge town in the Urals, typical of many across Russia,
to soften the blow of spiralling food prices.
Nobody in Yekaterinburg believes they will starve this winter. But with
state shop shelves still mostly bare, the issue is now not simply the price
of the food, but also its distribution.
One reason is that in Yekaterinburg, as in many industrial towns across
Russia, a considerable proportion of the food that passes through the town
is distributed, not through shops and markets, but through the factories.
Yekaterinburg, like most towns in the Urals and Siberia was built up as an
industrial town with practically no local agriculture to sustain it. It is
dominated by huge industrial complexes, the largest of which, the machinery
and metal works complex 'Uralmash', employs 50,000 people.
Under the old Soviet system, these factories have provided their workers not
only with housing, kindergartens, saunas and sanatoriums, but also most
crucially, with subsidised restaurants and food shops.
'Uralmash' for example, spent over Rbs70m last year on the 'social welfare'
of its workers  - an expenditure that Mr Sergei Lipatnikov, Uralmash's chief
economist, cites as one reason for its Rbs127m loss last year. 'If we are to
make the factory profitable, and do business in market conditions, then we
probably will not be able to sustain this type of social programme for
long,' he admits.
For the moment, though, factories across the Soviet Union are using their
newly-won independence to barter industrial goods and metals for food
produce, either from other republics, or from abroad. In a typical deal
Uralmash is now bartering its metal with a Czech company, Dialog Agro, in
exchange for Czech meat, oil and sugar, all of which are in desperately
short supply in the town.
This food is directly distributed to employees or sold through subsidised
shops in the factory or Uralmash's cafeterias, which are far better stocked
than anything on the streets of Yekaterinburg.
'Before it wasn't fasionable to eat in the factory cafeterias, but now
everyone eats in them,' says Mr Vladimir Gorokvy, a welder at the factory,
who estimates that he and his wife now get 'about half' of their food at the
factory.
But although this system allows employees access to rare goods like sugar,
it does little for the rest of town's citizens.
Those employed in the new 'private' businesses  - where wages are usually
two or three times higher than in the factories  - can afford to shop in the
state shops and free markets, where meat has been available at Rbs45 a kilo.
Mrs Katsishevskaya, whose pension has been only Rbs186 a month, plainly
cannot.
In spite of the efforts of the town authorities to persuade factories to
give up some of their food for wider distribution, the factories  - faced
with an increasingly restive workforce  - are so far refusing to do this. As
economic conditions deteriorate, every level of the administrative hierarchy
in Russia is becoming increasingly determined not to give up any of its
assets to the level above it.

CALLED the ice-cream men by their supporters, but lackeys of Germany by
their opponents, the white-uniformed EC observers have played a crucial role
in trying to monitor 15 ceasefires since arriving in Croatia last August,
writes Judy Dempsey.
The 170 unarmed monitors have worked indefatigably from their headquarters
in Hotel 'I' in Zagreb.
Their task initially was to supervise the implementation of ceasefires
forged by the EC with the federal army, Croatia's national guard, and Serb
and Croat paramilitary units. But, since September, they have been involved
in setting up negotiations to secure the peaceful withdrawal of soldiers
from federal army garrisons in Croatia. Above all, they have attempted to
set up confidence-building measures.

FT  09 JAN 92 / German parties agree to draft new asylum law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S four leading political parties in government and opposition have
agreed urgently to draw up a common proposal for a new asylum law, intended
to accelerate the processing of asylum applications from 12 months to six
weeks.
The agreement emerged from cross-party talks yesterday, in spite of grave
doubts that the acceleration plan will work, and against criticism that the
streamlined procedure will limit the fundamental rights of asylum-seekers.
The idea is to speed up processing of asylum applications, which last year
topped 256,000, an increase of almost 33 per cent, in order to stem the flow
and send economic migrants swiftly home to their country of origin.
However, there is a fundamental difference between the parties. The
Christian Democrats, senior partners in the ruling coalition, believe that
the liberal German constitution should be changed to limit the right of
political asylum. Their coalition partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), and
the Social Democrats (SPD) in opposition, reject any constitutional change,
and say that the influx can be contained through improved procedures.
There was no apparent progress yesterday in persuading individual federal
states to prepare new 'collection camps' for refugees, to protect them from
the rash of racist attacks on the hostels and individual apartments where
they are currently housed.
The idea of the new procedure is to streamline consideration of all those
applications for political asylum which are 'clearly without foundation',
given that only 6.9 per cent of all applications were actually approved last
year.
However, Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, has attacked
the proposals to allow decisions to be taken by a single judge, and to limit
the right of appeal against those decisions.
To make the new procedure work, the states are also supposed to find an
additional 500 legally qualified personnel, but so far they have failed to
do so. As for the collection camps, only Baden-Wurttemberg, of the 16
states, has prepared adequate accommodation, according to the Interior
Ministry.
What the parties did agree yesterday was to draft a common amendment to the
asylum law, possibly by next week, with a first reading in parliament
possible by February.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Mafia turnover put at Dollars 17bn a year as organised crime
spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISED crime in Italy is becoming an increasingly sophisticated business
with an annual turnover of L20,000bn (Dollars 17bn), according to a report
published by the private social and economic research institute, Censis.
The report does not distinguish between turnover and profits from criminal
activities. Nevertheless, the 283 page document is the most considered
attempt so far to analyse the growing economic impact of organised crime
which now generates the equivalent of almost 2 per cent of GDP, according to
Censis.
The report coincides with mounting public concern about organised crime
spreading throughout Italy and the apparent impunity of some 500 criminal
'families' dominated by the Sicilian Mafia, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta and
the Naples Camorra.
Last Saturday a police inspector and his wife were gunned down in the
southern town of Lamezia Terme near Catanzaro, reportedly by hired assassins
of the Calabrian mafia. The assassination provoked 25,000 to demonstrate in
the town on Tuesday.
On Sunday night a bomb went off on the railway near Lecce, south of
Brindisi, narrowly missing the crowded Lecce-Milan express in what is seen
as muscle-flexing by local organised crime.
The Censis report, which excludes petty crime, estimates that L16,000bn is
generated from illicit activities, while a further L4,000bn comes from
operating in legitimate fields of business using criminal methods -
essentially in the field of obtaining public contracts.
The L3,700bn obtained by rigging public contracts accounts for almost 20 per
cent of total earnings and is exceeded in importance only by the manufacture
and sale of illicit drugs (heroin, cocaine and marijuana) valued at
L4,000bn.
Theft accounts for a significant L3,700bn of which L820bn is reckoned to
come from stolen works of art and archaeological items, L965bn from stolen
lorry-loads of goods and L800bn from stolen cars. A further L2,200bn is
earned from armed robberies, the most lucrative being the hijacking of
loaded trucks worth L340bn. In November, police broke a Calabrian gang
responsible for robbing 1,600 trucks in five years.
Illegal lotteries and gambling, according to Censis, provide an annual
turnover of L1,400bn, while contraband generates L790bn. The latter is
mainly illegal cigarette sales. Since the middle of last month the
government has stepped up its campaign against cigarette contraband,
controlled by the Naples mafia, and banned for a month sales of most Philip
Morris brands because of excessive contraband seizures.
Commenting on the report, Mr Giovanni Conso, former president of the
constitutional court, said: 'This enemy (organised crime) is worse than
terrorism because that was something outside the state structure; this is
inside the state and benefits from a complicity which goes beyond the mere
taking of bribes.'
The report through its title, 'Outside and Inside: criminality,
institutions, society', highlights this complicity. In particular the system
of public contracts is open to abuse with last year 65 per cent being
awarded on the basis of closed bids.
In Sicily it is estimated that 75 per cent of all contracts end up in mafia
hands, while nationwide the percentage is believed to be around 7 per cent.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Politicians lose control of elements in army: Five EC
monitors died because of rifts within the federal forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shooting down of a European Community helicopter on Tuesday has
convinced western diplomats in Belgrade that the federal army must be
brought under political control as soon as possible.
But because Yugoslavia's federal structures have disintegrated, it remains
uncertain under whose control the army should be placed. Moreover, diplomats
believe it will be impossible to rein in the army, and have no confidence in
any permanent ceasefire until all factions are united under a single
command.
At the time of the incident on Tuesday the federal army was under the
nominal control of General Veljko Kadijevic, the defence minister, who was
reported to have resigned last night. He had accepted the latest ceasefire
forged by the United Nations, which envisages, among other things, the
withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia. He had also agreed to the
deployment of UN peace-keeping troops in Croatia.
But the downing of the EC helicopter showed the general could not control an
army divided into several camps.
First, there is the Titoist/Yugoslav nationalist element, represented until
recently by Gen Kadijevic. It is wedded to defending the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, and by implication, the federation.
This faction was supported by Mr Ante Markovic, the former prime minister,
and by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, after June 25, when
Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. The military attack on Croatia
was aimed at preventing the republic from seceding from the federation.
Another faction consists of hardline Serb nationalists led by Gen Blagoje
Adzic, the chief of staff, who has temporarily assumed the defence
portfolio. His outlook is conditioned by history  - his family was killed by
the Nazi-backed Croat Ustashas during the second world war.
As a Serb nationalist determined to redress historical grievances, Gen Adzic
has forged close links with the Serb nationalists in the self-proclaimed
Serb republic of Krajina, southern Croatia, in eastern Slavonia, eastern
Croatia, and in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia-Hercegovina.
This tacit alliance not only opposes the acceptance by Gen Kadijevic and Mr
Milosevic of a UN peace-keeping force, but it has widened the differences
among the army's top officer corps and Serbia's leadership.
Yesterday, Mr Milan Babic, head of the Krajina Serbs, who was pushed into
power by Mr Milosevic, with the backing of the federal army, blamed Gen
Kadijevic for the helicopter tragedy. Mr Babic implied that the general's
acceptance of the UN ceasefire terms had provoked rogue elements in the
armed forces opposed to the ceasefire, particularly Serb nationalists in
Croatia who feel the army is no longer protecting them.
Behind the scenes lurks Mr Branko Mamula, former federal defence minister,
now head of the revamped Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and who remains
ideologically committed to Yugoslavia. Mr Mamula has extensive contacts in
the army and is visited regularly by Mr Milosevic.
But his colleagues say he is acutely aware that the federal army needs a
secure base, financial assurances and a new role, even if that role was
confined to one republic.
Gen Marko Negovanovic, the former federal head of counter-intelligence, and
now defence minister of Serbia, continues to play a pivotal role.
Once opposed to the break-up of the federation, he is now trying to salvage
a smaller, Serb-dominated rump Yugoslavia in which the army could play a
prominent role.
Bringing all these elements together under one single command  - and under
political control  - is plagued with difficulties, western diplomats said.
'We also have to consider how the middle ranks of officers can be reined in.
'We cannot yet talk of any lasting peace,' a diplomat commented.

FT  09 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Two long-dated Ecu deals help to push
down prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO long-dated deals in the Ecu bond market, coupled with rumours of further
supply, overstretched existing demand in the sector, pushing secondary
market prices down slightly.
An Ecu750m, 15-year deal for Finland, via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, suffered from
concern about the borrower's credit rating, currently under review by
Moody's.
The country's economic problems are pushing its funding needs higher.
However, the deal was considered fairly priced.
Societe Nationale des Chemins de fer Francais, the French national railway,
issued Ecu400m of 15-year bonds, priced to yield 8.49 per cent, which was
considered rather aggressive.
The launch spread tightened from 6 basis points to 5 basis points above the
French Treasury's comparable Ecu OAT.
The deals were both unswapped; there is virtually no Ecu swap market beyond
10 years.
Dealers had reported strong demand at the longer end, but rumours of more
supply at 10 years induced fears that the market would become clogged.
Last summer, the market effectively closed for several months after it
failed to absorb a deluge of new issues in the spring. The total supply so
far this year is still relatively small.
In the event, Belgium, which was rumoured to be looking at the Ecu market,
is likely to access the D-Mark sector later this month instead, with a
DM500m five to 10-year deal. However, Norway and Italy are also said to be
eyeing the sector.
In the dollar sector, demand for the World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn 10-year
global offering, officially launched yesterday, continued to outstrip
supply.
Dealers expect the deal to be priced at the low end of the indicated range
of 15 basis points to 17 basis points, the tightest pricing to date for a
global offering.
The dollar sector is proving an attractive source of fixed-rate funding for
borrowers keen to lock in historically low interest rates. However, most US
companies can still raise funds more cheaply in the US market.
Phillip Morris Capital Corporation and BOC raised Dollars 200m and Dollars
150m respectively of five-year bonds, both via CSFB.
Meanwhile, two UK companies, Tesco, the retailer, and Southern Electric, the
utility, raised Pounds 200m and Pounds 150m respectively in 10-year bonds.
The Tesco deal was considered aggressively priced at 80 basis points above
the curve, while the Southern Electric offering was considered more
attractively priced at 70 basis points over the curve.
Swaps opportunities into floating rate sterling are proving relatively
attractive, but demand for bonds could be curtailed by concern about the
weakness of sterling, which is bumping on the bottom of its exchange rate
mechanism band.
Late in the day, the Leeds Permanent Building Society launched a Pounds 100m
two-year deal via NatWest Capital Markets.
Elsewhere, CIA Hering, a Brazilian textiles and food company, brought a
Dollars 50m private placement of two-year bonds, priced to yield 835 basis
points over the comparable US Treasury market. The deal was arranged by ABN
Amro.
Turnover on the Amsterdam-based European Options Exchange (EOE), this year
was likely to be roughly the same as last year, said Mr Tjerk Westerterp,
the exchange's president, Reuter reports.
The volume of options contracts was likely to fall slightly, but this would
be offset by an expected rise in the number of futures contracts, Mr
Westerterp said.
Last year, the exchange handled a total of 11.2m options and futures
contracts.

FT  09 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOUR-PRONE derivative markets saw continuing volatility yesterday and
contributed to the early weakness in the underlying equity market, writes
Peter John.
The FT-SE futures March contract opened sharply lower and in early trade it
was at 2,490, representing a 32-point premium over cash. Although above
estimated fair value, the premium was well down on levels of recent days.
March came under further pressure with the first reports that US President
George Bush was ill and a belief that Wall Street would open at least 20
points off.
At one stage March was down 40 points, but then the buyers began to return.
Fears over Bush's illness eased, Wall Street opened only 10 off and then
rallied sharply, and a rumour swept through the market that the Bank of
England would hold a positive afternoon press conference. March climbed back
towards its previous close. It finished down 4 at 2,502 with 8,800 contracts
dealt and at a premium of 40 to cash.
On the LTOM, turnover was 23,130, slightly down on the previous day and BP
was the top equity option on 1,483 lots dealt. The biggest single trade was
a bearish buy of 700 Hanson February 200 puts at 7.

FT  09 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo at new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1991 star of the FT-SE 100 index, Glaxo, was once again outstanding in a
very weak market yesterday as US investors went on a spending spree. The
shares were among the strongest in the Footsie list. The share price broke
through the previous all-time peak, achieved in November, and gained 15 to
885p on unusually high turnover of 8.6m.
Any sellers in London were immediately matched by US buyers who, enthused by
bullish press reports and an earnings forecast upgrade on Tuesday, ensured
that the pharmaceuticals group was able to hold up in the morning.
The shares were further helped by a report that US pharmaceuticals group
Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would charge the US federal government less for
drugs.
Analyst Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett said fears that the US would
impose price restrictions on pharmaceutical companies was 'the one black
cloud on the horizon', and a feeling that the industry was becoming
self-regulating would be a fillip to sentiment.
Dixons higher
Interim figures from Dixons, the electrical goods retailer, although around
a third lower than the same period last year, were very well received by the
market and gave a shot in the arm to a troubled retailing sector.
Dixons shares, good performers in the run-up to Christmas but which had
fallen sharply in the past few days, staged a strong rally to close 15
higher at 205p. It was the third most heavily traded stock in the London
market yesterday with 9.4m shares changing hands.
Dealers said the improvement reflected a strong performance in the UK, where
the group enjoyed much better than expected sales at its Dixons and Currys
outlets. But analysts said Dixons was not a good barometer of the UK
retailing sector generally.
Mr Tony Cooper at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said he 'remained a long term bull of
the sector but expected that in the short term the sector would remain
choppy'.
He added that there were still 'massive uncertainties with no signs of a
recovery in spending' and that 'worries about unemployment and property
values mean the public is still not putting its hands in its pockets'.
BAe rebounds
Good news from several quarters drove British Aerospace 11 higher to 311p,
recovering the losses following the negative weekend press comment. Most
significant was the belief in the market that Kleinwort Benson Securities
had turned positive on the stock and would become a buyer shortly.
BAe had suffered from press reports that reiterated criticisms in a private
note by Nomura, the Japanese broking house, which cast doubts on the
likelihood of BAe winning the second phase of the Pounds 2.5bn Al Yamamah
defence contract. Most other analysts felt the criticism was overdone; this
week Nomura circulated a second, less-bearish, note, expressing regret to
BAe for any embarrassment caused.
The stock was also cheered by news of BAe's participation in the new Orion
satellite venture and improved Rover car sales in the UK for December. The
shares also found sentiment favourable ahead of a series of meetings next
week between BAe and institutions. Turnover was a moderate 4.5m.
Guinness change
A number of securities houses changed forecasts and stances on Guinness and
the shares ended a strong run. Following a jump of more than 50 points since
Christmas, the shares fell 12 yesterday to 539p with 3.2m traded.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew moved from being a buyer to a holder. It lowered its
1991 estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 955m and its 1992 figure to Pounds
1.08bn from Pounds 1.1bn, citing recent tough trading conditions.
Among other houses said to have reduced their estimates was Cazenove,
Guinness's broker. Cazenove never comments on market speculation but
analysts believed that the house had cut its estimate to Pounds 1.08bn from
Pounds 1.11bn.
Cable and Wireless came under more pressure, ending 17 off at 577p on
relatively heavy turnover of 6m, with dealers citing worries of increased
competition in UK telecoms from US group Sprint as the reason for the latest
slide in the shares.
Midland Bank outpaced the rest of a troubled banks sector, responding to
what most dealers described as 'unlikely' tales of a bid from Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking, which already holds a near 15 per cent stake in Midland.
The bid rumours followed hints that HK Bank could be lining up a substantial
rights issue. HK Bank built up its stake around two years ago with the
ultimate intention of a full merger with Midland. But the departure of Sir
Kit McMahon, the previous Midland chairman, and problems at HK Bank, and
Midland's never-ending problems with third world debt and now UK bad debt
provisions, put paid to the merger hopes.
Midland ended 3 up at 212p on moderate turnover of 2.6m. NatWest, heavily
sold in recent sessions after profits downgrades from, among others, James
Capel, managed a minor gain to 264p, with Kleinwort Benson said to have been
a keen supporter of the shares.
Financing anxieties hit Greycoat Properties, which has been trying to raise
money to cover the cost of its Embankment Place development at London's
Charing Cross station. The shares dropped 22 to 76p as fears emerged that
the group's attempt to replace its original Pounds 110m financing with a
Pounds 130m deep discount bond issue was not going well. County NatWest will
today downgrade Greycoat's net asset value from 7.3p to 6.5p.
Oil shares, buffeted by the recent spate of profits downgrades, were again
heavily traded but closed well above the day's lowest levels as a number of
analysts took the view the sector may be oversold. Kleinwort Benson said:
'Earnings downgrades on BP and Shell have been discounted and both are a
buy.' It added that it preferred BP, given its high prospective yield of
over 8 per cent.
Strauss Turnbull, one of the leading bears of the oil sector for more than a
year shifted its stance on the sector from 'sell' to 'hold', 'because of the
20 per cent underperformance over the period'. But Strauss remains extremely
bearish of Shell, which dipped 7 more to 475p on heavy turnover of 9.1m. BP
rallied from 270p to close only 2 off at 274p with a hefty 13m shares
traded.
Grand Metropolitan rose 5 to 919p on news that its US subsidiary Pillsbury
is buying the frozen products division of Minneapolis-based McGlynn
Bakeries.
Worries about profits downgrades continued to overhang Body Shop shares,
which retreated 9 more to 328p. Ratners bounced up to 24p before closing a
net 2 firmer at 23p awaiting the crucial statement on Christmas trading.
Suggestions that a line of 5m Burton shares was on offer depressed the
Burton share price, which slipped 1 1/2 to 35 1/2 p. Closing turnover of
2.4m in Burton indicated the shares were still kicking around as the market
closed.
The recently somewhat amazing performance of Reed International was checked
yesterday. The shares had risen more than 50p since mid-December, but
yesterday they fell 23 before closing 10 off at 528p. There were suggestions
that one securities house had cut its profits estimate, and that other cuts
were in the wind.
Holiday groups again slipped back on fears of a price war, Airtours losing
14 to 813p and Owners Abroad 5 to 98p. However, many in the market feel the
war is a phoney one and that the sector remains fundamentally strong.
Smith New Court yesterday upgraded Airtours, forecasting profits of Pounds
36.5m for 1992.
A buy note on Granada Group from broker Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken sent the shares
ahead 7 to 204p.
A tight market in Rank Organisation left the shares 9 up at 613p. Confidence
that the group would pay its final dividend at the end of the month helped
sentiment.

FT  09 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices rally from early setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIVERSE pressures at present acting on UK equities were clearly
displayed in the market's performance yesterday. A firm, if uncertain,
opening by Wall Street, after President Bush's collapse in Tokyo was
ascribed to nothing more serious than gastric influenza, prompted a
substantial recovery in UK shares, which had been falling heavily on
sterling's weakness.
The Footsie, already down by around 30 points, initially extended its loss
as the news from Tokyo seemed to open the way for a heavy fall on Wall
Street. At worst, the Footsie was down 41.6 at 2,441.3, although trading
volume at this stage was fairly modest.
The UK market rallied abruptly in late afternoon but traders were cautious
of giving all the credit to Wall Street, although the Dow was up by 18
points in UK trading hours. Further details of President Bush's illness came
just as a substantial trading programme, weighted to the buy side, unrolled
across the range of Footsie stocks.
By the close, the FT-SE Index had recovered to 2,467.1, with the day's loss
reduced to 15.8 points. Equity strategists pointed out that the pound was
still challenging its ERM lows at the close, and that a sudden increase in
equity business volume in the final two hours could be put down to the
trading programme. Seaq turnover finally totalled 505.3m shares for the
session, against 478.3m on Tuesday.
The first half of the session presented a universally bleak appearance, with
sterling's weakness accompanied by wider concerns over the recession in the
UK economy. The depressive mood was set by confirmation that British Steel
is closing its steelmaking plant in Ravenscraig, Scotland.
However, there was slightly better news on the retail front from Dixons, the
consumer electronics retailer, which said that, while US business had
disappointed, domestic trade over the crucial Christmas selling season and
in the early weeks of that month had been 'well above' last year's.
This helped retailers, and some bank shares also tried to steady from recent
losses. But across the broad range of the market, shares were weak again,
with oil and insurance stocks extending this week's losses.
Some profits were being taken yesterday ahead of the close tomorrow of the
equity market trading account. This week's slide in the market had trimmed
the gain on the account to around 20 Footsie points at yesterday's lowest
levels. Traders were a little wary of the rapid recovery in share prices in
late trading and will be watching keenly to see how Wall Street behaves
overnight, since this will probably set the tone for this morning's opening
in the London stock market.
At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Trevor Laugharne remained very cautious
about the market in the near term, commenting that domestic forces remain
weak.
Trading remained stock selective, and the FT-SE Index was helped by sharp
rises in British Aerospace and Glaxo, two stocks which moved in opposite
directions last year. Glaxo, the star of the London market, continues to
attract US as well as European buyers. In British Aerospace, which suffered
heavily last year for its rights issue move, investors have begun to refocus
on prospects for the Pounds 2.5bn defence contract with Saudi Arabia.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Appointments: Sallying forth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers International, still struggling to regain its position in
the international capital markets after revelations of US Treasury
market-rigging last summer, is waiting to see whether the seasonal flow of
staff departures in the new year will turn into a flood.
The first to leave the ship in 1992 was the firm's head of bond syndication,
Simon Meadows, who has joined Credit Suisse First Boston as co-head of debt
syndication with John Walsh. A spokesman for Salomon Brothers says the
position is likely to be filled internally.
Meadows' move follows the departure last November of Ian Hannam, head of
equity syndicate, who left as a result of the internal restructuring in the
wake of the Treasury scandal. Hannam was replaced by Jeremy Palmer, an
internal appointment. Both these positions were key roles in Salomon's core
business, which has already suffered in the aftermath ; Salomon slipped from
sixth to 16th in the 1991 table of international bond underwriters,
according to Euromoney Bondware.
An official at Salomon Brothers points out that staff turnover at the firm
is traditionally at its highest in the first quarter. Last year, 136 staff
left, around 50 in the first three months. Salomon's ability to stem the
flow will be one measure of its recovery.

FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Secondary stocks perform
strongly as Dow held back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
SECONDARY stocks were again the star performers in US equity markets
yesterday, shrugging off news of President Bush's illness to end at another
all-time high. Broader indices, however, ended the day virtually unchanged,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down a slight 0.89 at
3,203.94 from Tuesday's record peak. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 was just 0.70 firmer at 418.10, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks outshone the other indices by climbing 8.03 to a
record 610.32. Turnover on the New York SE was exceptionally heavy at 290m
shares.
The market opened weaker, with the Dow retreating 17 points as investors
reacted nervously to the news that President Bush had collapsed at a dinner
in Tokyo. Assurances from Mr Bush's doctors that he was only suffering from
intestinal flu calmed the market, and it did not take long for demand to
pick up and prices to recover.
Although there was a bout of mid-afternoon selling, there was enough late
buying to recover most of the losses. CSX gained Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 56
1/8 after the railroad and pipeline group announced a restructuring
programme which would involve substantial job cuts and, hopefully, big
improvements in productivity stemming from agreements with the rail unions.
The company said it would be taking a Dollars 490m after-tax charge in the
fourth quarter to cover the cost of the restructuring.
RJR Nabisco, up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 11 1/2 in turnover of 9.3m shares,
was in great demand yesterday. Investors bought the stock on hopes that the
company's earnings will improve sharply this year as the economy picks up.
Tandem Computers moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 13 in heavy trading
after the company said that first-quarter 1992 revenues would be above those
reported a year ago, and announced plans for a restructuring charge in the
next quarter of Dollars 90m. In the same sector, IBM declined Dollars 2 1/4
to Dollars 92 3/8 , Compaq shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 and Digital
Equipment slipped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 59 3/4 .
Best Buy jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 20 1/4 in response to news that the
electronic appliance retailer's same-store sales increased by 16 per cent in
December.
Leading the strong performance of over-the-counter stocks were Microsoft, up
Dollars 4 1/4 at Dollars 124 1/4 , Apple, Dollars 1 3/8 ahead at Dollars 60
1/2 , and Amgen, which appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 74 5/8 .
Mentor put on Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4 after the company offered its
saline-filled breast implants as an alternative to the silicone-based
variety, which have been banned from use for 45 days by the US Food and Drug
Administration pending further safety tests.
Canada
TORONTO closed little changed in heavy trading after rallying from an early
decline.
The composite index gained just 2.7 at 3,515.6 on the day. It opened down
almost 13 points, following the drop overnight on the Tokyo market, but
steadily recovered. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by 321 to 259
after a volume of 36.4m shares.
Biomira gained CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 18 1/2 , on top of the previous
day's rise of CDollars 2 7/8 . The company said it has agreed in principle
with a 'major pharmaceutical company' to enter into joint licence and
research agreements.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling slides against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING continued to slide against the D-Mark on the foreign exchange
markets yesterday, falling close to its 'floor' within the European exchange
rate mechanism.
From a close of DM2.8450 on Tuesday, the UK currency had fallen to DM2.8350
by late morning, dragged down by the weakness of the dollar and just on the
limit of its permitted divergence range within the ERM.
From this level sterling proved unable to sustain a rally and remained weak
through the afternoon session.
This weakness occurred as the US currency was firm or rising, demonstrating
that the fortunes of sterling are not tied to the dollar.
Earlier this week, analysts were ascribing sterling's weakness within the
ERM to the fall of the dollar, since any decline in the value of the US
currency was likely to benefit the D-Mark. However, yesterday's sterling
decline indicated that it can fall while the dollar is gaining against other
European currencies.
At 4pm in London, the closing time used by the Bank of England to calculate
sterling's position within the ERM, the UK currency stood at DM2.8395, the
lowest close against the D-Mark since sterling joined the system.
By 5pm sterling had fallen further still and was pinned back at the day's
low of DM2.8350 when trading ceased in London, a full 2 pfennigs down from
Monday's opening level of DM2.8550.
The dollar was firm against the yen and D-Mark yesterday in spite of a brief
scare in mid-morning after early reports that US President George Bush had
been taken ill.
Following a late rally in London on Tuesday, the dollar continued firmer
overnight in the Far East. At the close in Tokyo, the US currency stood at
DM1.5095, from a close in New York of DM1.5065, and at Y124.40, from
Y123.90.
Having failed to breach the psychologically important DM1.50 level, the
dollar was pushed higher against the German currency.
Comments by Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, on the progress of
trade talks with the Japanese government contained only a passing reference
to the dollar/yen exchange rate. This disappointed many dealers following
speculation that the two governments would agree to a controlled devaluation
of the dollar against the yen as a means of moderating the US trade deficit
with Japan.
This more positive tone continued into European trading until the first
reports of President Bush's illness were received. Amid an atmosphere of
deep uncertainty about the health of Mr Bush, the US currency fell back to
DM1.5060 and Y123.95.
However, later reports confirmed that Mr Bush was suffering from only a mild
illness and the dollar recovered ground to close at DM1.5150 and Y124.84 in
London, but off the day's highs of DM1.5195 and Y125.40. It ended in New
York at DM1.5072 and Y124.23.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Rates close steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MONEY rates edged higher during the morning session yesterday but fell
back in late trading to close little changed from Tuesday's levels.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the
day, later revised up to Pounds 1.15bn. In early assistance the bank bought
Pounds 114m of band 4 bills at 10 1/8 per cent.
Later in the morning session, the bank purchased a further Pounds 304m paper
as rates moved higher as liquidity was squeezed. Assistance comprised the
purchase of band 1 bank bills and treasury bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band 3
bank bills and treasury bills at 10 7/32 per cent and band 4 bank bills at
10 1/8 per cent.
However, the heavy slug of assistance did not prevent rates from moving
higher. Overnight unsecured money was quoted at 11 1/4 -11 per cent around
midday from a closing level of 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent on Tuesday.
During the afternoon session, the Bank of England purchased a further Pounds
193m bills in bands 1, 2 and 3. Late assistance totalled Pounds 395m,
bringing the total for the day to just over Pounds 1bn. This relieved
pressure on rates and by the close the overnight rate had fallen back to 10
3/4 - 5/8 per cent.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange closed at 89.38, up from 89.36 on Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan again squeezed money market interest rates
higher, adding to a Y660bn liquidity shortage by recalling Y200bn loans to
financial institutions.
Mr Yasushi Meino, Bank of Japan governor, said the authorities were trying
to ensure 'adequate' interest rates and that pressure for lower rates was
caused by market speculation.
At one stage, overnight call money was quoted well over 6 per cent before
falling back to 5 13/32 per cent by the close, after 5 11/32 per cent on
Tuesday.
Today a liquidity shortage of around Y550bn is forecast, suggesting firm
rates.
In Frankfurt, money rates edged lower following several days of complete
stability. Call money ended at 9.40-50 per cent, from the 9.45-55 per cent
level which has prevailed so far this year.
Rates eased even though the Bundesbank withdrew a net DM2.6bn from the
market by setting a DM30.6bn repurchase pact to replace the expiring
DM33.2bn agreement.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reynolds predicts further cuts
in aluminium capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIMARY ALUMINIUM production outside the former communist countries is
likely to fall by more than 3 per cent this year and further capacity cuts
must be expected, says Mr Lloyd O'Carroll, corporate economist at Reynolds
Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group.
He suggests in a report prepared for Reynolds that another 200,000 tonnes of
capacity - equivalent to one large smelter - will be shut this year on top
of the 929,000 tonnes of cuts already announced as the west adjusts to the
steep increase in exports from the former Soviet Union.
Mr O'Carroll sees western world aluminium output falling from an estimated
14.79m tonnes last year to 14.34m tonnes in 1992 before recovering to a
record 15.2m tonnes in 1993.
He suggests that exports to the west from the former Soviet Union will ease
back a little, from about 900,000 tonnes in 1991 to 700,000 tonnes this
year. This will help reduce total supply by 5 per cent, from 15.96m tonnes
to 15.19m tonnes.
Meanwhile, demand in the west, which levelled off last year, is forecast to
resume its growth and increase by 4 per cent in 1992 to 15.576m tonnes and
then by another 7 per cent in 1993 to 16.665m tonnes.
He estimates that western world aluminium consumption last year would have
remained at the 1990 level had it not been for the unification of Germany.
The old East Germany accounted for all the 80,000 tonnes, or 0.5 per cent,
rise.
The forecast increase in demand in 1992, the production cuts and a small
fall in Soviet exports will push stocks down by 385,000 tonnes for a
'modest' improvement in the supply-demand balance, Mr O'Carroll suggests.
He estimates that at the end of 1991 stocks were about 1m higher than in
December 1990 at 3.25m tonnes or roughly 80 days of supply - the highest
since 1985. This implies that without the Soviet exports the supply and
demand would have been roughly in balance last year.
He points out that there is a great deal of uncertainty at present about
aluminium supply and demand. 'The additional production tonnage cut and
timing of those cuts is unknown. Additionally, relatively little is known
about the Soviet situation. Depending on what one believes about those two
elements, one could be either somewhat more pessimistic or much more
optimistic than our own forecast.'
Mr O'Carroll admits that a separate 'western world' classification for the
aluminium industry is becoming an out-dated concept. But 'unfortunately,
statistical data from the former communist countries is not sufficient in
either quantity or quality to perform a true world analysis'.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana producers seek accord on
EC access - Moves for a joint Caribbean/Latin American stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH LESS than a year to go before the European banana market is
deregulated, Caribbean producers, who are seeking a continuation of trade
preferences, and Latin American exporters, who are opposed, will meet
tomorrow to discuss a common approach.
The meeting, to be held in Belize, follows discussions at a recent Central
American summit in Honduras. Mr George Price, the prime minister of Belize,
which is a member of the Caribbean Community, said the Latin American
leaders were 'sympathetic' to the concerns of the Caribbean producers, and
to their fears of losing their European market share to Latin American
fruit.
In spite of this, Mr Price said the Latin American producers 'were lined up
for a tariffication solution' in the European banana market. There was,
however, an indication from the Latin American producers that they would
support a special mechanism to protect Caribbean bananas.
'We are cautiously optimistic that with the goodwill displayed to date, a
positive signal can be sent from this meeting,' Mr Price said.
That the meeting is being convened is significant, given the degree of
hostility that Caribbean producers have displayed towards the Latin American
exporters. A recent offer by Chiquita Brands, one of the leading Latin
American producers, to co-operate with the Caribbean states in finding an
acceptable approach to the European market was immediately dismissed by Mr
John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia.
The Caribbean states are still hoping that since they will be unable to
compete with cheaper Latin American fruit in an open European market, the
European Community will find a method, which has been promised, to guarantee
the region's market share.
The hundreds of small farmers in the Caribbean islands, working on small
plots and paying higher wages, cannot compete with the large plantations and
low labour costs of Latin American producers.
But there is still no indication from the European Community as to what
method will be used to meet Caribbean concerns. The banana protocol of the
Lome Convention, a trade and aid treaty between the EC and several
developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, says that the
deregulation of the European market should not place any of the producers
'in a less favourable situation than in the past or present'.
'The challenge remains about reconciling the European Community's
obligations to the producers with the single market,' said Mr Anthony
Fairclough, a special adviser to the European Commission.
'The circle which has to be squared is how to organise the market whilst
allowing the market itself to operate as competitively as possible. How do
we ensure that banana producers from all sources benefit?'
The leaders of Caribbean banana producing countries are equally uncertain
about the method the EC will use to guarantee their access in the face of
the European shift towards deregulation. 'The Europeans must find a way in
which we can sell our bananas as we do now,' concluded Miss Eugenia Charles,
the prime minister of Dominica. 'They must find a way or we will cease to
exist.'
The Caribbean producers supply about two-thirds of the bananas consumed in
Britain, but less than 15 per cent of the 3.4m tonnes consumed each year in
the EC. More than half of Europe's imports come from Latin America.
Caribbean leaders argue that, in spite of the small size of their industry,
it represents the main economic pillar of several countries and failure to
protect the region's market share after the end of this year would cause
severe social and political damage.
The prime minister of St Lucia has attempted to soften European hearts by
criticising the morality of banana production in Latin America. 'The
Caribbean producers will employ every diplomatic device to ensure that we
maintain our position in the market and are not driven from it by unbridled
competition in a playing field which is by no means level and where we
compete at disadvantages by paying a living wage to our workers,' Mr Compton
argues.
He says trade unions and farmers' organisations are 'hallmarks of civilised
society' and suggests that 'Europe must realise that cheap bananas have a
social cost to the people of the countries in which these cheap bananas are
produced'.
Unless there is an early indication of what the EC proposes, the Caribbean
banana industry could lose out as marketing companies look elsewhere for
supplies. Mr Ray Hilbourne, a director of Geest Industries, which markets
Windward Islands bananas, said there are 'enormous' difficulties for the
marketing companies in making forward plans in the current state of
uncertainty. The implication is that the companies may be forced to look to
other sources, such as Latin America.
This Friday's meeting notwithstanding, there is underlying disagreement
between the Caribbeans and Latin Americans about the best solution to the
EC's dilemma. According to Mr Jorge Asension, an adviser to the Guatemalan
economy ministry, the Guatemalan government thinks the Community has to
abide by its commitment to create a totally free market, based on free trade
and with no preferences and subsidies.
'It is outrageous that Latin American producers are not able to sell bananas
to Spain, which is their historic colonial power,' Mr Asension said.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers told to group together
to market produce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OXFORD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK supermarkets, often castigated in the farming press, should be seen
'not as an impediment, but as a neighbour', the Oxford Farming Conference
was told yesterday.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll, owners of Safeway, told the 400
delegates that the size of the supermarkets led to pressure to find and
develop new products. Whereas 30 years ago the average supermarket stocked
800 or so items, a typical store now stocked 15,000 items.
But farmers would have to become effective trading partners, Sir Alistair
said. 'As a Pounds 5bn multiple retailer we cannot realistically deal
directly with a vast number of raw material producers.'
If the producers organised themselves into larger groups, increased size
would give them more competence and clout in their trading relationships
with both customers and their own suppliers.
'As a retailer, the last thing I want is a weak supplier,' he said.
While well conceived, good value, quality products would always sell given
an assured supply, UK producers all too often missed market opportunities.
'The enormous food and drink trade gap is the clearest evidence of this,' he
said, echoing remarks made by the prime minister at the conference dinner
earlier this week.
Since the Second World War two factors had held back the UK farming
industry's marketing. First, agricultural policies had helped farmers
prosper by concentrating on a narrow range of commodities. Second, the large
size of a typical UK farm compared with those in Europe had enabled it to
produce just enough cash flow to finance new equipment without having to
co-operate with other producers.
The challenge now was to find new ways of both reducing input costs and
adding value. 'To do this, farmers need to achieve critical mass both as
buyers and sellers, and this will mean that new forms of organisation will
be needed for all but the very largest farming enterprises,' Sir Alistair
said.
Mr Andrew Logan, a farmer and a founder of a food production group in Fife,
Scotland, said the supermarkets were both bullies and ruthless. But he
asked: 'What other industry would criticise its customers? We must love our
customers'.
The supermarkets had taught the grower his job in marketing, 'forcing him to
produce a quality article packed and presented in such a way as meets the
demands of the most discerning customer'.
It was imperative, however, that producers grouped together to achieve
sufficient size to deploy the marketing skills and finance the resources
required to be the supermarkets' supplier.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Technology: Electric vehicles gain momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A prototype of the electric car that BMW intends to sell in the US in the
second half of the 1990s is on display at the Los Angeles motor show which
opened to the public this week.
It represents one of several developments on the electric car front in the
past few weeks, with more manufacturers indicating their interest in
commercial production of such vehicles despite their formidable cost and
performance disadvantages compared with petrol or diesel cars.
They are being spurred by the accelerating momentum in North America towards
wide adoption of Californian clean air standards. These require that from
1998 zero emissions vehicles (Zev), in other words electric ones, make up 2
per cent of the sales of every manufacturer selling more than 35,000 cars in
the state, rising to at least 10 per cent of annual sales from 2003.
Manufacturers which do not comply will be barred from selling any cars in
the state.
In California alone, this means a forecast of 35,000 Zev sales in 1998,
rising to more than 150,000 a year from 2003.
However, a further 12 states, plus Washington DC, have now indicated their
intention to adopt the California standards, which would mean 110,000 Zev
sales in 1998 and more than 500,000 in 2003.
Despite the fact that General Motors is already preparing a plant to produce
the Impact, which GM intends to be the first electric car in volume
production, GM, Ford and Chrysler collectively insist that other states do
not have California's air pollution problems.
But along with European and Japanese manufacturers seeking to maintain a
presence in North America, they want vehicles ready to put on the market if
California's standards spread throughout North America and into Europe.
In the past few weeks Fiat has indicated its intention to produce an
electric version of the Cinquecento, its new small car, and Citroen of
France has unveiled a prototype electric town car, the Citela.
Earlier this week Ford said that within a year it would have a fleet of 80
Ford Ecostar electric vans running commercial trials in several US and
European cities.
The BMW at Los Angeles, designated E2, strongly resembles an earlier
prototype, E1, unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show in September. However,
it has been 'stretched' to accommodate a bigger battery pack for long
distances and to provide extra interior room for the Californians who
initially will buy it.
Styled by Los Angeles-based Designworks, of which BMW is part owner, the E2
is claimed by BMW to have a maximum range of 267 miles; acceleration to
50mph in 15.6 seconds and a top speed of 75mph.
The batteries are high-energy sodium-sulphur. Problems include an eight-hour
recharging time and a battery cost of around DM40,000 (Pounds 14,000).
Citroen's model, the Citela, is a city car with a recyclable body. Citroen
claims a range of up to 130 miles, a top speed of up to 70mph, and a quick
recharge facility - of one minute per mile of range.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries lose gains on auction news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BOND prices were virtually unchanged in late trading yesterday after
early gains had been wiped out by a disappointing auction of seven-year
notes.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unmoved at 107
7/32 , yielding 7.391 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up
1/32 at 100 21/32 , yielding 4.631 per cent.
Overnight, the long bond had weakened in Tokyo and London when news of Mr
George Bush's collapse at a dinner in Japan first broke, but confirmation
that the president was only suffering from intestinal flu helped calm the
New York market's nerves and prices soon rallied.
Attention subsequently switched to the afternoon auction of seven-year
notes, which was expected to go well. But when the sale was completed, bond
prices fell back as the market reacted badly to news that the seven-year
notes had been awarded to bidders at an average yield of 6.40 per cent.
THE European bond markets were dominated by activity in the Ecu sector
yesterday. Ecu bond prices fell after the launch of two large 15-year Ecu
bond issues - an Ecu 750m issue from the Republic of Finland with a coupon
of 8 1/2 per cent and an Ecu 400m issue from SNCF of France with a coupon of
8 3/8 per cent. The yield on the 9 1/8 per cent UK Ecu bond due 2001 moved
from 8.35 per cent to 8.41 per cent.
The German government bond market slipped on profit-taking. The Liffe bund
futures contract opened at 88.01 but after peaking at 88.04 fell to 87.68
and ended the day at around 87.80.
Traders reported some switching out of the Dutch government bond market into
French government bonds ahead of Friday's release of Dutch inflation
figures. Most analysts are forecasting a Dutch inflation rate of between
4.9-5.2 per cent for December.
STERLING weakness against the D-Mark and dollar yesterday prompted some
profit-taking in the UK government bond market and generally left gilt
prices lower or unchanged.
The Liffe gilt future, which opened at 97.15, slipped to 97.09 on an
above-average volume of 20,000 contracts. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt
due 2003/07 ended the day almost unchanged at 115 5/8 .
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped lower as a weakening in the yen
against the dollar encouraged some profit-taking yesterday.
The financial markets had expected President Bush's visit to Japan to lead
to an agreement to boost the Japanese currency. But the yen weakened against
the dollar, from Y122.8 on Tuesday to Y124.7 in Europe yesterday, in the
absence of any such commitment.
The March futures contract fell from 103.32 to 103.24 while the yield on the
benchmark No 129 moved from 5.28 per cent to close at 5.32 per cent in
Tokyo. Traders noted some buying of the 20-year maturity bonds, and said
these appear cheap relative to the 10-year maturities.
Today, the Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of
10-year bonds.

trading

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORONTO Stock Exchange has recommended, after several years of
hesitation, that all equity trading on North America's busiest bourse after
New York be automated within the next 12 months.
The board of governors' recommendation is likely to be approved at a meeting
of members on February 13.
Mr Michael Edwards, the Toronto Stock Exchange chairman, said that an
electronic trading system would 'substantially increase productivity for
member-firms, reduce potential for misunderstanding and error, and
significantly reduce the cost of trading.'
However, the strong feelings aroused by the decision were quickly apparent
when one of the exchange's 240 traders loudly heckled an official who
announced the plans on the exchange's floor.
Floor traders, supported by several powerful firms, have over the years
resisted efforts to move trading to the exchange's Computer-Assisted Trading
System (Cats).
Cats is used for about half the 1,138 companies listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, but it accounts for only 20 to 25 per cent of trading volumes.
The decision will end equities trading on the 30,000 sq ft floor in the
heart of Toronto's financial district to which the stock exchange moved
eight years ago.
Face-to-face trading will continue, however, for options and futures at a
location which has yet to be decided.
The Toronto Stock Exchange traded 5.8bn shares valued at CDollars 67.7bn
last year, accounting for about three-quarters by value of trading on
Canada's five stock exchanges.
The credit quality of Canadian companies is expected to crumble further in
1992 as downgrades continue to outpace upgrades, but the pace of downgrades
may be slowing, analysts at rating agencies said, Reuter reports.
Sectors most at risk include retailers, steelmakers and natural resource
companies.

AMERICAN Airlines, one of the three largest US carriers, is to introduce
'business class' travel - ranking between first class and coach in service
and price terms - on its New York-Los Angeles route. The service will start
on February 4, writes Nikki Tait.
Although US carriers often offer three classes on international flights,
three-tier pricing is unusual on domestic US flights.
American's main rivals, Delta and United, do offer business class on some
domestic flights when the aircraft is going on to an international
destination. United also plans to expand its business class service next
month, making it available on 149 domestic flights each week. This will
involve having business class seating on some aircraft 'dedicated' to flying
domestic routes, the carrier said.
American said it planned to reconfigure 10 DC-10 aircraft dedicated to the
LA-New York service, to include 52 business class seats in each.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S national car manufacturer, Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional (Proton),
will offer 55.4m MDollars 1 shares at MDollars 5 each to the public to seek
a stock exchange listing, officials said, Reuter reports.
Proton is owned jointly by state-owned Hicom, the finance ministry,
Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsubishi Motors.
Proton will also issue 88.8m shares to approved ethnic Bumiputra investors,
including a minimum of 2m shares to state-owned Permodalan Nasional (PNB),
Mr Jamil Jan, chairman, said. Proton directors and staff will be allocated
another 5.77m shares.
The car-maker is due to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange before
the end of March.
After the listing, state-owned Hicom will reduce its equity in Proton to
29.2 per cent from 41.74 per cent, while the Minister of Finance
Incorporated's stake will fall to 17.8 per cent from 26.47 per cent. Equity
held by Mitsubishi and Mitsubishi Motors will fall to 8.7 per cent from
12.45 per cent.
Mr Jamil said the group had command of the domestic car market and, with
growing exports, investors were assured of earnings and dividends.
He said it was forecast to earn a pre-tax profit of MDollars 406.6m
(USDollars 150.6m) for the financial year ending March 31 1992, on turnover
of MDollars 2.1bn, against a pre-tax profit of MDollars 261.4m in 1991 on
turnover of MDollars 1.8bn.
Mr Jamil said Proton's share of the domestic market was projected to be
maintained at 64 per cent for the next five years. However, the introduction
of a second national car could affect sales.

AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, is reorganising its operations. It plans to
remove a layer of management, which employs some 1,000 people, and sell off
its most persistent loss-making activities, Reuter reports from Arnhem.
Akzo's worst loss-makers accounted for 15 per cent of sales in 1990, but it
began selling them off last year.
The company plans to merge two of its basic divisions; general chemicals and
salt and basic chemicals. The general chemicals division employs about 8,100
people with a further 6,500 employed in the salt and basics division. The
group had a total workforce of 64,500 people in September.
The merger will begin in February and be completed by May 1993. However, the
company said no areas of activity would be eliminated purely because of the
divisional merger and it could give no figures about job losses.
However, Mr Aarnout Loudon, Akzo's chairman, said the changes in the
management structure would inevitably result in job losses.
Mr Loudon, who announced the reorganisation and divestment plans in his New
Year message, said that the next 40 per cent of sales which produced only 25
per cent of operating income, would be either strengthened, divested, or put
in co-operation ventures.
No timescale was given.
Akzo is due to report its 1991 results next month. In 1990, it made net
profits of Fl 727m. Mr Loudon said 1991 profits looked to be modestly lower.

charge for job cuts

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CSX, the large transportation group, yesterday announced it planned to take
a Dollars 755m pre-tax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings.
Much of the charge relates to planned job cuts and productivity improvements
in its railroad operations, which range over about 20 states to the east of
the Mississippi.
Most of the US railroad companies have announced similar moves in the wake
of a new framework labour agreement, which was finally negotiated with some
congressional help, last year. The companies have been implementing this at
local level, via further union negotiations.
CSX declined to say how many jobs it expected to save on the grounds that
discussions with the unions were continuing. The railroad division employs
some 36,000 people.
However, the company stressed that the charge was designed to cover
workforce reductions across all its divisions, not just the railroad
operation. Of the Dollars 755m, Dollars 634m related to the job cuts. At the
post-tax level, the total charge reduced to Dollars 490m.
Separately, the company announced a Dollars 318m pre-tax charge, also in the
fourth quarter, as a result of the US accounting change on non-pension
retiree benefits.
Many US companies have been taking similar charges on this score.
The Virginia-based company added that it expected to make a net loss in 1991
as a result of these moves, having clocked up profits of Dollars 280m in the
first nine months.
CSX shares rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 56 1/8 in New York.

Dollars 100m in fiscal 1993.
Among the restructuring plans to be implemented over the next nine months
are consolidation of some offices and facilities, write-offs of
non-productive assets and redundancies.
Tandem has reduced its workforce by 3 per cent over the past six months, and
plans an additional 6 per cent cut.
The computer company said it expected first-quarter revenues to be slightly
above last year's level of Dollars 444m.
For fiscal 1991, Tandem reported a sharp decline in earnings to Dollars
35.2m, or 33 cents a share, compared with net income in fiscal 1990 of
Dollars 121.8m, or Dollars 1.13. Revenues for 1991 were Dollars 1.92bn, up
from Dollars 1.87bn the previous year.
'We believe the economic framework of the computer industry is changing,'
said Mr James Treybig, Tandem president and chief executive.
He said the restructuring was needed to maintain the company's position as a
low-cost producer of fault-tolerant, on-line transaction processing systems.
Tandem is a large supplier of computer systems to banks, airlines and other
businesses which frequently access critical business data.
'The economic environment continues to be very tough and we do not
anticipate relief in the short term, but the path we have embarked on today
will make us more operationally efficient,' said Mr Treybig.
Compaq Computer said that worldwide orders for its portable 486c personal
computer had exceeded company expectations, AP-DJ reports.
The company said it last month began shipping its first colour transportable
PC to customers worldwide.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Rescuers of The European stay away from
relaunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY

<TEXT>
MR CHARLES Garside, the new editor and general manager of The European, made
an important forecast yesterday. There will be no pictures of the Barclay
brothers, his new proprietors, in this week's issue.
'Did you ever work for Bob (Maxwell)? It's so refreshing to have someone who
doesn't want their pictures in the paper,' said Mr Garside.
Neither Mr David nor Mr Frederick Barclay, the owners of hotels and ships
and now a weekly newspaper, turned up yesterday at the press conference to
announce formally that The European was back in business.
But Mr Alan Chamberlain, the new managing director, promised that the
pan-European newspaper, the first large chunk to float free from the
wreckage of the Maxwell empire, would be highly successful.
Mr Chamberlain said he would be producing business plans for the first three
weeks, three months and three years.
For the first three weeks the aim would be to get a two-section paper out
using journalists on a freelance basis. Then the hiring of staff on proper
contracts would begin and Elan, the paper's third section,
The Barclay brothers, readers of The European who spend most of their time
in Monte Carlo, have taken on none of the newspaper's debt and have bought
just the title and the equipment needed to produce it.
'We are going to run it like a business. The problem was that it was run as
a paper with 20 times the revenue it actually had,' said Mr Garside. He also
thanked collectively what he said were the thousands of readers who had
written in expressing support. 'We didn't have the money to pay for the
stamps to write to them.'
Mr Kevin Maxwell, son of Mr Robert Maxwell, has agreed to comply with a
parliamentary order to appear, next Monday, before the Social Security
Committee, to answer questions about the disappearance of pension funds.

FT  09 JAN 92 / EBRD sees rise in E European deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday predicted a
steady flow of big equity investments in eastern Europe in the coming weeks
as it completed its second substantial transaction in Czechoslovakia since
the start of the year.
The latest investments, in Ceskeslovenske Aerolinie, the state airline, and
Cokoladovny, the country's largest food producer, bring to four the equity
investments made by the development bank.
However, it said previous delays in approval by the Czech authorities had
been overcome, and substantial equity investments in the country were likely
to be completed at the rate of one or two a month in the first months of
this year. The bank said it was reviewing 15 Czech investments in the
aerospace, petrochemicals and pulp and paper industries, among others.
Other substantial projects throughout eastern Europe, among 150 under
consideration at the bank, were also expected to be completed shortly.
Mr Ronald Freeman, vice-chairman of the EBRD in charge of investment
banking, said the average size of the 14 investments by the bank was Ecu20m
(Pounds 14.3m), but added: 'We expect the size to increase.'
Each of the latest equity transactions has been made in partnership with
large western companies - Air France in the case of CSA, and Nestle, the
Swiss-based foodmaker, and BSN, the French biscuit manufacturer, in the case
of Cokoladovny.
However, Mr Freeman said these did not provide a blueprint for future
investments.
In both cases, the EBRD expects to lend further money to the companies
concerned. 'It is quite likely they will want to leverage up,' said Mr
Freeman. The EBRD looks poised to treat the former republics of the Soviet
Union as members, according to a senior official.
Mr Sylvia Jay, head of the bank's political unit, said the bank was not
dealing with completely new membership in the case of the former Soviet
Republics and so the emphasis would be on continuity of membership, Reuter
reports.
'We've had some informal confirmations from individual republics that they
wish to continue membership - only Russia has given a formal confirmation,'
Mr Jay added. The former Soviet Union had a shareholding of 6 per cent in
the bank.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK jobless rate third worst in EC, says Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party yesterday underlined its intention to place unemployment at
the heart of the election campaign by releasing a leaked Department of
Employment briefing paper which shows that Britain now has the third highest
rate of unemployment in the European Community.
When calculated on the same basis as other countries, Britain's jobless rate
is behind only Spain's and Ireland's.
As Labour launched its package of measures to strengthen the economy in the
longer term, Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said the paper
showed that the rise in job vacancies, which Mr John Major had implied in
the House of Commons was a positive economic sign, seemed to be 'associated
with a reduction in recruitment activity'.
It acknowledged that the number of new vacancies notified to Jobcentres fell
for the first time since August, while the number of people placed into jobs
by the employment service also dropped - the largest fall in placings since
June.
Mr Blair said the paper also showed that the rate of increase in
unemployment in Britain in the past year was higher than any country in the
western world except Finland, and was continuing with 'an underlying upward
trend of about 30,000 a month'.
The document, intended as a briefing for the departmental press office,
showed that places on the employment training (ET) programme had fallen from
190,000 in November 1990 to 139,000 in November 1991. While the figures for
youth training (YT) places were less precise, there seemed to have been a
fall from 350,000 to about 295,000.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said there was nothing surprising
or depressing about the reduction in ET. It was part of a deliberate policy
announced at the end of 1990 after it had been discovered that many
unemployed people were already quite highly skilled and needed other forms
of help which have subsequently been provided in other programmes.
The reduction in YT was attributed to more people staying on at school, the
lack of information for Scotland and the introduction of training credits.
The Department of Employment said the leaked document had wrongly been
marked confidential, and that almost all the material in it was available
when the monthly unemployment figures were released.
Nevertheless, with jobless levels set to continue rising in the coming
months, the issue will remain a sensitive one for the Conservatives, even
when other economic indicators are more encouraging.
To counter this, there will be renewed warnings from Mr Howard about the
effect of Labour's policies on jobs.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Variations seen in the cost of crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRIME DOESN'T pay, but it costs a lot less in Newport, on the Isle of Wight.
Getting caught red-handed committing a crime in the town, close to Parkhurst
Prison, is much less likely to lead to a spell inside than in most other
places in England and Wales.
Research published yesterday reveals that courts in certain towns
consistently find defendants guilty, while others, such as Newport, York,
Taunton, Exeter and Southampton, are much 'softer' and acquit a higher
proportion of defendants.
The town to avoid is Mold, north Wales, followed by Caernarvon and Chester,
where defendants are more likely to end up detained at Her Majesty's
pleasure after appearing in a crown court.
The findings came in a detailed analysis of decisions against bailed and
remanded defendants at 64 crown courts excluding London and the south-east
during 1987-90, presented at the Institute of British Geographers'
Conference in Swansea yesterday.
Mr Paul Robertshaw, a lecturer at Cardiff Law School, was unable to explain
the variations, but said judges in 'softer' areas tended to dismiss many
cases before they came before juries, while those in more authoritarian
areas pushed most cases to trials.
He suggested that Newport's low conviction rate might partly reflect a large
number of fairly trivial offences such as holiday skirmishes at the seaside.
Research he is conducting on a smaller sample of courts appeared to show a
tendency for areas with strong Labour majorities to be lenient, while those
under Conservative control were generally tougher.
Mr Robertshaw admitted that publishing the information might encourage
criminals to travel to 'softer' areas.
'But there is a lot to be said in the public interest about researching
these variations.'
The proportion of bailed defendants acquitted by juries ranged between 16
per cent and 50 per cent.
The figures for judges issuing discharges before trials commenced or
acquittals during trials ranged from less then 5 per cent to more than 50
per cent.

FT  09 JAN 92 / British Gas may face inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS could face an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission unless it removes the conditions it has attached to its agreement
last month to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995.
The company has until tomorrow to make its position clear to the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT).
British Gas late last month said it had agreed to certain proposals by the
OFT which included hiving off its pipeline division into a separate company
as well as cutting its industrial gas market share from 90 per cent to 40
per cent.
But at the same time, Mr Bob Evans, British Gas chairman, stressed that the
company's agreement depended on being able to raise domestic prices. This
would require adjustments to a tough new pricing formula which is due to
take effect in April.
British Gas yesterday said the issues were part of the same package and that
it had spelt out its views to the OFT during six weeks of talks before
Christmas.
Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, the industry regulator, said
there was no link between the company's agreements on the industrial market
and its domestic pricing commitments.
'I will review the formula, but I am not prepared to allow
cross-subsidisation of one sector of the business by another sector,' he
said.
If British Gas insists on linking the two issues, the OFT will have no
choice but to refer the company to the MMC. British Gas said it was prepared
to face an MMC investigation.
MMC officials have indicated privately that they are preparing for a swift
review of the gas industry.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Protest over Kenya deal with UK firm: World Bank attacks
cost of contract for proposed hydroelectric scheme as 'exorbitant'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank has laun-ched a strong attack on a Pounds 38.1m contract,
backed by the UK government, involving a British firm of consulting
engineers and a Kenyan state company.
The British firm, Knight Piesold and Partners, signed the contract in July
1990 with the Kenya Power and Lighting Corporation (KPLC) for consultancy
services on the proposed Ewaso Ngiro hydroelectric scheme.
In an internal document, the World Bank says the price of the contract for
consultancy services is 'five times what such services would normally cost'.
A World Bank official in Washington confirmed the authenticity of the
document but would not comment further.
KPLC is a state owned company under the Ministry of Energy. The ministry is
tarnished by allegations of corruption during the nine year tenure of Mr
Nicholas Biwott, the disgraced former minister who held the energy portfolio
until November last year.
No such allegations are made against the British company. Last night the
company denied the consultancy fee was excessive in relation to the likely,
final cost of the project.
Mr Biwott was sacked from the cabinet after allegations at a public inquiry
that he had received financial kickbacks from a Swiss consultancy firm and
that he was a prime suspect in the murder in February 1990 of Dr Robert
Ouko, the former foreign minister. He was arrested in connection with the
murder but later released after the police said they could not find enough
evidence to charge him.
Western officials also question the role of Britain's Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD), which is understood to have guaranteed 85 per
cent of the loan. A spokesman for ECGD in London refused to confirm that a
credit has been arranged for the project, but western diplomats and bankers
close to the project insist that the guarantee has been approved. The
Department of Trade and Industry declined to comment.
According to the World Bank document, at least Dollars 28m (Pounds 15.3m)
has already been paid up front to Knight Piesold for a feasibility study -
including site investigation - on the hydroelectric scheme, which is not due
to come on stream for at least another decade. The British company says the
project will be completed earlier.
Western economists believe that a further payment of Dollars 16m will have
to be paid on presentation of the study by the middle of this year.
'The exorbitant cost of this contract together with the high level of
upfront payments . . . even before the feasibility study has been completed,
raises fundamental questions about procurement practices and financial
management,' says the document, drawn up after a special mission to Kenya
last November by the International Development Association, the soft loan
arm of the World Bank.
Knight Piesold says the scheme involves the multi-purpose development of the
Ewaso Ngiro river and includes three separate hydroelectric projects, a
river transfer scheme and an irrigation project. 'At about 12 per cent of
the total estimated cost (of the completed project cost), the consultancy
fee is entirely in line with the norm for work of this nature.'
It adds: 'Within the sum are a number of significant items not related to
consultancy, such as site investigation, survey, environmental impact
studies, financing charges and the construction of access roads - all of
these being essentially front-end costs.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Dixons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 7 per cent jump in Dixons' share price in response to decidedly
poor interim figures is understandable enough. A market starved of good news
from retailers was bound to welcome a 72 per cent rise in UK retailing
profits and talk of an excellent Christmas. Never mind that the increase was
achieved without help from the market place and on a mere 2 per cent
increase in like-for-like volume. Never mind either that it was more than
offset by a dreadful Pounds 11m loss in the US. In the four years since
Dixons hit trouble, the market has always tended to give it the benefit of
the doubt.
There is nevertheless room for irritation with a company which, while
sending in its UK retail team to tackle the mess of a four-year-old US
acquisition, talks blithely of acquiring its way into continental Europe
within the next year or two. The market has generally assumed that because
Dixons was the first retailer into the downturn, it will be the first out.
Yesterday's UK results perhaps confirm that. But it is worth recalling that
even if full year profits for 1992-3 were to rebound smartly to some Pounds
100m - putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 14 - they would only
have returned to their plateau of 1986-88.

FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet again, sterling is living dangerously. Yesterday's rate of DM2.8395 at
4pm London time - when the ERM ceases operation for the day - was the
closest it has been to its effective floor since it joined the system. The
optimist might argue that this does not matter. Since the floor is
determined by the peseta, intervention would presumably be directed at
pushing the peseta lower. Failing that, Spain could reverse the small rise
in overnight rates with which it responded to the latest Bundesbank
increase, thereby moving sterling's floor down by another couple of
pfennigs. If the system can be relied upon in this way, perhaps there is
nothing to worry about. The obvious snag is that in refusing to join its
partners in raising rates, the UK is trying to buck the system in the first
place.

FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Corporate bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If investors really do intend to buy more bonds this year, it makes sense
for companies to seek debt market finance. Yesterday's issues from Tesco and
Southern Electric might thus be the start of another flood of UK corporate
sterling issues in 1992.
The signs are certainly propitious. Not only do utility companies have a
natural appetite for fixed rate borrowings, with their large capital
spending programmes. Low spreads over gilts also mean opportunistic
borrowers like Tesco can swap all - or in yesterday's case part - of the
proceeds into cheap floating rate debt. Companies worried about the
fickleness of today's commercial banking relationships may find even high
real fixed rates worth paying to extend their debt maturities.
Whether new issue volume will exceed last year's record, calculated by the
International Financing Review at Pounds 8.5bn, is another matter. A run of
poor profits and dividend cuts could yet undermine the investor appeal of
corporate bonds. Even so, the prospective volume gives the clearing banks
food for thought. With highly-rated customers securing long-term funds
elsewhere, the quality of their loan books suffers accordingly.

FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: AGF/AMB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The apparent ease with which Assurances Generales de France (AGF) has built
up a 25 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB) must be
highly embarrassing for the German company. AMB has already made a
well-publicised hash of combining banking with insurance, but it is not
exactly the local tradition for shareholders to dash for the exit in this
way.
The deal confirms AGF's reputation as one of the EC's more far-sighted
insurers. The price looks a bargain by comparison with other cross-border
deals, representing an estimated 20 per cent to 30 per cent discount to net
assets. In the process, France's number two composite gets one step closer
to its goal of a major presence in the German market.
The immediate obstacles, of course, are AMB's preference for a European
alliance with the UK's Royal and Fondiaria of Italy and its refusal to
recognise more than 9 per cent of AGF's votes. One possibility is that the
French will ultimately join a four-legged grouping. Friendly deals are
preferred on the continent, and might be in Royal's interest too. Hopes are
already high that the joint venture can improve Royal's solvency margin by
the deconsolidation of its Italian premium income and the exchange of assets
for cash. But given the parlous state of AMB and Fondiaria, the scope for
balance sheet repairs has almost certainly been exaggerated. AGF is stronger
than the others and has much more to offer. But it will only do so on
radically different terms.

FT  09 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: More cracks in British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,467.1 (-15.8)
British Steel's decision to bring forward the closure of its Ravenscraig
plant is open to two interpretations. One is that it was strategically
desirable to act before an election which could return a Labour government.
The other is that the steel market is even worse than expected. Sadly for
the economy at large as well as the company's shareholders, the latter looks
the main motive.
The downturn in Germany, along with economic ferment in Russia and the rest
of eastern Europe, leaves the European market apparently condemned to
chronic oversupply. Even though the redundancy costs are already provided
for, the company faces an accelerated depreciation charge of some Pounds 35m
which will swell this year's loss. It will certainly have to act on its
earlier dividend warning. There must now also be doubts about when the
previous rather generous dividend can be restored, if at all.
British Steel is thus in limbo. It can no longer be classified as an income
stock, but it is far too early for any recovery appeal. The Ravenscraig
closure will eventually produce cost savings of some Pounds 50m, but the
full year effect will not be felt until 1993-94. The shares have already
underperformed the market by nearly 50 per cent over the past year. They may
have further to fall as the last income funds lose heart.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Better Frankfurt than Liverpool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let us suppose that the different states of the US still had their own
currencies, which they had linked together in an exchange rate regime, and
hoped eventually to fuse into a single dollar. Let us go back one step and
assume that there was not yet a Federal Reserve Board, but a series of
regional Feds which had to follow New York. There would then surely be many
vociferous complaints that other states were being forced to accept
excessively high interest rates based on the needs of New York.
Yet in practice Florida, California, Wyoming and the rest might benefit more
from a zone of currency stability than from the ability to have their own
nominal interest rates. And if New York had a good sound money record, the
other states could improve their own anti-inflationary credentials by using
it as an anchor.
This comparison has been provoked by the renewed campaign to cut Britain
free from the strings of the ERM. (The biggest non-surprise of the new year
is the report that Mrs Thatcher has been expressing similar views. It would
be astonishing if she had not been.) Let no one suppose that a mere
realignment - that is, a devaluation within the ERM - would give the UK
freedom to slash interest rates. Rates would still have to stay competitive
with other European centres, plus an additional devaluation risk premium.
Mr Nicholas Ridley believes that the ERM has 'overkilled' UK inflation,
which is now 'zero or even negative'. I only wish this were true. He is
right to say that the retail prices index is misleading; but that is because
it now understates inflation, the underlying rate of which is 5 1/2 to 6 per
cent.
A plausible case can be made that both core and headline inflation will be
down to 3 per cent or less by the end of this year. But we are not there
yet. It would take only a few signs that the UK was once again
devaluation-happy to reignite inflationary psychology.
What is disagreeable about the alarmist talk is the implication that there
is nothing that business and workers can do to help themselves, such as to
stop pricing themselves out of work. In a previous article I instanced the
Ford pay settlement at a rate well above inflation and in defiance of the
glut of workers asking for jobs. So long as this 'going rate' mentality is
prevalent, unemployment will be high whether the UK is on a fixed or
floating exchange rate, inside or outside the ERM, and irrespective of which
party is in power.
Now for another example. I have a friend who has behaved like a textbook
employer, reducing pay in his factory by 10 per cent before contemplating
short time or redundancies. But his cost-cutting efforts have been
undermined by a ground landlord who demands hefty increases under a
five-year rent revision clause, on the assumption that high inflation is
here to stay. My friend has been advised to tell the landlord to jump into a
lake.
These incidents are part of the human friction involved in the transition
from a fixed price (or cost-plus) economy to a flexible price one. The
transition would be stopped in its tracks if the government panicked over
recession - too late in any case to do itself any electoral good.
Incidentally, it does not take much imagination to see how John Smith would
have the government for breakfast if it embarked on any form of devaluation.
One way in which self-correcting economic forces can work in a large
economic area is for the recessionary region to lower its costs and prices
relative to the anchor state. If a monetary policy, decided in New York in
my hypothetical case and Frankfurt in the actual one, were to depress output
in the outlying states, the latter could emerge from recession by improving
their competitiveness and increasing market share.
But would all these efforts be offset by the inability of the outlying
states to reduce interest rates - which would actually rise in real terms if
inflation rates fell? History suggests that they need not be. In the second
half of 1981, in the early stages of UK recovery from the 1981 recession
(and when Sir Alan Walters was advising Mrs Thatcher at No 10), base rates
had to be jerked sharply upwards in reaction to monetary tightening in the
US; and they did not return to their starting point until July 1982.
Moreover, because of dropping inflation, real UK interest rates rose even
more sharply, and increased further in 1982-83.
Yet these developments did not prevent a recovery in British output starting
in the middle of 1981 and gathering force in 1982-83. High real interest
rates are compatible with economic recovery, even though they are hardly
welcome; and the period of negative real interest rates in the mid-1970s was
a gloomy one for growth.
If the calls to slash interest rates, irrespective of the exchange rate
consequences, were coming from unreconstructed Keynesians, I could
understand. What is difficult to take is when they come from economists such
as the 'Liverpool Six', headed by Prof Patrick Minford, many of whom claim
in their academic capacity that the main influence of monetary policy is
over inflation and any effects on output and jobs are transitory. Indeed
Minford himself is known for his belief in both 'rational expectations' and
'new classical' doctrines.
What these doctrines were supposed to mean, unless I totally misunderstood
them, was that output and employment could only be influenced by surprise
changes in macroeconomic policy, and that the real economy would soon adjust
to any stable monetary policy regime, once that was credible and understood.
Within this method of thinking, the debate between using a fixed exchange
rate against a low-inflation country and relying on internal monetary rules,
was a second order one in which reasonable monetarists could disagree with
each other, and the answer might depend on circumstances of time and place.
Now all these teachings have been thrown out of the window as the Liverpool
Six outbid the crudest Keynesians in their calls for reflation.
The fundamental question is how worried we should be that monetary policy
throughout Europe is increasingly decided by the Bundesbank. I can think of
a good many worse bodies to decide it. The implication, so resented in the
Thatcherite camp, is that businessmen and workers in Britain , as in most
other European countries, should be so intimately affected by the
Bundesbank's efforts to contain the inflationary impact of German unity.
In the words of CS First Boston Economics: 'That in turn makes the coming
German wage round assume trans-continental importance. Whether German unions
know it or not, their irresponsible demands are pricing British, French,
Italian and Spanish workers out of jobs. The Bundesbank is only helping to
make it crystal clear to all the political leaders of the EC. So whether the
German unions like it or not, and they clearly don't, they will be under
immense outside pressure to settle for wage increases near the 5 per cent
level they currently say is unacceptable. And employers seem ready for
strikes . . .
'We think it highly likely the unions will lose out, and thus there may be
room for the Bundesbank to take the first cautious step towards easing
surprisingly early in the second quarter . . . and German short rates may
move rather more than the markets expect by year-end - probably to somewhere
near 8 per cent.'
I am sure that CSFB is right about the causality and hope that it is right
about the outcome. There is in any case no way that British policy can
escape the impact of events on the Continent. The ERM supplies a coherent
framework and a device for ensuring that we obtain some counter-inflationary
benefits from it.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Letter: A drastic, but workable way to create a market
system in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRINSLEY BEST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Lloyd's article (December 31) on the freeing of prices in Russia
calls the measure 'a cruel necessity'. He also states that prices are
'certain to rise by threefold or more' as a result.
Even so, Yeltsin's price liberalisation need not fail. At the start of
'perestroika', the black market was not all that significant. By 1988, it
was estimated to be about 100bn roubles out of total household disposable
income of about 560bn roubles. This would be about 20 per cent of the value
of sales and less than 10 per cent of the volume at then prevailing price
differentials.
In 1991, the value of black market sales could be about 25 per cent of total
consumer expenditure, and perhaps a little over 10 per cent of volume, the
total of which may have declined through shortages.
Rampant inflation is not inevitable. If the two-tier market is abolished
then the average price for the two markets should prevail. After some
adjustments, perhaps to soften the blow for the 'mafia', ordinary prices
might rise by about 20 per cent, while falls of between 40 and 60 per cent
should be seen in prices charged on the black market.
This all assumes the renewed assertion of control over the printing of
roubles. This done - and automatic inflation adjustment of certain wages
stopped - the rouble could quickly rise on the free market, thus reducing
the utility of the massive amount of hard currency already in circulation,
estimated at USDollars 20bn, or about 2,000bn roubles at the free market
exchange rate, compared with the official figure of annual disposable income
in 1989 of 652bn roubles.
Ukraine's and other republics' objections to all this are quite
understandable. At end-September 1991, the price of beef and eggs and many
other foodstuffs on the free market in Moscow was two to three times higher
than in Kiev or Voronezh. Tomatoes and certain fruits cost about four times
more in Moscow than in the Caucasian republics.
Price liberalisation in Russia will automatically attract more produce to
Moscow and St Petersburg, even through the 'official' channels, to the
extent that transport permits. In addition, if Russia controls the printing
presses, it can deny roubles to other republics, thus making it difficult
for them to buy their own produce. Hence, the urgency which Ukraine attaches
to introducing its own coupons and, eventually, currency.
Yes, the measures may seem cruel, but they are a long way from the forced
confiscation of food from the countryside under 'war communism', and from
collectivisation. Though drastic, they may prove to be the only workable and
humane solution to avoid social unrest and to build a genuine market system
in the shortest time, provided those on the lowest incomes are assured
supplies.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Tory prospects in tatters: Scotland will show its wrath at
the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a cruel political irony that the privatised British Steel, one of the
proudest creations of the Conservative government, should have delivered
what could be the coup de grace to Tory election hopes in Scotland.
As it prepared to shut the remains of its Ravenscraig complex two years
ahead of schedule, Mr Lang, the Scottish secretary, was left with a
difficult task. All he could do yesterday was to promise more funds and an
enterprise zone for the regeneration of Lanarkshire, and ask, almost
certainly in vain, that British Steel explain to the Scottish public the
full commercial reasoning behind its decision.
For the past four years ministers could at least parade the commitment which
the Conservatives extracted from British Steel chairman Sir Robert Scholey
in 1987 that steel-making at Ravenscraig would continue to 1994, 'subject to
market conditions'. Now Sir Robert has ruthlessly swept aside that slender
piece of the government's protection from the wrath of Scottish voters.
Many Scots will see the shutdown as the inevitable result of Tory economic
policies which, in their eyes, have undermined Scottish manufacturing. More
broadly, it will reinforce their conviction that the government does not
care about Scotland.
This perception has grown over the past 10 years. But Ravenscraig owes its
survival through the 1980s to the Tories. In the early part of the decade,
Sir George Younger, the then Scottish secretary, insisted that the
state-owned British Steel did not close it. The plant always posed a dilemma
for the party, however: it was not on a coastal site for easy transport and
most of its main Scottish steel users, such as car makers, had disappeared.
Its supporters refused to recognise these inescapable facts.
Labour politicians, trade unionists and the Scottish media invested the
plant with a symbolism it never merited, often based on muddled and romantic
thinking of the kind expressed in 1990 by the Scottish rock singer Pat Kane,
who said: 'If Scotland wants to have a 21st century manufacturing future it
needs to have a Ravenscraig. It is regarded as a link to our manufacturing
past.'
That link was shattered in May 1990 when Sir Robert declared that
Ravenscraig's hot strip mill was to close. The Conservatives at last began
trying to convince the Scots that they should look to an economic future
beyond steel-making. Consultants who were asked to examine the options for
steel-making in Scotland, stated bleakly that there were virtually none.
In the past year Scottish politicians have at last been able to discuss the
future of Lanarkshire after steel without automatically being accused of
defeatism. The mood among steel workers and local people in Motherwell
yesterday was one of dignified resignation, unlike the anger of May 1990.
For Mr Lang that is about the only favourable thing to emerge. The boost to
the Tories' standing in the Scottish opinion polls which followed the
departure of Mrs Margaret Thatcher in November 1990 has almost completely
evaporated and the party is now back at about 20 per cent.
The disastrous performance of the party in the Kincardine and Deeside
by-election in the autumn, where a Tory majority of 2,000 was turned into a
Liberal Democrat one of almost 8,000, was a reminder that the party is
identified as the English party, imposing unpopular measures such as the
poll tax that only a minority of Scots voted for. Since then, the party has
been on the ropes.
Opinion polls suggest that the Tories could lose five of the nine Scottish
seats (out of a total of 72) which they still hold. Mr Lang could lose his
seat in Galloway.
By his timing Sir Robert has ensured that it is the Tories who will take
almost all the blame for Ravenscraig; an incoming Labour government would
find little left to save, a point that may have occurred to him. Since it
was the Conservatives under Prime Minister Harold Macmillan who created
Ravenscraig, that may be poetic justice.

A plea for political stability from George Inge, chairman of Savills, the
upper crust firm of estate agents which reported another loss yesterday and
passed its dividend again. The current housing slump is the worst Inge can
remember in his 30 years in the business and he shudders at the thought of
what the return of a Labour government might do to his wealthy clients.
According to Savills, central London house prices have fallen by 16.5 per
cent from their 1989 peak, while country house prices have fallen by 15.4
per cent. Traditionally, the London market gets hit first and recovers
first, and Inge sees the same thing happening again. Although his firm is
seeing increasing numbers of repossessions at the upper end of the market,
the good news for clients is that forced sales are 'making vendors more
realistic about asking prices'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With three months to go before the tenth anniversary of the Falklands War,
Britain's Channel 4 has fired the opening shot in what looks like being a
fierce ratings battle. The subject - the most comprehensive account of
Britain's conflict with Argentina . . . and there could be casualties.
Channel 4, whose four-part documentary starts next Monday, has Admiral Sir
Henry Leach, a former sea lord, accusing former defence minister Sir John
Knott of 'making a howling cock-up' of defence policy in the run-up to the
war.
In order to spike the opposition's guns it has taken the precaution of
getting agreement from a host of retired admirals, generals, and senior
diplomats, including former UN ambassador Sir Nicholas Henderson, not to
talk to any other channel until after the anniversary.
Nevertheless, at least another four Falklands programmes are planned by the
rival channels in what could prove to be a scheduling nightmare in an
election year. The BBC is not taking up the suggestion of Sir Bernard
Ingham, Mrs Thatcher's former press secretary, to screen a pro-Thatcher
Falklands play.
Meanwhile, details of Mrs Thatcher's role in the anniversary celebrations
remain under wraps. She refused to sign any contract with Channel 4.
Wouldn't it be interesting if she resurfaced on the Beeb?

Are you keeping your shrink informed? Joan Weill, wife of Sandy, Primerica

Her husband, the former number two at American Express, had confided his

This week the said shrink, narrowly escaping prison for his insider dealing,

One of the troubles with a small place like Wales is the shortage of
politically-correct movers and shakers. When the rulers in London want to
fill a slot with a Welsh figure, the same old names pop up.
Take the case of Gwyn Jones, a 43-year-old entrepreneur who sold his
software company in 1987. One of former Welsh secretary Peter Walker's
blue-eyed boys, Jones was made part-time chairman of the Welsh Development
Agency in 1988 and after his recent reappointment his WDA workload was
increased to four days a week.
However, he has now added the Welsh BBC governorship to his portfolio, which
carries with it the chairmanship of the Broadcasting Council for Wales and
membership of the Welsh Channel 4 network. Add all the tasks together and
even Jones the computer is not capable of working eight days a week.
Jones is now going to shed some of his international workload at the WDA to
take on his new responsibilities at the Beeb. Even so his appointment does
nothing to reduce the concern within the principality at the concentration
of top jobs in such a small number of hands.
Come the election it could all be different. Different faces that is. . .

FT  09 JAN 92 / Passing of an industrial symbol: In closing Ravenscraig,
British Steel hopes to rid itself once and for all of political interference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Sir Robert Scholey retires this summer as British Steel's chairman,
Scotland is unlikely to be his first choice for a holiday.
Over the past two years, Sir Robert has been vilified by Scottish
industrialists, trade unionists and community leaders for presiding over
British Steel's strategic withdrawal from steelmaking in Scotland. The
retreat turned into a rout yesterday when the company announced it would
close the last two blast furnaces at its complex at Ravenscraig in Scotland
by September this year.
Two factors lie behind the Ravenscraig closure. The first is British Steel's
attempt to overcome the historic fragmentation of the UK steel industry
which has left it with smaller and less economic plants than its best
European competitors.
This fragmentation has left Ravenscraig particularly vulnerable to the
second factor: a savage decline in the steel market in the last two years
which has forced the privatised British Steel into a desperate fight to
maintain its financial performance.
For many Scots, Ravenscraig is a symbol of the nation's industrial strength.
For British Steel, the plant is a symbol of the political and managerial
obstacles which have hampered the modernisation of the industry throughout
the post-war period.
Critics of the closure argue that it spells the end of hopes of an
independent Scottish manufacturing industry. British Steel is hoping it
marks the end of an era in which commercial decisions have been undermined
by political expediency.
It was 1959 when Harold Macmillan, the then Conservative prime minister,
forced the then private-sector steel industry to establish two hot strip
rolling mills instead of the one that was required: one in Ravenscraig, near
Glasgow, and the other in Llanwern in south Wales. The plan was that each
plant would provide the hub of an area with steel tube and plate plants
supplying factories for ships, buses, cars and other products.
Ravenscraig drained the finances of Colville, its private owner, so much
that it helped to push the industry towards nationalisation in 1967. Yet
political pressures meant that British Steel had to stand by its Scottish
plant.
Doubts about the future of the Scottish industry had long been raised but
became insistent with the privatisation of British Steel in 1988; the bell
really tolled from May 1990 when the company announced plans to close the
hot strip rolling mill with the loss of 770 jobs. Then, in November that
year it announced the closure of its Clydesdale tube works with 1,200 job
losses. The future of the other big Scottish plant, the Dalzell plate mill,
has been in question since last July when the company said it planned to
invest in a new mill at Lackenby on Teesside, north-eastern England.
Bereft of a strip mill to roll and finish the steel, Ravenscraig's three
blast furnaces were increasingly forlorn, making crude slabs for British
Steel plants in south Wales and for sale on the open market. The first blast
furnace closed last year with the loss of 1,200 jobs. The final two will
close no later than September with the loss of a further 1,250 jobs.
The immediate reason for the Ravenscraig closure is the price war in the
stagnating European steel market. UK steel production, which fell by 8 per
cent last year to 16.5m tonnes, is forecast to drop to 16m tonnes this year,
according to MEPS, the Sheffield-based steel consultants.
The steep fall in steel prices has been even more troubling. Last month hot
dip galvanised steel was selling for Pounds 260 a tonne, 32.5 per cent down
from its 1989 peak, while hot rolled coil could be bought for Pounds 170 a
tonne, a cut of about 28 per cent.
With steel demand falling as a result of slower economic growth in Germany,
France and Italy, British Steel will gain no relief from the fierce
competition which drove its UK market share down from 64 per cent in 1990 to
a low of 55 per cent last year.
The deterioration of the steel market has taken a heavy toll on a company
which in the late 1980s was held up as a symbol for the resurgence of
British industry. Its pre-tax profits for the six months to last September
fell 78 per cent to just Pounds 19m. Mr Ewan Fraser, a steel analyst at
stockbroker James Capel, forecasts it will make a loss of Pounds 80m-Pounds
100m for the year, including the exceptional costs of Pounds 30m for
shutting Ravenscraig.
The closure is central to British Steel's hopes of stemming the haemorrhage.
It should cut the company's costs by at least Pounds 100m a year.
In the long run it is unlikely this is the end of British Steel's attempt to
reshape itself. It wants to concentrate production at two sites - its
Llanwern-Port Talbot complex in south Wales, and Teesside - to gain the
economies of scale it needs to match its largest continental competitors,
Usinor Sacilor in France and Thyssen in Germany.
There will be further job cuts - 5,000 went in the six months to September,
leaving 47,000 - and tight control of investment. The company disclosed
yesterday that it has postponed a planned Pounds 100m investment to install
a second continuous caster at Llanwern.
The Ravenscraig closure marks two other, potentially more significant,
developments that are reshaping the British steel industry. The first is its
shift from a national focus to a European one. Ravenscraig was built as part
of a national industrial strategy to stimulate Scottish manufacturing. It is
being closed because it cannot survive in an increasingly competitive
European market.
When the strip mill closed, only 4 per cent of Ravenscraig's steel went into
the Scottish economy. A small plant with capacity of only 2m tonnes, it is
500 miles away from the main continental markets. In contrast 50 per cent of
customers for Thyssen, the mighty German producer, are within 100km of its
main plant near Duisburg, which has a capacity of 10m tonnes a year.
The real weakness of the British steel industry is the weakness of its
customer base, British manufacturing industry. The solution can only be
further internationalisation of its markets.
The second long-term shift in the industry lies in the balance of power
between the public and the private sectors. Ravenscraig is being closed
because British Steel is now a private-sector company able to take its own
commercial decisions. But the pressures it is under come in part from
public-sector steel companies elsewhere in the European Community - some of
which, in France, Italy and Belgium for example, are cushioned from falling
prices by indirect government subsidies.
Ravenscraig has always epitomised the troubles of the British steel
industry; its demise is a symbol for the troubles besetting the industry all
over Europe.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Raven croaks at Motherwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE Mr Harold Macmillan announced, in 1959, that a major steel
industry investment should be divided between Scotland and Wales on regional
policy grounds, the position of the Ravenscraig steel works has been a
matter of controversy and doubt. In the 1960s, the steel industry needed
consolidation on appropriate sites, not further politically motivated
fragmentation.
To most observers in the last two decades, the plant, near Motherwell in
central Scotland, has appeared doomed. With the loss of the nearby Linwood
and Bathgate vehicle manufacturing industries, central Scotland could offer
neither local raw materials nor local markets. British Steel, privatised in
the 1980s, and chasing world-class costs and productivity, has in recent
years not bothered to conceal its ultimate intention for Ravenscraig.
Although none of this has quietened Scottish political passions on the
subject, even influential voices in Lanarkshire have in the last year urged
recognition of reality, since a government-commissioned report by management
consultants Arthur D Little underscored the weakness of Scotland's claim to
a place in world steelmaking.
None of this alters the fact that the loss of thousands more jobs in
Ravenscraig represents a local economic catastrophe. To some extent, those
Scottish politicians who have done most to overstate Ravenscraig's claims to
a future have made the problems of transition worse.
No duplicity
Equally, British Steel has not helped in the last two or three years by
refusing to make more explicit the economic case against Ravenscraig. The
company cannot, however, fairly be accused of duplicity over the timing of
yesterday's announcement. It had long said that its preferred closure date
of 1994 was subject to market conditions; the faltering UK economic recovery
is presumably precisely what British Steel feared when it entered the
caveat. It should go without saying that there is no case for compelling
British Steel to act against its own commercial best judgment.
The main lesson of Ravenscraig, therefore, is that neither a country's nor a
local community's long-term interests are served by politically inspired
investment decisions. With a Labour government possible by July (or
earlier), the point is worth re-stating.
Blind eye
The point is also depressingly germane in the context of a European
Community which continues, for all the most persuasive but self-destructive
political reasons, to turn a blind eye to steel industry subventions in a
number of member countries. Last year's EC approval of a FFr2.5bn (Pounds
260m) injection by the state-controlled bank, Credit Lyonnais, to Usinor
Sacilor, is but the latest and most blatant example. The fact that it
cleared the commission's competition directorate only demonstrates the
institutional weakness of EC competition policy.
Sacked Ravenscraig workers can therefore justly resent not only the chronic
misjudgments and shiftiness of UK politicians, but also the double standards
which are too easily tolerated in Brussels. German steelworkers displaced by
the current merger wave running through their industry are in the same boat.
The Community evidently needs to rationalise production in big industries
such as steel, motors and airlines on the basis of performance and
competitive advantage if powerful competitive challenges from outside the
community are to be met. But the Twelve have yet to discover the political
will to construct a de-politicised competition policy of the kind needed to
ensure that market forces are allowed to work.
The only other thing to be written in the Ravenscraig epitaph is that there
was never a community more deserving of EC and UK government help in
rebuilding its local economy. Ravenscraig's workforce has been loyal,
hardworking and as efficient as the plant permitted. It has every right to
expect politicians to move whatever bureaucratic obstacles stand in the way
of measures to stimulate the creation of jobs in industries more suited to
the periphery of Europe.

American cinema prohibition-era gangsters rear up at us as if they were
knickerbockered Borgias and a crumbling early-century department store can
seem as romance-haunted as a castle.
The films are Billy Bathgate and Liebestraum. You never saw such attempts to
make 60 years ago look like 600. In Billy Bathgate, scripted by Tom Stoppard
from EL Doctorow's novel about mobster Dutch Schultz, director Robert Benton
lays on the peeling posters and dingy-floral wallpaper. History is already
antiquing his characters as they live and speak. And in Liebestraum, an
essay in American Gothic from Britain's Mike Figgis (Stormy Monday, Internal
Affairs), the old high-street store in Elderstown has seen more terrors and
tragedies than the Palace of Versailles under a string of Louis's.
The problem with glamorising the past is that when a film is under-energised
mythologisation becomes 'museumisation'. Billy Bathgate is like a story in a
glass case. Where Doctorow's tour-de-force novel was a nervy, ironised
memoir of the gangster era, narrated in a precipitate pastiche of fine
writing by the boy hero who joins the Schultz gang and witnesses its
terrors, Benton's film is like a costume try-out by actors waiting for a
script. Worst casualty is Dustin Hoffman as Dutch. Tuxedo'd to the nines, he
struts and frets in his period strait-jacket, seeking the key of life to a
character whom his director has already locked away in a case marked Mythic
Mobster.
Scenes that horrified in the book - a concrete-shod gang member pushed to
his death off a boat, a fire inspector battered to death, Billy himself
given a bloody nose to camouflage the murder-stains on a hotel carpet - here
become picture-book pages from history. Nothing touches us: least of all
Loren Dean's performance as Billy, all bland generic innocence with no sense
of shocked individuality or scarring insights.
Everything, one suspects, was wrong about this project from the start. It
was produced by Disney, whose first instinct with the past is to turn it
into a theme park. It was written by the cerebral Stoppard when it needed a
scenarist of the visceral. And it was directed by Benton, whose best films
from Bonnie And Clyde (screenplay) to Kramer Vs Kramer and Places Of The
Heart have dealt with plain folk quirkily thrown into crisis. Nothing is
plain about the folk in Billy Bathgate: stunted, horrifically mediocre, the
blind leading the blinded.
Liebestraum has more life, but it is hard to define that life. In a Mike
Figgis film the visual background is a stroboscopic tapestry - shifting
shadows and blobs or shards of light - and the 'music', composed by himself,
consists of brooding electronic hums and throbs. If Antonioni had ever been
hit over the head and brought to Hollywood to make thrillers, he might have
made Liebestraum.
He would certainly be on a wavelength with its plot. Architectural writer
Nick (Kevin Anderson), visiting Elderstown, runs into ex-schoolfriend Paul
(Bill Pullman), a property developer who is demolishing the historic
iron-frame Ralston Department Store, the 'missing link in American
architecture.' Paul's wife (Pamela Gidley) completes the edgy love triangle
and shadows from the past rise up or spill advice from hospital deathbeds
(Kim Novak as Nick's mother).
For half an hour we might be watching La Notte done as a Hollywood
no-brainer. But even as the plot thickens and the daftnesses grow - spooky
mannequins in the midnight store, the town freak revealed as the town's
heir-to-power, a scene in a brothel that makes Twin Peaks look like
Pollyanna - Liebestraum casts its bizarre spell. As in Internal Affairs,
Figgis dives into the dark spaces between dialogue lines as if seeking the
lost secrets of silent cinema, when images spoke more than words. And unlike
Billy Bathgate, where the past becomes a mausoleum for the narrative, the
past here is a hunting ground for guilts and mysteries, where the last-scene
revelation lies crouched in hiding, ready to ambush.
Bertrand Blier's Merci La Vie begins as a shock-therapy black comedy in the
style of his Tenue De Soiree. A girl in a bride's dress (Anouk Grinberg) is
kicked to the ground by a man who then drives off; another girl (Charlotte
Gainsbourg) picks her up and befriends her; soon they are both picking up
men and seducing them as if on a two-woman campaign to reverse the
hunter-and-hunted roles in human sexuality.
Grinberg, it transpires is a VD-carrier out to fell men with disease under
the guidance of Dr Gerard Depardieu, a mad medico keen to increase his
work-load. A film whose opening imagery evoked Truffaut's The Bride Wore
Black shades into something more brutal and modernist: The Bride Brought
Clap, directed by Blier as if he were pushing us through life's emergency
wards on a runaway trolley.
Indeed we soon freewheel into total confusion. As if the screen were not
already alternating between colour and monochrome for no known reason, the
film begins to hop between decades.
We are in the present; we are in Nazi-occupied France. Mlle Gainsbourg is
alive today; she is alive at the same age 50 years ago ('Is this what they
call a flashback?' she asks). Jean-Louis Trintignant and Michel Blanc pop up
in cameos. Miss Grinberg levitates after sex. And there are Pirandellian
games with a camera crew on the oh-it's-all-only-an-illusion model. By the
close of what began as a sly comedy of sexual subversion, we feel we have
strayed into an end-of-series orgy for the cast and crew of Dr Who.
British cinema can be such a contrast to these deliriums. The Bridge, shot
with the gilded buttery glow of a TV commercial, speculates on what happened
to the impressionist painter John Wilson Steer (David O'Hara) during the
summer of 1887. At the end of his hols on the Suffolk coast he painted 'The
Bridge', a shimmering picture of a young woman with her back to us talking
to a gaunt man on a wooden bridge near the sea.
The artist fell in love with Saskia Reeves is what happened, according to
director Syd Macartney and screenwriter Adrian Hodge, adapting Maggie
Hemingway's novel. And Miss Reeves, loving him back, fought with her
conscience and her husband (Anthony Higgins). We the audience drowse through
two hours of genteel, tinkly romance while the flower of British character
acting - Joss Ackland, Rosemary Harris, Geraldine James - droops on the
window-sill.
One sometimes believes the world of British cinema has stopped turning since
Brief Encounter. The Bridge is prim, easy-on-the-eye and vacuously wistful:
a Merchant-Ivory film made by a team without M-I's talent and for whom the
past is a foreign country where everyone speaks with a far-away look as if
scanning subtitles.
The rest of the week is worth dashing through at high speed, holding one's
coat over one's head. VI Warshawski (15, Odeon Haymarket) has the stylish
Kathleen Turner in a soggy crime thriller drawn from Sara Paretsky's
woman-detective novels.
The local colour (Chicago) is thickly laid on as the smoke-voiced Miss T
croaks out her one-liners. Unfortunately this is one of those films where
everyone has a smart answer but no one has thought to bring a smart
question.
Year Of The Gun (15, Cannons West End)is worse: a thick-eared Italo-American
action thriller centred on the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro. Star and
former brat-packer Andrew McCarthy flexes his two known expressions -
constipated and more constipated - while John Frankenheimer directs.
Hello Hemingway (ICA, no cert), a first feature from Cuba's Fernando Perez,
is sweet but small-voiced. In 1950s Havana, on the eve of revolution,
penurious young Laurita (Laura de la Uz) hopes to win a place at an American
university, with or without help from her rich neighbour E. Hemingway. Will
she succeed? The suspense is bearable. We keep watching thanks to fine
period evocation and the bubbly naturalism of Miss de la Uz.

Thomas Chatterton was an extreme example of the phenomenon of doomed youth.
When he died, by his own hand in 1770 at the age of 17, the precocious
Bristolian was the author of a series of pseudo-medieval poems and a forged
correspondence involving a 15th century monk which was so convincing that it
kept the scholars quarrelling for years. According to Keats, who dedicated
Endymion to him, he was 'the purest writer in the English language'. To
Wordsworth, he was 'The marvellous boy/ The sleepless soul that perished in
his pride.'
Hence the title of this show, which paints Chatterton as not marvellous at
all but a tittering, capricious whelp, not unlike Peter Shaffer's portrayal
of that other prodigy, Mozart, in Amadeus, but without the scatology.
To a certain extent Public Parts have a point. The conception of Chatterton
today is dominated by the Henry Wallis painting of 1856, which shows a
Byronic youth trailing decorously over the edge of his deathbed. The fact
that his death, by poisoning, would certainly not have been decorous
presents an intriguing counterpoint to his enshrinement in the romantic
imagination.
In their attempt to get to grips with Chatterton, this Bristol-based company
confronts his family after his death - his widowed mother, his passionate
and embittered sister and, most bizarrely, his paternal grandmother (played
by a man), whose senile delusions are seen as tracking into the precocious
fantasies of her two grandchildren.
This then is a play about the power politics of the imagination. The thesis
is that the fictitious Thomas Rowley was the creation of the childhood games
of Thomas and his sister Mary. He, being a boy, was sent to charity school;
she, being a girl, was not, so it was he who acquired the skills to make
something of the fiction.
Rowley is represented as a spirit invoked by the two children in a local
church; a cappella singing of latin masses sets a quasi-mystical scene as
ancient figures are conjured from their tombs into recitations in
middle-English.
This does not, of course, explain how a teenage boy living in the mid-18th
century came to master medieval language. More seriously, it is hard to
suspend disbelief far enough to admit Tim Crouch's Thomas, who is
bumptiously unappealing in his assumption of childish moods and mannerisms.
Julia Limer's production is simply not strong enough to carry off the
inversions that lead to a boy who looks years older than his mother (Carrie
Wale) and a grandmother (Luke Williams) who seems designed to keep the whole
piece on the level of travesty.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Arts: Royal Academy pins its hopes on Mantegna and revamps
the summer show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If I had to destroy the work of Monet or Mantegna, I would definitely
choose that of Monet' said that arch modernist Norman Rosenthal, exhibitions
secretary of the Royal Academy yesterday. I am sure he means it, but it also
makes good business sense.
Last year was the best ever, financially, for the RA, with a profit of
almost Pounds 1.5m thanks mainly to the record number of 1.3m visitors, half
of whom were drawn to just one show, the Monet. The 658,000 pairs of feet
managed to wear out the stair carpet. They also spent lavishly in the shop
and restaurant, and bought 65,000 catalogues.
This year's exhibition programme includes no such outstanding shows, apart
from that devoted to Mantegna which opens on January 17, thanks to
sponsorship by Olivetti. This outstanding, wayward, artist of the Italian
Renaissance bears the burden of ensuring that the RA has another good year.
The appearance in the show of eight of his nine canvases of the 'Triumphs of
Caesar', the undoubted masterpiece of his career, which entered to the Royal
Collection in 1629, should ensure a good attendance, but the RA is
optimistic if it imagines that this Old Master can capture the popular
imagination in the manner of an Impressionist.
The other interesting exhibitions are those devoted to the Impressionist
Sisley (July), whose reputation has long been over shadowed by his
contemporaries; Sickert (November), the greatest British post-Impressionist
who has not received a serious show for 30 years; and a display of Tibetan
art, stretching back over 1,000 years, in September.
President Sir Roger de Grey announced changes in its most established
institution, the Summer Show. Honorary foreign RAs, like Robert Diebenkorn,
are to be invited to exhibit in an attempt to raise standards. Although
around 12,000 works are submitted for the Show, very few contributions by
amateur artists are accepted. Sir Roger sees the Show as offering young
professional artists a chance.
Other shows this year are devoted to Alexander Calder, creator of the mobile
and the RA Tom Phillips. Next year there will be major exhibitions of
British watercolourists between 1750-1860; a Pissarro show; and one devoted
to 20th century American art.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Arts: Dinner Dance - Lyric, Hammersmith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unsubtle and coarse in several ways, the dance-theatre group The Kosh is
well named. In this two-act Dinner Dance, writer David Pownall and
choreographer-director Sian Williams treat a group of seven characters from
two contrasting angles, neither of them rewarding.
Act One is 'A Slice of Life,' in which we follow the lives of three couples
and a female despatch rider in brief scenes, soap-opera style, all set in
the same kitchen. A working wife grows tired of her unemployed husband and
his hopes of starting a family. A bible-freak ('Well, at the moment you rang
I was reading the Psalms of David') dates a black girl. Two gay lovers break
up ('Being a junk jewellery salesman does have its limitations'). Don't ask
about the girl cyclist. For emotional depth or psychological penetration,
this all scores less than Acorn Antiques.
Most scenes are spiced with mime-dance-acrobatic ingredients. I guess this
is meant to suggest the intensity of the things left unsaid, but in practice
it makes each character look (a) phoney (b) melodramatic (c) narcissistic.
One gay man replying to his lover: (pirouette across the kitchen, backbend
over a work-surface) 'I can't trust you to do anything for me]' Bible freak
to his black chick: 'You look' (is suddenly lifted high in the air by two
unseen men) 'terrific]' And the way characters keep making entrances and
exits from or into the fridge or kitchen cupboards is a hoot.
Act Two is called 'Throw Caution to the Wind.' Here the seven characters
(and their poor accompanying 'cellist) are dressed in harnesses, kneepads
and not a lot else. It looks like a bad bondage party. The music (thanks,
Howard J. Davidson) is standard soft-core rock - stuff to energise to. I
imagine that what occurs here is an attempt at transcendent lyricism
modelled on the famous 'Golden Section' in Twyla Tharp's 1981 The Catherine
Wheel. But, whatever its concept, it is fatally constricted by the
deliberately strenuous, crude movement style.
The dancers stamp athletically and do a few acrobatic feats, but they look
even more tense and self-conscious than in Act One, and they maximise the
effort involved. The eventual image is one of totalitarian perversion,
marked by competitive aggression. Then they chant a finale: 'I. I want. I
need . . . Ever am I alone with you, and thou, and she, and him, and her and
me.' The singing is as strenuous as the movement; half the performers sound
hoarse.
Nothing about this performance cheered me, but I must mention the overall
Kosh features that are most depressing. Dinner Dance is so straitjacketed by
its own effortful manner that it never makes clear what kind of social
comment it intends. Is Act Two supposed to show the same characters,
conflicts and problems as Act One? Or does it hope to express a lyrical
release in which ordinary social character is forgotten? Impossible to say,
because neither is achieved. Sadder yet is the brutalising effect that this
kind of show has on its executants. Any kind of refinement - technical or
spiritual - is out of place here.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Management: Bouquets that are not to be sniffed at - Philip
Rawstorne visits Chateau Latour, where prestige has a higher priority than
profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chateau Latour is one of the ultimate brands, says Michael Jackaman,
chairman of Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks and food group, which owns the
Bordeaux premier cru.
'For 300 years, Latour has been a benchmark of quality. Its reputation
enhances our entire drinks portfolio. It spells out Allied's long-term
commitment to international premium brands. It is the jewel in the crown.'
It was for its prestige rather than its profitability that Allied acquired
Latour in 1988, paying Pounds 58m to add the 53 per cent shareholding of
Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, to the 25 per cent it already
owned. It has since increased its stake to 95 per cent.
Jackaman admits that such an investment would have been difficult to justify
on a more basic calculation of return on capital. Despite the fact that a
dozen bottles of Latour's 1961 vintage would fetch about Pounds 5,000, the
Medoc estate - whose value has now risen to about Pounds 160m - makes annual
profits of only Pounds 5m.
The prime objective in managing the brand, therefore, is to maintain and
improve its reputation for excellence; to ensure that it retains its place
alongside, if not ahead of, its rival first-growths, Chateau Lafite, Chateau
Margaux, and Chateau Haut-Brion.
Financial returns are readily sacrificed to maintain the quality of the
wine, says David Orr, director of the estate, who previously ran Allied's
fine wine business in the US.
Grapes for the grand vin come only from vines grown in the 100 acres of
gravelly soil that comprised the original 700-years-old estate overlooking
the Gironde. This is the terroir - the French word that encompasses the
area's soil, sub-soil, drainage, aspect and micro-climate - which gives the
wine its singular, slow-maturing savour.
Only the grapes from vines that are more than 10 years old are used and
fruiting is restrained to improve quality by severe pruning and by thinning
the bunches of green grapes in July.
Selective picking at harvest time ensures that any grapes judged unfit for
the grand vin are used with fruit from younger vines and those in the
outlying areas of the estate to make a second wine, Les Forts de Latour, and
sometimes a third, classed simply as Pauillac. Les Forts fetches half the
price of the grand vin and Pauillac, half the price of Les Forts. Rigorous
control of quality continues during fermentation - in the first stainless
steel vats to be used in the Medoc - and afterwards in the blending. The
result is that, even in the best of years, Latour produces no more than
20,000 cases of grand vin.
The wine is sold in the year after the vintage while it is beginning its
maturation in new barrels of French oak. 'It is like selling a future,' says
Orr. 'The wine will not be ready for drinking for 20 years. For the buyers,
it represents an enormous act of faith.'
The price at which it is offered takes account of the quality of the vintage
and economic conditions, particularly in the main markets, the UK and US.
The 1990 vintage was offered last year at Pounds 22-Pounds 25 a bottle. 'We
try to lead the market in a responsible way,' Orr says. 'The health of the
entire Bordeaux business is important to us.'
There is no difficulty in finding buyers. The spread of international
markets, from Austria to Japan, helps to offset any problems in any one
country. 'The key for a first growth,' says Orr, 'is not in selling but in
selling well'.
Allied has only limited control over marketing and distribution because of
the French government's concern that it should not by-pass the
long-established channels through Bordeaux merchants.
But it has modified the process. It retains 15-20 per cent of the vintage
each year, building stocks that can be sold in years, say, when frost cuts
production, as in 1991.
The wine is sold to only half of the 120 Bordeaux negociants; the amounts
allotted to individual merchants are limited; and the chateau sells direct
to a number of wine importers.
Though Latour's claims as one of the world's great wines were first
proclaimed in the UK in advertisements in the early 1700s, the chateau no
longer advertises its product.
Its reputation is fostered discreetly and conservatively, but with some
vigour. 'The wine has to be seen in the right places - the best restaurants,
Oxbridge colleges, London clubs,' Orr says. It is sold direct to the Elysee
palace and the British embassy in Paris and was served at the recent G7
dinner for Mikhail Gorbachev in London.
One exclusive tasting is arranged in Britain each year; and last year 324
magnums of vintages ranging from 1961 to 1988, worth Dollars 250,000, were
tastefully presented at a New York gathering of wine buffs.
'It is important to talk to the top wine merchants and importers, to wine
writers and collectors,' Orr says. 'There are perhaps 50 to 75 collectors
around the world; a network of connoisseurs which monitors the progress of
first growths as closely as others follow stocks and shares, but who buy the
best wines to drink and not as an investment.
'It is a very small world but its opinions are vital to the wider perception
of Latour.'
An almost obsessive attention to detail - from the alignment of the
chateau's tower symbol on the cork with that on the label of each bottle, to
the arrangement of flowers in the chateau itself - goes into ensuring that
nothing detracts from that perception.
'We are very conscious of Latour's historical heritage,' Orr declares. 'It
is the product of centuries of intensive cultivation and it is our task, as
the latest in a long line of winemakers, to ensure that it passes to the
next generation with its prestige higher than ever.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / Labour unveils strategy for investment-led recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL row over the prospects for the economy took a fresh turn
yesterday as Labour launched its package of measures to revive British
industry, while the Tories focused on a leaked paper from a junior
opposition spokesman.
At the start of an intensive campaign on the theme 'Made in Britain', Mr
Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, unveiled a strategy founded on Labour's
belief that economic recovery must be investment-led rather than
consumer-led.
Among measures proposed is a cash-limited fund for investment in small and
medium-sized manufacturing companies, to last for six months, and new
measures to promote exports. These would include creating an integrated
export service, and launching regional export drives.
The paper setting out the strategy also brings together policies such as
enhanced first-year capital allowances for manufacturing investment and
improvements in skills training.
The paper will form the basis of intensive campaigning in the regions by the
Opposition economic team for the next two to three weeks, and was the theme
of last night's party political broadcast featuring Mr David Puttnam, the
film producer.
Mr Kinnock condemned the government for seeing competition 'only in terms of
going down-market to low-tech, low-skill goods and services. That is not the
way for Britain to succeed.'
Mr Kinnock brushed aside questions about a paper written by Mr Chris Smith,
a Labour Treasury spokesman, which raised questions about the possibility of
a luxury value added tax rate and whether cuts in defence spending could be
the North Sea oil of the 1990s.
It was, Mr Kinnock said, a personal paper written two years ago for
discussion, and had not even been seen by members of the economic team.
But Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, said the paper showed
Labour had a hidden agenda that would 'bring economic chaos'.
Labour needed a recovery package for its credibility, he said, adding that
the reference in Mr Smith's paper to a costing of Labour's spending
programme at Pounds 35bn showed that Labour's own estimate tallied with the
government's figures.
Labour retorted that Mr Smith's paper had been referring not to the party's
actual spending plans, but to Conservative estimates of what they would be.

FT  09 JAN 92 / MP seeks company safety disclosures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES that neglect workers' safety or damage the environment will face
bad publicity if a private member's bill becomes law.
Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said yesterday that his
bill, due to be debated on January 17, would ensure that companies breaking
environmental laws or injuring employees would no longer be able to go on
pretending to be 'models of social responsibility'.
The Corporate Safety and Environmental Information Bill seeks to require
companies with more than 50 employees to include in their annual reports
details of convictions for safety or environmental offences, the number of
occasions they have been served with enforcement notices by regulatory
authorities, the total of serious and fatal accidents to employees, and
compensation payments made to persons injured by their activities or
products.
Mr Rooker believes the resultant publicity would enable concerned investors
to bring pressure to bear on companies that fail to meet their
responsibilities. He says the public would be less vulnerable to public
relations exercises designed to cover up failures to comply with safety and
environmental laws.
The bill, which faces a difficult passage in the Commons, has been drafted
by the Campaign for Freedom of Information and the Citizen Action
Compensation Campaign. A statement by the two organisations said the annual
reports of 22 large companies failed to mention recent convictions for
breaches of safety or environmental laws.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Company plans prove costly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies spend considerable time and money preparing corporate
plans but frequently fail to follow them through, according to a survey by
3i, the UK's largest venture capital company.
Of 174 companies polled, 76 per cent drew up formal corporate plans but one
in three said they failed to follow them through, 47 per cent of companies
said they adhered to their planning guidelines to start with but later
diverged and only 13 per cent stuck closely to the guidelines.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Clash likely over legal-aid pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE row between solicitors and the government over legal-aid pay looks set
to come to a head at a meeting between the Law Society and the Lord
Chancellor tomorrow.
The society is to press Lord Mackay for an increase in legal-aid pay of more
than 10 per cent after rejecting the government's initial offer of a 1 per
cent increase.
It says: 'The basic increase in legal-aid pay rates must fully cover the
predicted rise in solicitors' overheads during 1992-93 and go some way
towards correcting the inadequate increases made in previous years.'
The evidence of the poor profitability of legal-aid work, increases in
overheads and a decline in the numbers of solicitors prepared to do the work
indicate that the legal-aid scheme 'has entered a spiral of decline which
must be checked', it says.
In a document sent to the government in support of its case, the society
warns that if this decline is not checked now there will not be enough
solicitors available to do legal-aid work in future.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Insurers face Pounds 60m bill over collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH insurers are to be told to expect a bill of about Pounds 60m to pay
claims from policyholders of subsidiaries of London United Investments, the
insurance group that failed two years ago, Richard Lapper writes.
The money is to be levied by the Policyholders' Protection Board - the body
responsible for funding claims against insolvent insurers - which has
written to the Association of British Insurers, notifying that it will need
to raise funds before the end of March.
The UK's 500 insurance companies are to be asked to pay a levy equivalent to
0.5 per cent of net premium income in 1990 to pay outstanding claims lodged
by customers of four insolvent LUI subsidiaries - Kingscroft Insurance, El
Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual Re - all of which are now
insolvent.
The levy is by far the biggest to have been made under the terms of the
Policyholders' Protection Act 1975.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Plan to increase modern manufacturing techniques in
engineering endorsed by NEDC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to increase the use of modern manufacturing techniques, skills and
training in engineering was endorsed unanimously yesterday by the National
Economic Development Council, Andrew Baxter writes. The NEDC initiative is
intended as a response to UK engineering's more deep-seated problems, many
of which have been exacerbated by the recession. The council endorsed the
plan after its meeting heard a paper combining the work of the NEDC's
engineering industry sector group and its engineering skills working party.
Afterwards Mr Bill Jordan, chairman of the industry group and president of
the AEU engineering union, said: 'The best of British companies are doing
the right things, but they are in such a thin layer across the line of
manufacturing. If we want to succeed against international competitors, we
have to turn the specific into the general.' Mr Jordan rejected charges that
the NEDC initiatives were timid. The degree of upheaval needed by companies
such as Rover attempting such a programme represented the biggest challenge
they had ever faced.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Lamont rejects pleas for Budget boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday held out the prospect of a
cautious Budget, rejecting pleas from the Trades Union Congress and the
Confederation of British Industry for immediate fiscal boosts to the
economy.
Mr Lamont insisted at a meeting of the National Economic Development Council
in London that upsetting the balance of the Budget in the medium term would
risk a build-up of problems for ensuing economic growth.
Reporting on the meeting, Mr Walter Eltis, director-general of the National
Economic Development Office (Nedo) quoted the chancellor as saying: 'The
Budget should be balanced in the medium term over the cycle as a whole, and
we should not start the recovery by getting the Budget wrong.'
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said the
chancellor's position was in opposition to those of the TUC and the CBI.
Both bodies, he said, were in broad agreement for the first time for years
over measures to help economic recovery.
The measures included more funds for Training and Enterprise Councils
(Tecs), tax concessions to stimulate investment and bringing forward
government spending on transport infrastructure.
The CBI said its proposals could be implemented in the short term without
being detrimental in the long term.
Mr Lamont agreed there was a need for corporate and public investment, but
stressed that the government's medium-term objective had to be tight control
of public spending combined with a balanced Budget.
He added that the government's policies would not have been different had
its forecasts on the economy's performance been more accurate.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, also attended the
meeting and stressed the need for a 'nine-year recovery' rather than a
two-year boom that had to be stopped.
There was agreement from all sides at the meeting that Britain should stay
in the ERM with the pound pegged at its current level.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Architects see sign of rise in workload
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHITECTS are expressing cautious optimism for the first time since October
1989 about the prospect of their workloads increasing this year. The
profession has been severely affected by the recession in the construction
industry.
According to the periodical RIBA Leads, published jointly by the Royal
Institute of British Architects and Carmargue Communications, more
architects expect an increase in workloads this year than expect a fall.
Only those architects in the south of England expect workloads to fall
further in the next six months. The most optimistic are those in Scotland.
The depth of the recession can be gauged by the number of abandoned
projects, the periodical says. During the past 12 months, 41 per cent of new
commissions and 36 per cent of projects that reached the production drawing
stage were abandoned or postponed. In the north of England, 75 per cent of
new commissions were abandoned or postponed.
Big firms are more optimistic for the coming six months, 37 per cent of
those employing 11 or more staff predicting an increase in workload, and 22
per cent forecasting a decline. Overall, 32 per cent of firms see workloads
rising, 28 per cent predict a fall, and 10 per cent foresee stable
workloads.
Figures for architects' workloads in the third quarter of last year show
that new commissions for housing rose to Pounds 1.49bn, from Pounds 1.38bn
in the second quarter.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Shattered towns that prove there can be a life after steel:
Anthony Moreton and Stewart Dalby find hope for Lanarkshire in recent
history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE in Lanarkshire may be numbed by yesterday's announcement of the
closure of Ravenscraig, but they can take heart from the fact that towns in
England and Wales have proved that there is life after steel.
The most recent large closure, announced in May 1990, was of the United
Engineering Steels works at Brymbo, near Wrexham, Clwyd, throwing 1,125
people out of work.
On the day of the announcement, Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the Welsh
Development Agency (WDA), received a priority call at the agency's Cardiff
headquarters from Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary. He asked Dr Jones to
lead a search to find a buyer for the plant.
In the next eight weeks a small team sifted through companies with steel
interests worldwide that had inquired about investing in Wales, wrote to
almost 200 and called on the agency's offices in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
and the US to make an input.
The result was that six companies visited either Cardiff or Brymbo and at
least two came near to talking turkey.
Eventual failure had more to do with United Engineering's unwillingness to
sell the plant and its equipment to a competitor at a time of surplus
capacity around the world.
Two decades ago, steel employed 72,240 people in Wales - today there are
16,400 involved. In addition to Brymbo, steelmaking at Cardiff, Llanelli and
Ebbw Vale in south Wales and Shotton in north Wales has ended, while
employment has been severely cut at both Port Talbot and Llanwern in south
Wales.
The response of the government and the WDA differed according to the
circumstances. After British Steel's closure of the East Moors works in
Cardiff in the early 1980s, the government immediately put some Pounds 42m
into an advance-factory building programme.
Around Pounds 4m was made available to the then new town of Cwmbran to
develop an industrial estate after Llanwern was hit by job losses.
At Shotton 8,000 people lost their jobs overnight in 1979 in the largest
single plant closure in Europe in 35 years. Now the Deeside industrial park
is home to tenants including Toyota's Pounds 150m engine works, Iceland
Foods, Kimberly-Clark, United Paper Mills, Deeside Titanium and Optical
Fibres. Almost as many jobs have been created.
Mr Phil Head, chief executive of the WDA, says many government resources
were put into alleviating the situation after the run-downs. 'Our budgets at
the time were significantly increased. Most of the new money went towards
the development of industrial sites and new factories.'
One of the most spectacular turnarounds was in Corby, Northamptonshire,
which in 1979 had one of the largest integrated steelworks in Europe,
employing more than 10,000 directly and indirectly in a town of 52,000.
The steel mill was closed in 1980. The tube mill lived on employing 7,000 at
first but gradually running down to its current level of 2,000.
Mr Duncan Hall, chief executive of the Teesside Development Corporation, who
was chief executive of Corby District Council at the time of the closures,
says unemployment in the town hit the 30 per cent mark by 1983, the highest
in the UK outside Ulster. 'By 1988 we had got it down to 3.9 per cent,' he
says.
Unemployment is back up to 7.9 per cent, but more than 400 companies have
been drawn in and most of them have stayed and survived.
Consett, in County Durham, close to Newcastle upon Tyne, is similar. With a
population of 24,000, it was a one-industry town based on steel. When the
integrated works began to close over 1979-80, some 3,500 people were
employed, down from 7,000 in the early 1970s. Unemployment peaked at 28 per
cent in 1988.
As with Corby - which was declared an enterprise zone - electronics,
biotechnology, food processing and other companies were attracted to Consett
using a battery of assistance and incentives. Unemployment is now back to 14
per cent having dipped into single figures in the 1980s.
But the 190 British and foreign companies that have relocated or established
in Derwentside, which includes Stanley the coal town as well as Consett,
have stayed. Some 5,000 jobs more than were employed in steel have been
created.
Mr Eddie Hutchinson of the Derwentside Industrial Development Agency says:
'I do not know of one single company which has moved out.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / Workers show refusal to look back in anger: As the
Ravenscraig plant counts down to closure the community assesses the chances
of new openings - James Buxton and Chris Tighe on the mood of resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUDDLED for protection against driving rain and sleet, the Ravenscraig shop
stewards still managed to look dignified yesterday as they stood before the
vast, doomed steel complex.
'Realistically speaking it's too late to save Ravenscraig,' says Mr George
Quinn, the craft workers' convener. 'We will just keep the plant working to
the best of our abilities up to August and then we'll have to go.'
For Mr Quinn and Mr Willie Twaddle, the senior plant convener, the mood is
resignation rather than anger. For them the time for surprise and dismay at
the behaviour of British Steel is long past. 'There was an inevitability
about it,' Mr Twaddle says, 'even though we were guaranteed to 1994.'
Mr Quinn says: 'It's nothing to do with market conditions and all to do with
politics and British Steel. British Steel's master plan is working out as
the plants in south Wales are getting ready to take over. But I have to say
that relations with management inside the plant have always been good.'
The men, says Mr Twaddle, took the news of the closure calmly. 'They've been
conditioned into believing that we couldn't save the plant after we lost
Gartcosh.'
Many of the steelworkers are young men, he says, since many older men have
already left. At least they are the kind of people who could get jobs in new
inward investment plants, he thinks.
Slightly incongruous in his dog-collar amid a pensive group of Ravenscraig
shop stewards, the Rev John Potter a Melthodist minister and industrial
chaplain for Lanarkshire's vanishing steel industry, pondered the greater
incongruities of the failure of the campaign to keep the plant open.
'There's pride and achievement in a strange way on a day like this - it's
factors beyond the community which have brought the place to an end,' says
Mr Potter who has ministered to Ravenscraig's workers for 19 years.
'Ravenscraig's workers and their leaders had nothing to reproach themselves
for. In that lays the sense of pride,' he says.
'This is the industrial revolution. In a revolution there will be painful
change. But there will be a new day.'
In spite of yesterday's gloomy news and its timing in the middle of a
recession, Mr Potter's long-term confidence for Motherwell's future finds
many supporters.
Even Ravenscraig employees such as blast furnace operator Mr Donald Horne
expressed some belief that the government's promised enterprise zone might
create employment.
But 39-year-old Mr Horne was preoccupied by the immediate future. 'In 7 to
10 years' time when those jobs happen we'll be too old,' he said.
Dr John Reid, one of Motherwell's two Labour MPs, while highly critical of
the government's policy on Ravenscraig was more hopeful for the longer term.
He pointed out that the new Eurofreight channel tunnel depot for Scotland,
to be located at Motherwell, is expected to create up to 8,000 jobs.
For some traders, such as the McGuinness family the closure may spell doom.
Their general shop near the Craig main gate opens from 5am to 10pm to catch
passing steelworkers' trade. It employs Mr Kevin McGuinness, his father
Peter, a former steelworker, and mother Nancy and a full-time employee.
'Everybody has really been expecting this news but it's come a bit quicker
than everybody thought,' Mr Kevin McGuinness said.
In Motherwell town centre other traders dependent on the steel works were
more sanguine. 'The future should be good with the railway depot starting
up,' said Mr Brian Digby, owner of Digby's Delicatessen and a shopkeeper in
Motherwell for 30 years.
Later this month at the Jerviston Social Club, Mr George Younger, the former
Scottish secretary, respected by shop stewards for his attempt to defend the
works, will propose the toast of the Immortal Memory at the Burns Supper.
The immortal memory for many of those attending may be not Robbie Burns but
their workplace.
PROMISES OVER THE YEARS
1959: Tory premier Harold MacMillan describes as 'judgement of Solomon' his
decision to sanction two extra steelworks instead of the one the industry
wants. One to be at Llanwern, Gwent, and the other at Ravenscraig - both
subsidised from public funds.
1983: Thatcher government defends Ravenscraig when European Commission
recommends closure. Mrs Thatcher praises Ravenscraig workforce during
miners' strike in following year.
1985, June: Scottish secretary George Younger reaffirms government's
commitment to save Ravenscraig and threatens to quit cabinet if the works is
closed.
1986, Sept: Younger's successor Malcolm Rifkind says of pounds 30m British
Steel investment at Ravenscraig: 'I regard the package as a splendid
confirmation of Ravenscraig's long-term future .. today's news must put paid
to the pessimistic forecast we have heard from so many quarters'.
1987, Dec: Junior industry minister Kenneth Clarke says if British Steel
ever wants to abandon steelmaking at Ravesncraig it will consider
privat-sector offers as alternative to closure.
1990, June: Trade and Industry secretary Nicholas Ridley claims he is
following bipartisan policy in refusing to intervene in British Steel
closure plan. 'The more I hear about this matter the less I can discover
what the difference is between the government and the Labour party'.
1991, Feb: Scottish secretary Ian Lang denies giving up fight to persuade
British Steel to reverse closure decision; says he will help if there is any
chance of avoiding loss of steel jobs in Scotland.

TSB, the sixth-largest banking group, may face selective industrial action
over three compulsory redundancies after restructuring at the bank.
Bifu, the banking union, yesterday released results of a ballot among its
20,000 members at TSB on industrial action. It showed 4,895 in favour and
2,100 against.
Union officials will meet today to decide how to proceed and are expected to
recommend selective strikes at branches all over the country.
Ms Jennifer Cole, Bifu negotiating officer, said: 'Staff have shown TSB
exactly what they think of compulsory redundancies, low staffing levels . .
. and their new staff structure which would mean reductions in salary and
promotion expectations.'
The union says that nearly 4,000 jobs have been cut since 1989, but it is
most alarmed at three compulsory redundancies, which, it says, are in breach
of an agreement.
TSB said last night that no agreement has been breached and the bank had had
no intention of breaking agreements. 'Strike action will not prevent us
going on with our successful restructuring,' it said.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Warning of harm to city centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRENDS IN retail development will destroy the central business districts in
British cities unless there is greater government intervention, the
conference was told yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Gwyn Rowley from Sheffield University claimed that shopping complexes
outside town centres are draining money from high streets and reducing the
number of shops that open in them.
Research in 12 towns showed that retail sales in central areas had declined
over the past year as a result of the recession. But sales had fallen by
about 20 per cent in towns with out-of-centre shopping developments, against
a decline of about 10 per cent in other towns. He said plans for a further
500,000 sq ft of out-of-town shopping developments in England and Wales
would accelerate this trend.
Slack planning controls and the limited resources of local authorities have
allowed many new shopping centres to be built, he said.
Other academics at the same session disagreed. Mr Clifford Guy from Cardiff
University said that since the 1970s, the centre of Charlotte, North
Carolina, had shrunk to 'almost complete insignificance' while Cardiff had
grown into an important regional centre. City centres in the UK are still
regarded as the prime location for large shopping developments, he argued.

A LABOUR government might penalise electricity companies which fail to meet
conservation and efficiency targets in order to encourage energy saving and
protect the environment, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, indicated
yesterday.
Under one option, companies that missed such targets might be forced to
charge lower prices for their electricity or suffer restrictions on the
returns they were allowed to make.
In the shorter term, companies that did not achieve adequate results in the
specific area of home insulation might be threatened with sanctions
including the loss of their licences.
'We will need to look in great detail at how we best benefit the customers
and save energy by changing the operational and financial regime,' Mr Dobson
said.
Labour is studying attempts by US regulators to encourage greater energy
conservation, and intends to strengthen UK regulatory regimes.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Sainsbury modifies Sunday contracts: Union attacks offer and
warns of pressure on wages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTS that make Sunday part of the normal working week are to be offered
by J. Sainsbury, the largest UK food retailer, to all its employees, in
spite of union opposition.
Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, predicted yesterday that other companies
would follow - and that there would be a price war on wages in supermarkets
as well as on goods. It called on the government to punish retail groups
that breached the 1950 Shops Act.
Sainsbury stressed that the contracts were optional and that Sunday working
in its stores would remain voluntary. It said existing double-time payments
for Sunday working would continue 'for the time being', but were under
review. The company added that staff who worked on Sundays would always
receive a 'very significant extra payment'.
But Usdaw feared that Sainsbury was trying to follow the example of
Woolworth. The union explained that all Woolworth employees taken on since
April had been given contracts defining Sunday as a normal working day which
did not attract overtime payments.
Woolworth workers employed since April are paid time-and-a-half for Sundays
if they work 39 hours during the rest of the week. Workers who were with the
company before April are paid double-time for Sundays, irrespective of which
other days they work or whether they work Sundays within a 39-hour week.
Woolworth said its workers were paid according to contracts which, as in
most companies, varied according to job and length of service. It added that
many of its workers 'are interested in Sunday work whether on a contracted
or voluntary basis'.
Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary, doubted whether the proposed
Sainsbury system would be voluntary: 'Staff will feel that their jobs are at
risk and prospects of promotion impaired if they refuse to work on a
Sunday.'
'It has been argued that only volunteers will be requested to work, but
anyone knowing the retail sector will know that there are an enormous number
of pressures, inducements and coercions that can be made to increase the
level of fear and insecurity among staff.'
Mr Davies also predicted that Sainsbury, which employs about 6,000 of
Usdaw's 350,000 members, would seek to scrap double-time working.
He had no doubt that other retailers would be unable to ignore developments
by Sainsbury. Tesco, for example, has negotiated an agreement with Usdaw for
double-time payments for Sunday working.
Mr Davies said Usdaw agreed with the Keep Sunday Special Campaign that there
was room for change in the law, but that any review should include all
interested parties.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Scheme to promote NHS job-sharing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB-SHARING in senior posts is to be promoted within the National Health
Service as part of a programme launched yesterday to improve women's
employment opportunities.
Eight goals to increase and improve the participation of women in senior
posts in the NHS were highlighted by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
minister.
The Department of Health is the first government department to launch a
detailed plan in response to Opportunity 2000, the business-led initiative
seeking to improve the position of women in the workforce.
The NHS - the largest employer of women in the UK - was criticised recently
by the Equal Opportunities Commission for not doing more to improve the
position of its female employees.
Mrs Bottomley said the goals were not about positive discrimination, but
rather about positive action for women.
Mr Eric Caines, NHS director of personnel, said he saw the initiative in
three stages. The first was to continue with existing programmes, such as
improving childcare. The second was to equip women to move up the management
ladder through confidence-building, the third, to put them in positions to
compete for top jobs.
All shortlists for senior jobs within the NHS, such as regional general
managers, should for example include women. Regional health authorities will
be asked to prepare registers of women who are well-equipped for promotion.
Should short-lists not include sufficient female candidates, women on the
register could be asked to apply. One specific goal is to increase the
number of women in general management posts from 18 per cent last year to 30
per cent in 1994.
Mr Caines said that above all he wanted flexibility. Job-sharing was a key
to part-time working at senior levels, he added, and those opposed to the
idea should provide evidence that it was not feasible.
The department is not advocating any sanctions for non-compliance with its
goals, although the NHS trusts will have to provide details of their
progress in annual reports.
Ms Caroline Langridge, head of the department's women's unit, said she did
not see the initiative in terms of sanctions but rather in terms of
generating enthusiasm and commitment.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOSPITAL bed is declining in importance as the central component of
patient care, the Audit Commission says today.
Until recently, says a report from the local government watchdog, the status
of most hospital consultants was judged by the number of beds they
controlled. But improvements in primary and community services and
technological advances were reducing the bed to just one of several
resources used to provide integrated healthcare.
'It follows that the number of hospital beds is no longer a useful measure
of the quality or quantity of the healthcare delivered,' says the
commission, which is responsible for audit and value-for-money exercises in
the National Health Service.
The declining number of hospital beds is frequently quoted in political
exchanges over the NHS. The government - which prefers a productivity-type
measurement based on patients treated per available bed - welcomed the
report.
Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, said: 'I was particularly pleased
to see that the Audit Commission firmly endorsed our view that bed numbers
should not be regarded as a key element of strategic planning, but rather as
just one of many resources required to care for patients.'
The commission says that if all health authorities used their beds as
efficiently as the best-performing 25 per cent, 27,000 of the 123,000 beds
currently available would no longer be needed.
It emphasises that many of the resources freed by such a reduction would
have to be reinvested in community-based services.
There was a 22 per cent reduction in the number of medical beds in the NHS
between 1974 and 1989, while the number of in-patients treated rose by a
similar percentage. This increased the average annual throughput of patients
per bed from 26 to 41. The increased throughput was achieved by shorter
lengths of stay and reducing the time beds remained empty between patients.
The commission says that further improvements are possible. Its auditors
will this year examine bed use in every English and Welsh health district.
